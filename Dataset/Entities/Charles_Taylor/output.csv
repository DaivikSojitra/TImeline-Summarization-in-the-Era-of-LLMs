Scalfaro leaves
early Outgoing Italian President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro formally resigned yesterday , making way for President - elect Carlo Azeglio Ciampi as new head of state .
Scalfaro 's seven - year term had been due to run until 28 May. Rebel bomb warning The National Army for the Liberation of Uganda , a little - known rebel group linked to former President Milton Obote 's government , claimed responsibility for a series of bomb blasts that killed 13 people in Kampala this year and warned of more attacks ."
"Aid agencies in Liberia pondering who to negotiate with to win the release of six of their workers , including the four Britons abducted by guerrillas on Wednesday , will find no shortage of candidates .
One thing President Charles Taylor is not short of is enemies .
It was not immediately clear who was responsible for the cross - border raid on Liberia 's remote Lofa county .
Mr Taylor swiftly blamed rebels in neighbouring Guinea , but did not say who they might be .
He declared a state of emergency , closed Liberia 's borders and ordered a general mobilisation .
Yesterday his government said several units were on their way to Lofa to confront several thousand rebels .
There are several candidates for the attack , particularly among the president 's former foes during Liberia 's seven - year civil war , which cost about 200,000 lives , displaced half the 3 m population and wrecked the economy .
It was thought the war was over two years ago when Mr Taylor was elected .
Many Liberians said they voted for him to prevent more war .
But he still has powerful enemies , including two exiled warlords - the former presidential candidate Alhaji Kromah , of the mainly Mandingo Ulimo force , and Roosevelt Johnson , the leader of the Krahn ethnic fighters .
It need not have been an old foe who was responsible for the raid .
With a precarious peace in neighbouring Sierre Leone leaving tens of thousands of armed men on the loose , and other insurgents hiding in Guinea 's forests , the attack could have come from one of several guerrilla bands .
Among other incentives are the diamonds , gold and other minerals which have long played a central role in the destabilisation of the far west of Africa .
Lofa county is rich in alluvial diamonds , which can be plucked from the ground or river beds .
Mr Taylor implicitly accused Guinea of allowing the rebels to operate from its soil . ""
This attack comes in the wake of numerous public warnings by our government about dissidents being trained in Guinea with the purpose of destabilising our nation , "" he said .
But the raid may also be a spin - off from Mr Taylor 's contribution to the destabilisation of his neighbours .
He provided crucial backing for the rebel Revolutionary United Front in Sierre Leone , which has conducted an horrific campaign against civilians as much as government forces .
The commander of the West African peacekeeping force , Ecomog , accused Liberia earlier this year of creating upheaval in the region .
"" As long as Taylor is in power in Liberia , the Sierre Leone crisis will never end , "" General Timothy Shelpidi said .
Mr Taylor in turn accuses Ecomog of training forces to overthrow his government .
The two have a long and bitter history , dating from Ecomog 's defence of the Liberian capital , Monrovia , against Mr Taylor 's rebel forces during the civil war .
The raids have added to growing unease in Monrovia , just hours after the death of one of the president 's most senior wartime commanders , who went on to become the chief of police .
Jo Tate was killed on Wednesday when his plane crashed while trying to land at night at an airport where the lights had been turned off ."
"Publishing a newspaper which is viewed abroad as the mouthpiece of the British establishment is not always a good thing .
Sometimes , it can have serious drawbacks .
When Charles Taylor , the president of Liberia , saw an article in the Times repeating allegations made in a book accusing him of "" indulging in human sacrifice and the ritualistic consumption of human body parts "" - otherwise known as cannibalism - he took legal advice .
His London - based solicitor has now lodged a claim for substantial damages following the alleged defamation .
As the ever - expanding internet continues to shrink global consciousness , it seems there is no country too remote to worry about its reputation in London .
Just as the dust from the Michael Ashcroft affair has settled it looks as if Times editor Peter Stothard now has another high - profile libel case to worry about .
The article , which appeared on the foreign pages on November 2 1999 , also mentioned "" reports and rumours of Mr Taylor 's alleged cannibalism , including drinking the blood of his murdered rivals "" .
Taylor , who won the 1997 presidential election after leading one of the factions in Liberia 's civil war , believes he can not allow such gruesome allegations to stand unchallenged .
And the Times pulls few punches .
Taylor 's writ also highlights the claims in the article that "" specific individuals were selected for human sacrifice and consumption , a practice believed by some Liberians to confer power on the participants .
Many of these bloody rituals were allegedly carried out in Charles Taylor 's house . ""
These lurid allegations were based on accounts in The Mask of Anarchy , a scholarly book examining the underlying causes of Liberia 's brutal civil war .
Written by the Oxford - educated African scholar , Stephen Ellis , the book was praised for its balanced approach .
The author and his publishers have also been served with a writ which they will be contesting .
On December 26 the Sunday Telegraph also ran a piece about the book .
It appeared on the books pages , clearly labelled as a review .
Halfway through his piece , the reviewer wrote : "" In the course of the [ Liberian civil ] war , children were turned into psychopathic fighters and cannibalism was rampant .
Mr Ellis deals with this most sensational aspect of the conflict without titillating the reader .
He argues that human sacrifice and cannibalism had long been a part of Liberian ritual practice , but under the control of traditional spiritual leaders , who limited it to special occasions .
"" The authority of these spiritual leaders was destroyed during the war , and so cannibalism broke its traditional bounds .
Young fighters , high on drugs and alcohol , tried to assimilate the power of the slain by eating parts of them . ""
It seems that because there was no specific mention of Taylor in the Sunday Telegraph account , their reviewer has been spared a writ .
It is one thing to mention cannibalism generally and quite another to allege that it actually took place in the current president 's house .
The Times has stated it intends to contest the action vigorously .
But libel law does not favour defendants and substantiating claims based on allegations made in a book will not be easy .
In Liberia , it is accepted that various factions engaged in atrocities during the civil war .
But that does not mean the Times will be able to prove to a libel court that the current president presided over human sacrifice in his own house ."
"The United Nations is again facing a crisis of credibility in Africa as at least 300 of its troops remained missing , taken hostage , or encircled by rebels in Sierra Leone yesterday , and new fighting broke out in Democratic Republic of Congo just as the UN plans to deploy there .
Six civilian UN employees , including a four - man Russian helicopter crew , were released during the day from eastern Sierra Leone after intervention by President Charles Taylor of Liberia , but tension remained high in several towns where UN troops are based .
From New York last night the UN confirmed that 300 of its men are hostages and at least 12 wounded .
As the crisis deepened the UN secretary general , Kofi Annan , talked by telephone to African leaders , and envoys were dispatched from several west African countries to Freetown in an attempt to confront the Revolutionary United Front ( RUF ) leader , Foday Sankoh . ""
He is already isolated and it is going to get worse , "" Mr Annan said .
The secretary general persuaded six African leaders , including President Olusegun Obasanjo of Nigeria and President Muammar Gadafy of Libya , to put pressure on Mr Sankoh . ""
They 've told him to take action .
They told him to release [ the hostages ] .
They 've tried to impress on him the seriousness of the situation . ""
Britain is dispatching an advisory team to Freetown to assess technical support needed to enhance the UN force 's effectiveness , Robin Cook said last night .
It follows a request from the UN secretary general .
The UN 's new crisis is as grave as its miscalculation in Angola in 1992 election when a UN - monitored election plunged the country into a civil war worse than the previous 20 years of fighting .
Underlining the long - term effects of such a failure , the UN yesterday announced a $ 100 m ( £ 65.5 m ) shortfall in funding for the humanitarian programme for Angola .
The events in Sierra Leone this week have cast a shadow over the current UN security council mission to central Africa , aimed at putting a 5,500-strong UN peacekeeping force into Congo .
The UN troops are intended to keep alive a fragile ceasefire involving half a dozen countries from Zimbabwe and Angola to Rwanda and Uganda who back rival forces in Congo .
Yesterday a summit meeting of all the forces and their outside backers planned for the Congolese capital , Kinshasa , was cancelled after heavy fighting in the north - east of the country .
Ugandan troops attacked their former allies from Rwanda before dawn just out side the rebel - held Congolese city of Kisangani and at least five civilians died in the crossfire , according to a UN official .
"" There is shelling all over Kisangani , "" he said .
Kisangani is one of the four points the UN plans to install its peace monitors .
Colonel Akram Hossain , who heads a four - man preliminary UN observer mission in Kisangani , blamed Ugandan troops for the clashes - the first since the two sides fought a three - day battle in the town in August last year .
"" It was initiated by the UPDF
[ Ugandan amy ] and since then there has been shelling and intermittent firing all around the town , "" Col Hossain said .
Rwandan military sources said their troops were under orders not to respond , but the shelling by Uganda 's 120 mm mortar shells and anti - aircraft guns became heavier until they had to choose between surrendering or firing back .
"" We want to defuse things - we have no reason to fight with the Ugandans , "" said a Rwandan military spokesman , Major Emmanual Ndahiro .
Sources in both Uganda and Rwanda were pessimistic about any early reconciliation between the two former allies who have large military presences inside Congo .
In Sierra Leone the former rebels of the RUF , similarly unprepared for peace , continued to deny that they held any UN hostages .
A spokesman for Mr Sankoh said they were not aware of any hostages being held , apart from the five civilians released yesterday .
But Mr Sankoh , many miles from the various front lines , and long out of touch with the commanders of the various RUF units , does not have the authority to make the peace process and disarmament a reality .
UN officials said that the explosion of tension this week was linked to RUF commanders ' demands for the return to their units of combatants who have handed in weapons to the UN , received indemnities , and were being prepared for demobilisation , as agreed in the peace treaty signed in Lome last July .
Part of the peace deal was a controversial amnesty for Mr Sankoh and his fighters .
A UN spokesman yesterday emphasised that the amnesty did not cover any events after the peace treaty of July 1999 ."
"More than 130 of 500 UN peacekeepers held captive by Sierra Leone 's rebel movement have been released into Liberian custody , Liberia 's president Charles Taylor said last night .
Taylor said 15 of the 139 freed captives were flown by a government - chartered helicopter to Liberia 's capital , Monrovia , on Sunday evening while the remaining 124 were waiting to be evacuated from the Liberian border town of Foya , some 130 miles to the north .
A UN spokesman in Sierra Leone 's capital said he was unaware of the reported releases and officials at the UN headquarters in New York were also unable to immediately confirm the report .
However , Taylor briefly introduced an Associated Press reporter to two smiling but tired - looking men wearing new uniforms whom the president said were freed Kenyan and Zambian peacekeepers .
West African and UN officials including secretary general Kofi Annan 's envoy to Liberia , Felix Downes - Thomas , stood by silently during the meeting in the living room of Taylor 's presidential mansion .
Taylor , the region 's closest ally to the Sierra Leone 's Revolutionary United Front rebels , had been asked by regional leaders to mediate with the renegades to obtain the UN captives ' release .
He warned that continued attacks by Sierra Leone 's pro - government forces against the rebels "" threaten the lives "" of the remaining UN personnel held captive by the renegades , adding he was trying to obtain their release . ""
The attacks on the Revolutionary United Front could not only hamper the mediation work by the Liberian team but also end the lives of the hostages , "" he said .
Meanwhile , the government is expected to make a statement clarifying the precise rules of engagement for Britain 's forces in Sierra Leone today , after criticism that it has not been clear about its intentions .
Defence secretary Geoff Hoon will tell the House of Commons that there has been no change in the 600-strong contingent 's status since its arrival in Freetown a week ago ."
"Liberia is the oldest black African republic , with the longest history of corruption , exploitation and brutal repression .
Its current head of state , Ghankay Charles MacArthur Dapkana Taylor , is the latest of a long line of utterly ruthless rulers .
He is also the principal sponsor of Foday Sankoh , the rebel leader in neighbouring Sierra Leone .
Sankoh learned his trade from a good teacher .
Taylor was just one of a clutch of rival warlords who reduced Liberia to a bloody pulp in the 1990s .
That he emerged victorious is a tribute to his ruthless ambition .
Liberia , established as a United States colony to be a homeland for freed slaves ( Sierra Leone was established by Britain for the same purpose ) , became independent in 1847 .
The nascent state was dominated by the small minority of Afro - American settlers who held almost total power until 1980 , when army master - sergeant Samuel Doe led a bloody coup .
Doe , who arbitrarily executed most of the ancient regime and any subsequent potential rivals , recruited Charles Taylor to his ramshackle administration .
But Taylor wanted more .
He built an extensive network of sponsors and allies in neighbouring countries , such as Libya and even - according to one exiled opponent - in Taiwan .
On Christmas Eve 1989 he launched his insurrection .
Almost immediately , his National Patriotic Front movement split into murderous factions , which reduced the tiny country to chaos .
In August 1990 Taylor 's principal rival , Prince Johnson , snatched Samuel Doe literally from under the noses of the so - called peacekeeping force from other West African countries .
The dictator was beaten to a pulp , mutilated and killed , the whole ghastly affair recorded in detail on videotape .
Many hoped that Doe 's death would restore order .
Instead , it sparked a five - year spiral of hellish tribal and factional violence .
In 1995 the Abuja peace accords brought a fragile peace and saw Taylor installed as de facto ruler .
He reinforced his position with elections in 1997 which were notionally free and fair , but which were utterly distorted by systematic intimidation .
Taylor , now halfway through a six - year presidential term , maintains an iron grip on power through a brutal armed guard and a small coterie of egregiously corrupt cronies .
One of his principal assets is the continuing financial aid from Liberia 's long - time ally , the United States .
Another is the booming diamond export trade , which has been greatly boosted by the dreadful civil war in neighbouring Sierra Leone - a war fomented and fuelled by President Taylor through his protege , Sankoh .

"There is growing political pressure on British commanders in Sierra Leone to rein in the military assault against the Revolutionary United Front because of new threats against almost 500 UN peacekeepers held hostage by the rebels or semi - hostage by the president of neighbouring Liberia .
Concern over the fate of the abductees has heightened following reports that some of the 124 UN personnel released by the rebels into Liberia at the weekend were badly tortured and in "" a terrible state "" .
The Liberian president , Charles Taylor , has admitted that 30 or 40 of the hostages have bullet wounds .
He has so far blocked UN officials from meeting them and warned that the war against the RUF must be halted or it could harm the remaining abducted UN personnel .
Mr Taylor , the RUF 's principal foreign backer , has also confined 15 former hostages - including the only Briton among the 124 - to a hotel for the past three days .
The fate of the hostages has led to a split within the UN in Sierra Leone , with its military commander in Freetown backing the assault against the rebels while Kofi Annan 's special representative is pressing for a ceasefire .
The Freetown government is strongly opposed to any let - up in the war .
Mr Taylor 's warning came as the British officer coordinating the campaign against the rebels , Brigadier David Richards , claimed that the Sierra Leone Army ( SLA ) is making headway .
"" We have definitely got over the worst of it in Freetown .
The RUF is pulling back to Makeni .
It 's quite a rap on the knuckles for them .
If there 's one change to the plan it 's that the SLA is doing better than we expected .
We want it to keep pushing eastwards , without pausing , "" he said .
Brig Richards disowned a report on the BBC Today programme that claimed he had said UN forces are to go on the offensive against rebels .
Peacekeepers will instead be used to hold areas already taken by the SLA .
"" What I 've got the UN to do is move up and fill the gaps behind the Sierra Leone army .
The UN was a bit iffy about that
but I persuaded them .
The key to success now , my priority , is to get the SLA to keep going and keep fighting , "" he added .
But there are problems .
Frontline government troops have been short of food , although Brig Richards says that problem is being addressed .
The question of ammunition is more sensitive .
The chief of Britain 's defence staff , General Sir Charles Guthrie , who was in Freetown earlier this week , is returning home with a list of requirements for Sierra Leonean forces , including ammunition and possibly guns .
Whether they are supplied is a political decision , and there is concern that British weapons could fall into rebel hands if the tide of war turns .
The SLA and the UN are heavily reliant on the British in matters of strategy and logistics .
A British officer is now running the Sierra Leone defence headquarters .
But Brig Richards says the various parties , including the UN and military factions now united to fight for the government , are at one on the need to take the war to the RUF 's heartland .
The real test will come in the next few weeks as government forces launch an assault on the diamond areas that provide the rebels ' financial lifeline .
Russian helicopter gunships will back up the attack .
Charles Taylor 's attempts to curb the SLA offensive are , in part , a bid to forestall an attack on the diamond mines , which have also proved profitable for the Liberian president .
The British army has also been trying to mend relations with the Nigerian military after one of its senior commanders warned that his men might shoot white troops .
Brig Richards described the incident as a "" little local difficulty "" at the international airport where the British took over responsibility for security for the Nigerians . ""
One British soldier was told by a Nigerian soldier ' if you do n't tell us what you are doing you will end up getting shot ' .
I 'm confident this is a non - problem .
It was not ' we will shoot you ' , "" he said .
"" We have told the Nigerians what we are doing but it had not got down to the soldier level . "" .
But the Nigerian officer who made the remark , Lieutenant Colonel Ginda Usman , said the members of the Parachute Regiment had humiliated his men by detaining and disarming them on suspicion of being rebels .
"" They [ the British ] sometimes deployed right behind our positions and some of my soldiers were disarmed by them , "" Lt Col Ginda said .
"" They said RUF rebels had captured UN uniforms and they could n't be sure if my men were rebels in stolen uniforms .
The paras even used to check me at the airport and I 'm the commanding officer .
"" I pointed out that there are white mercenaries working for the RUF and if we did n't know who you were then we could mistake them for mercenaries .
And what do we do to mercenaries ?
We shoot them . ""
The British can ill afford to annoy the Nigerians .
Their 3,000 troops are the largest contingent in the peacekeeping force .
More importantly , they have considerable experience of fighting in Sierra Leone and detest the RUF for atrocities it has committed against captured Nigerians ."
"Britain is desperately trying to block a £ 35 m European aid package to Liberia because it believes that its president , Charles Taylor , is actively supporting the rebel campaign in Sierra Leone , Foreign Office officials admitted yesterday .
In a move likely to anger Britain 's EU partners , who have already unanimously approved the aid , Robin Cook will call for the money to be blocked when he attends a meeting of EU foreign affairs ministers in Luxembourg next week .
The foreign secretary will press for the aid to be "" put on ice "" despite the fact that France , which is soon to assume the EU 's rotating presidency , is reluctant to agree because it is unsure about the precise nature of Taylor 's role in Sierra Leone .
The UK government is not itself certain about the extent of Taylor 's involvement with the Revolutionary United Front , but it is fairly sure that he is supplying it with arms in return for diamonds .
"" It seems quite clear that the Liberian government is implicated and it is time to send a signal that this wo n't do .
It is a pretty substantial chunk of money we 're talking about , "" a Foreign Office official told the Guardian .
The money is part of a two - year EU anti - poverty programme and all 15 EU countries , including Britain , have already agreed that it should be released as soon as possible .
Britain 's last - minute intervention comes as the European commission is poised to sign the final documents authorising the funds to be transferred and as British troops prepare to start withdrawing from Sierra Leone .
It is highly unusual for a minister to call for EU humanitarian aid to be delayed in order to send a political signal to undesirable governments , although Britain tried and failed to do just that with aid earmarked for Zimbabwe in April .
EU officials believe that the UK will succeed in holding up the aid for a few months but warn that it will be the people of Liberia who will suffer and not Charles Taylor . ""
This package is designed to alleviate poverty and it is the Liberian population that benefits and not the government or the administration , "" one official argued .
Foreign Office officials counter , however , that it is legitimate to delay the aid because it is not urgently required and will not have an immediate impact .
Once the Liberian government has got the message and stops backing the rebels in Sierra Leone the money can , they say , be unblocked .
"" It 's a half step towards suspending EU aid and it will send out a pretty strong signal .
We are of course much more involved with Sierra Leone than other countries who are coming to this issue quite late .
Some of them have n't really given it much thought .
"" The Foreign Office will try to rally support for the move in EU capitals in advance of the crunch decision , which is expected to be taken on Tuesday ."
"Britain succeeded in blocking a £ 35 m European aid package to Liberia yesterday , an act designed to force its president , Charles Taylor , to stop supplying the rebels in Sierra Leone with arms and funds in return for diamonds .
It was strongly opposed by the European Commission , which believes that it will be ordinary Liberians and not Mr Taylor who will feel the pain .
Keith Vaz , the British minister for Europe , persuaded a meeting of EU foreign ministers in Luxembourg to put the aid "" on ice "" after several days of intense lobbying by the Foreign Office in EU capitals .
Mr Vaz , who stepped in at the last minute after Robin Cook was called upon to attend President Assad 's funeral in Syria , ran into French opposition when he raised the possibility of threatening to suspend EU aid to Liberia altogether .
Other EU members did agree to sign a strongly worded statement expressing "" deep concern "" about Liberia 's involvement in Sierra Leone and condemning its illicit diamond trade with the Revolutionary United Front ( RUF ) , which is believed to be fuelling the war .
EU diplomats in the Liberian capital , Monrovia , will now draw up a report on the extent of Mr Taylor 's involvement in Sierra Leone and warn him to behave in "" a responsible and consistent "" manner .
EC officials made it clear that they would have preferred Britain not to have used EU aid as a political football .
"" The thing is that this money is to help poor people and not the government of Liberia , so there is some regret that there may now be an overdue delay in getting the money to those who need it , "" one said .
It is unclear how long the aid package , whose delivery was unanimously approved by EU member states last month , will be kept on ice .
French diplomats said that they were happy to go along with Britain up to a point but had balked at the suggestion that the EU should consider opening consultations with Liberia under the Lomé convention , which could lead to the suspension of all EU aid .
UK diplomats argue , however , that this was not the main issue and claim that the overall decision to delay the aid package sends a clear signal to Mr Taylor that "" it is not business as usual "" , and spells out the fact that EU aid is not immune to politics . ""
Other member states supported us by their silence and were very supportive once they had seen the dossier we had compiled , "" a British diplomat told the Guardian , referring to a confidential British report detailing Mr Taylor 's role in supplying the RUF with arms .
A copy of the report , obtained by the Guardian , shows that Mr Taylor has been providing money , arms and advice to the RUF for some time .
It is one of the most devastating attacks on a foreign head of state by the British government in recent years .
The report claims that Mr Taylor does not want to see the RUF defeated , in spite of his efforts to help secure the release of 500 UN peacekeepers held hostage by the group .
Mr Taylor , it suggests , wants to install Sam Bockarie as the new leader of the RUF to replace the captured Foday Sankoh and is allowing rebel forces to train in Liberia . ""
President Taylor is motivated by a need to maintain his personal wealth and political position in Liberia .
Taylor 's game - plan is to maintain his control and influence over eastern Sierra Leone by making it lawless . ""
Britain plans to use the report to persuade other international organisations , such as the World Bank and the UN , to make Mr Taylor 's life difficult .
It clearly identifies diamonds as being at the heart of the conflict .
Although Liberia 's annual production is no more than 100,000 - 150,000 carats , exports have rocketed to 6 m carats thanks to illegal supplies from Sierra Leone .
The report concludes that Mr Taylor 's behaviour "" will improve if he is threatened with embarrassing exposure and sustained sanctions "" but adds : "" He has proved highly adept at maintaining his position in the face of past difficulties "" .
British marines in Sierra Leone were ferried by helicopter to HMS Ocean yesterday as the UK continued to scale down its involvement in its war - torn former colony .
A separate force of 200 soldiers , who will help train the Sierra Leone army , has arrived .
Government forces and rebels clashed near the town of Lunsar , which was captured by loyalists last week on the road to the RUF stronghold at Makeni .
Military sources said an army patrol exchanged fire on Monday with rebels , who had sent out a reconnaissance mission .
There were no immediate reports of casualties .
Captain Daniel Yanka told Reuters that the rebels appeared to be about five miles from Lunsar ."
"Detailed evidence that the president of Liberia is providing rebel forces in Sierra Leone with guns and equipment in return for diamonds has been presented to the UN by western governments , the Guardian has learned .
President Charles Taylor is personally "" orchestrating "" a campaign which has taken on a west African dimension , involving Burkina Faso , Guinea and Angola , according to well - placed sources .
He regularly meets leaders of Sierra Leone 's rebel Revolutionary United Front , including Sam Bockarie and Issa Sesay .
They have made joint visits to Burkina Faso for meetings hosted by its president , Blaise Compaore .
Mr Taylor and Mr Bockarie visited Burkina Faso on June 5 and June 23 , when Mr Compaore supplied arms to the RUF in return for diamonds , the sources say .
Burkina Faso also supplies weapons to the Unita rebel forces in Angola .
On June 1 , RUF leaders with a consignment of diamonds travelled to the Liberian capital , Monrovia , where President Taylor assured them of both his full support and supplies of arms , trucks , food and medicine for use in operations against the Sierra Leone army and UN forces .
A few days later the equipment , with operators and helicopters from Liberia , left Monrovia for the eastern Sierra Leone town of Kailahun , where UN troops were under siege .
Fifty - five mercenaries from Burkina Faso also arrived in Sierra Leone , according to reports sent to the UN .
Western sources say that last year Liberia exported 6 m carats of diamonds - worth £ 200 m - to Belgium alone .
Liberia 's diamond industry has an annual capacity of 150,000 carats at most .
It is estimated that 40 % of Sierra Leone 's diamonds reach the outside world via Burkina Faso , the rest going via Liberia .
The sources say that Mr Taylor and the RUF are plotting with dissidents to overthrow the government of Guinea ."
"The former South African president Nelson Mandela yesterday telephoned the president of Liberia and urged him to release the Channel 4 television crew who are facing espionage charges .
Mr Mandela told Charles Taylor that even if the Liberian authorities had a watertight case against the four men , "" it would be a wonderful gesture if he could pardon or release the four journalists "" .
Mr Taylor said he needed a day or two to consider the matter , according to Mr Mandela 's spokeswoman , Zelda La Grange .
Meanwhile , Britain warned Liberia that detaining the two Britons , a Sierra Leonean and a South African , who were all working on a documentary for Channel 4 , set the west African state on a collision course with the international community .
"" They are not spies , they are journalists , and this is an attack on international press freedom , "" the Foreign Office minister Peter Hain told BBC radio .
The four are David Barrie and Zimbabwean - born Timothy Lambon , both Britons , Gugulakhe Radebe , from South Africa , and Sorious Samura , a Sierra Leonean film maker .
They work for a London based independent production firm , Insight News Television .
All four appeared in court again yesterday at a bail hearing in the Liberian capital , Monrovia , but the judge refused bail , saying the suspected crime was too grave .
The men went back to prison .
Representatives from Channel 4 said yesterday they were briefing a lawyer in London who would go to Monrovia later this week to support a locally retained solicitor .
If convicted , the four men , who arrived in the country on August 1 , could face up to 10 years in prison .
The Liberian president has called for a speedy trial open to the international media , but said it would be wrong for him to interfere in the judicial process .
Referring to the film crew late on Monday , Mr Taylor said nothing would happen that would violate their rights under the laws of Liberia ."
"The Manchester City and Liberian striker George Weah plans to meet his country 's president and hopes to persuade him to free the Channel 4 television crew held in the west African state on charges of espionage .
The former world footballer of the year is due to play an international at home against Mauritius on Sunday .
"" The meeting has not been confirmed yet , but he knows President Charles Taylor and is a well known character in Liberia , "" Manchester City 's chief executive , Chris Bird , said .
"" He wants to try his best to do what he can . ""
Weah has donated large sums of money to rebuild Liberia after its devastating seven - year civil war and is said to be on good terms with President Taylor .
Rev Jesse Jackson , the US special envoy to Africa , and former South African leader Nelson Mandela have appealed to the president on behalf of the men .
Two Britons , David Barrie and Zimbabwean - born Timothy Lambon , a South African , Gugulakhe Radebe , and a Sierra Leonean , Sorious Samura , have been under arrest for a week .
The men , who work for the London - based Insight News production company , have been denied bail .
The hearing is expected to resume tomorrow ."
"Liberia today released four journalists working for Channel 4 after an international outcry following their arrest on espionage charges a week ago .
The Foreign Office confirmed that the Liberian president , Charles Taylor , had announced that he was freeing the men .
Last Friday 's arrest of the television crew - two Britons , a Sierra Leonean and a South African - sparked outrage around the world .
The men had faced a possible death sentence if convicted of spying .
A Channel 4 spokeswoman said : "" We welcome this news that the four men have been released by President Taylor . ""
David Barrie , Zimbabwe - born Timothy Lambon , South African Gugulakhe Radebe and a Sierra Leonean work for Insight news production .
They had been in Liberia for three weeks working on a documentary film when they were arrested at their hotel in the capital , Monrovia .
The four were charged on Monday after authorities reviewed their videotapes and found material deemed to be "" damaging to the Liberian government and the security of the state "" .
The indictment said that the documentary would aim to support British and American allegations of Liberian government involvement in diamond - smuggling and gun - running for the rebel army in neighbouring Sierra Leone .
Mr Taylor , for years associated with the Sierra Leone rebels , has repeatedly denied that Liberia acts as a conduit for rebel diamonds or weapons .
Channel 4 said that the men had suffered "" mental abuse "" .
The arrests had angered international leaders and press freedom groups .
Former US President Jimmy Carter , American civil rights leader Jesse Jackson and former South African President Nelson Mandela all appealed for the crew 's release .
The Manchester City and Liberian striker George Weah had planned to meet the Liberian president to persuade him to free the TV crew ."
"Four Channel 4 journalists charged with espionage in Liberia were released from prison yesterday after a week of international protests and a personal apology from the men and the chairman of the television company to Liberian president Charles Taylor .
The four men , who were making a three - part documentary , were detained last Friday and charged on Monday with helping British and US intelligence to support allegations that Liberia was assisting rebels in neighbouring Sierra Leone by diamond smuggling and gun running .
Interviewed on CNN , Mr Taylor said their release was the result of "" plea bargaining "" between government lawyers and defence counsel .
"" We are not expelling the journalists but they are free to leave whenever they want , "" he said .
The journalists - British director David Barrie , Zimbabwe - born cameraman Tim Lambon , who has dual South African and British nationality , Sorious Samura from Sierra Leone , and South African soundman Gugulakhe Radebe - were expected to fly out of the capital Monrovia to Abidjan on the Ivory Coast .
Under the Liberian penal code they could have faced 10 years in prison or , according to the indictment , the death penalty .
Their release was welcomed by the foreign secretary Robin Cook as "" an enormous relief for the men 's families "" .
Mr Cook said that he would be thanking President Ob - asanjo of Nigeria ; Nelson Mandela ; Jesse Jackson , President Clinton 's envoy to Africa ; and the Sierra Leone ambassador to Liberia for their efforts .
The Liberian authorities released the men 's statement which read : "" We , the four journalists currently held in Monrovia central prison , wish to express our unreserved apology to both his excellency the president of Liberia and the people of Liberia for any offence which our actions or statements have caused .
"" The letter to Mr Taylor from Channel 4 chairman Vanni Treves , which is not being released , reinforced that message .
Mr Taylor told CNN that the charges against the men stemmed from a script seized from them at the time of their arrest at their Monrovia hotel .
He said the journalists appeared to have decided on their story before arriving in Liberia and to have come to the country to "" fill in the blanks "" .
"" This was not a check to the free press .
We were dealing with a case of conspiracy with a clear case of libel here , which would have damaged this country .
"" I am very thankful to Almighty God that they have realised that an error has been made and that Channel 4 in Britain have issued a statement of remorse , because they did something terrible here . ""
Mr Taylor , a former warlord in the Liberian civil war , has repeatedly denied allegations that he was colluding with his allies across the border , the rebel Revolutionary United Front which controls Sierra Leone 's diamond areas .
He again demanded proof yesterday , even though the evidence is far from circumstantial .
British and American officials have claimed to have information from photographs and satellite surveillance of arms being trucked across the border to the rebels as well as intelligence of meetings between rebel leaders and Mr Taylor .
It is estimated that last year Liberia , with an annual diamond production worth about $ 10 m ( £ 6.8 m ) , exported stones to the value of $ 300 m .
A senior Swiss customs official confirmed two weeks ago that Liberian imports had surged from nothing in 1997 to $ 29.7 m in the first half of this year .
Last month a senior director of De Beers , the main diamond buyer , told a conference in London that 600 Liberian soldiers were guarding a rebel diamond mine .
In July , the UN security council imposed a ban on the purchase of Sierra Leone diamonds that do not have a government certificate in an effort to prevent the RUF from financing its long - running civil war , in which tens of thousands have been killed and maimed ."
"The four members of a Channel 4 television crew imprisoned in Liberia on espionage charges arrived back safely at Heathrow Airport yesterday morning after a week of threats , interrogation and learning last Wednesday that they faced trial on charges punishable by the death penalty .
Speaking for the first time of their ordeal , the four men described conditions in the police holding cells of President Charles Taylor 's Liberia , where they witnessed the torture of a youth , a near - rape and the misery of the long - term inmates . '
The violence was extraordinary , ' said cameraman Tim Lambon yesterday .
The four journalists - Zimbabwe - born Lambon , presenter Sorious Samoura from Sierra Leone , British director David Barrie and South African soundman Gugulakhe Radebe - were granted official permission to make a documentary in Liberia , which is fast approaching the status of an international pariah because of its trade in ' blood diamonds ' and its support for the rebels in neighbouring Sierra Leone who routinely chop the hands off children .
But prior approval meant nothing when the four were bundled into lorries by 20 police brandishing rifles .
Samoura , who is a household name throughout West Africa and celebrated for his documentary Cry Freetown , about Sierra Leone 's brutal civil war , told a Heathrow press conference : ' These men in black started beating us and pushing us out into the street in the dark .
We thought that was it . '
Barrie said it had been a moment of ' total terror , considering the number of officers there , the number of rifles there and the extent to which these guys had absolutely been hyped up ' .
Lambon added : ' There might not have been all the serious physical abuse , such as rifle butts in the back of the head , although there was some of that , it was a situation of mental terror . '
They were taken to police holding cells .
Conditions were dire : the one toilet stank , the heat was unremitting , other prisoners had to pay bribes to go to the toilet and there were constant fights .
Lambon and the others were searched in an aggressive and intimidating way , and had no choice but to witness the routine barbarities of Liberia 's strange version of law and order . '
They slapped one boy , he must have been 17 , against the wall so hard he must have fractured his wrist .
I will never forget the sound of him howling with pain .
They almost gang - raped two women , but they were saved at the last moment .
And there were constant fights , ' Lambon told The Observer . '
I told the others how not to display edges , to look down , to droop your shoulders , keep out of the way , but not out of sight , to hold your elbows in , so that you have a profile that is lower than shark - shit , ' he said . '
Conditions for the other prisoners were far worse .
They had to pay bribes of five Liberian dollars to go to the toilet , 20 dollars to get out of the cell . '
Let me tell you , we met hundreds of people who today are still in those jails , whose families do n't even know they are there .
And they do n't have a hope .
If you do n't have money , you do n't get water and you do n't get food . '
On Tuesday night , as international pressure for their release grew , they were taken from the police cells to the feared headquarters of the National Security Agency .
Here Samoura was separated from the rest of the team .
He was taken into a pitch - dark solitary cell the size of a ' broom cupboard ' and threatened with a knife . '
The knifeman said : "" We 're going to cut out your heart and use your blood to write Cry Liberia . ""
Every time anyone touched my door I thought that was the end . '
The President had been angered by the discovery of a bidding document by the team to CNN , setting out in lurid detail the dark side of the Liberian regime .
The document had been brought into Liberia by mistake , Samoura admitted .
In London , Insight News , the production company behind the documentary , and Channel 4 journalists worked around the clock to bring pressure to bear .
Foreign Office Minister Peter Hain , former South African President Nelson Mandela , Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo and Bill Clinton 's envoy to Africa , the Reverend Jesse Jackson , all pitched in .
Obasanjo called up Taylor several times , pointing out the difference between espionage and normal journalistic practice .
Their court appearance was a low point .
The Liberian judge refused bail , and the crew had little idea of how much pressure was being generated on their behalf .
Then things slowly started to go their way .
On Thursday it was announced that former world footballer of the year George Weah - who plays for Liberia - was to intercede on behalf of the four journalists .
Weah has film - star status in his homeland , and the ear of his President .
Meanwhile , Channel 4 's lawyers came up with an apology for the bidding document with which the regime could save face .
The statement issued under the journalists ' names read : ' We , the four journalists currently held in Monrovia Central Prison , wish to express our unreserved apology to both His Excellency the President of Liberia and the people of Liberia for any offence which our actions or statements have caused . '
Channel 4 's chairman , Vanni Treves , also sent a letter of apology to Taylor , the contents of which have not been released .
Looking pale and exhausted , Barrie said : ' We went there to do a job , we meant no offence .
We went in there to try and understand the country . '
Taylor claimed the documentary would have fuelled an ' international conspiracy ' to destroy Liberia by implicating it in gun - running and diamond - smuggling .
If broadcast , the allegations would have been sufficient to trigger international sanctions or military action by the US and UK against Liberia , he said ."
"Sierra Leone is to begin exporting its first diamonds next week under a complex new certification scheme aimed at curbing the trade in smuggled gems that has financed the rebel Revolutionary United Front 's vicious war on civilians and propped up Charles Taylor 's regime in neighbouring Liberia .
The Sierra Leone government and British officials who instigated the scheme say it will have a major impact on the trade in "" blood diamonds "" and the weapons and drug rackets that accompany it .
But sceptics argue that the process is vulnerable to corruption and the questionable commitment of importers such as Belgium and Israel .
The scheme follows a United Nations ban in July on trading in Sierra Leone diamonds that have not been approved for export , and a meeting the same month in Antwerp at which international diamond companies adopted strict measures to track the origin of gems in a bid to stave off more drastic measures , such as a publicity campaign of the kind that all but killed the fur trade .
Tamper - proof Every parcel of diamonds leaving Sierra Leone legally will have to be accompanied by a numbered , tamper - proof certificate printed in the UK and paid for by the British government .
Each certificate lists a parcel of diamonds by carat and value , and includes tear off portions to track the movement of the stones and to ensure that they have not been undervalued in Sierra Leone , either through incompetence or corruption .
The government 's gold and diamond office in Freetown will issue the certificates .
Its manager , Lawrence Ndola - Myers , works from a small room in the central bank , after the RUF burned him out of his original offices during the rebel invasion of Freetown in January 1999 .
"" We have learned our lessons from Angola and Congo , which did not have fake - proof certificates .
We have gone to America , Belgium and Israel and discussed this to make sure everyone is committed .
It will work .
It 's already started working .
It will be very difficult for the RUF , "" he said .
Four international dealers will handle all exports .
There were to have been five , but De Beers declined to participate .
"" We asked De Beers to be one of the dealers because they are the biggest in the world , "" said Mr Ndola - Myers .
"" They said they did n't want to get into any funny business .
They say that want to wait until there is a smooth running of the whole system .
They will not be partaking . ""
Concerns
The success of the system relies heavily on officials in the major diamond dealing centres scrutinising all imported diamonds to ensure that illegal Sierra Leone gems do not slip in .
Diamond experts say it is easy enough to tell the origin of a diamond if it is packed with gems from the same area , but if a lone Sierra Leonean stone is mixed with others from Congo or Russia it becomes much harder to spot the illegal gem .
De Beers is providing a selection of Sierra Leonean stones for comparison by officials overseeing imports in Antwerp and Tel Aviv .
But Alex Yearsley of Global Witness , an organisation that produced a widely respected report on the impact of blood diamonds , questions whether the scrutiny will be stringent . ""
In Tel Aviv they are patently not interested .
The biggest achievement to date is to get dealers to sign a declaration that they are not dealing in conflict diamonds .
In Antwerp they are far more proactive , but only under pressure , "" he said .
Some dealers say that if Antwerp enforces the ban rigorously it will lose business to Tel Aviv , providing a further incentive to relax controls .
There are also concerns about the probity of the process within Sierra Leone . ""
If you are determined enough it will be easy to bypass this system , "" Mr Yearsley said .
"" Officials can be bought .
People say , ' How can you say the Sierra Leone government is corrupt ? '
But it is .
This system could quite conceivably give the RUF a legal way of getting its diamonds out of the country .
"" Whatever its flaws , there is general agreement that the system will make it harder for the rebels and others to dispose of illegal diamonds , and that it will diminish their value .
But campaigners say the key to long term success is an international agreement requiring the certification of all diamond exports , no matter which country they come from .
Britain is hosting a conference in London next month aimed at getting just such a deal .
Hisham Mackie exported more diamonds legally from Sierra Leone in the first six months of this year than any other dealer - three times as many as his nearest rival .
His office in the heart of Freetown is guarded by a military policeman .
Mr Mackie is ensconced behind electronic doors and closed circuit television with a parcel of diamonds worth $ 60,000 ( £ 43,000 ) before him .
"" It will work if they enforce it the other end .
It it 's not enforced it 's just a hassle for the legitimate people .
The bottom line is , you would not have a 100 % system but you will get 80 % .
That is good enough under the circumstances here , "" he said ."
"The president of Liberia , Charles Taylor , is withdrawing a libel case he brought against a British academic for alleging that he is a cannibal , and the Times newspaper for repeating it .
He is trying to place an advertisement in British newspapers saying he has been forced to withdraw because of the high cost of pursuing the case in London .
But the statement also shows that he has realised that a trial would examine his central role in one of Africa 's most brutal civil wars of the 1990s , marked by the wholesale murder of civilians , the widespread use of drugged child soldiers , and ritual sacrifices .
Mr Taylor brought the case a year ago after Stephen Ellis , a British academic at a Dutch university , claimed in his book The Mask of Anarchy that he had eaten human flesh , reflecting the belief widespread among his fighters that human organs , particularly the heart , gave them more strength .
The Times repeated the allegations in its review of the book .
Mr Taylor decided to withdraw after a preliminary hearing in London last week at which the court rejected his request to bar evidence of a range of human rights abuses and the judge ordered him to deposit £ 175,000 as security for the defendants ' costs should he lose the case . ""
Counsel has advised that the effect of these decisions is that the English high court has refused to allow me what can be regarded as a proper opportunity to vindicate my reputation , because it has insisted on a form of proceedings which would be too broad , costly and time consuming , "" Mr Taylor said .
Mr Taylor is known for his immense wealth , so it is unlikely that expense would be an obstacle to him pursuing the case , had he wanted to .
The defendants could have required him to testify in London , where human rights groups have been pressing for his arrest and prosecution for crimes against humanity .
Liberia has been threatened with international sanctions because of his backing , since he won power there , for rebels in Sierra Leone responsible for hacking children 's ' arms off and illegal diamond and weapons trafficking"
"We call it Old
Brother 's Great Shoot - Out .
Although that sounds like the Wild West , "" shoot - out "" registers the violence with which Charles Taylor runs Liberia , and which he has exported to Sierra Leone and across urban West Africa . ""
Shoot - out "" is a good description of our crazy armed robbery .
Around midnight Old Brother ( my neighbour and boss of our extended family ) was woken by a guard from next door , where an American gold - digger and his family were renting the house .
Four armed bandits had leapt out of the darkness and overpowered the guard on the gate .
As they forced their way into the house , the second guard had crept away to warn Old Brother .
Old Brother 's reaction was entirely foolish .
He grabbed his pistol , his shotgun and his pith helmet , and raced out , shouting : "" Call the police ! ""
Convinced that she was going to lose her husband , Marie first phoned for an ambulance .
Then she rang the police .
Meanwhile this overweight 60-year - old was stumbling out into the darkness to find his son Madani and set an ambush .
Madani crept round to the riverbank , and approached the Americans ' house from behind .
On the terrace in the electric light stood a young man holding a Kalashnikov rifle .
Madani , 25 , uses his elephant gun ( I am sorry to say ) to shoot stray dogs .
He reckons thieves are no better than stray dogs , so he took aim and fired .
There was a scream , and the bandit fell to the ground , yelling : "" They done shoot me ! ""
His companions abandoned their hostages and ran out of the house , firing into the night .
Fortunately they missed Old Brother , who was hiding in the bushes by the road .
He let off both barrels of his shotgun in the general direction of the house . . .
my Jeep was peppered with birdshot .
When another shot came from Madani on the riverside , the thieves fled in panic .
As Old Brother was reloading , one of the men came running down the road towards him .
Old Brother let fly one cartridge .
The robber yelled , dropping a package as he disappeared into the trees .
This turned out to be a bag containing the jewels of the American 's wife .
Another robber fled to the riverbank .
This was a mistake .
As he stood silhouetted against the surface of the water , Madani blew a hole in the smooth skin of his back .
Three days later his bloated body was found floating in Dead Man 's Hole , whirling on an eddy in the rapids below the Sotuba hydroelectric station .
The ambulance and the police arrived .
Wisely , they kept their distance until the shooting had stopped .
At daylight they picked up the bandit who had been wounded on the terrace , following his blood trail through the bushes beside the river , where he had passed out .
Meanwhile Old Brother was receiving congratulations from every side .
In some countries killing armed intruders is frowned upon ( or is even considered a crime ) .
In most countries people feel that "" he who lives by the gun deserves to die by the gun "" : if someone manages to shoot an armed bandit before he has time to kill , why should the bandit complain ?
A dead thief never complains .
This gang of Liberians had been terrorising Bamako for weeks .
They had even attacked the house of the minister of defence - probably by mistake .
When they found it was guarded by soldiers , they slipped back into the night .
Now the gang was shattered .
Police morale was restored .
Old Brother was the hero of the hour .
As a reward , the police gave him permits for all the guns in his house , which he had previously owned illegally ."
"The Liberian president , Charles Taylor , has called in the Sierra Leonean Revolutionary United Front guerrillas to help fight off an insurgency which threatens his rule .
With UN peacekeepers deploying throughout Sierra Leone , the RUF 's survival has become contingent on Mr Taylor , whose arms - for - diamonds deals have sustained their 10 years of war .
But analysts say the insurgency in Lofa county , in northern Liberia , by the Liberians United for Reconciliation and Democracy poses a serious threat to Mr Taylor and could topple him , dramatically increasing the chances of peace in Sierra Leone .
Liberian refugees at Daru , a ransacked town near the southern border of Sierra Leone , said the RUF had not stopped the dissidents sweeping Mr Taylor 's ragtag security services before them .
UN intelligence sources said Lurd were in control of Lofa and had been reported as far south as Salayei , 125 miles from the capital , Monrovia .
Lurd are thought to be a loose alliance of Mr Taylor 's disgruntled former officers and rival warlords , galvanised by Guinea since it was attacked by RUF and Liberian fighters last year .
Britain , which was instrumental in bringing UN sanctions against Mr Taylor , is rumoured to be providing intelligence support .
This was denied by the British high commissioner in Freetown , Alan Jones .
At France 's insistence , Liberia 's timber industry was exempted from the the sanctions , leaving them ineffective .
Analysts say the war in Lofa is much more likely to trouble , or even topple , Mr Taylor . ""
As far as sanctions go , timber is crucial , "" the US ambassador to Sierra Leone , Joe Melrose , said .
Mr Taylor has recently remobilised 15,000 of the militiamen from Liberia 's nine - year civil war he disbanded for fear of a coup when he was elected president in 1997 .
RUF fighters went to Liberia to defend the town of Kolahun two months ago , said Steven Garmoh , 32 , a student from Vahun , the county 's main town .
"" They said the government soldiers were being beaten because the dissidents were very strong . ""
When Kolahun fell to the dissidents six weeks ago RUF fighters entered Vahun with the Liberian army and Mr Taylor 's presidential guard .
Five weeks ago Vahun was attacked .
Fanta Konneh , 26 , a Sierra Leonean refugee , said : "" The soldiers started running , the RUF too .
Liberian soldiers were taking off their uniforms and throwing their guns into the river . """
"Charles Taylor , Liberia 's controversial president , will be issued a powerful ultimatum by the European Union which could lead to Brussels suspending its annual aid programme to Liberia altogether and putting a £ 35 m aid package into deep freeze .
In a move likely to delight Britain , which believes that Mr Taylor is actively supporting the rebel campaign in neighbouring Sierra Leone , a European Commission delegation will demand that the Liberian leader prove beyond a shadow of a doubt that allegations of government corruption , multiple human rights abuses and an illegal diamonds - for - arms trade are without foundation .
If Mr Taylor is unable to satisfy the commission and refuses among other things to set up an independent human rights commission , officials say Brussels will sever its annual aid to the country worth £ 16 m and cast Liberia into a diplomatic no - man's- land .
"" Basically he risks becoming an international pariah if things go on as they are and it would be in his own interests to comply , "" one EU official , who declined to be named , told the Guardian .
"" There is a feeling that Taylor might be looking for some kind of opening . ""
UK government sources indicated last night that the move had Downing Street 's backing and officials in Brussels say the new hardline approach , likely to be formally agreed in July , enjoys the support of all 15 member states .
EU officials stress that such an approach , described in EU jargon as opening consultations under the Cotonou agreement , is a highly unusual step and one embarked upon only where there are grounds to suspect that "" serious "" corruption is afoot .
There is no suggestion , however , that EU development aid itself is being improperly administered since it is managed by the commission and not by the Liberian government .
Brussels is always reluctant to axe such aid because it benefits ordinary people rather than the government but officials insist that they may be left with no choice .
A separate £ 35 m poverty alleviation package remains on ice after Britain blocked its rollout last year to punish Mr Taylor for his alleged backing of the Revolutionary United Front in Sierra Leone .
But if the Liberian leader falls into line , officials say Brussels will consider unblocking it .
Brussels ' wish - list is extensive ; an independent human rights commission , a South African - style truth and reconciliation commission , re - education of Liberia 's security forces , an end to harassment of the opposition and a far - reaching judicial shake - up ."

"Shelling near the Liberian capital Monrovia yesterday provoked panic among residents , who feared that rebels were about to storm the city .
Tens of thousands of people fled their workplaces for home and dragged their children out of school as excitable government troops tore through the streets waving weapons .
The attack by a shadowy rebel group on an area just 15 miles from Monrovia was the closest to the capital to date , and further evidence of the looming threat to President Charles Taylor 's power .
Liberia 's defence minister , Daniel Chea , said the area under assault was Arthington , the source of Monrovia 's water supply .
At the weekend , rebels seized control of Liberia 's second city , Gbarnga .
Mr Taylor ordered the arrest of two of his frontline commanders for "" conniving with rebels "" to capture the city .
Mr Taylor declared a state of emergency in February - compounding the fears of much of the population about his manic and violent rule - as members of Liberians United for Reconciliation and Democracy ( LURD ) intensified their attacks .
LURD is principally made up of rebels who lost the ethnically - driven seven - year civil war to Mr Taylor in 1996 .
Recently , it has received support from neighbouring Guinea and pro - government militias in Sierra Leone .
Attacks by LURD in recent weeks have underlined the government 's vulnerability .
Mr Taylor 's problems have been compounded by a UN arms embargo , and the regime in Monrovia says it is now severely short of weapons ."
"The governments of Liberia and Burkina Faso facilitated an al - Qaida plot to funnel diamonds and weapons through west Africa before and after the September 11 attacks , it was reported yesterday .
A joint investigation by European intelligence agencies has uncovered an elaborate web of bribery and clandestine deals which allowed Osama bin Laden 's terror group to hide financial assets in the region , according to the Washington Post .
The paper said the Liberian president , Charles Taylor , received $ 1 m ( £ 625,000 ) to harbour senior al - Qaida operatives after the attacks in New York and Washington in September 2001 .
The Islamists are said to have shuttled between areas under Mr Taylor 's protection and the presidential compound in Burkina Faso while buying $ 20 m worth of diamonds , effectively cornering the market in west Africa 's precious stones .
At the same time they sought sophisticated weapons , including anti - aircraft missiles .
President Blaise Campaore of Burkina Faso and Mr Taylor deny the accusation , which is included in a summary of the joint intelligence findings .
The European investigators , who lost track of the diamonds after they left west Africa , were quoted criticising the CIA for not responding to the information they shared .
Since Mr Taylor triumphed in Liberia 's civil war , the country has been run as his fiefdom and the UN has banned him and his aides from international travel .
Gangsters and smugglers have flocked to the capital , Monrovia .
Al - Qaida 's effort to hide assets in the region appears to date from 1998 , after the bombings of the US embassies in Tanzania and Kenya led to an international effort to freeze its bank accounts and other assets .
Two al - Qaida operatives on the FBI 's wanted list allegedly toured diamond fields in Liberia and Sierra Leone and supervised the trade from a military camp in Liberia .
The report named three men - a Lebanese diamond merchant , his cousin and a Senegalese mercenary - as conduits who linked the Islamists to the Liberian leadership and a company in Belgium which polished and sold the stones .
In 2000 the firm is said to have sold diamonds worth $ 14 m .
Calls from its headquarters and a satellite phone were traced to Afghanistan , Pakistan , Iran and Iraq .
In January 2001 the Islamists and their conduits rented a large house in Monrovia which became their base .
In the summer of that year two alleged al - Qaida operatives , Ahmed Khalfan Ghailani and Fazul Abdullah Mohammed , allegedly stayed in the compound of the president of Burkina Faso in the capital , Ougadougou , before moving to Camp Gbatala , a military camp in Liberia near Mr Taylor 's private farm .
For that the Liberian president was allegedly paid $ 1 m .
After September 11 the Pentagon sent a special forces team to neighbouring Guinea to snatch the pair , but the plan was scrapped when their identities could not be confirmed .
Simultaneously , the Islamist cell allegedly tried to buy weapons from an Israeli arms dealer in Panama .
An intercepted email from the Israeli to a Russian arms merchant , listing assault rifles , ammunition , ground - to - air missiles and 200 rockets for multiple rocket launchers , said the consignment was for "" our friends in Africa "" ."
"The question has never been about whether Saddam is a bad leader and tyrant , because only a fool would argue that he was n't .
The question is under what terms the international community tries to enforce international law , and for what reasons the UN decides to cooperate with US designs .

John Steppling , Krakow , Poland You state : "" at the same time , he has thus far managed to insist , and also to persuade the Americans , that we stick to the path of UN endorsement and the framework of international law .

Do we really need to be allied to this superpower with its doctrine of "" American exceptionalism "" , when it has to be "" persuaded "" to stick to international law ?

Jeremy Haywood , Hamburg , Germany Thank you for your thoughtful analysis on the situation in Iraq .
I am writing to you as an American who favours strong military action against Saddam Hussein .
Much of what you see on TV regarding public opinion here centers on anti - war protests , but there are nearly equal numbers who feel that appeasement or peace at any price , although a noble philosophy , has proven disastrous throughout history .
I am a teacher , and I do not favour war or killing , but I also know that there are times when reason and logic are completely useless when dealing with irrational and fanatic dictators ...

That would be indeed a surprise .
Instead , my best bet would be , if Saddam was not sitting - as now it 's being widely said , on a pool of oil - the US , the UK , the Observer and a perhaps few other nations would be turning their eyes prudishly away from Baghdad 's deeds .

There has certainly been no link established nor will there be , between the disgusting Saddam regime and the equally appalling 9/11 attack .
Why Iraq ?
Why now ?
The only thing I care about are the men , women and children who have neither voice nor vote to decide their future and will suffer even more during and after an American led war .
As a devout Muslim who follows the fundamentals of Islam as best
I can
, I care about people and justice and truth .
There is a great imbalance and lack of accuracy in most media reporting and in general the public , both Muslim and non - Muslim , have very little idea of what really is going on .
Khadija Podd , Barcelona , Spain
I find this article well balanced and instuctive .
Thank you .

Please , please , do n't peddle the view that an Iraqi war is justified .
Those who have consistently taken such a position with respect to every dictatorship that tortures its citizens are perhaps due respect , even by those of us who differ .
This is not the American position .
The US espouses one person one vote , and yet ( along with Britain ) insists on a veto in the United Nations .
The US pretends to believe in international law , but refuses to recognize an international court .
However smart President Bush 's aides may be , they are a very frightening group of people for those of us who watch them erode human rights every day .
Clive Stafford Smith , New Orleans , USA Your rationale for supporting military action against Iraq merely reiterates self - serving platitudes about humanitarian intervention and dispelling the possibility of weapons of mass destruction falling into the hands of terrorists .
You also brandish puerile assertions about Western nations making law and not war .
Given the West 's bloody imperial and colonial histories , its incessant devotion to the technology of war , and its own internecine conflicts that resulted in two world wars , I find such assertions to be laughable .
The fact is that the US and Britain will attack Iraq because they have the military might to overwhelm a weakened , bombed - out , isolated country presided over by an odious dictator with no allies .
This is Machiavellian realpolitik , thuggery camouflaged as morality .
Here in the Caribbean , the overwhelming perception of the pending war is that it is an American imperial war for oil and the manifest destiny of keeping the Arabs in their place .
Norval Edwards , Kingston , Jamaica Thank you very much for expounding the case for Western intervention in Iraq so clearly and objectively .
Your article has helped me clarify my own position .
Peter Craven , Auckland , New Zealand
The worst thing about this all is that there is no need for a war to protect ourselves against Saddam Hussein , even if he does possess more than a few empty warheads .
Inspections and verification and containment will do the job .
Surely with all the drones , satellites and AWACS which are crowding the skies over the Middle East , we are in a position to make sure that if a mouse moves in Iraq , we 'll know about it ?
Michele Bailey , Brussels , Belgium Thank you for your thoughtful and rational editorial regarding the Iraq situation .
It cheers both heart and mind to read an intelligent and honest analysis of the dangerous situation the free world must face up to .
Your words also serve as a reminder as to why the special relationship between the US and England will persist .
Brian Ish , New York , USA I desperately would like somebody to tell me how can I prove that I do n't possess something .
Nobody has been able tell me yet .
Am I a complete fool ?
The American President and the British Prime Minister pretend they know that Saddam Hussein is in possession of weapons of mass destruction .
Why do n't they tell Hans Blix where they are ?
Why do n't you journalists ask such simple questions instead of writing lengthy leaders that do in no way answer this decisive question .
Hermann Lindenberger , Lauffen Germany
I applaud you for your clear analysis of the Iraq situation .
Indeed , I predict that Saddam will be crushed without or only with partial intervention .
Indeed he may serve the Western interests more than he really expected .
This important geographic flank will be secured for the Asian - Russian oil flow for many years to come .
It will continue to erode Arab oil dominance .
The US must come out of it with some tangible economic victory or its economic power will continue to erode .
Fritz Fiber , Albuuqerque , New Mexico , USA I personally am against war with Iraq unless the UN inspectors find unambiguous evidence that Iraq has nuclear weapons , complete with warheads and advanced launching systems , all ready for immediate use .
I think it would be a cop - out to hide behind a UN resolution that sanctions war on weak and dubious grounds , just because it is the UN that has passed the resolution .
I expect that the UN will turn out to be irrelevant anyway :
Either America will buy off opposition on the Security Council - not too difficult given the Security Council 's membership - or it will go ahead and attack Iraq regardless of UN opposition , pinning all its hopes on a quick victory , and on the supposed electoral popularity , within America , that such a victory might bring .
John Sargent , Trieste , Italy
As a 69 year old Brit who has worked and lived in the US for 30 years , here is my take on the Iraq crisis .
Saddam Hussein runs a corrupt regime that requires elimination if there is to be any hope of commencing to stabilize the Middle East .
The 1991 Gulf War did not complete its planned objectives because of serious miscalculations by George Bush senior , his son is rightly attempting to remedy that failure .
The US has the military capability to successfully complete its miliary objectives in Iraq/ Nationbuilding will take somewhat longer but once Saddam flees to Libya there will be a national sigh of relief from Sunnis and Shiites in Iraq .
Rebuilding the country will be much easier that recreating a nation in Afghanistan but at least give the US credit for making these moves .
Most other industrialized nations privately agree they are necessary but are loath to step forward and be counted .

"I do not feel threatened by Saddam ( Threat of war , March 5 ) ; Saddam 's neighbours feel that he is effectively contained .
His own people may not be happy , but the same could be said for scores of oppressed populations throughout the world , not least in Africa .
If Mr Blair is so keen on the neo - imperialist policy of regime change , he might start with Charles Taylor of Liberia .
British troops have just been committed for the second time to save Sierra Leone from his marauding forces .
It was insurgents from Liberia that recently stirred up trouble in Ivory Coast .
If Mr Blair sought my support for regime change in Liberia on moral grounds , he would have it .
We could then move on to Zimbabwe , or who knows where ?
I might just be persuaded that there is a moral argument for regime change , but not with Saddam at the top of the list .
Julian Pettifer London Hans Blix wrote of "" 380 SA-2 missile engines imported outside of the export / import mechanism "" in his report to the UN security council on February 14 .

A reply from Ewen Buchanan said : "" We are still investigating this , but even if / when resolved , we would not release the supplier name . ""
This appears to be typical of the hypocrisy being practised .

"Rebels fought their way to the outskirts of the Liberian capital , Monrovia , yesterday in a renewed effort to oust President Charles Taylor .
Civilians fled as government troops struggled to rebuff a week - long offensive which brought the rebels to within three miles of the city , just one of three battle fronts ravaging the west African nation .
Aid agencies and military officials told Reuters there was gunfire around a Monrovia secondary school and a suburb called Virginia .
There were also reports of shooting around Brewerville , six miles from the capital .
The assault appeared to be one of the more serious challenges to Mr Taylor in a three - year insurgency by the rebel group Liberians United for Reconciliation and Democracy .
Battles also took place in the central city of Gbarnga and in the eastern towns of Toe and Zle near the border with Ivory Coast , which has its own civil war .
The president , a former warlord who seized power in a seven - year civil war and was elected in 1997 , said he would defy a United Nations security council arms embargo to defend his rule .
Depicted by critics as a gangster who sought power and mineral wealth by stoking conflicts in Sierra Leone and Ivory Coast , Mr Taylor said neighbouring states wanted to destabilise him ."
"Panic swept through the Liberian capital , Monrovia , yesterday after President Charles Taylor was indicted by a UN - backed court for crimes against humanity during the civil war in neighbouring Sierra Leone .
Fearing clashes , thousands of people reportedly fled their homes .
The charges , which follow the government 's loss of nearly two - thirds of the country to two rebel groups which are now within a few miles of Monrovia , were made public as Mr Taylor engaged in peace talks with the rebels in the Ghanaian capital , Accra .
Some analysts described the timing of the indictment as a politically motivated slap in the face to the peace talks ' mediators , who include South Africa 's President Thabo Mbeki , Nigeria 's Olusegun Obasanjo and leaders of Sierra Leone , Ivory Coast , and Ghana .
Prosecutors called on Ghana to arrest Mr Taylor , but the for eign minister , Nana Akufo - Addo , said the Accra government had not received a formal request to extradite him .
Minutes after the indictment was made public , Mr Taylor appeared in a motorcade at the talks ' opening ceremony , looking tense .
The president reportedly offered to resign some weeks ago if plans for an indictment were dropped .
After it was issued , he again hinted he might step down in January if this helped bring peace .
"" My government , whose mandate ends in January , will seek upon my return to Liberia a national unity government immediately .
Following my term as president , there must exist a transition .
I will strongly consider a process of transition that will not include me _
If President Taylor removes himself for the Liberians , will that bring peace ?
If so , I will remove myself . ""
Alex Vines , the head of the Africa programme at the Royal Institute for International Affairs , and a former member of the UN 's panel of experts on Liberia , said he was surprised by the timing of the indictment .
"" It is an opportunistic move , and Ghana is under intense pressure to act on the indictment , "" he said .
He added : "" Some on the security council seem to believe regime change is desirable but lack any vision of what happens once Taylor is gone "" .
Two rebel groups from different tribal backgrounds , one supported by Guinea , the other by Ivory Coast , have seized most of the country but there is no guarantee they will not turn and fight each other if the Taylor government falls .
Britain and France , with their special interest in Sierra Leone and Ivory Coast respectively , resent Mr Taylor 's earlier efforts to destabilise the countries .
They apparently want him out , whatever the consequences .
Liberia is already under UN sanctions , including an arms embargo and a travel ban for Mr Taylor and other top government officials , for spreading regional instability .
 EU ambassadors in Brussels yesterday approved sending its new peacekeeping force to Congo to separate warring rebel groups , just five days after the UN security council backed a 1,400-strong multinational force .
It is the first deployment since the force was declared ready to go last month , and comes as the EU seeks to increase its influence by speaking and acting together in foreign affairs .

"Charles Taylor , the kleptocratic warlord who has presided over Liberia for a decade and exported civil strife along the West African coast , declared his defiance yesterday as rebel fighters closed in on the centre of the capital , Monrovia .
British aid workers trapped in the city described how rebels who crossed the St Paul river bridge into the outskirts of the city on Friday had reached within three miles of the European Commission compound and US embassy in the ramshackle city 's heart close to the Atlantic ocean .
The attack by rebels from the Liberians United for Reconciliation and Democracy ( LURD ) follows the indictment last week of Taylor by the UN tribunal investigating human rights abuses in Sierra Leone where rebel fighters were backed by Taylor .
He is accused of gun - running and other trafficking with the Sierra Leone rebels , who killed , maimed , raped and kidnapped tens of thousands of civilians there before their defeat in 2002 .
Magnus Wolfe Murray of the charity
Merlin told The Observer that rebel fighters had ' surged ' into the city . '
We could hear very heavy fighting only three miles from where we are at the EC compound this morning , ' he said . '
All the UN 's displaced persons camps are in rebel hands and there are waves of people fleeing .
There were 220,000 people in those camps .
We estimate there may be 300,000 to 700,000 people now in danger of being displaced . '"
"Rebel fighters encircled Liberia 's capital , Monrovia , yesterday , sending tens of thousands of inhabitants fleeing for their lives .
The rebels gave the country 's president , Charles Taylor , 72 hours to step down .
Refugees said members of Liberians United for Reconciliation and Democracy advanced under heavy fire to recapture the key Saint Paul river bridge just hours after the defence minister had vowed to root out pockets of resistance .
US marines prepared sandbag bunkers on top of the American embassy , ready for an expected helicopter evacuation of westerners .
The embassy had already announced an evacuation of non - essential personnel , and UN agencies were also said to be considering pulling out .
The fighting has overshadowed peace talks in Ghana to try to end nearly 14 years of violence , which Mr Taylor is accused of spreading to Sierra Leone and Ivory Coast .
Mr Taylor has been indicted by a UN - backed court for war crimes in Sierra Leone .
The peace talks are due to resume today ."
"French military helicopters evacuated foreigners from Monrovia , the besieged capital of Liberia , yesterday , ferrying them to a ship waiting in the Atlantic .
The evacuations came as rebels fighting to oust President Charles Taylor bore down on the capital .
Explosions sounded in the distance and French forces stood guard as helicopters took off from the EU compound , where foreign residents had gathered .
"" We ca n't work , and we had to leave , "" said Isabelle de Bourning , of French charity Médecins sans Frontières .
"" I hope it will be quick . ""
Helicopters later arrived at the US embassy compound to collect Americans and those with dual citizenship .
By mid - afternoon , French troops had evacuated 350 people , including Americans , Europeans , Lebanese , Indians and Egyptians , a French defence ministry spokesman said .
Up to 500 people were expected to be taken to the ship , Orage , before it headed for Ivory Coast .
The EU , which operates the water plants for Monrovia , planned to keep a core staff there as long as possible , said David Parker , acting head of the EU mission in Liberia .
The US ambassador , John Blaney , and some marines , special forces and security workers were also staying .
Mr Blaney renewed appeals for a ceasefire so that talks that started in Ghana last week could proceed ."
"A roaring storm of grim outriders , armoured Jeeps and sleek black saloons pours through Monrovia 's rotting streets .
To the tattered war orphans and refugees gawping in the gutter of one of the world 's poorest countries , such opulence must seem unreal .
But so much does in the inside - out world of President Charles Taylor , Liberia 's warlord - turned - democratically - elected leader .
In Monrovia 's northern Douala suburb , a uniformed work - gang was mowing the grass , just yards from where three corpses lay decaying after a rebel attack .
Along the road , child fighters in curly women 's wigs - a ju - ju defence against bullets - consumed their salaries in drugs .
And , according to terrified refugees flooding by , raped for their pleasure and robbed for their food . '
They took a 12-year - old girl right here , that 's what we 've come to , ' said Anthony Washington , 30 , outside a refugee camp 's deserted Red Cross office .
The girl was young .
But so , according to Washington , were the rapists . '
We got no order , ' said Washington , in Creole . '
We do n't know who 's a rebel and who 's a government man .
We do n't know who to run from , or where to run to next . '
This is the Liberia Taylor built .
A US - educated , Libyan - trained guerrilla leader , he began a seven - year civil war in 1989 that claimed more than 200,000 lives .
Then , in 1997 , he terrified its survivors into electing him President .
Now he is fighting two wars .
The first is against two rebel groups , allegedly armed by neighbouring Guinea , Sierra Leone and Ivory Coast - all sick of him arming their own rebels .
The second is against the West , with Taylor charged this month with war crimes and crimes against humanity by a UN - backed tribunal that is investigating Sierra Leone 's repellent war .
But Taylor , a most eloquent guerrilla , appeared on a popular radio talk show last week to withdraw his promise of days before to cede power to a transitional government . '
The vast majority of our people , including chiefs and others , are protesting that I ca n't step aside without their approval , ' said Taylor , wearing a safari suit emblazoned with Liberia 's gold seal of state .
That was bad news for Monrovia 's 1.2 million brutalised people , crammed into a crumbling city built for 300,000 .
The Liberians United for Reconciliation and Democracy , allegedly backed by Guinea and Sierra Leone , was barely beaten back from the city early this month in fighting that claimed more than 400 lives and scattered 60,000 already destitute refugees .
Meanwhile , the Movement for Democracy in Liberia ( Model ) , allegedly backed by Ivory Coast , is lurking to the south .
If the rebels attacked together , Monrovia would probably fall and become a bloodbath . '
Something terrible is going to happen if Taylor refuses to go , ' said one of the few Western diplomats still in Monrovia . '
If he digs in and the rebels come in , a lot of innocent people are going to die . '
The rebels , at least , were not fooled . '
Not an option , ' said Eugene Wilson , a spokesman for Model , of Taylor 's plan to cling on . '
This time around , he will learn to respect and come to realise that it 's not going to be his way , but the way of the Liberian people . '
America , Taylor 's long - time enemy , was also unimpressed . '
We believe there is no place for Charles Taylor in a transitional government or in any government of Liberia , ' said Philip Reeker , a State Department spokesman .
Analysts and aid workers are calling on America to intervene in its former territory to end the anarchy , as Britain did in Sierra Leone and France in Ivory Coast .
In recent days , more than 100 US troops have been deployed to the US Embassy in Monrovia .
But Washington has shown no signs that it will snatch Taylor , much less send peacekeepers to fill the void if he falls . '
Everyone knows it 's up to the Americans now , ' said the Western diplomat . '
They have the capacity to intervene and Liberia has always been their sphere of influence .
But it does n't look as if they 're considering it . '"
"Tens of thousands of terrified civilians fled through a battle zone in Monrovia yesterday , as fresh clashes for Liberia 's capital threatened to end the rule of its president , Charles Taylor .
Liberia 's main rebel group , Liberians United for Reconciliation and Democracy ( LURD ) , pushed through Monrovia 's centre yesterday , towards the port .
The renewed fighting followed Mr Taylor 's vow last week to remain in power , repudiating a peace agreement signed just days before .
"" There 's fighting all around , we 've had a bullet through our compound , two grenades have just landed outside , "" David Parker , the EU 's aid coordinator in Liberia and one of the few remaining western aid workers or diplomats , told the Guardian by phone from Monrovia .
"" There are three bodies down the road , many civilians are being killed and wounded from stray missiles and bullets .
The rebels are moving very , very quickly , "" he said .
As the battle moved towards the US embassy late yesterday , officials opened an adjacent embassy compound to about 40,000 refugees .
At least 27 wounded civilians were brought to the office of the medical aid agency Médecins Sans Frontières late yesterday .
Two of them later died .
With central Monrovia too dangerous to pass through , and the city 's northern suburbs cut off since late on Tuesday , Mr Parker suggested that the toll of dead and wounded would be much higher .
Mr Taylor , who was indicted earlier this month for war crimes committed during Sierra Leone 's civil war , yesterday vowed to survive the second rebel attack in a fortnight on Monrovia .
"" I am right here with the men and women in arms , encouraging them to continue to fight on , "" he announced on his private radio station yesterday .
"" Your survival is my survival , my survival is your survival .
"" One of Mr Taylor 's officers gave a more plausible account .
"" We will fight them until a neutral force can come here , "" he said.""We have no place to go . ""
According to last week 's agreement international observers were to monitor a ceasefire between the government , the LURD and another rebel group , Movement for Democracy in Liberia ( Model ) , which are allegedly backed by Guinea , Sierra Leone and Ivory Coast .
That agreement was in tatters yesterday with fighting never ceasing outside Monrovia and half the capital held by the LURD .
Liberia 's last civil war , begun by Mr Taylor in 1989 , ended when he was elected president in 1997 .
It was marked by more than a dozen failed peace deals and more than 200,000 dead .
The current conflict began three years ago after the LURD was allegedly armed by Guinea to repel an invasion from Mr Taylor 's allies in Sierra Leone .
Model was launched this year from Ivory Coast after Mr Taylor 's fighters invaded that country 's western part . ""
Taylor 's plan to rule the region through rebellion has backfired , "" said Comfort Ero of the International Crisis Group , a thinktank in Sierra Leone 's capital , Freetown .
"" Now he 's getting the same treatment from his neighbours .
Whether he falls now or in a few weeks or month the writing 's on the wall for Charles Taylor . ""
David Crane , chief prosecutor at the international war crimes tribunal in Freetown , which indicted Mr Taylor , said yesterday : "" As my father used to say , right is right . ""
That means , we 're going to get Charles Taylor , I assure you . """
"A mob deposited seven corpses outside the US embassy in Monrovia yesterday , urging America to intervene in a battle for the Liberian capital that has claimed about 300 lives in three days .
The fighting waned in the centre of the city yesterday , with the government claiming to have driven the main rebel group - Liberians United for Reconciliation and Democracy ( Lurd ) - to the city 's outskirts .
But to the sporadic crackle of gunfire , the ragged soldiers of the president , Charles Taylor , began looting furiously .
"" Most aid agencies were ransacked during the night , and now I hear they 're looting shops and businesses everywhere , "" the EU 's aid co - ordinator , David Parker , said from Monrovia .
"" It 's difficult to say if anyone 's in control . ""
Liberia 's health minister , Peter Coleman , said that between 200 and 300 civilians had been killed in the three - day fight , and about 1,000 wounded .
The Lurd 's march on Monrovia on Tuesday wrecked a week - long ceasefire agreement between the government and two rebel groups .
It was sparked by Mr Taylor 's decision to renege on his promise to step aside in favour of a transitional government , the cornerstone of the agreement .
Carrying the corpses of four children , two women and a man , a furious crowd marched on the US embassy , screaming for American intervention to stop the killing .
The mob 's cries followed a similar request from Sir Jeremy Greenstock , British ambassador to the UN , on Wednesday .
America was the "" natural candidate "" to end the mayhem in Liberia , Sir Jeremy said ."
"Heavy artillery and small - arms fire pounded Monrovia yesterday as a four - day battle for the city degenerated into scenes of random violence and widespread looting by the army of Liberia 's besieged president and indicted war criminal , Charles Taylor .
As the rebel Liberians United for Reconciliation and Democracy ( Lurd ) redoubled its attack on the city 's main port , residents estimated that 500 civilians had been killed in that small area of Monrovia alone .
Mr Taylor 's army , a ragged assortment of Israeli - trained officers and hastily - armed street - boys , rushed to meet the rebels ' advance , before switching its efforts to retaking Monrovia 's main brewery in the nearby suburb of Doala .
"" We are fighting to liberate Doala in general , the beer factory in particular , "" said one soldier running to the front with a submachine gun .
At midday , the rebels unilaterally declared a ceasefire to "" avoid a grotesque humanitarian catastrophe , "" according to a statement posted on the internet .
Yet aid workers and local journalists in Monrovia reported no let - up in the fighting around the port , or in looting across the city .
"" There 's heavy fighting for the port and loads of guys just shooting into the air and looting everywhere , "" said David Parker , the EU 's aid coordinator by telephone from the city .
After a stray rocket hit a funeral home , Mr Taylor 's soldiers poured in to loot among the tangled corpses .
Around the port , journalists reported seeing dozens of residents dragging the bodies of family - members to bury in the sand or dump in the surf .
With most of Monrovia 's food reserves stored inside the port , food prices tripled overnight , leaving the majority of the city 's 1.2 million people hungry and prone to worsening epidemics .
Health workers have reported many cholera cases among about 100,000 people seeking refuge at the main football stadium .
Most of Monrovia 's population were refugees even before the current battle , having been chased from their villages in northern Liberia and neighbouring Sierra Leone during a decade of bitter conflict in the region .
Up to 100 foreign aid workers were trapped in the American embassy in Monrovia as a planned evacuation was stalled by UN red tape . ""
While the UN pisses about looking for safe - passage guarantees from every side , we 're having to work out how to save ourselves , "" said one of the trapped aid workers .
Four UN helicopters were awaiting permission to fly from Freetown , Sierra Leone 's capital , despite a blinding tropical storm throughout the day .
A UN spokesman , Patrick Coker , said : "" We 're just awaiting clearance .
We remain on very short notice to move in . ""
The battle for Monrovia had waned late on Thursday as both the rebels and government forces withdrew pending a statement by President George Bush , who is due to visit Africa next month .
Yet with Mr Bush merely restating that Mr Taylor should cede power to a transitional government , the fighting quickly resumed .
Washington has come under mounting pressure to intervene in Liberia , as Britain did in Sierra Leone and France has in Ivory Coast .
On Wednesday , Britain 's ambassador to the UN , Sir Jeremy Greenstock , urged America to lead a multinational force into Monrovia .
"" America is being told to act by the international community , and so it must , "" said Comfort Iro of the International Crisis Group , a thinktank in Freetown .
"" Liberia is its sphere of influence , and the situation there is critical . """
"President Charles Taylor of Liberia , indicted for war crimes in neighbouring Sierra Leone and besieged by rebel forces , will stand down if the case against him is dropped , one of his ministers said yesterday .
As the UN prepared to evacuate refugees from the capital , Monrovia , Mr Taylor 's "" special emissary "" tried to negotiate a process of "" national reconciliation "" without retribution .
Samuel Jackson told a meeting at the Royal Institute of International Affairs in London that if Mr Taylor stepped down there would be retribution against his supporters in which thousands would be killed .
But Mr Taylor was willing to go if there was a peace process .
Mr Jackson met Foreign Office officials to discuss a possible international peacekeeping force for Liberia .
Britain , France and the US believe Mr Taylor has to go .
Sanctions against Liberian timber are due to be introduced in a fortnight .
Asked what the president would do when he left power , Mr Jackson replied : "" He sees his future as a coffee or cocoa farmer , his home in Monrovia converted to a presidential library .
He will be the granddaddy of Liberian politics . """
"President Bush is preparing to send "" several hundred "" troops to Liberia as part of an international peacekeeping force to stop the bloodshed from civil war , US officials said yesterday .
Mr Bush also called for the Liberian president , Charles Taylor , to step down and leave the country , as an essential precondition for restoring peace .
An announcement on the deployment of US troops is expected today or tomorrow , ahead of the president 's first visit to Africa next week .
The force would probably be between 500- and 1,000-strong and would be made up principally of marines currently on standby in Spain .
The Ministry of Defence said it was unlikely that more than a handful of officers would be deployed from Britain .
Mr Bush has been under intense pressure to intervene in a state founded by freed American slaves , as the death toll from street fighting rose to 700 over the past month .
Mr Bush told reporters that "" one thing needs to happen ...
Mr Taylor needs to leave the country .
"" It was not clear last night whether the Liberian president 's departure was a precondition for the marine deployment .
US military officials have previously insisted that American troops should be part of an international force , probably including West African and British troops , but would be under US command .
The deployment would be limited to a period of weeks or months ."
"President Bush is preparing to send "" several hundred "" troops to Liberia as part of an international peacekeeping force to stop the bloodshed in the civil war , US officials said yesterday .
Mr Bush also called for the Liberian president , Charles Taylor , to step down and leave the country as an essential precondition for restoring peace .
An announcement on the deployment of US troops is expected today or tomorrow , ahead of the president 's first visit to Africa next week .
The force would probably consist of between 500 and 1,000 troops and would include a rapid deployment unit of marines currently on standby in Rota , Spain .
Their main job would be to defend the US embassy in the capital , Monrovia , and protect several hundred Americans still in Liberia .
The Ministry of Defence said it was unlikely that more than a handful of officers would be deployed from Britain .
Mr Bush has been under intense pressure to intervene in the African state founded by freed American slaves .
The death toll from street fighting has risen to 700 following the collapse of a June 17 ceasefire between President Taylor 's supporters and rebel forces which now control two - thirds of the countryside .
Mr Bush told reporters that "" one thing needs to happen ...
Mr Taylor needs to leave the country .
"" It was not clear last night whether the president 's departure was a precondition for the marine deployment .
US military officials have previously insisted that US troops should be part of an international force , probably including West African and British troops , but would be under US command .
The deployment would be limited to a period of weeks or months .
Rumours of the imminent arrival of US troops were enough to trigger jubilant celebrations in Monrovia .
However , the deployment could be delayed by uncertainties over the fate of President Taylor .
He has been in negotiation with Lagos on a deal that would allow him to take refuge in Nigeria , and protect him from human rights abuse charges in a Sierra Leonian court ."
"The US said today it would send a team of military experts to the war torn west African nation of Liberia to decide whether American troops should be sent as part of a peacekeeping force .
White House press secretary Ari Fleischer said the team would "" work with nations in the area "" to determine the best approach to ending the rebel warfare .
Earlier today , the controversial Liberian president , Charles Taylor , renewed a pledge to step down if an international force is sent to keep the peace .
"" It makes a lot of sense for peacekeepers to arrive in this city before I transit , "" Mr Taylor told a meeting of Liberian clerics in the capital of Monrovia . ""
Before I transit , I think it is important that peacekeepers be present . ""
He welcomed the possibility of American troops among an envisioned international intervention force .
"" I welcome and will embrace the presence of American troops in Liberia .
I think it will be essential for stability , "" he said adding , however : "" I do n't understand why the United States government would insist that I be absent before its soldiers arrive . ""
Mr Taylor offered a chilling warning to rebel opponents that his government forces were still "" capable of carrying out havoc in the city .
Even government soldiers and supporters that are angry are capable of havoc .
"" I 'm not fighting to stay in power .
What I am fighting for right now is that there would be such a normal transition that anger , frustration and other things do n't creep in , "" Mr Taylor said .
Insurgents last month laid siege to Monrovia , leaving hundreds dead and sending tens of thousands of displaced villagers racing into the city centre to seek shelter .
Now those refugees are stalked by hunger , disease and Mr Taylor 's looting , often drunken fighters .
The US president , George Bush , has urged Mr Taylor to step down , and is considering a possible US contribution to a peacekeeping contingent requested by UN secretary - general Kofi Annan , France and Britain .
The force could range from none to several thousand American troops .
The US has been under considerable pressure to intervene in Liberia , which has close historic ties to the US .
However the itinerary for Mr Bush 's upcoming visit to sub - Saharan Africa did not include Liberia .
Peace talks resumed today , with chief mediator and former Nigerian junta leader Abdulsalami Abubakar meeting rebel envoys in Accra , the capital of Ghana .
He was scheduled to meet later with Mr Taylor 's delegation .
An official of the leading rebel movement at the talks stressed that Mr Taylor should not renege on the deal if an eventual international force does not include US troops .
"" We are encouraged by this pronouncement , "" Kabineh Ja'neh said , expressing hope Mr Taylor would leave "" as soon as troops arrive in Liberia "" .
The sides are negotiating over a possible transitional government which rebels say must exclude Mr Taylor - who launched Liberia 's 1989 - 1996 civil war .
Although Mr Taylor indicated during the first round of peace talks in Ghana on June 4 his willingness to step down if doing so restores peace , he later insisted he would stay until his term runs out next year .
An aide to the Nigerian president , Olusegun Obasanjo , speaking on condition of anonymity in the capital of Abuja , confirmed to the Associated Press today that Nigeria has offered Mr Taylor "" temporary asylum "" on the condition he would eventually depart for a third country .
The Nigerian official did not say if Mr Taylor had finally accepted the offer .
While Mr Taylor was in Ghana , a UN - backed war crimes court in neighbouring Sierra Leone indicted him for gun trafficking and supporting Sierra Leone rebels during their vicious 10-year terror campaign .
Mr Taylor cut short his Ghana visit and flew home an international fugitive ."
"Charles Taylor , the Liberian president , under siege from rebels in the capital Monrovia , yesterday renewed his promise to step aside and seek asylum in Nigeria .
A senior Nigerian government official said President Taylor had accepted an offer of asylum . ""
[ He ] asked to be given 40 days , but Nigeria said it should be some time this month , "" said the official .
Mr Taylor , who has been in power for six years , said yesterday he would only relinquish power when an international force arrived .
But George Bush , the US president , who visits Africa next week , is said to be unwilling to commit troops to Liberia until Mr Taylor goes .
The US had been asked to send a small detachment of troops , of up to 1,000 , to lead a mainly African peacekeping force .
"" It makes a lot of sense for peacekeepers to arrive in this city before I transit , "" Mr Taylor told a meeting of Liberian clerics in Monrovia .
Mr Taylor was indicted as a war criminal last month , accused of fomenting the civil war in neighbouring Sierra Leone fought over diamonds .
British military intervention three years ago helped end the Sierra Leone conflict .
Western governments yesterday treated Mr Taylor 's comments with caution , recalling that he reneged on a promise a fortnight ago to leave .
If he goes into asylum , the US , Britain and other countries will try to prise him out of Nigeria to face trial .
While promising to leave yesterday , Mr Taylor also warned that , if he chose , he could create another bloodbath round Monrovia .
He said government forces loyal to him were still "" capable of carrying out havoc in the city "" .
The World Health Organisation yesterday appealed for international assistance for 100,000 refugees from Monrovia who fled the fighting .
Cholera and dysentry have risen over the past few weeks .
President Bush is sending military experts to Africa to assess whether his troops in Liberia would help bring stability to the war - torn nation ."
"Liberia 's embattled president , Charles Taylor , accepted an offer of asylum in Nigeria yesterday but gave no indication of when he would leave and insisted that it must be an "" orderly exit from power "" .
The announcement followed the visit of Nigeria 's president , Olusegun Obasanjo , to discuss the offer , ahead of a team of US military planners who are due to arrive today to assess America 's role in a peacekeeping force in the war - torn nation .
After talks at Monrovia airport Mr Taylor and Mr Obasanjo warned that too hasty a departure could spark new fighting in Liberia , where hundreds died in a failed rebel push into the capital in June .
Mr Taylor said : "" I thank my big brother for coming .
He has extended an invitation and we have accepted an invitation . ""
But he added , "" It is not unreasonable to request that there be an orderly exit from power . ""
He said US participation in an peacekeeping force planned for Liberia was "" crucial "" .
Mr Obasanjo said : "" We believe the exit should not take place in confusion ... in a way that will lead to more bloodshed .
We believe the transition should be orderly and peaceful . ""
It should take place "" in a very , very short time "" .
Mr Taylor has been indicted for war crimes by the international tribunal in neighbouring Sierra Leone , for his role in arming and commanding Sierra Leone 's defunct rebels .
The court told Reuters last night that it would pursue Mr Taylor even if he went to Nigeria .
Nigeria is a member of the tribunal 's management committee , but is thought to have promised not to extradite Mr Taylor to the court .
Nigeria 's offer is thought to have been made under US pressure , after George Bush said America would not intervene in Liberia while Mr Taylor remained in power .
Last night the main rebel faction , Liberians United for Reconciliation and Democracy , remained sceptical that Mr Taylor would go .
In Washington , the chairman of the Senate armed services committee said yesterday that the US Congress should vote before any American troops were sent to Liberia .
"" It 's a presidential decision , but ... I would want a vote in the Congress before we begin to commit substantial forces into that region , "" said Republican John Warner of Virginia ."
"The Archbishop of Monrovia , on a diplomatic visit to London , called on Tony Blair yesterday to help persuade the Americans to send a peace - keeping force to Liberia .
After meetings at the Foreign Office Archbishop Michael Francis said that the ceasefire between the rebel forces encircling Monrovia , the capital , and the militia backing President Charles Taylor was in imminent danger of breaking down .
"" I hope Mr Blair will bring up the Liberian situation with Mr Bush during his visit to Washington . ""
Renewed fighting north of Monrovia yesterday sent more people fleeing to the capital , whose population has already been swollen from 900,000 to 1.5 m by refugees from the previous fighting .
Starvation and cholera have added to their misery .
Britain has supported calls for an international peacekeeping force to end the decades of coups and civil wars .
The US has sent a 31-strong military assessment team but has not yet committed itself to sending a peacekeeping force .
Liberia , founded by freed US slaves in the 19th century , has historically retained close ties with Washington .
Other West African states are expected to send peacekeeping contingents in the coming weeks ."
"Rebels renewed their assault on the Liberian capital , Monrovia , at the weekend , sending thousands of civilians fleeing and shattering the fragile ceasefire before peacekeepers arrive .
They took a bridge in the western suburbs about three miles from the city centre .
Speaking from the balcony of his mansion , President Charles Taylor said his forces would fight to the last man .
But the rebels , armed with mortars and heavy machine guns , encountered only light resistance yesterday , and they now control the port and northern districts .
Mr Taylor , who is wanted for war crimes in Sierra Leone , has accepted a Nigerian offer of asylum , but says he will go only after peace keepers arrive .
The rebels fear he will stay and try to use the presence of foreign soldiers to cling to power .
A spokesman for the main rebel group , Liberians United for Reconciliation and Democracy , said the offensive was a response to provocation and not an attempt to seize the city .
Delegates meeting in Ghana are expected to decide today whether to accept a peace plan which would pave the way for an outside force of African troops ."
"Liberian rebels took control of a key bridge in the capital , Monrovia , yesterday before being beaten back by government troops .
The move by the rebel Liberians United for Reconciliation and Democracy aimed to cut off President Charles Taylor 's remaining forces from their supply bases .
As the fighting raged , the economic community of west African states , Ecowas , promised to send 1,300 Nigerian troops as the first part of a larger regional peacekeeping force .
Hundreds of people have been killed in fighting in the city this week and aid agencies are warning of a humanitarian disaster as they try to help some 250,000 people who have fled the war - torn areas of the capital .
Civilians have fled the northern suburbs as government forces fought to repel the rebel advance across Stockton Creek bridge .
Aid workers , cut off by the fighting from the city 's cemeteries , buried victims on Monrovia 's beaches .
Many more corpses still lay in the streets .
Street hawkers near the US embassy , where at least 10,000 people were seeking refuge , were selling cups of flour and cornmeal stolen from the World Food Programme .
Merchants said that troops had looted the bags from warehouses in the port .
Among the crowd were dozens of people in wheelchairs .
Gathered in front of the US embassy , they chanted : "" We want food !
We want food ! ""
Aid agencies said they were logging 350 new cholera cases a week , but expected the epidemic to surge .
Rebels have occupied the district with a European Union - run water plant .
With no running water since Saturday , Monrovians are depending on too few wells , many of which are contaminated .
The rebel fighters pledged that they would press on and force Mr Taylor to leave the country in this their third assault on the capital in two months .
Mr Taylor , who is wanted by an international war crimes tribunal in Sierra Leone for atrocities allegedly committed by his forces during the country 's 1996 - 2001 civil war , said on Tuesday that he would step down and take up Nigeria 's offer of asylum .
Such a move would set in motion a plan which includes an international peacekeeping force and possibly fresh elections .
Yesterday , in Accra , Ghana , one of Mr Taylor 's top aides pledged that the embattled former warlord would leave the day that Nigerian troops arrive .
"" When the interposition force arrives , Mr Taylor will leave , "" Lewis Brown said .
Mr Taylor 's repeated pledges to cede power have been dismissed by the rebels as a bluff .
President George Bush has said that a limited American force might bring stability , but only after Mr Taylor is gone .
Swiss authorities said yesterday that they had frozen £ 913,000 in bank accounts linked to Mr Taylor 's associates .
The move followed a request from the war crimes tribunal in Sierra Leone .
The Rev Jesse Jackson , a former US envoy to Africa , told the BBC yesterday : "" Liberia 's been a long - time ally , and we are on the verge of betraying Liberia for a second time . ""
The silence of secretary [ Colin ] Powell , security chief
[ Condoleezza ] Rice and Mr Bush is deafening . """
"Renewed shelling today plunged the Liberian capital , Monrovia , into a state of terror and killed 11 civilians , including several children .
Heavy shelling hit the diplomatic neighbourhood around the US embassy , where thousands of refugees have taken shelter from the rebel forces fighting to wrest power from Liberia 's controversial president , Charles Taylor .
The rebels and government forces have each accused the other of shelling the densely populated city .
The rebels have now pushed government forces into Monrovia 's downtown , Mr Taylor 's final stronghold after a three - year campaign to oust him .
The defence minister , Daniel Chea , said today that rebels had retaken the strategic Stockton bridge overnight .
The bridge is one of three key crossings fought over since Saturday .
Government forces briefly had taken the bridge today , for the first time in the latest rebel attack on Monrovia .
Fifteen to 20 shells hit within 10 minutes at the height of the attack , sending residents of downtown and the blocks around the heavily fortified embassy compound running for cover .
One shell early in the attack landed near two boys who stood brushing their teeth in a yard near the embassy , killing both .
Their bodies lay with those of two other victims at a Médecins Sans Frontières clinic .
Blocks away from the embassy , a schoolyard where hundreds of war - displaced people have crowded took a direct hit .
Refugees there said the shell had killed seven , and wounded at least a dozen .
At the school , wailing crowds surrounded the bodies of five victims , already in white body bags an hour after the main attack .
Weeping uncontrollably , one woman cradling a two - week - old baby stood next to a body bag holding her sister , the child 's mother .
A sixth body , that of a boy in his early teens , lay curled in a corner . ""
What do they want to achieve ? "" cried Peter Garwah , 27 , at the school .
"" Innocent people are dying , not soldiers . ""
A fresh attack after the main one sent sobbing , terrified survivors running for cover , crouching under schoolhouse tables and pressing up against classroom walls , screaming .
The full casualty toll was still being assessed .
Witnesses said two shells struck the nearby compound of Radio Veritas , a Catholic - run radio station that over the years has been outspoken against President Charles Taylor .
Angry residents flooded the streets after the main attack to plead for help from the US , which has yet to announce any participation in a west African - led peace force for this American - founded nation .
"" I want to tell George Bush to do something hurriedly , very fast and quickly , "" Emmanuel Sieh , 28 , said .
"" People are dying every day . ""
A woman wrapped in white stood before the embassy , swaying , arms raised beseechingly in the air .
"" We 're tired !
We 're tired ! ""
she cried .
Rebels have tried to press across the bridges on their drive to downtown , while government forces have battled to cross over and encircle the rebels and drive them from the city 's port .
Insurgents launched their third attack in two months on the capital on Saturday .
Fighting since then has killed hundreds of people .
Monday 's shelling had marked the heaviest day of fighting since June , and claimed heavy casualties .
Mr Taylor , a warlord - turned - president behind 14 years of near - perpetual conflict in Liberia , has promised to step down when foreign peacekeepers arrive .
But Mr Taylor has repeatedly hedged on promises to cede power since June ."
"George Bush yesterday bowed to international pressure and deployed US troops to the coast of Liberia in support of a west African peacekeeping mission in the wartorn country .
Shells , mortars and gunfire ripped through the Liberian capital on a seventh day of fighting , as rebels continued to press the forces of President Charles Taylor .
More than two dozen people were killed and many more wounded by a mortar barrage near the US embassy in the capital , Monrovia .
Mr Bush has faced loud calls from within Liberia and the international community to intervene .
But he is wary of spreading the US army too thinly and engaging soldiers in another bloody , politically unattractive conflict from which retreat might prove difficult .
"" We are deeply concerned the condition of the Liberian people is getting worse and worse and worse , "" Mr Bush said yesterday .
"" Today , I did or der our military , in limited numbers , to head into the area to help prepare the arrival [ of African peacekeepers ] to relieve human suffering . ""
An amphibious assault group - including the helicopter carrier USS Iwo Jima , two other warships and 2,300 marines - is gathering in the Mediterranean .
Pentagon sources said the president had ordered the group to sail to the coast of Liberia .
The US navy said yesterday that one of the three ships had yet to pass through the Suez canal .
The Pentagon sources said the ships were seven to 10 days ' sailing time from Liberia .
"" It takes about a week to get there , "" one said .
The White House appeared to be keeping its options open .
Mr Bush stopped short of saying the troops would actively participate in the mission , and the White House has said it will not put troops on the ground until Mr Taylor has gone and a ceasefire is in place .
The current plan is to provide logistics , communication and other non - combat support .
With growing disquiet in the US as troops are killed in Iraq on a daily basis , the Pentagon stressed that this was a limited mission , with an exit plan .
Talks are going on with the UN to ensure US peacekeepers will be replaced within four months .
In a written statement , the White House spokesman , Scott McClellan , said : "" The US role will be limited in time and scope as multinational forces under the United Nations assume the responsibility for peacekeeping . ""
The US has historical ties to Liberia , which was founded by former American slaves .
Yesterday 's fighting in Monrovia was concentrated near the fortified US embassy , causing casualties among the thousands of residents gathered in its vicinity for protection .
Several children were among the dead after heavy shelling .
The government and the Liberians United for Reconciliation and Democracy rebels blame each other for shelling residential areas .
Residents swarmed on to the streets after the main attack to plead for help from the US .
Emmanuel Sieh , 28 , said : "" I want to tell George Bush to do something hurriedly , very fast ...
people are dying every day .
"" More than 200,000 of the city 's residents are threatened by the violence and are cut off from clean water .
Aid agencies say an outbreak of cholera is imminent , and urge the quick deployment of US forces .
The Nigerian force , to be bolstered by other African troops , is intended to establish a "" zone of separation "" between the warring factions , providing a secure environment for relief agencies and preparing the way for a force of 3,000 to 5,000 peacekeepers by September 19 .
It is hoped the first Nigerian troops will arrive on August 2 .
Liberia 's special envoy to the UN , Jacques Klein , said : "" We stand between two options : hope and disaster .
Hope that we quickly move troops in , stop the killing , and stabilise the situation ; disaster if nothing is done . """
"The main rebel force in Liberia today declared a unilateral ceasefire and said it would pull its troops back to Monrovia 's port until west African peacekeepers arrived .
A spokesman for the Liberians United for Reconciliation and Democracy ( Lurd ) delegation at peace talks in Ghana told Reuters the ceasefire would last at least 48 hours , and could be extended to seven days pending the arrival of peacekeeping troops .
Lurd rebels have been battling government forces loyal to President Charles Taylor in the capital Monrovia for the past 11 days .
The ceasefire is the fourth such truce declared by the group since a June 17 peace deal that was supposed to halt fighting .
Previous ceasefires have not lasted long and heavy fighting has left hundreds dead in the capital . ""
The information about the ceasefire was delivered to the forces at six o'clock ( 0600 GMT ) this morning , "" the Lurd spokesman said .
"" We will pull our forces from the frontline ... and we will remain at the Freeport area pending the arrival of peacekeepers . ""
The move came as Nigeria said it had 1,500 peacekeeping troops on standby , and they could enter Liberia within a few days .
Lurd said that once the peacekeepers arrive , it would pull its forces back to the Po river , 7.5 miles from the outskirts of Monrovia .
"" We will stop fighting until the peacekeepers arrive , unless attacked by Taylor 's forces , "" Sekou Conneh , leader of Lurd , told Reuters by telephone .
Meanwhile , President Taylor 's forces launched a counterattack on Buchanan , Liberia 's second city , one day after it fell to the country 's second , smaller rebel group , Movement for Democracy in Liberia .
Military officials , speaking on condition of anonymity , reported a "" big fight "" in the city .
Rebels hold the port , cutting off warehouses filled with food from the increasingly hungry and disease - ridden population .
Aid workers said the loss of Buchanan , which had been the last significant port left in government hands , could intensify the humanitarian crisis .
"" Buchanan was the only alternative way to ship some food into Liberia .
Now - you can forget about it , "" Frederic Bardou said at a feeding center in Monrovia run by Action Contre la Faim , or Action Against Hunger ."
"Liberian rebels seized the city of Buchanan and attacked the town of Gbarnga yesterday in a two - pronged offensive which paved the way for intensified assaults on the capital , Monrovia .
President Charles Taylor 's regime buckled as the rebels made unexpected and apparently easy gains in the provinces as the battle for the capital entered its 10th day .
West African leaders and officials from the UN and US were last night expected to announce a date for a Nigerian - led force to intervene , but the rebels ' swift advance threatened to overtake the peacekeeping deployment .
General Benjamin Yeaten , a senior government commander , confirmed that Buchanan , a strategic port 60 miles southeast of Monrovia , had fallen to the Movement for Democracy in Liberia , the country 's second largest rebel group .
His forces would counter - attack , the general said , but residents reached by telephone were sceptical , saying that the rebels were in complete control of the city .
Analysts said the way was now clear for an all - out attack on Monrovia , where aid agencies estimate that more than 400 people have died in the past two weeks .
Conditions for the living have steadily worsened , with disease , hunger and thirst adding to the death toll .
"" We are hoping that the peacekeeping forces are coming this week to relieve us of this misery , "" the Rev Franklin Holt , president of Monrovia College , told the Associated Press .
As mortar shells landed nearby , he added : "" They [ the peacekeepers ] are very late .
Extremely late .
"" Monrovia is being attacked by the largest rebel force , Liberians United for Reconciliation and Democracy ( Lurd ) .
Having rejected a US appeal for a ceasefire on Sunday , the group tried to tighten the noose around the capital yesterday by crossing three bridges into government - held territory .
The army claimed to have pushed them back , but some reports said the rebels had managed to bypass Stockton bridge , which connects the rebel - held island port to the mainland .
For the city 's 1.3 million residents there is no front line behind which they can shelter , as both sides lob mortar shells into crowded neighbourhoods .
A rocket fired yesterday by government forces hit a house on the side of the city they are supposed to be defending , wounding eight civilians , according to aid workers .
"" People are just moving up and down , shedding tears , mourning their families .
The situation is not humanly comprehensible , "" said one aid worker , Patrick Broh .
West African leaders meeting in Accra , Ghana , said that months of dithering would end this week with the dispatch of peacekeepers .
But rumours that a vanguard force would arrive today were played down by the Nigerian brigadier general who will oversee the deployment .
Festus Okwonkwo told reporters that a deployment this week was "" unlikely "" .
Washington has sent three warships packed with marines but has not said whether the marines will go ashore .
The Pentagon hopes that the west African force will be enough to impose order .
The squabbles in Accra about funding and logistics have been compounded by the rebels ' refusal to stop shooting until the peacekeepers arrive .
Mr Taylor has refused to step down - the rebels ' main demand - until the foreign troops arrive , and his promise to accept an offer of asylum in Nigeria is taken with a pinch of salt .
Analysts worry that Lurd has no clear political agenda beyond removing him , and that the chaos could continue after he falls ."
"It 's business as usual for "" the US sitting offshore , without a UN mandate "" ( Leaders , July 29 ) .
Anyone experiencing a sense of deja vu should be forgiven , as the next "" humanitarian "" intervention is on the horizon .
However , timing is crucial : too soon and Liberia 's Charles Taylor is saved , legitimised and a thorn further embedded in the paw of the US .
Too late and there will be no sides left to separate , no rationale for an occupying force .
Last year the US invested around $ 10bn in the region , as companies moved to exploit the oil in the Guinea basin .
Its interests should be clear .
No doubt the cries for an American intervention emanate from the same individuals who backed a war to topple Saddam Hussein on "" humanitarian grounds "" .

"Leaders tell Taylor to go West African leaders meeting in Ghana have called for the deployment of a Nigerian vanguard peacekeeping force to Liberia by Monday at the latest , and the departure of President Charles Taylor within three days of that .
More than 1,000 people have died in fighting in the capital Monrovia in the past fortnight .

"Charles Taylor , Liberia 's indicted war criminal president , bears a great deal of responsibility for the murderous wars to have wracked not only his own country but also the neighbouring west African states of Sierra Leone , Ivory Coast and Guinea .
Taylor was elected president of Liberia in 1997 , by a people desperate for an end to the seven years of chaos and bloodshed that he initiated in 1989 .
He gained power after emerging victorious from Liberia 's brutal warlord battles of the early 90s and , by the time of the election , controlled the vast majority of the country .
Born in Liberia in 1948 , Taylor was one of 15 children of an Americo - Liberian father and a native Liberian mother .
He studied for a degree in economics in the US , and it was there that he became involved in radical Liberian and pan - African politics .
After completing his studies , he returned to Liberia .
At that time , the country had , since 1980 , been ruled by Samuel Doe .
The native Liberian had violently overthrown the regime of US - born president , William Tolbert .
Doe , who had had Tolbert disembowelled , claimed to represent the indigenous Liberian tribespeople that make up the vast majority of the population , but had been effectively ruled by freed US slaves who had returned to found the country in the 19th century .
Taylor , a Baptist preacher , took up a post in Doe 's government , but fled back to the US in fear of his life after falling foul of the dictator .
However , he soon returned to Africa , seeking power as well as revenge over Doe .
In 1989 , he emerged from the Libyan training camps with an invasion force , the National Patriotic Front of Liberia , that he launched against the regime from neighbouring Ivory Coast .
In 1990 , Doe was toppled , and was tortured , mutilated and murdered live on video by another warlord , Prince Johnson .
Also a preacher , Johnson was formerly an ally of Taylor 's , but became his chief rival in the ensuing seven - year civil war .
By the time of the 1996 ceasefire , with up to 200,000 people having died and several times as many displaced from their homes , Taylor 's forces controlled the whole of the country apart from the capital , Monrovia .
However , even before his presidential election victory in 1997 , Taylor had already began to turn his sights to neighbouring countries in an effort to widen his influence and plunder the natural resources that they , and especially diamond - rich Sierra Leone , could offer him .
As he amassed power in Liberia during the early 90s , Taylor used the control and export of the region 's plentiful resources to fund his armies .
This happened despite UN sanctions , an international arms embargo and recent international efforts to stem the sale of conflict diamonds ( rough diamonds sold to help fund armed combat ) .
Liberia itself is rich in diamonds , iron ore and timber , but , in a neat racket , Taylor had Sierra Leoneon diamonds smuggled over the border into Liberia throughout the 90s , where they were sold on the international market .
He then used part of the revenue to pay back Sierra Leoneon rebel leader Foday Sankoh , a close ally since they had trained alongside each other in Libya during the 80s , in guns .
Sankoh , who died last week while awaiting his war crimes trial in Sierra Leone , was heavily supported by Taylor in setting up the Revolutionary United Front ( RUF ) and starting his own civil war in Sierra Leone in 1991 .
In exchange for diamonds , Taylor gave Sankoh a Liberian base , arms and mercenaries .
And , as the RUF extended its control over the country and its eastern diamond fields , the deal became increasingly lucrative .
Sierra Leone 's war was one of Africa 's bloodiest and , when details of it emerged , they horrified the world .
It saw an army of brutalised child soldiers , in which tens of thousands of boys , many as young as five , were kidnapped , fed cocaine and forced by their RUF superiors to hack of the hands , arms or legs of men , women and children with machetes .
It saw tens of thousands of women and girls raped , abducted and forced to become soldiers ' wives .
It left up to 200,000 people dead , more than half the population displaced and tens of thousands of adults and children maimed or psychologically scarred for life .
For his part in the Sierra Leone atrocities , Taylor was indicted by the country 's UN - backed war crimes court on June 4 .
However , his intervention in regional affairs does not end with Sierra Leone .
His diamonds - for - arms trade has also equipped rebels from neighbouring Guinea , who launched a war against the regime of the ageing military leader , General Lansana Conte , in 1999 .
Further border raids and fighting were later controlled by ( mainly Nigerian ) peacekeepers , but Guinea is heavily strained by the huge numbers of refugees ( more than 700,000 ) to have sought shelter from the wars in Sierra Leone and Liberia .
The country is also rich in natural resources , including diamonds , and the pattern of conflict that has overwhelmed Liberia and Sierra Leone is now threatening to engulf it , too .
In September 2002 , war also broke out in Ivory Coast , when a failed coup inflamed ethnic divisions in the previously stable country .
The coup leader , Robert Guei , was soon killed , but was a close ally of Taylor , who is also no friend of Ivory Coast 's president , Laurent Gbagbo .
Two of the rebel groups in Ivory Coast , which now control much of the country , are believed to be backed by Taylor , and many of the fighters are Liberians .
Liberian mercenaries are now also reported to be fighting and looting their way around the Liberia / Ivory Coast border .
However , for Taylor , what goes around has , finally , come around .
In 1999 a rebel Liberian group , Liberians United for Reconciliation and Democracy ( Lurd ) launched a campaign against Taylor 's regime that is now in imminent danger of deposing him .
Now controlling the northern third of Liberia , Lurd is reportedly backed by Guinea , and based in Sierra Leone .
And earlier this year , an offshoot of Lurd emerged in the south - east of Liberia .
Called the Movement for Democracy in Liberia ( Model ) , it is apparently composed of Liberian refugees living in Ivory Coast , who were conscripted to fight against Taylor by President Gbago .
It is now advancing on Monrovia from the south .
So Taylor 's troops are now besieged in their last stronghold , Monrovia .
Surrounded on the north by Lurd forces , and on the south by rebel troops from Model , Taylor surely knows that his days as Liberian president are numbered .
He is under pressure from the US to step down and accept an offer of asylum from Nigeria .
However , he says that he will only leave when peacekeeping forces arrive in the country .
So Taylor could be contemplating an attempt to ride out the storm .
Due to a legal loophole , he may be immune from extradition and prosecution over Sierra Leoneon war crimes , if he accepts asylum in Nigeria .
Liberia 's powerful west African neighbour is keen to help defuse the current situation in the country by encouraging him to leave .
It is also possible that he could retreat to his former realm in the east of Liberia , and cling on for as long as he can in the country that he has systematically ruined ."
"What is the war about ?
Rebel forces backed by neighbouring countries are fighting to oust Liberia 's warlord - turned - president , Charles Taylor .
Two main rebel groups have succeeded in pinning Mr Taylor 's government into a final stronghold : the capital , Monrovia .
At least 1,000 civilians have died in the past two months of intense fighting .
One rebel leader said his group would surrender their positions to peacekeepers when they have secured the city .
The US has said it will not send in troops until Mr Taylor leaves .
Mr Taylor , who has accepted an offer of asylum from Nigeria , has agreed to step down on August 11 .
However his promise was conditional , and he may or may not cede power by that date .
Meanwhile , the rebels continue to press into Monrovia , and the government troops keep fighting to hold them back .
Residents and refugees in Monrovia are running out of food and clean water .
Why are the rebels trying to oust Mr Taylor ?
Mr Taylor 's financial support for rebel forces in Guinea , Ivory Coast , and Sierra Leone created enormous hardship in those countries .
The UN banned sales of diamonds from Liberia in 1990 , in an attempt to cut off Mr Taylor 's source of funds and thus limit the amount he could funnel to rebel insurrections in neighbouring countries .
His contributions to rebels in Sierra Leone fuelled a bitter civil war in that country .
His main ally , the Revolutionary United Front , has been accused of widespread torture and sexual assault .
In June , a UN - backed court indicted Mr Taylor for crimes against humanity during the civil war in Sierra Leone .
Guinea and Ivory Coast have similar complaints .
All three countries have repaid the favour by supporting rebels inside Liberia .
Who are the rebels ?
Two rebel groups from different tribal backgrounds now control most of Liberia .
The Liberians United for Reconciliation and Democracy ( Lurd ) grew out of Mr Taylor 's old foes from the 1990 - 1996 civil war .
Sheltered by Guinea and Sierra Leone , Lurd launched its attack on Monrovia after taking the northern third of the country .
The Movement for Democracy in Liberia ( Model ) , supported by Ivory Coast , emerged earlier this year and took the southern third of the country .
This group is also now closing on Monrovia .
Is the tension all down to external factors ?
No , there are underlying tensions in Liberia .
The African - Americans who founded the country in the early 1800s did not reconcile with the indigenous Africans .
The relatively small group of Americo - Liberians held power until 1980 , when Samuel Doe assassinated the serving American - descended president .
Mr Taylor 's father was Americo - Liberian and his mother an indigenous African .
Model and Lurd have differing ethnic memberships , which could contribute to tension .
How did it come to this ?
The country 's civil war began in 1989 , when Charles Taylor returned to Liberia from neighbouring Ivory Coast .
He brought with him a force of 100 rebels - the National Patriotic Front of Liberia - seeking to oust the repressive regime of the then - president , Samuel Doe .
A rival warlord , Prince Yormie Johnson , seized , tortured and executed Doe in front of video cameras in September 1990 .
But the demise of Doe 's corrupt , abusive regime failed to bring about stable democratic government .
Johnson and Mr Taylor turned on each other , plunging Liberia into seven years of civil war .
The west African peacekeeping force , Ecomog , eventually stepped in .
Mr Johnson accepted asylum in Nigeria , and Mr Taylor finally found himself in a position to hold elections in July 1997 , despite his failure to secure the entire country .
He took 75 % of the vote from a war - weary electorate desperate for an end to the violence .
One of Mr Taylor 's campaign slogans ran : "" He killed my Ma , he killed my Pa , but I will vote for him . ""
Just as Doe 's assassination brought only more war , Mr Taylor 's election failed to end the violence .
How many people have been killed in the conflict ?
Over the last 14 years of on - again , off - again fighting , around 200,000 Liberians have died .
Another 1.5 million have been forced to flee their homes .
Are any peacekeepers on the way ?
A West African peacekeeping force - expected eventually to total between 3,000 and 5,000 troops - is the vanguard .
Nigeria deployed an advance force of about 200 troops on August 4 to secure Monrovia 's airport and set up a base of operations .
The UN security council approved a multinational force on August 1 , with plans for UN peacekeepers to take over in few months .
But even if Mr Taylor leaves for Nigeria , as did Prince Johnson before him , peace will not necessarily follow .
There is no guarantee that the two main rebel factions in Liberia would not continue to fight each other .
Why has the US not sent troops to the country ?
Liberia was founded by former US slaves in 1847 , leading to calls that America has a special responsibility to protect the lives of Liberian civilians now .
So far the US has sent only a handful of troops to safeguard its embassy in Monrovia .
George Bush has ordered three ships to take up positions off Liberia 's coast , but has made no specific commitment to putting troops on the ground .
In 1990 , the administration of George Bush sr also deployed marines off the coast of Liberia .
They assisted with the evacuation of American citizens , but never came ashore for peacekeeping duties ."
"First the drugs , then the bullets and then the battle .
Jungle Fire battalion knew the routine and lounged on the abandoned market stalls , waiting for the marijuana and crack cocaine to kick in .
It was 4 pm and they had to take the bridge before nightfall with an all - out assault to push back the rebels and reclaim the port area of Monrovia , Liberia 's capital , for President Charles Taylor .
Waterside district was once the city 's trading hub but it was as dead as the decomposing body of the soldier on Merclin Street , the legs rotted , the chest a carcass , the arms missing and the skull gleaming white .
The flies preferred the three civilians further up the street : young men with holes in the head sprawled beside little green boxes of Chinese tea .
Executed for looting , said some members of Jungle Fire , felled by mortars , said others .
It did not seem to matter .
The battalion 's eyes reddened and some began giggling .
A 17-year - old calling himself War Black sprinted on the spot , euphoric .
His friend , General Death , 31 , issued orders to assemble but Richard Shakpeh , 28 , was not ready .
"" I 'm in charge .
I 'm deputy commanding general lance corporal of the ... "" he paused , thinking hard , "" of the 51st platoon section . ""
Liberia 's civil war , one of the continent 's most brutal , is to start ending today with the arrival of 300 Nigerian peacekeepers , the vanguard of a 5,000-strong west African force authorised last week by the UN security council .
Mr Taylor , pressured by Washington and regional leaders as well as the two rebel groups who control most of the country , has agreed to resign on August 11 .
Weeks of shelling and gunfire have reduced districts to charred rubble and killed hun dreds but Monrovia hopes that deliverance is at hand . ""
Minutes away from showtime , that 's where we 're at , "" grinned George Quaye , a taxi - driver .
But Liberia 's history may repeat itself , with peacekeepers sucked into a conflict which started in 1989 when the then warlord Charles Taylor started a bush rebellion which flared again after he was elected president in 1997 .
He has accepted an offer of asylum from Nigeria which should protect him from a war crimes indictment in Sierra Leone , but the orders given to Jungle Fire suggested he could be planning to stay and fight .
For weeks , Old Bridge was the frontline between the rebel - held port and Taylor - held city centre .
On Saturday evening , the president decided to end the stalemate in a grab for strategic territory before peacekeepers arrived . ""
Yes indeed , the time has come , "" whooped General Death , herding comrades up Merclin Street .
Rice was doled into grimy hands but the hunger was for the contents of the little white cardboard boxes which a commander , standing on a wooden crate , opened and threw into the air .
In puddles and in rubbish , his fighters scrabbled for bullets .
"" Ammo straight from the executive mansion , lots of it , "" smiled a fighter .
Watching scornfully from the back of a pick - up was a boy , no more than seven , whose AK-47 clip was already full .
Disappearing inside a motorcycle helmet , he banged the cabin roof and sped away .
According to Clausewitz 's Principles of War you could describe the battle in terms of forward rushes , supporting fire and tactical retreats but the macabre spectacle was closer to the principles of Barnum 's circus .
Seven youths broke cover and emptied their assault rifles in the direction of the other side , a collection of shacks hundreds of metres away .
The seven dashed back behind a wall , panting .
It was the turn of David Kollie , 12 , nicknamed Deputy , to lead the next wave .
He wore a red headband , a yellow T - shirt which said "" AK Baby , Man Moving , Man Dropping "" and a serene expression .
"" I eat the leaf , "" he said , "" but I can not disclose its nature because that is a military secret .
"" Then he was on the bridge , firing away and joined by older boys , some with women 's wigs and toenails painted blue .
On Merclin Street a teenager with a bayonet jigged to the rhythm .
It started to drizzle and some stripped off their T - shirts .
Return fire pinged overhead and on the ground , ricocheting and chipping masonry but of little concern to Benjamin Mulbeh , strolling for cover to the beat from his ghetto blaster .
Phase two of the attack was led by five young men with bandoliers and a very loud Chinese - made machine gun .
A man with a T - shirt emblazoned SSS , a special unit , roared at the others to follow and threatened executions .
In another part of the city another suspected SSS man carried out the threat but at Old Bridge there was no need : Jungle Fire emptied their guns towards the unseen enemy .
A youth accidentally discharged his AK-47 and a comrade hopped back , his shin bloodied .
Then , another casualty : a 15-year - old pulled his trousers down to his ankles to inspect a grazed thigh .
He seemed a child about to cry but the moment passed .
Phase three was a Toyota Land Cruiser mounted with a machine gun and seven men , greeted as rock stars .
Without warning they fired , deafening and scattering the admiring throng , then raced across the bridge .
They stopped about 20 metres from the other side and blazed at the enemy before reversing at top speed to offload a fighter hit in the belly .
For the next assault the SSS man found a more effective stick to prod Jungle Fire into action and about a dozen fight ers supported the Land Cruiser .
One boy , emotional from drugs or trauma , offered to lend a clump of white hair on a necklace , his juju charm . ""
This'll bullet - proof you , man , "" he said .
The rain was hard now and the rebels were replying with mortars but they landed far away , among the city 's 1.3 million civilians .
The number of dead was not known but the morgue at JFK hospital was full .
Staff treated more than 80 people , including a commander with a shattered leg whose men threatened to shoot any surgeon who amputated .
As dusk fell it was clear the bridge would not be taken and the sodden attackers retreated down the cartridge - strewn street .
The attack resumed last night but few expected a breakthrough from Mr Taylor 's lost souls .
Their childhoods plundered , all they could offer was sound and fury .
Save the Children UK said it was flying 30 tonnes of medical supplies , food and clothing for the people of Monrovia .

"The Liberian government has asked the world court to prevent Sierra Leone pursuing war crimes charges against Liberia 's embattled president , Charles Taylor .
According to a statement issued today by the International Court of Justice ( ICJ ) in the Netherlands , Liberia has asked it to order the immediate "" cancellation and/or withdrawal "" of an indictment and arrest warrant issued by Sierra Leone 's UN - backed war crimes court against Mr Taylor .
Its main contention is that President Taylor has immunity from prosecution as a head of state .
But an ICJ official said the court - the UN 's highest judicial body , which deals with disputes between nations , not individuals - could intervene only if the Sierra Leone government agrees .
The court 's secretary , Arthur Witteveen , said : "" The request by Liberia itself does not bring proceedings into existence .
There is no case as of this moment . ""
The Liberian submission has been passed to Sierra Leone for its response , Mr Witteveen told the Associated Press .
Mr Taylor was indicted by the Sierra Leone tribunal on March 7 2003 for his alleged backing of Sierra Leone rebels during the 1991 - 2001 civil war .
The rebels were infamous for hacking off limbs , ears and even lips to terrify and subdue civilians .
In its application to the world court , which was submitted yesterday , Liberia alleges that the arrest warrant "" violates a fundamental principle of international law providing for immunity from criminal proceedings [ in ] foreign criminal jurisdictions of an incumbent Head of State "" .
It also contends that "" [ a]n arrest warrant of a Head of State issued by a foreign jurisdiction is also inconsistent with the internationally recognised principle that foreign judicial powers or authority may not be exercised on the territory of another State . ""
The complaint was filed yesterday by Dutch attorney Michail Wladimiroff and British lawyer Steven Kay .
Both have been involved in the trial of the former Yugoslav president , Slobodan Milosevic , and other defendants at the Yugoslav war crimes tribunal based in The Hague .
The Special Court of Sierra Leone , an independent tribunal based in Freetown , was jointly established last year by the UN and the Sierra Leone government , and began issuing indictments this year .
It was created to try serious violations of international humanitarian law in Sierra Leone committed since 1996 .
Mr Taylor 's lawyers argue the tribunal is not a UN or international criminal court , but a Sierra Leone court , and therefore could fall under the jurisdiction of the world court .
Liberia 's capital , Monrovia , has been besieged by rebels since June , and under pressure from Washington and west African leaders , Mr Taylor has agreed to cede power following the arrival of Nigerian peacekeepers .
However , he now appears determined to ensure that he is protected against prosecution before he fulfils his pledge to take up asylum in Nigeria .
Rebels have refused to pull back from Monrovia until the former warlord leaves the country , although they have promised to return the city 's port to the peacekeepers in order to allow humanitarian aid to reach the country ."
"Crowds calling for his head , the American ambassador chatting up the rebels , helicopters disgorging foreign troops into the capital : you might think President Charles Taylor was having a bad week .
Quite the opposite .
Liberia 's big man gives the impression of savouring what others consider the crumbling of his regime .
The eyes of the world are exactly where he wants them , on him .
From Abuja to Washington his every utterance is analysed , for what he does next will determine the fate of his country and much of west Africa .
Headline writers call it his endgame , but this is a man who once sawed his way through the bars of a Massachusetts prison cell and shimmied down a knotted bedsheet to freedom .
Now Liberians hope it is their turn to escape from 14 years of war and anarchy which have killed hundreds of thousands and left the country a bombed - out ruin .
The siege of Monrovia is the culmination of a three - year insurgency by rebels with one objective : deposing the president .
"" We will fight Taylor until the last man drops , "" said Abdullah Seyeh Sheriff , the rebel chief of staff .
In the bowels of the executive mansion Mr Taylor considers his next move under the chandeliers .
But the vast rooms , all velvet and brocade , are stripped , like the rest of the country , of electricity .
Although he has agreed to leave on Monday and accept asylum in Nigeria , he is back at his old tricks : clouding his real intentions , suggesting that he may stay and rule behind the scenes after installing a crony as president , according to a western diplomat .
The Nigerian - led peacekeeping force of the west African community Ecowas began arriving this week , supported by US warships offshore , prompting jubilation by civilians and a lull in fighting between the rebels and the government forces .
Mr Taylor resisted pressure to leave before they came , and now they are in Monrovia he has a fresh deck of cards to play .
The chants of "" Taylor must go "" from the thousands lining the streets in rebel - held zones yesterday soon became "" No monkey "" , then "" Taylor must die "" .
Even his own forces , once famed for loyalty , show signs of turning .
"" If the president goes I 'll be happy .
I want my life back , "" said a young checkpoint commander calling himself Cairo Poo Poo .
Liberia was peaceful , stable and largely unnoticed until 1980 , when native Liberians , discriminated against by the descendants of the freed slaves who founded the country , bit back .
A group of soldiers disembowelled President William Tolbert in his bed and Samuel Doe , a semi - literate sergeant , became president .
Then Charles Taylor , the ambitious son of an Americo - Liberian father and a native Liberian mother who had paid his way to an economics degree at Bentley College , Massachusetts , by working as a security guard and petrol station mechanic , returned to Monrovia and became head of Doe 's procurement agency , allegedly by throwing the incumbent out of the office .
They called him "" Superglue "" , for money seemed to stick him .
Too much , it seems , because he was accused of embezzling $ 900,000 , and fled to the US .
While he was detained in Boston pending extradition to Liberia , friends in high places are rumoured to have helped organise his escape .
He made his way to Libya and was trained by Muammar Gadafy 's military instructors .
On Christmas Eve 1987 he crossed from Ivory Coast into eastern Liberia with 100 men and began a brutal insurgency which swept the countryside and took him to the gates of the capital .
It was a rival warlord , Prince Johnson , who captured and cut the ears off Doe , but it was Mr Taylor who emerged dominant after seven years of bloody fighting between factions and Nigerian peacekeepers .
The war - weary population voted overwhelmingly for him to take the presidency , in an election judged free and fair , on the grounds that the conflict would resume if he lost : an attitude expressed in the campaign jingle : "" He killed my pa , he killed my ma , I 'll vote for him . ""
In a pre - election interview he admitted his responsibility .
"" I agree I spoiled it and I need to be given the chance to fix it , "" he said .
If that was a glimpse of a man seeking redemption , something went horribly wrong , because five years later it is the entire region which needs fixing .
A blend of terror and extortion sponsored rebellions in Sierra Leone , Guinea and Ivory Coast which left their populations murdered , mutilated and raped and Mr Taylor very , very rich .
Minerals , especially diamonds , and timber poured hundreds of millions of dol lars , some say billions , into his bank accounts .
They deny it , but Guinea and Ivory Coast are suspected of sponsoring the two rebel groups which now control most of Liberia .
That Mr Taylor still holds the initiative shows tactical skill .
Will he follow the Ugandan Idi Amin and the Ethiopian Mengistu Haile Mariam into air - conditioned exile ?
According to his international envoy , Samuel Jackson , he wants to retire to his cocoa farm , convert his Congo Town residence into a presidential library and write his memoirs .
Talking to reporters last week on the steps of the Executive Mansion , the man who refers to himself in the third person grinned as he played with questions about what would happen next .
That was a matter for the presidential self to decide ."
"Helicopters dropped the first US troops into Liberia yesterday , but President George Bush warned that a larger force would not follow the seven marines until the Liberian president , Charles Taylor , had left the country .
Mr Taylor is expected to formally announce his intention to resign today , following a pledge to leave this Monday .
Asked whether Mr Taylor 's departure was a condition for a larger US deployment , Mr Bush said : "" Yeah , we would like Taylor out . ""
Mr Taylor , meanwhile , has appealed to the international court of justice in the Hague to lift the war crimes indictment brought against him by the UN - backed special court in neighbouring Sierra Leone .
His lawyers said the warrant for his arrest violated "" customary international law "" .
The ICJ rules on disputes between states .
Mr Taylor has said that he will go into exile in Nigeria only when the war crimes charges are annulled .
The war crimes court in Sierra Leone indicted him for crimes against humanity this year , accusing him of backing and arming the Revolutionary United Front ( Ruf ) in the civil war between 1991 and 2001 which ended in Ruf 's defeat .
Ruf was accused of cutting off the hands and feet of its victims .
At least 50,000 people were killed .
Mr Taylor is held to have prolonged the misery by supplying the RUF with arms in return for diamonds .
His lawyers argue that as an incumbent head of state the president should have immunity from such charges , that Sierra Leone has no jurisdiction in Liberia , and that the Sierra Leone court is not an official UN or international court .
Sierra Leone must accept the ICJ 's jurisdiction .
The first seven US marines dropped into Liberia from the ships stationed offshore were described as part of a "" liaison element "" to provide logistical support for the West African peacekeepers .
The US has a taskforce of about 2,300 marines off the coast , but the White House has been reluctant to involve its forces directly in Liberia .
They are already stretched by their commitments in Iraq and Afghanistan and other global missions .
And Washington remembers the US peacekeeping nightmare in Somalia a decade ago , when it pulled its troops out after 18 were killed in an October 1993 battle with militia fighters , and the corpses of some of their soldiers were dragged by mobs through the capital , Mogadishu .
But the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff , General Richard Myers , said on Tuesday that any US involvement in Liberia would not fail .
"" I do n't know who 's talking about Somalia .
This is not the same situation , "" he said at a briefing in the Pentagon .
Last night the UN asked member governments to donate £ 42.8 m in emergency aid to provide food , clean water and shelter for a million people in Liberia .
"" This is a country that is desperately in need , "" Jacques Paul Klein , UN secretary - general Kofi Annan 's special envoy for Liberia , told a meeting of 50 donor countries ."
"Liberian rebels and government soldiers , some aged 12 or even younger , are assaulting thousands of girls and women under the cover of war , aid workers said yesterday .
More than 600 rapes have been documented in Monrovia since July , but that is thought to be a small fraction of the real figure .
The victims say that as President Charles Taylor 's regime has crumbled , fighters on both sides have treated the female civilian population as booty , thinking it may be their last chance to exploit the anarchy before the peacekeepers arrive .
Those attacked have been aged between eight and 65 .
But what some medical professionals have found more shocking is that many of the perpetrators have been soldiers aged 12 or younger .
Many of the assaults have been accompanied by the murder of male relatives .
Unlike the mass rapes in Sierra Leone and Rwanda , where armed groups used sexual assault as a strategy to terrorise and ethnically cleanse civilian populations , those in Libera seem to be opportunistic rather than systematic .
Nigerian peacekeepers were cheered and kissed when they patrolled the centre of Monrovia for the first time yesterday .
But it will be weeks before the stabilisation force is at its planned strength of 3,250 and even then many civilians fear they will remain vulnerable .
Three years of civil war and two months of siege have left Monrovia a smoking ruin , the streets littered with shell casings and hundreds of thousands of homeless people crowded into disused warehouses and factories .
In theory government militias and rebel groups control various zones , but in reality the capital is lawless , at the mercy of the whims of those with rifles .
The fighting has tapered off this week as both sides respect a ceasefire , but uncertainty about what will happen after President Taylor steps down on Monday has encouraged a frenzy of rape , aid workers said .
"" They are on the rampage , especially the government side , because they think this might be their last chance , "" said Mariama Brown , director of the Concerned Christian Community , which counsels women .
Since 1994 - four years after conflict engulfed Liberia - CCC has counselled about 1,000 rape victims each year .
But in the past few weeks 626 girls and women have come forward .
CCC , which is funded by the UN and by Dutch , German and US churches , suspects that thousands have been raped recently but have not sought help because mortars and stray bullets make it too dangerous to venture outdoors .
According to CCC , one of this week 's cases involved soldiers who raped a woman and then her 10-year - old daughter Nana , who died during the attack .
It was the girl 's birthday .
Nana 's 12-year - old friend , who was forced to perform oral sex , survived but has not been able to stop crying .
In a separate incident a 16-year - old was shot in the foot when she tried to resist , and surgeons had to amputate the leg below the knee .
Hawa Foday , 53 , says she was attacked in June by two rebels and then in July by two government soldiers .
"" They asked , did I want to die or did I want to have sex with them . ""
Five men had raped her in 2001 , she said .
Those who carried out the more recent attack took her clothes , shoes and transistor radio .
Mrs Foday has kept the instruction booklet for the radio carefully wrapped in a plastic bag .
"" It 's all I 've got left , "" she says .
Sitting next to her on a bamboo bench outside Monrovia 's football stadium , at present the home of more than 50,000 displaced people , was Jenneh Brown , 30 .
Last month rebels from the Liberians United for Reconciliation and Democracy ( Lurd ) raided the house where she and two other women were sheltering from shelling .
"" They raped me eight times ; the others I do n't know how many times , "" she said .
Her husband , Boima , has left her . ""
He says I 'm no use now , "" she said .
Given the stigma , she does not blame him .
Esther Macauley , 40 , was gang - raped by Lurd fighters in front of her four children after being captured in an ambush .
She lost count of the rapes after five , but remembers that the rapists were young : "" small baby men "" .
They disembowelled her husband .
"" They said they were looking inside for Charles Taylor . ""
Civilians in the rebel - held areas of Monrovia say that the rapes and murders did taper off as Lurd attempted to show discipline recently .
Government troops , too , executed four comrades accused of rape last month - crowds cheered when the corpses were dumped on the streets - but it was a rare outbreak of discipline .
Many checkpoints are commanded by the likes of "" General "" David Passane , 22 .
"" We take good care of civilians , they are our citizens , "" he says - but his voice is slurred from alcohol and his soldiers were using marijuana .
Over the course of the war each side was as bad as the other , according to CCC , but in this phase President Taylor 's forces have been worse .
"" It 's not the regular army , it 's the militias , "" said Ms Brown , who has been subject to death threats for highlighting the problem .
Bindu Hagar , 46 , gang - raped twice in separate incidents by boys in their mid - teens , said they ordered her to laugh and say "" fine "" when asked how it was .
What shook her most was that some of the same boys raped her 15-year - old daughter : to Liberians it is taboo for any man to have sex with both a mother and daughter .
"" We are cursed , "" Mrs Hagar said .
Alice Kpaku 's composure dissolved the moment she tried to explain how it felt to watch a husband have a cigarette popped in his mouth as he is disembowelled .
Later they tied her ankles to stakes and stabbed her in the right thigh when she struggled .
"" I have no hope in life , "" she says .
"" I have no one left .
Oh comfort me , Jesus . """
"He began with dreams of an empire , but in his final hours Charles Taylor is little more than President of the republic of downtown Monrovia .
Taylor 's 14-year career as one of Africa 's big men is due to end at 11.59am tomorrow , when he bows to his enemies and cedes power .
He plans to address the nation today , but there is no electricity and , in any case , most televisions and radios are destroyed or looted .
But the Liberian leader could just as well shout from the balcony of his Executive Mansion , since much of his domain would be within earshot .
Lurdland , the territory controlled by the rebel Liberians United for Reconciliation and Democracy ( Lurd ) , begins a stone 's throw from central Monrovia .
Yesterday , council workers cleared weeds from a street that had seen the apocalypse , the buildings blackened shells , the cars rusting carcasses .
It was an incongruous attempt at normality , which the crowds of refugees foraging for snails and flower bulbs - anything edible - watched in disbelief .
Taylor 's resignation may not signal the end of his era , because the fragile ceasefire hinges on his promise to leave the country .
Fresh arms shipments from Libya suggest that he could be preparing for a fight .
The Presidents of South Africa and Nigeria are expected to fly into Monrovia to try to coax Taylor , 55 , to the air - conditioned house in Nigeria that has been earmarked for his exile .
But that might not be enough to prevent more fighting .
The rebels reject the designated successor , Vice - President Moses Blah . '
Tell me the difference between Taylor and Blah .
They are the same .
If Blah takes over , we will fight back , ' said Sekou Fofana , a top Lurd official .
The rebels spent three years fighting in the bush and for two months they have besieged the capital , launching three onslaughts that the traumatised residents call world wars one , two and three .
Some 2,000 civilians died : the survivors are battling hunger and cholera .
The arrival of a Nigerian - led peacekeeping force last week silenced Monrovia 's guns and unleashed jubilation , but fighting continues in the towns of Buchanan and Gbarnga .
Vaani Passawe , Taylor 's spokesman , issued a stark warning : ' Once the President leaves , our boys might be stigmatised .
If that is the case , you must expect chaos .
Hell might just break loose . '
With Taylor still holding the initiative , anything could happen .
It usually does .
Anarchy started in 1989 when Taylor launched a bush rebellion that evolved into civil war .
After 200,000 deaths , an exhausted electorate , fearing more bloodshed if he lost , voted him President in 1997 .
The new President 's dreams involved money and influence rather than territorial conquest .
Accused of sponsoring insurgencies in Sierra Leone , Guinea and Ivory Coast , he amassed hundreds of millions of dollars through diamonds and timber .
The Swiss bank accounts are frozen and now he has rebels at his gates .
His family was yesterday rumoured to be preparing to flee to Johannesburg .
Monrovia has been devastated .
Taylor has cancelled interviews because , his aides say , the Executive Mansion has no diesel for generators .
Nor does the Liberian Communications Network , the television and radio stations he founded .
Yesterday staff lounged on the grass outside the studios , wondering what happens next . '
When Taylor leaves , we 'll not have the kind of support that we have been getting , ' said Jimmy Wessehtues , programmes director .
An understatement .
When Taylor leaves , the network risks the sort of mobs that ransacked Milosevic 's television station in Belgrade .
Taylor 's fighters , many having spent their childhood in his army , are bracing for uncertainty . '
General ' Cairo Pupu , 29 , a checkpoint commander in a black velvet jumpsuit whose hair twirls into a cone , professed eternal loyalty : ' He is my leader .
I 'll cry like a baby the day he leaves . '
But , out of his comrades ' earshot , he says : ' When Taylor goes , I 'll be happy .
I want my life back . '
The rebels in Lurdland are also looking ahead .
As their leader , Seko Damate Conneh , toured Europe last week , they showed journalists around the areas they control , a moonscape of destruction .
Crowds chanted support and commanders politely asked photographers not to show child fighters smaller than their AK-47s .
It did not occur to them that leaving streets littered with naked corpses , their hands bound , was not the best way to shake off a reputation for atrocities .
Yesterday the bodies were still there , but had been covered in a white powder , as if they died rolling in flour .
The putrefying corpses on Taylor 's side have been buried , some in mass graves like the sandy pit at Sheflin barracks into which 65 dead men , women and children were dumped last week .
Aid trickles rather than streams into Monrovia , but , for the 450 orphans evicted from Daniel Hoover Children 's Village , a little helps .
Their bicycles , clothes and food having been stolen by rebels , their home sequestered by Taylor 's forces , they walked for two days without food until finding sanctuary in an abandoned three - storey government office where Taylor briefly worked in the 1980s .
Handful Harris , 14 , shepherded two of the younger children to safety .
Born the year Taylor started his rebellion and with both her parents lost to the war , Handful 's dream was for the peace to hold and to return to the orphanage . '
And , ' she added , ' to practise my singing again . '"
"It has been an eventful summer for Moses Blah , who entered it as Liberia 's vice - president .
At the beginning of June he was under arrest accused of attempting to mount a coup against President Charles Tayor .
Just over two months later he is to succeed him .
His rise to the top of the government is the result of the heavily negotiated terms and conditions under which Mr Taylor - who virtually no one wanted to remain in office - agreed to resign .
But it is not an especially great promotion for the 56-year - old : the Liberian government has lost most of Liberia to rebel militias and Mr Blah will , in effect , be president of the government - held areas of the capital .
One of the old guard , he will inevitably be associated with a regime that exported war and is blamed for much of the chaos in Sierra Leone , Guinea and Ivory Coast .
He also shares much of his past with the man he succeeds - the two trained in Libyan guerrilla camps in the 1980s before Mr Taylor launched his 1989 rebellion against then president Samuel Doe .
After a six - year civil war , which saw Mr Blah gain the reputation of a feared general , Mr Taylor was elected president in 1997 .
One campaign slogan ran "" He killed my Ma , he killed my Pa , but I will vote for him . ""
The death of Mr Taylor 's first vice - president , Enoch Dogolea , in 2000 saw Mr Blah return from being ambassador to Libya to take the job .
As vice - president , he ditched his general 's uniform in favour of African robes and drove himself around in a jeep rather than travelling in motorcades .
He has spoken of his wish for exiles to return to rebuild the shattered country and suggested a new start can be made . ""
Let bygones be bygones .
If there is power , we can share it , "" he recently told the Associated Press .
Mr Blah 's arrest this summer apart , the present and previous presidents are considered firm allies .
Their split , which now appears to have healed , came on Mr Taylor 's return from peace talks in Ghana .
He fled home after the UN special court in Sierra Leone indicted him for war crimes to accuse Mr Blah and 30 other senior government figures of conspiring with the US to oust him .
Some tensions may remain but the closeness between the two men presents a problem for the leaders of Liberia 's two main rebel groups since Mr Blah is not the neutral candidate they want to see heading a transitional administration ; some have accused him outright of being a proxy .
Sekou Fofana , a senior member of Liberians United for Reconciliation and Democracy , the group who have made repeated assaults on the capital , was reported to have said that "" [ They ] are the same .
If Blah takes over , we will fight back "" .
It is perhaps with such such statements in mind that the president of Ghana , John Kufuor , also chairman of the west African community Ecowas , attempted to limit political - and military - fallout from the appointment with his announcement today that Mr Blah will serve in office until an interim government is established in October .
But only the events of the next weeks will determine if the departure of Mr Taylor and arrival of peacekeepers is , for now , enough to end the conflict in Liberia and start what will be its inevitably long recovery ."
"Charles Taylor , Liberia 's warlord president , finally stepped down today , prompting one rebel group to declare the country 's war over .
Mr Taylor resigned a tense two and half hours after the time he had appointed - 11.59GMT today .
He had been delayed at the airport , where he was welcoming dignitaries including the South African president , Thabo Mbeki , and the Ghanaian president , John Kufuor , to the handing - over ceremony .
He eventually ceded power to his vice president , Moses Blah , at 2.30GMT ( 3.30BST ) .
Sekou Fofana , a rebel leader of Liberians United for Reconciliation and Democracy ( Lurd ) , immediately promised an end to fighting if Mr Taylor now left the country as planned .
Mr Taylor has accepted an offer of asylum from Nigeria .
"" For us in Lurd , the war is over .
Once he leaves Liberia today we are not going to fight .
The suffering of Liberians is over , "" Mr Fofana said .
Dressed in a white safari suit and holding his trademark staff , Mr Taylor - who plunged Liberia into 14 years of war with a 1989 insurgency - said that history would forgive him . ""
History will be kind to me .
I have fulfilled my duties , "" he said , adding : "" I have accepted this role as the sacrificial lamb ...
I am the whipping boy . ""
Mr Taylor looked on as Mr Blah was sworn in .
Placing his left hand on the bible and raising his right , Mr Blah pledged to "" faithfully , conscientiously and impartially discharge the duties and functions of the Republic of Liberia "" .
Mr Blah began his presidency with a moment of silence for all those have died in Liberia 's wars . ""
Let the nation begin to heal , "" he said .
"" Let all of us unite as one people and work to peace . ""
Mr Kufuor announced that Mr Blah will remain in power until the second Tuesday in October . ""
Moses Blah , then president , will hand over power to the leadership of the national transitional government of Liberia , which will have been negotiated and appointed at the Accra conference over the next few weeks , "" Mr Kufuor said .
Liberian politicians have been meeting in Ghana 's capital , Accra , to try to negotiate a comprehensive peace deal .
Mr Blah today waited with Liberian and regional officials for Mr Taylor to arrive at a velvet - draped room in his heavily - guarded mansion which , like the rest of the capital , Monrovia , is without electricity .
Outside , Monrovia 's beleaguered people cheered Nigerian peacekeepers , part of a vanguard peace force of west African soldiers that is eventually meant to include 3,250 troops .
However , they refrained from celebrating the former warlord 's resignation until it was official .
"" I can hardly believe it .
He has brought too much suffering on the Liberian people , "" Henry Philips , a 38-year - old former security official , said .
"" His absence is better than his presence . ""
Many of the undisciplined , often - drugged government fighters who had previously patrolled the area appeared to have slipped away into the city with their weapons .
Rebels have rejected Mr Taylor 's choice of Mr Blah , who is a long - time ally and comrade in arms , as successor , and demanded that a neutral candidate be chosen to preside over a transition government until elections can be held .
Today , pickup trucks full of armed rebels raced toward the front as insurgents threatened to resume fighting if Mr Taylor stays in the country after stepping down from power .
The Nigerian president , Olusegun Obasanjo , was not attending Mr Taylor 's resignation , but sent his foreign minister .
Aides said that Mr Taylor was expected in the Nigerian capital , Abuja , today .
Two months of intermittent rebel sieges have left over 1,000 civilians in Monrovia dead as government and insurgent forces duel , with the city , which has a population of 1.3 million , as their battlefield .
The war has left Mr Taylor 's government controlling little but downtown , which rebels derisively refer to as Taylor 's "" federal republic of central Monrovia "" .
Under mounting pressure from the US and west African , nations , Mr Taylor promised to leave power today .
However , he remained defiant in a farewell address to the nation yesterday , declaring himself "" the sacrificial lamb "" to end what he said was a US - backed rebel war against his besieged regime .
He called the uprising an "" American war "" and suggested that it was motivated by US eagerness for Liberia 's gold , diamonds and other reserves .
"" They can call off their dogs now , "" Mr Taylor said of the alleged US support of Lurd .
"" We can have peace . ""
Mr Taylor was elected president in 1997 , on threats of plunging the country into renewed bloodshed .
Rebels , including some of Mr Taylor 's rivals from the previous war , took up arms against him two years later .
Rights groups and Liberia 's people accuse Mr Taylor 's ragtag forces of routine rape , robbery , torture , forced labour and summary killing .
Rebels , to a lesser extent so far , are likewise accused of abuse ."
"One of Africa 's most brutal regimes is due to end today when Charles Taylor steps down as president of Liberia , giving a war - ravaged region a fragile opportunity for peace .
Mr Taylor has promised to hand over power at 11.59am and head into exile , raising hopes that west Africa can escape a decade - long cycle of violence and instability .
The warlord - turned president has bowed to pressure from the international community as well as rebels who control most of the countryside and much of the capital , Monrovia .
In a televised address last night he said he was the victim of a Washington - led conspiracy and would quit to spare his people further suffering .
Comparing his plight to the persecution of Jesus Christ , Mr Taylor said : "" I found myself in the same position .
I am the sacrificial lamb , the whipping boy . ""
His departure is supposed to consolidate a ceasefire , open Liberia to humanitarian aid for a population close to starvation and consign to oblivion the architect of much of the chaos in Sierra Leone , Guinea and Ivory Coast .
Indicted for war crimes by a United Nations - backed tribunal in Sierra Leone , Mr Taylor , 55 , has refused to say when he will leave and there are fears that he will try to control events from behind the scenes after ceding power to the vice - president , Moses Blah .
Mr Blah said he was "" 100 % sure "" he could bring peace .
But the rebels have rejected him as a Taylor crony and threatened renewed fighting unless a neutral figure takes over .
South Africa 's Thabo Mbeki and Nigeria 's Olusegun Obasanjo are among the African heads of state expected at today 's ceremony in an effort to lend prestige and dignity to Mr Taylor 's resignation - and to encourage his departure .
Wearing a navy blue jacket and seated behind a desk , the former Boston security guard cast himself as the victimised father of the nation in last night 's broadcast .
He blamed sanctions and withheld World Bank loans for Liberia 's economic collapse and accused the US of sponsoring the rebels .
"" They can call off their dogs now .
I realised I could no longer see the blood of our people wasted .
I must stop fighting now .
I do not step down out of fear or fright .
I step down out of love for you . ""
He rejected allegations of mass murder and plunder as "" misinformation , lies , rumours , fabrications , a grand scheme of propaganda , a self - fulfilling prophecy "" .
Relinquishing power was voluntary , he said , but the exile was driven by Washington 's refusal to help Liberia until he left .
Looking tired , he said : "" God willing , I will be back . ""
Very few Liberians were expected to see or hear the broadcast in the absence of electricity , batteries and diesel to run generators .
Interviewed on her way out from church , Jewel Taylor said her husband would soon leave . ""
Maybe a day or two .
We 're still packing .
It 's been a rough couple of years but now we 're leaving .
And by God 's grace we 'll make do in Nigeria .
"" The president had no regrets . ""
He 's not bitter , he 's not angry .
In fact , he 's been keeping me going .
When we get there , we 're going to rest .
"" The bush rebellion Mr Taylor launched in 1989 plunged Liberia into an anarchic war that left 200,000 dead and the country a ruin .
He became president in a 1997 election most observers judged free and fair , though many voters backed him fearing the war would resume if he lost .
He has been accused of exporting insurgencies to neighbouring countries to build a criminal empire based on diamonds and timber .
The rebellion in Sierra Leone was especially bloody , with drugged - up child soldiers mobilised to murder , rape and mutilate .
Jacques Paul Klein , the UN special envoy to Liberia , has called Mr Taylor a "" psychopath "" .
Two rebel groups , allegedly backed by Guinea and Ivory Coast , control most of Liberia and Mr Taylor , his Swiss bank accounts frozen , has also come under heavy pressure from the Washington and African leaders to quit .
Sporadic fighting has continued outside the capital but Monrovia has been quiet since Nigerian - led peacekeepers arrived last week .
Hundreds of thousands of displaced people are trying to survive amid the rubble , eating wild plants , snails and pet dogs .
In areas lacking medicine and doctors , patients are dying from gangrene ."

"Charles Taylor stepped down as president of Liberia and flew into exile last night as three US warships neared the country 's coast , boosting hopes that US marines would join Nigerian- led peacekeepers enforcing a fragile ceasefire .
Waving a white handkerchief to wailing supporters , Mr Taylor boarded a plane for Nigeria , leaving a country ravaged by 14 years of war and chaos but relieved that he had kept his promise to go .
The warlord turned president bowed to intense pressure from western and African leaders as well as the rebels who control most of the countryside and much of the capital , Monrovia .
His luxury vehicles and other belongings loaded on to an aircraft , Mr Taylor , 55 , left with relatives for Calabar , in south - eastern Nigeria where three houses have been set aside for what is supposed to be a quiet retirement .
Since launching a bush rebellion in 1989 and becoming president in 1997 , he has been accused of deepening Liberia 's chaos and fomenting conflicts in Sierra Leone , Guinea and Ivory Coast .
Besieged in his capital , and indicted for war crimes by a UN - backed tribunal in Sierra Leone , he had little choice but to accept the haven offered by Nigeria 's President Olusegun Obasanjo , who greeted him at Abuja airport last night .
At a ceremonial handover of power in Monrovia , Mr Taylor said history would be kind to him .
"" I have fulfilled my duties .
I have accepted this role as the sacrificial lamb . ""
The leaders of South Africa , Ghana and Mozambique attended the ceremony in what was seen as an attempt to help him save face .
The vice president , Moses Blah , was sworn in .
He began his presidency with a moment of silence for all those had died in Liberia 's wars .
Rebels have rejected him as a Taylor crony , but their guns stayed silent .
Mediators yesterday announced a plan for Mr Blah to give way in October to a transitional government to be agreed by both warring sides at talks in Ghana .
A Nigerian - led peacekeeping force took command of check points in Monrovia and was soon expected to take over the city 's rebel - held port opening the city to aid shipments .
President George Bush promised to help once Mr Taylor left and on cue a US marines taskforce steamed over the horizon , cheered by thousands of ecstatic Liberians .
the US secretary of state , Colin Powell , said last night that the commander of the taskforce would go ashore in the next day or so to see how the marines might help open the port ."
"Fresh fighting broke out in Liberia yesterday as rebels advanced towards Monrovia 's international airport , dashing hopes of an immediate end to conflict in the wake of Charles Taylor 's departure .
Hundreds of civilians fleeing on foot said a rebel offensive had pushed to within 30 miles of the airport , prompting government troops to drive out of the capital in pick - up trucks to bolster their frontline .
In another ominous development one of the rebel groups announced that it wanted its leader to become president of the west African country , a demand that will complicate peace talks .
It added up to a sour sequel to Monday 's scenes of hope and relief when President Taylor kept a promise to resign and head into exile , paving the way for an end to three years of civil war which has left the population famished and destitute .
In an apparent breakthrough , leaders of the main rebel group , Liberians United for Reconciliation and Democracy ( Lurd ) , promised to withdraw their fighters from Monrovia , including the port .
General Seyou Sheriff signed a written declaration promising to hand over the rebel - held zones of the city to peacekeepers at noon tomorrow .
The rebel withdrawal to the Po river on Monrovia 's outskirts appeared to be conditional on government forces withdrawing from their stronghold in the city centre .
The deal was brokered by a delegation led by the US ambassador , John Blaney , who was accompanied by about 20 marines , believed to be from the US warships offshore .
Mr Blaney said it had not yet been decided whether US troops would accompany the Nigerian - led peacekeepers .
Reviled as he was , Mr Taylor 's departure did not prompt much jubilation , since most people were too busy scavenging amid the rubble for food and water .
With no television , radio or newspapers , many had not even heard the news .
Promises that humanitarian aid would flow once the warlord - turned - president left have created a crisis of expectations and the crowds who gathered in the city centre , chanting "" We want rice , we want eat "" , turned ugly , at one point surrounding cars filled with foreigners and government soldiers .
"" I did n't eat today , did n't eat yesterday , wo n't eat tomorrow .
Are you waiting for me to die ? "" shouted one woman .
Aid agencies said food and medicine should arrive this week but the needs are vast : in Monrovia alone hundreds of thousands of displaced people are living on snails , leaves , dog meat and handfuls of rice .
A ceasefire in the capital has more or less held over the past week but fighting in Liberia 's second city , Buchanan , has spread , with the rebel Movement for Democracy in Liberia , known as Model , pushing towards the international airport outside Monrovia yesterday .
Civilians fled because the fighters were moving from house to house , slashing with cutlasses , witnesses said .
Before heading to the frontline the defence minister , Daniel Chea , accused Model of slaughter .
"" There is no reason for this .
Taylor has left , that 's what they wanted . ""
But a rebel spokesman , General Boi Bleaju Boi , said his forces had been provoked by government soldiers and had no intention of seizing the airport , which is the base for 800 Nigerian troops , the vanguard of the peacekeeping force .
Mediators hope that Liberia 's 14 years of anarchy and conflict will end now that Mr Taylor has given way to his deputy , Moses Blah , who is supposed to give way in October to an interim government agreed at peace talks in Ghana .
The rebels have rejected President Blah as a Taylor crony and say October is too long to wait .
A fresh twist was added yesterday when Lurd rebels announced they wanted their leader , Sekou Damate Conneh , to become president .
"" We were responsible for the downfall of Charles Taylor .
We want to serve in the highest capacity .
That means we can be president of the interim government , "" said a senior rebel official , Sekou Fofana .
He scorned Mr Blah 's offer of the vice - presidency .
Lurd had until now suggested it would accept a lesser role in an interim government .
Pessimists fear a reprise of 1990 , when two rebel groups ousted the then president before turning on each other and the regime 's remnants in a bloody conflict which sucked in Nigerian peacekeepers .
Mr Fofana said history would not repeat itself and that relations between Model and Lurd were cordial .
Lurd would respect the ceasefire , he said , though it would not cooperate with President Blah .
Having seen off Mr Taylor Lurd rebels might have been expected to be jubilant but yesterday they were sullen and edgy .
At their headquarters a young rebel was stripped and beaten with a cane for firing his AK-47 without permission .
Down the street another rebel with a knife chased a boy .
Mr Taylor and his entourage were meanwhile settling into three luxurious hilltop residences in Calabar , one of Nigeria 's sleepier cities . ""
No problem .
I 'm OK , "" was all the former president said upon arrival ."
"The day after the grim farce of ex - president Charles Taylor 's flight from Monrovia , international aid agencies have rushed to tackle the human tragedy which he left behind .
An estimated 1 million people are either trapped in appalling conditions in Liberia 's cities or cut off from help in the countryside , according to the Disasters Emergency Committee , bringing together 11 British charities to launch the Liberia Crisis Appeal .
The country ranks last but one on the UN 's human development index .
The percentage of children suffering from malnutrition is as high as in North Korea .
Oxfam , Save the Children and others have to tackle appalling conditions in which displaced families live next to "" rivers of sewage and infestations of maggots "" and the cost of rice has risen by 700 % since June .
Liberia is justly labelled as a "" complex emergency situation "" and the disasters committee appeal deserves a huge response ( donations online at www.dec.org.uk or at any bank or post office ) .
Mr Taylor 's departure was finally achieved after the deployment of a vanguard force of Nigerian peacekeepers in Monrovia - plus the face - saving arrival of three African heads of state to speed him on his way .
The top priority now is for proper security , if the de facto ceasefire is not to collapse like the one reached previously in June .
A second security council resolution is needed urgently , backed by funds and troops , to enable a more substantial UN peacekeeping effort with wider powers - and much better discipline than in previous efforts .
Only then will there be a realistic chance of achieving a political settlement acceptable to the rebel factions of Lurd and Model - one unlikely to include the dubious Moses Blah , Mr Taylor 's henchman and now acting president .
It will take even more to begin the task of mending this deeply fractured society , which began to disintegrate under the US - backed Samuel Doe regime in the 1980s , long before Mr Taylor appeared on the scene .
Schools are needed for the displaced children , jobs for the demobilised fighters and aid to rebuild a shattered infrastructure .
How to balance the rival demands of justice and reconciliation is another tough problem : Mr Taylor is not the only leader who could be charged with war crimes .
This is a daunting agenda in a region which has long suffered from international neglect , but it should not be ducked ."
"New York Times Editorial , August 12 ""
The prospects for an end to Liberia 's blood - letting brightened considerably [ on Tuesday ] with President Charles Taylor 's resignation and flight to Nigeria ...
Although Nigeria has granted him sanctuary , Mr Taylor must eventually be brought to justice ... ""
Mr Taylor brought destruction not just to Liberia but also to its neighbours : Sierra Leone , Ivory Coast and Guinea .

The devastation was greatest in Sierra Leone , and a tribunal backed by the United Nations has indicted him for war crimes there .
Trying him would establish an important precedent that could help heal the region and discourage future atrocities .
Nigeria should turn him over to the tribunal .

Independent Editorial , August 12 ""
There will be those who ask whether such a brutish leader as Mr Taylor should have been granted the luxury of leaving office with dignity .
The formal ceremony , however , with three other African leaders in attendance , lent an air of legitimacy to the handover ...
"" The choice was not between prosecuting and not prosecuting , but between continuing civil war and starting peace .
Weighed in that balance , Mr Taylor 's immunity was the better of two evils .
The condition must be that he abandons his hope of returning to Liberian politics and resists the temptation to meddle in the affairs of his homeland from afar . ""
Toronto Star Editorial , August 12 "" At a time when the former Yugoslav leader Slobodan Milosevic is on trial for war crimes and Rwanda 's prime minister , Jean Kambanda , has been jailed , Mr Taylor 's pain - free exit is a blow to the UN , to the international criminal court and to the rule of law ...

"" The writing is on the wall ; the United States is going to get more involved in Liberia .
It should do so and do it well .

"" What to do after the fighting stops is always the great problem ...
The model for Liberia is East Timor in 1999 .
Then , a great power ( Australia ) led a multinational force , secured East Timor 's independence and handed it over to the UN .
The UN helped in the nation - building and then turned over power to the locals in two years .
The East Timor model shows that with foresight , good planning and multinational cooperation , a few troops and limited funds can make a huge difference .
In adopting it , the Bush administration could show the world a multilateralism that works . ""
Financial Times Editorial , August 12 "" By moving even a small number of troops from their offshore anchorages into Monrovia , the US could impart vital authority to the stabilisation force now being formed .
Washington 's reluctance has already caused delays that have cost hundreds more lives .
Liberia is one place where US soldiers would be heartily welcomed .
But in the longer - term task of providing aid to rebuild Liberia 's shattered economy , the onus must be more widely shared .
The European Union also has a crucial role . ""
Wall Street Journal Editorial , August 12
"" No one can look at the suffering in Liberia without wanting to do something , and we 're not against such a humanitarian intervention in principle .
But especially with Africans making progress on the ground , no one we 've seen has offered a proposal for what American troops are supposed to do once they got there .
Beyond enforcing an immediate ceasefire , which unsavoury side in the conflict are we supposed to favour ?
The danger is that US troops could get sucked in for a long stay or suffer casualties with no clear purpose . ""
With US blood and treasure already engaged in Iraq and Afghanistan , this is one colonial effort too many .
Especially post-9/11 , the first priority for US national security has to be fighting terror .
Liberia is a west - African tragedy that is best solved by west Africans , and it would do that continent enormous good if they finally met that responsibility . """
"Just a week after they forced warlord Charles Taylor into exile , Liberian rebel groups signed a peace accord today with government officials to end their three - year insurgency .
The accord , signed in the Accra , Ghana , ends a war that has left thousands dead and forced many Liberians to flee their homes .
It calls for the establishment of a two - year transitional government which will lead Liberia into elections .
"" I want to believe that with the signing of this agreement today , Liberia will never be plunged into another spiral of violence in the quest for political power , or under the false pretence of liberating the people , "" said the retired Nigerian general Abdulsalami Abubakar , who led two and a half months of peace talks .
Two rebel movements - Liberians United for Reconciliation and Democracy ( Lurd ) and the Movement for Democracy in Liberia ( Model ) - signed the agreement , along with representatives of Liberia 's post - Taylor government . ""
Today is a good day .
Today is a happy day , "" the Lurd leader Sekou Conneh said , as embraced his rebel and government counterparts and exchanged copies of the deal with them . ""
The war is over . ""
Peace talks , which had begun on June 4 , were quickly sidelined by fighting that overtook Monrovia when all sides violated a June 17 ceasefire .
With the capital as the battle ground , mortar barrages and AK-47 fire killed well over 1,000 civilians outright and left hundreds of thousands trapped and starving following the breakdown of talks .
The signing of the accord concludes a dramatic week of momentous events in Liberia , beginning with Mr Taylor 's resignation on August 11 and his flight into exile in Nigeria .
Rebels , west African leaders and the US had all called for him to step down .
On Thursday , rebels lifted their siege of Monrovia , allowing vital food and aid to flow .
Under the peace deal , rebels and government alike will waive any claim to top posts in the interim government and yield control to noncombatants for the first period of reconstruction .
Rebels and members of Mr Taylor 's former government will be allowed to fill lower - ranking positions .
Moses Blah , Mr Taylor 's designated successor , is to resign in October and make way for the power - sharing government .
Ghana 's president , John Kufuor , was on hand for the agreement , which saw representatives of the UN , the EU and the African Union sign as witnesses .
The US also has had an influential delegation at the talks .
Brigadier General Festus Okonkwo , the leader of a two - week - old west African peace mission , said he expected to have a second full battalion of Nigerian troops on the ground by the end of the week .
Troops from Ghana , Senegal and Mali are expected to join them .
About 150 US soldiers are also on the ground in Liberia , a nation founded with US backing by freed slaves in the 19th century .
President George Bush said yesterday that the Marines have a limited mission and will be withdrawn by the beginning of October .
Despite the peace deal , many in Monrovia are still in desperate need of food , after weeks of subsisting on leaves , snails and whatever else they could forage .
Most Monrovians remained indoors last night for fear of gunmen , and few had batteries or electricity for radios after 10 weeks of rebel sieges .
"" Maybe God has now turned his right ear to Liberia , "" said Sarah Tingbeh , a 38-year - old refugee , who clutched a plastic bag with a precious cup of rice in it .
"" We have suffered enough . ""
Liberia has been in ruins since 1996 , when a devastating seven - year civil war launched by Mr Taylor came to an end .
At least 150,000 people died in the conflict , and aid agencies estimate that virtually all of the country 's three million people were displaced from their homes was displaced at one time or other ."
"Gyude Bryant was sworn in today as the head of Liberia 's transitional government , charged with leading the country out of 14 years of war and into democratic elections .
Mr Bryant , 54 , will serve a two - year term as chairman - not president - of the transitional power - sharing government .
Liberia 's warring factions chose Mr Bryant , a businessman regarded as politically neutral , as leader in August during the peace talks that followed warlord president Charles Taylor 's exile .
Mr Bryant takes over from Moses Blah , Mr Taylor 's deputy , who served as the temporary head of government for the past two months .
Mr Taylor , widely blamed for the violence that engulfed Liberia for the last 14 years , flew into exile in Nigeria on August 11 .
Mr Bryant today took an oath before West African leaders and Liberians in the capitol rotunda of bullet - riddled Monrovia .
Wearing a black suit , he placed his left hand on a bible held by his wife , and swore to "" faithfully , conscientiously and impartially discharge the duties of the office of chairman of the national transitional government , to the best of my ability , so help me God . ""
West African leaders , some of whom just two months ago had ushered Taylor into exile out of his rebel - besieged capital , looked on . ""
Liberia needs to be pulled up by all of us , "" the Nigerian president , Olusegun Obasanjo , told the inauguration audience of heavily guarded rebel leaders , figures of Taylor 's toppled government , and international diplomats .
"" You have the support of all of us in West Africa , "" he told the Liberians , many of who will have stakes in Mr Bryant 's power - sharing government .
"" If there 's no peace in Liberia , there 's no peace in West Africa . ""
Mr Bryant faces enormous challenges in preparing his country for elections in 2005 .
He will have to disarm thousands of young fighters inured to murder , rape and pillage .
His government will also have to encourage hundreds of thousands of displaced civilians to return home .
More than 200,000 people have perished during fighting since 1989 .
In the two and a half months before Mr Taylor 's exit , sieges in the capital killed more than 1,000 civilians .
Mr Bryant is a long - time campaigner against warlords who stayed in Liberia throughout years of fighting under Mr Taylor .
Liberians cheered his return to Monrovia yesterday , brought back by a Ghana air force jet for the first time since Mr Taylor left .
Two months earlier , on August 11 , leaders from across Africa had assembled to see Mr Taylor into exile , giving him the ceremonial send - off he had demanded as a condition of yielding power .
Rebels and the government signed a peace deal one week after Mr Taylor 's departure , on August 18 , setting up Mr Bryant 's tenure .
In a statement released today from Nigeria , Mr Taylor rejected accusations from the UN that he continued to meddle in politics in Liberia and gave assurances that he was behind Mr Bryant .
"" I pledge my all to peace and the peace - building process now unfolding in Liberia , "" he said .
"" This is my native land where I have to return one day , live , die and be buried . "" "" Peace is all we need , "" slogans on placards held by women lining the streets outside the inauguration ceremony declared today , before a cordon of white UN armoured personnel carriers .
Inside , UN troops enforced massive security .
As Mr Bryant , rebel leaders and government officials arrived , blue - helmeted UN peacekeepers flanked each with AK-47s and rocket - launchers .
The UN military mission moved in earlier this month , replacing an emergency 3,500-strong peace force of African troops that had been led by Mr Obasanjo 's Nigerian forces .
Mr Obasanjo , seen as one of the most crucial of many African leaders engineering the end of Mr Taylor 's devastating tenure , drew the loudest cheers at today 's ceremony .
A heavy - equipment dealer and leader of a small political party , Mr Bryant led a 1997 effort to unite political parties behind a civilian candidate in Liberia 's first elections after a 1989 - 1996 civil war .
The six - party alliance 's effort failed , and Mr Taylor won the presidency ."
"Congress has attached to the Bill approving President Bush 's plan to spend $ 87 billion rebuilding and securing Iraq and Afghanistan , an unexpected $ 2 m ' for the capture ' of the former President of Liberia , Charles Taylor .
Taylor left Liberia in August after prolonged negotiations , and is currently ensconced in a villa in the Nigerian city of Port Harcourt , provided to him by the country 's President , Olusegun Obasanjo .
With his whereabouts far from a secret , the US bounty has raised fears that mercenaries may take up the challenge to kidnap and bring in the exiled Liberian warlord .
In June , Taylor was indicted on war crimes charges by United Nations tribunal that is trying Sierra Leoneans alleged to have committed atrocities during the country 's long civil war .
Taylor is accused of providing arms and financial support to the brutal rebel group the Revolutionary United Front ( RUF ) of Sierra Leone , whose stock in trade was to brutally amputate the limbs of civilians it captured .
It was only defeated after a combination of British troops and African troops drawn from the Economic Community of West Africa
Monitoring Group joined the side of the Sierra Leone government .
Obasanjo has made it clear that he does not intend to be ' harassed ' by the international community into giving up Taylor to the tribunal .
If the US does act on the Congressional proposal to capture Taylor , American policy will clash disastrously with that of the African states .
The Africans believe that only tireless negotiation can resolve the continent 's many fratricidal conflicts .
With this in mind , four African presidents escorted Taylor out of Liberia in August : Thabo Mbeki of South Africa , Obasanjo , John Kufuor of Ghana and Joaquim Chissano of Mozambique .
Last month , Obasanjo sternly warned Taylor not to interfere in Liberian affairs , after reports that Taylor was spending hours on his mobile phone to Monrovia , ' teleguiding ' the remnants of his administration .
A compromise candidate , Gyude Bryant , was sworn in as president last month .
His coalition includes member of Taylor 's former government .
But Obasanjo will not find it easy to dissuade the US from financing an attempt to kidnap Taylor .
In August , an Anglo - American mercenary company , Northbridge Services Group Ltd , was quoted on an American conservative website as offering to attempt to arrest Taylor .
But Taylor is guarded by Nigerian troops ; if they were to be killed or injured during a kidnap attempt , the US would pay dearly in diplomatic terms .
Africans remember clearly that when Liberians were in dire need of troops to save them , during the worst days of the civil war , all the US did was to send warships to ' patrol ' Liberian waters .
Eventually , after heavy international criticism , the US sent about 50 marines to provide logistical support to the African soldiers - mainly Nigerian and Ghanaian - which stopped the fighting ."

The resolution requires all countries to freeze funds , financial assets and economic resources of Taylor , his wife and son , as well as others on a UN sanctions list .

"The office of President Olusegun Obasanjo has announced in Abuja , Nigeria , that the new Liberian government of President Ellen Johnson - Sirleaf , which was installed on 16 January 2006 , has formally requested the extradition of the former president of Liberia , Charles Taylor , back to Liberia .
The Abuja announcement said President Obasanjo will take a decision on the issue after consulting the African Union ( AU ) and the Economic Community of West African States ( ECOWAS ) .
Taylor has been living in exile in Calabar , south - eastern Nigeria , since 2003 .
He has been indicted for war crimes by the United Nations war crimes tribunal in Freetown , Sierra Leone .
The announcement from Abuja about his extradition came as a surprise because President Johnson - Sirleaf had earlier stated that Taylor 's extradition was not one of the ' priorities ' of her new government .
A 14-year civil war , during which Taylor and other warlords laid waste to much of Liberia , has left the country largely without electricity and pipe - borne water .
Hospitals and clinics have been destroyed , as have schools and other educational institutions .
It is significant that Mrs Johnson - Sirleaf was on an official visit to the United States when the announcement came from Abuja that she had requested Taylor 's extradition .
The coincidence will inevitably be interpreted as the result of Washington applying pressure on Johnson - Sirleaf to request Taylor 's extradition in exchange for aid - huge quantities of which are needed by Johnson - Sirleaf if she is to be able to fulfil her promise to the Liberian electorate to restore life to normality as soon as possible after her inauguration .
Opinion in Liberia is divided over Taylor 's fate .
Some people think that he has enough support left in the country , after ruling it for almost a decade ( during which he was in control of the country 's revenues from rubber , timber and diamonds , often illicitly collected ) to be able to finance a resistance movement that could seriously subvert Johnson - Sirleaf 's new government .
In any case , trying him now could prove divisive at a time when Johnson - Sirleaf has called on all hands to come on deck to help rehabilitate the country .
Some even say that Taylor could embarrass Johnson - Sirleaf 's government by revealing details of how highly - placed politicians co - operated with Taylor in the past to subvert some of the governments of the time , especially that of the late Samuel Doe ( who ruled Liberia from 1980 until he was killed in 1990 ) .
But others in Liberia think that Charles Taylor is such a cantankerous individual that he will never fully implement the most important condition of his being granted asylum in Nigeria , namely , desisting from interfering in the affairs of Liberia .
It is claimed that he has already been tele - guiding some of the new Members of the Liberian Congress by cell - phone from his exiled home in Calabar .
Taylor 's ex - wife Jewel , is an elected senator in the newly - installed Congress .
When Obasanjo and the leaders of the African Union ( then the Organisation of African Unity , OAU ) brokered the asylum deal that ended in Taylor being exiled to Nigeria , the impression they gave was that it was better for Taylor to be outside the country , living in quiet safety , than hanging around within Liberia , causing trouble .
The UN war crimes tribunal was against this idea , but African diplomatic opinion , which placed peace in Liberia above legalistic considerations , prevailed and Taylor was escorted out of the country .
African leaders who went to Liberia personally to escort him out included Obasanjo , Thabo Mbeki of South Africa and Joachim Chissano ( then President of Mozambique . )
Obasanjo immediately came under international pressure to send Taylor for trial over war crimes in Freetown , but he resisted .
However , he conceded that if , at some future date , a freely - elected government of Liberia asked for Taylor 's extradition , he would consider the request .
This is what has now happened .
Obasanjo must now weigh the extradition against the possibility that some other troublesome warlord in an Africa plagued with political crises , may have to be persuaded to leave his country , and that Taylor 's extradition would serve as a bad precedent for anyone else of that nature accepting asylum in an African country .
Such an eventuality will severely limit the ability of African leaders to engage in diplomatic manouevres aimed at procuring peace in a strife - torn country .
Acknowledging Africa 's interest in the matter , Obasanjo 's statement said : "" In keeping with his commitment to give consideration to any formal request from a democratically elected government of Liberia for the return of former president Charles Taylor , President Olusegun Obasanjo has duly notified the chairmen of the African Union ( AU ) and the Economic Community of West African States ( ECOWAS ) that President Johnson - Sirleaf has made such a request , "" the statement said .
Obasanjo will take a decision on the extradition based on the views of the two regional groups , the statement explained .
It added that the Secretary - General of the United Nations , Kofi Annan , has also been informed .
Reacting to the statement , Charles Taylor 's spokesman in Nigeria , Sylvester Paasewe , accused the United States of being behind what he called the "" indecent proposal "" to extradite Taylor .
He said it put African leaders in a precarious position because they had agreed in 2003 to quash the indictment as part of the deal which brought Taylor to Nigeria and ended the war . ""
African leaders know that the whole matter is an outlay of U.S. foreign policy which is hinged on pre - emptive diplomacy which often carries with it the bane of regime change , "" he told Reuters by telephone from the southeastern city of Calabar .
"" I hope African leaders will throw off the yoke of neocolonialism and insist that AU and ECOWAS remain the pre - eminent voice in the affairs of Africa , as the EU is in Europe , "" he added ."
"Justice appeared to have caught up with Charles Taylor , the former warlord turned president of Liberia , yesterday when Nigeria confirmed it had received a request from the Liberian government to extradite him .
Mr Taylor , 58 , was forced into exile in Nigeria three years ago under a peace deal ending 14 years of civil war .
Shortly before he stepped down he was indicted for war crimes by an international tribunal in Sierra Leone , where he backed a rebel group notorious for hacking off the hands and feet of civilians .
Liberia 's president , Ellen Johnson - Sirleaf , has faced growing international pressure to bring to justice the man many Liberians blame for fuelling a civil war that cost a quarter of a million lives , left the country in ruins , and spilled over into neighbouring states .
But the case poses a problem for Ms Johnson - Sirleaf , who took office in January , because Mr Taylor still has supporters at home and his ex - wife is an elected senator .
The terms of Mr Taylor 's exile have never been revealed , but he is thought to have been promised that he would not face prosecution .
The Nigerian president , Olusegun Obasanjo , is consulting with the African Union and regional leaders on how to respond to the request , according to a statement from his office .
Nigeria has said it would only surrender Mr Taylor if a democratically elected Liberian government requested it .
Mr Taylor 's spokesman in Nigeria , Sylvester Paasewe , accused the US of being behind what he called the "" indecent proposal "" .
"" I hope African leaders will throw off the yoke of neocolonialisma "" he told Reuters .
Liberia 's information minister had on Monday denied any formal extradition request .
Mr Taylor , a descendant of the freed slaves who founded Liberia , led a small band of rebels into the country on December 24 1989 , triggering a period of civil war which ended when he was elected president in 1997 .
A rebellion against his rule plunged Liberia back into war in 2000 .
His government had done little to improve the lot of ordinary people and his armed forces included child soldiers who were enlisted into a special Small Boys Unit , often after the murder of their parents .
In Sierra Leone he backed a rebel force accused of widespread torture and sexual assault .
The indictment charges him with mass murder , rape and the use of child soldiers .
Mr Taylor was also accused of profiting from the civil war by acquiring diamonds .
His final words before leaving for Nigeria were : "" God willing , I will be back . """
"Charles Taylor , the former Liberian president and war crimes suspect , has been told that he can no longer hide in exile .
Nigeria said Liberia 's new government , which had formally sought Taylor 's extradition , was free to take him into custody .
Taylor went into exile in Nigeria in 2003 as part of a deal to end 14 years of civil war in Liberia .
Taylor faces war crimes charges over his role in the civil war in Sierra Leone , and could be indicted there once handed over .
The 15,000 UN peacekeepers in Liberia are under orders to arrest Taylor and transfer him to the UN - backed special court for Sierra Leone if he sets foot on Liberian soil .
Leaders of the African Union and of Ecowas , the West African regional grouping , had raised no objection to the move , a Nigerian statement said .
It did not say when or how he would be transferred .
Taylor 's spokesman in Nigeria said African leaders who brokered the 2003 deal under which Taylor stepped down and went into exile had agreed he could not be handed over to the court . '
African leaders can not afford to renege on that agreement , ' Sylvester Paasewe said . '
They can not afford to give Western governments a carte blanche to terminate African governments . '
Tens of thousands of people died in the conflicts in Sierra Leone and Liberia .
Taylor is accused of selling diamonds and buying weapons for Sierra Leone 's Revolutionary United Front rebels , who were notorious for hacking off the hands and legs of civilians during a 10-year war .
He also started the Liberian civil war in 1989 , before being elected president in 1997 ."
"The 15th anniversary of the start of the devastating war in Sierra Leone fell on Thursday and it brought a renewed call for the conflict 's most notorious war criminal to be brought to justice .
Former Liberian President Charles Taylor , sheltering in Nigeria since 2003 , has been indicted on 17 counts of war crimes - from mutilations and murders to sexual slavery , rape and use of child soldiers - for his role in the 11 year long conflict .
Nigeria , with the support of the US and the African Union , gave Taylor a temporary safe haven in the interests of making a peaceful transition of power in Liberia .
Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo had been stalling over surrendering Taylor to the UN - backed Special Court but indicated he would consider a request from a properly elected Liberian government .
Accordingly , its new president , Ellen Johnson - Sirleaf , made the crucial request earlier this month and yesterday Obasanjo relented , saying Liberia was free to take Taylor .
Many fear a trial could reignite unrest in Liberia .

"Nigeria was under pressure from a UN war crimes tribunal to arrest the former Liberian president , Charles Taylor , yesterday , as concerns grew that he might flee to evade trial .
The UN prosecutor , Desmond de Silva , said he had asked Nigeria 's president , Olusegun Obasanjo , to arrest Mr Taylor "" to avoid the possibility of him using his wealth and associates to slip away , with grave consequences to the stability of the region "" .
Mr Taylor , who is wanted on war crimes charges in Liberia 's neighbour , Sierra Leone , was granted refuge in Nigeria in 2003 .
But earlier this month Liberia 's new president , Ellen Johnson - Sirleaf , formally called for his extradition , and on Saturday Mr Obasanjo said Liberia was free to take him into custody .
But Mr de Silva said : "" The watching world will wish to see Taylor held in Nigerian detention . ""
Human Rights Watch warned yesterday that it was an "" unfair burden "" to expect Liberia to mount an attempt to detain Mr Taylor on Nigerian soil . ""
Nigeria has to ensure that he is handed over , "" said Corinne Dufka , the head of Human Rights Watch 's west Africa programme .
Mr Taylor is wanted for fuelling a brutal war in Sierra Leone by supporting rebels there in exchange for diamonds .
His exile from Liberia was brokered in a peace deal in which he agreed to step down as president in return for safe haven in Nigeria .
The possibility of an arrest met with mixed reaction in Liberia .
"" There is no celebration , "" said James Makor , head of a local NGO , Save My Future Foundation , from the capital Monrovia .
"" People are trying to put their lives back together and are worried that this may cause unrest . """
"The agreement reached on March 25 2005 between Nigeria 's president , Olusegun Obasanjo , and his Liberian counterpart , Mrs Ellen Johnson - Sirleaf , to send Liberia 's former dictator Charles Taylor to face trial before the United Nations special court in Sierra Leone could threaten African unity .
The reason is that the August 2003 deal under which Charles Taylor was sent into exile in Nigeria was brokered by several African heads of state , including John Kufuor of Ghana , Thabo Mbeki of South Africa and Joaquim Chissano , who was president of Mozambique at the time .
President Obasanjo says he consulted the African Union and the Economic Community of West African States ( Ecowas ) before agreeing to Liberia 's request for him to release Taylor into Johnson - Sirleaf 's custody , but he did not specifically mention those who were directly involved in brokering the 2003 agreement .
None of them has commented on the issue , but Charles Taylor 's followers are accusing them of going back on assurances they had given Taylor that he would be safe in Nigeria .
And now that Taylor is reported by the Associated Press to have vanished from Calabar , his place of asylum in southern Nigeria , the African leaders could be severely embarrassed .
No African leader finds it palatable to be told that he broke his word - and Taylor has a sharp tongue .
In Liberia itself , the announcement that Taylor is to face trial has not done any favours to the country 's new - found sense of security .
The news triggered off a "" coup panic "" , and several supporters of Taylor 's were detained .
Detentions of that nature do not augur well for the infant democracy , which was ushered into being when Mrs Johnson - Sirleaf was inaugurated , on January 16 2006 .
The tragic part of the issue is that the necessity of bringing Taylor to trial can not be contested : Africa needs to punish people like Taylor , who lay waste to their own countries as well as neighbouring ones just to enjoy power .
Potential warlords must be forcibly taught that if they tread in other people 's blood in order to attain power , they can no longer do so with impunity .
It is evident , then , that in Taylor 's case , the right medicine is being applied but at the wrong time .
Let Liberia settle down to consolidate its post - Taylor tranquillity ; prepare African public opinion to reconcile itself to the fact that all peace agreements have trade - offs that can not please everyone ; and then , but only then , get Taylor - for a good decision that is not accepted by the majority of those it affects is as harmful as a bad decision .
Also , in the end , it is n't the foreigners putting pressure on Obasanjo and Mrs Johnson - Sirleaf who will live with the consequences , should handing over Taylor prove to be a tragic mistake : it will be the already war - fatigued Liberian people and the neighbouring countries - Sierra Leone , Guinea , the Ivory Coast and Ghana - which have had to expend their already scanty resources on the thousands of refuges who flocked there during Liberia 's 14-year civil war ."
"Charles Taylor , Liberia 's former leader , has disappeared from his safe haven in Nigeria days before he was due to be transferred to a war crimes court .
Nigeria said yesterday that Mr Taylor had slipped his minders at his villa in the south - eastern town of Calabar on Monday night .
Just 48 hours earlier Olusegun Obasanjo , Nigeria 's president , had agreed to a request from Liberia to give up Mr Taylor , whom he had granted exile under a 2003 peace deal .
Remi Oyo , a spokeswoman for Mr Obasanjo , said the president had set up a panel to investigate whether Mr Taylor "" escaped or was abducted "" .
"" All the security people who were in charge of looking after Mr Taylor have been arrested , "" she said .
Mr Taylor 's disappearance confirmed the worst fears of human rights groups and prosecutors who had warned that Mr Taylor could escape if he was not detained by the Nigerian authorities .
Journalists who visited Mr Taylor 's riverside villa last week reported that there was little security .
But despite requests from the US and the UN - backed special court in Sierra Leone , which has indicted Mr Taylor for fuelling a war there , Nigeria refused to arrest him and maintained that it was up to Liberia to "" take him into custody "" .
Mr Taylor 's escape is embarrassing for Mr Obasanjo , who is due to visit the US tomorrow .
The US is understood to have pressured Liberia 's president , Ellen Johnson - Sirleaf , into requesting Mr Taylor 's extradition .
Nigeria 's acquiescence took many observers by surprise as it sent a dangerous message to some other African leaders that they could no longer take life in exile for granted .
News of Mr Taylor 's disappearance will be greeted with dismay in Liberia , which is struggling to restore normality after a 14-year civil war .
Mr Taylor is known to have supporters there who have threatened a return to the chaos that marked his rule .
Kilari Anand Paul , an Indian - American evangelist who describes himself as Mr Taylor 's "" spiritual adviser "" , told AFP yesterday that Mr Taylor had agreed to stand trial in The Hague . ""
He has also agreed to go to Liberia , but he has totally refused to go to Sierra Leone and face charges there , "" said Mr Paul .
He said that Mr Taylor had submitted political asylum requests to Syria , Libya , Venezuela and Ethiopia ."
"Human rights groups are demanding former Liberian president Charles Taylor be handed over to an international court to face war crimes charges after Nigerian officials said he had disappeared from his refuge in their country .
Mr Taylor vanished from his villa in the southern Nigerian town of Calabar on Monday night .
A government statement said the country 's president , Olusegun Obasanjo , would create a panel to investigate his disappearance .
It added they had not ruled out the possibility he may have been kidnapped .
Under pressure from the US , the Nigerian government has agreed in principle to surrender Mr Taylor to a UN tribunal on charges relating to civil war in Liberia 's neighbour Sierra Leone .
Liberian ministers , however , have expressed concern over the legality of the handover , as no extradition treaty exists between the two countries .
Lobby group Human Rights Watch had urged Nigeria to increase security around Mr Taylor to prevent his escape .
Corrine Dufka , head of the group 's West Africa office , told Reuters : "" This is a serious indictment of Nigeria 's commitment to peace and security in Liberia , to seeing justice done for victims of the violence in Sierra Leone and to the fight against impunity throughout Africa . ""
Amnesty International said any country that finds Mr Taylor must immediately hand him over to the special court in Sierra Leone , which has issued an international warrant for his arrest . ""
Any failure by the Nigerian or any other government to ensure that Charles Taylor is successfully extradited to Liberia or surrendered to the special court is a failure to fulfil obligations under international law and obstruction to justice , "" said Kolawole Olaniyan , director of Amnesty International 's Africa Programme .
Mr Taylor stepped down from his role as president at the end of 2003 as part of a deal to end a 14-year civil war in Liberia that had spilled over into nearby countries .
He is one of the most wanted men in Africa and was known as "" Pappy "" to thousands of former child soldiers in West Africa .
The UN war crimes tribunal in Sierra Leone holds him responsible for about quarter of a million deaths .
Throughout the 1990s his armies and supporters , made up of child soldiers orphaned by the conflicts , wreaked havoc through a swathe of West Africa ."
"Charles Taylor , the former Liberian leader wanted for war crimes , is being flown to his home country following his arrest in Nigeria .
The warlord was caught trying to slip across Nigeria 's north - eastern border with Cameroon , a police spokesman told Reuters .
Mr Taylor was then escorted to a nearby military barracks , where a Reuters reporter saw him walk on to the runway surrounded by about 20 soldiers .
The plane took off en route for the Liberian capital , Monrovia , a security official said .
UN peacekeepers at Monrovia 's international airport were waiting to arrest Mr Taylor , 58 , and deliver him to a war crimes court in Sierra Leone .
Mr Taylor disappeared from his Nigerian safe haven on Monday night , days after Nigeria agreed that he could be transferred to face war crimes charges .
He has lived in exile since he stepped down in 2003 as part of a deal to end 14 years of civil war in Liberia .
Today 's events are the latest twist in a complex saga .
Liberia asked Nigeria on March 5 to hand Mr Taylor over to a special UN - backed court in Sierra Leone , where he is accused of supporting brutal rebels in exchange for diamonds to finance the Liberian conflict .
Nigeria responded on March 25 that Liberia was free to take him into its custody , but it made no mention of Sierra Leone nor how and when a transfer would take place .
Yesterday , Nigeria said Mr Taylor had disappeared from his residence , causing an international outcry .
The announcement of his disappearance came an hour before Nigerian president Olusegun Obasanjo flew to Washington , where he is due to meet US president George Bush today .
Frank Nweke , the Liberian information minister , said Mr Obasanjo had ordered Mr Taylor 's "" immediate repatriation "" to Liberia .
Mr Obasanjo had initially resisted calls to surrender Mr Taylor .
However , he changed his mind on Saturday after Liberia 's new president , Ellen Johnson Sirleaf , asked that he be transferred for trial .
Mr Taylor has also been accused of starting civil war in Liberia and of harbouring al - Qaida suicide bombers who attacked US embassies in Kenya and Tanzania in 1998 , killing more than 200 people .
Mr Taylor has also been accused of starting civil war in Liberia and of harbouring al - Qaida suicide bombers who attacked US embassies in Kenya and Tanzania in 1998 , killing more than 200 people ."
"It is interesting that less than 24 hours after Charles Taylor was locked up in a cell of the United Nations special tribunal on war crimes in Sierra Leone , the tribunal has asked for Taylor to be taken to the special international war crimes court in the Hague , Holland .
Taylor has been described as ' ' a cat with nine lives '' and it is wise of the Sierra Leone tribunal not to accept responsibility for locking him up securely whilst he awaits trial .
Over several years , Taylor was the financier of the barbarous Sierra Leone insurgents known as the Revolutionary United Front ( RUF ) .
In exchange for diamonds , Taylor gave the RUF arms , which the RUF used to a gruesome end - they attacked villages and rendered the inhabitants homeless - and then "" invited "" the villagers to join the RUF .
Those who hesitated had their limbs chopped off .
Even babies and liitle children were not spared .
It is a common sight in Freetown , Sierra Leone 's capital , even today , to come across "" amputees "" begging for alms .
At the height of the Sierra Leone insurgency , the RUF could count on thousands of followers , and given money and organisational ability - both of which Charles Taylor can supply - the RUF could have been expected , at some future date , to storm Taylor 's prison and try to spirit him away , UN troops or not .
Just as Taylor did in Nigeria , where , if the Nigerians ' account is to be believed , he escaped earlier this week from his exile home in Calabar , southeastern Nigeria , only to be caught in the far north of the country , in Borno state .
He was known to be surrounded by security personnel in Calabar .
Yet he got away .
Indeed , Taylor 's personal history is littered with audacious escapes .
In 1985 , he made a spectacular escape from the Plymouth county house of corrections in Massachussetts , where he was being held on an extradition warrant presented by the government of the late Samuel Doe , then Liberia 's dictator .
Taylor had incurred Doe 's anger by absconding with $ 900,000 belonging to a government agancy at whose head Doe had appointed Taylor .
How does anyone escape from an American prison and manage to get out of the country into the bargain ?
Many Liberians believe that Taylor had inside help from a section of the US government , possibly the CIA .
A guy with contacts like that could bamboozle the Sierra Leone special tribunal authorities , could n't he ?
Hence the attempt to move him to the Hague .
But even there , no - one can provide a 100 percent guarantee that Taylor wo n't plan something remarkable to try and regain his freedom .
Meanwhile , a great deal of questions are being asked about his escape from Calabar earlier in the week .
How did he slip by the Nigerian security men ?
How did he get the Range Rover with diplomatic number plates in which he made the journey to Borno ?
Why was a wily fellow like Taylor dressed in ' ' flowing white robes '' which would have drawn the attention of the personnel of the border post to himself ?
Why was it that although he was carrying "" sackfuls "" of dollars and other foreign exchange , he failed to bribe his way out of Nigeria , a country whose customs and immigration posts are known to be rather "" permeable "" , to say the least ?
In short , was Taylor caught in a "" sting "" operation mounted by the Nigerians , to give them a motive for being annoyed with Taylor ?
Certainly , if Taylor had annoyed the Nigerians , then the Nigerians would be blameless if they broke the word they had given to Taylor in August 2003 , to grant him asylum in safety in Calabar .
The honest truth is that there are too many unaswered questions over this whole Taylor matter ."
"The fugitive former Liberian leader Charles Taylor arrived in Sierra Leone in handcuffs and a bulletproof jacket last night to face an international war crimes tribunal after being caught trying to cross the border from Nigeria into Cameroon .
Mr Taylor had been on the run since Monday , when he left his safe haven in the south - eastern Nigerian town of Calabar .
Last night , UN peacekeepers who had escorted him on a helicopter flight from Liberia to Freetown led the former president through the razor - wire gates of a fortified court compound where he joined nine others accused of involvement in atrocities during Sierra Leone 's civil war .
After being placed in his cell , he was read a list of the charges against him .
His deportation was prompted by Nigeria 's decision at the weekend to give him up to face an international tribunal .
Police said Mr Taylor was captured early yesterday morning at the remote Gamboru - Ngala border post , 930 miles north - east of Calabar .
Eyewitness reports said Mr Taylor , who was wearing his customary white flowing robe , had been travelling with a woman and his son in a Range Rover with diplomatic licence plates . ""
He passed through immigration , but when he reached customs [ officials ] were suspicious and they insisted on searching the vehicle , where they found a large amount of US dollars , "" Babagana Alhaji Kata , a local trader , told AFP . ""
After a further search they discovered he was Charles Taylor . ""
The flamboyant one - time rebel leader and Baptist lay preacher was taken to military barracks in Maiduguri , 70 miles south of the border , and then flown to Liberia aboard a presidential jet .
United Nations peacekeepers there arrested Mr Taylor at Roberts international airport in Monrovia and escorted him to the UN - backed court in Freetown , Sierra Leone .
Human rights groups welcomed the news .
Global Witness , a British investigative NGO , said : "" The chance for regional security and the prospects for peace have increased . ""
The UN secretary general , Kofi Annan , said his capture "" sends a powerful message to the region that ... would - be warlords will pay a price . ""
Mr Taylor , 58 , is set to become only the second former head of state - after Slobodan Milosevic - to appear before an international court for alleged crimes against humanity during his presidency .
He has been indicted on 11 counts for backing Sierra Leone 's Revolutionary United Front rebels , who were notorious for hacking off the limbs of their victims in a decade - long civil war .
Officials said the special court had recently reduced the number of charges from 17 to allow for a more focused prosecution .
The conflicts in Sierra Leone and Liberia , financed by Mr Taylor using blood diamonds and timber , also spread into parts of Guinea and Ivory Coast , and cost tens of thousands of lives .
His capture and deportation yesterday capped an extraordinary few weeks for a man who many people thought would never face trial .
He was granted exile in Nigeria in August 2003 in return for stepping down as Liberia 's president ; a deal that helped to bring peace to the country after 14 years of civil war and chaos .
Despite calls to extradite him , Nigeria insisted it was bound to honour its agreement to give him sanctuary .
His movements were restricted but he lived a comfortable life in his seafront villa in Calabar , and was widely suspected to be still meddling in Liberian politics .
When Ellen Johnson - Sirleaf became Liberia 's democratically elected president in January , Nigeria said it would consider giving up Mr Taylor if she made a formal request .
After pressure from the US , which is pumping millions of dollars into rebuilding Liberia , she made the request earlier this month .
The Nigerian president , Olusegun Obasanjo , reluctantly agreed to the extradition on Saturday .
But he said Liberia would be responsible for arresting Mr Taylor - a decision that allowed him time to plot his escape . ""
Nigeria 's insistence on sending him to Liberia rather than directly to the court in Sierra Leone illustrates its unhappiness about being pressured into giving up Taylor , "" said Mike McGovern , the west Africa project director for the International Crisis Group in Monrovia yesterday .
Nigeria denies aiding Mr Taylor 's disappearance , and responded to US criticism by pointing out that he once escaped from a US jail .
"" I feel vindicated , "" said Mr Obasanjo , who was on an official visit to the US yesterday .
"" Those who spread such ideas are wrong and owe an apology . ""
Backstory A descendant of freed American slaves who founded Liberia , Charles Taylor was born in 1948 .
He worked as a teacher before studying economics in the US .
He returned home to serve under President Samuel Doe , but fled to the US in 1983 after allegedly stealing nearly $ 1 m .
He was jailed in Massachusetts but escaped a year later .
In 1989 he launched a rebellion against Doe , sparking a brutal seven - year civil war in which up to 200,000 people died .
In 1997 Taylor was elected president of Liberia , his supporters using the rallying cry : "" He killed my ma , he killed my pa , I 'll vote for him . ""
During a bloody six - year reign he was accused of backing rebels in Sierra Leone in return for diamonds .
Taylor left for exile in Nigeria in 2003 ."
"The former Liberian president , Charles Taylor , appeared before a UN - backed war crimes court in Freetown , Sierra Leone today to face 11 charges of war crimes and crimes against humanity .
The former rebel warlord , who appeared under tight security wearing a dark suit and maroon tie , at first told the court he could not enter a plea because he did not recognise the court 's right to try him .
But he went on to say he was not guilty , telling Justice Richard Lussick :
"" I did not and could not have "" committed the atrocities that allegedly occurred during Sierra Leone 's civil war .
The court accepted his comment as a formal plea .
Taylor , who sparked more than a decade of brutal civil war in neighbouring Liberia , was flown to Freetown at the weekend after an apparent escape attempt from his house arrest in the Nigerian town of Calabar , where he has lived as part of a deal to end the Liberian civil war in 2003 .
He faces 11 charges for his alleged role in funding and directing Sierra Leone 's Revolutionary United Forces ( RUF ) , the violent faction responsible for fomenting a civil war that claimed 50,000 lives between 1991 and 2000 .
Court officials have already received death threats and Taylor appeared behind bulletproof glass .
The charges include counts of murder , looting , forced labour , conscription of child soldiers , mutilation and other violence , razing of property , rape and gang rape , sexual slavery and other assaults .
The RUF were notorious for hacking off their victims limbs and for carving the group 's initials into the bodies of their victims .
There have long been allegations that Taylor created , funded and supported the faction so as to disrupt the legitimate trade in diamonds within Sierra Leone .
Prosecutors will allege that diamonds were smuggled through Liberia to provide income for Taylor 's own factions , but he will not face trial for the actions of those factions during Liberia 's seven - year first civil war from 1989 to 1996 .
David Crane , a former chief prosecutor of the court , told Guardian Unlimited that Taylor was central to the collapse of law in Sierra Leone . ""
This is a mega - murderer , someone who ranks up there with the Pol Pots and Stalins and Mao Zedongs , "" he said .
"" He was the centre point of an extensive criminal enterprise that resulted in the murder , rape and mutilation of 1.2 million people across this region . ""
What this says to the common man in Africa is that they mean something .
Up to this point no African head of state had ever been tried for war crimes .
"" This is now , if not the beginning of the end , then at least the beginning of the beginning of the end for the rampant impunity that had plagued African politics . ""
But it is unlikely that Taylor will be tried for his actions in Liberia any time soon .
The Liberian president , Ellen Johnson - Sirleaf , has declared that a war crimes trial in Liberia itself would risk opening old wounds and stirring up fresh civil conflict .
An application before the UN security council could also move the Freetown trial to The Hague as a precautionary measure against the proceedings stirring up more unrest in Sierra Leone .
Taylor 's defence is likely to centre on the question of whether the Sierra Leone has jurisdiction over Liberia , although initial arguments on this basis have already been rejected by the Freetown court 's appeals body .
The delivery of Taylor to the court has been beset with pitfalls and claims that he has been protected by the Nigerian president , Olusegun Obasanjo .
The Nigerian government claimed he had disappeared from his Calabar home just three days after they agreed to deliver him to the Freetown court last week .
The following day he was arrested close to the Cameroonian border .
His spiritual adviser , Kilari Anand Paul , told Associated Press yesterday that he had been encouraged to flee by the Nigerian security forces ."
"Slobodan Milosevic 's death in custody at the UN 's war crimes tribunal in The Hague last month marked an abrupt end to hopes for justice for the thousands of victims of the Balkan conflicts that the former Yugoslav leader unleashed .
That was a grave blow to the evolution of international humanitarian law under which former heads of state who perpetrate atrocities can no longer shelter behind the outdated doctrine of "" sovereign immunity "" .
But now another Dutch prison cell is being prepared for Charles Taylor , the ex - president of Liberia , held responsible for some of Africa 's most savage bloodletting of recent years .
Taylor is facing justice only because Nigeria , under diplomatic pressure , reluctantly allowed his delivery to the Special Court in Sierra Leone , where the flamboyant warlord wreaked bloody havoc during the 11-year diamond - fuelled civil war by supporting and arming the Revolutionary United Front , a rebel group notorious for hacking off the limbs , lips and ears of civilians , including children .
Charges include crimes against humanity , sexual violence and the conscription of child soldiers who were kidnapped , drugged and turned into sadistic killers .
Nigeria allowed Taylor a comfortable exile in return for stepping down as president ; that helped bring peace to Liberia after 14 years of war and 250,000 dead , but the new government of Ellen Johnson - Sirleaf rightly insisted he be surrendered .
Still , the difficulties of avoiding impunity have been underlined by the request that the trial be held in The Hague , home to the fledgling International Criminal Court , since proceedings against him in Monrovia or Freetown could undermine the region 's tenuous peace and stability .
That is unfortunate because there are strong political and practical arguments for trying the perpetrators of atrocities close to where they were committed , not in some distant foreign capital .
Still it is good for Africa that justice has not lost out in a false argument between justice and stability .
Both matter .
The Sierra Leone tribunal , unlike the UN tribunals for Yugoslavia and Rwanda , uses a mixture of domestic and international law .
It has indicted only a dozen people but has yet to convict any of them .
The Rwanda tribunal has completed just 26 cases in 10 years .
Taylor will now join the ranks of Milosevic and Saddam Hussein - a lesson that should make other African despots think twice before unleashing mass murder and systematic mutilation .
But his trial needs to be efficient as well as fair .
Asylum and amnesty can not be the right end to such terrible stories ."
"The international community is determined to move the former Liberian president Charles Taylor 's war crimes trial to the Netherlands , with officials working yesterday to complete the steps necessary for the transfer .
Court officials have asked that the trial be moved to The Hague because of fears that Mr Taylor , 58 , could still spark unrest in west Africa .
Mr Taylor , who has pleaded not guilty , has asked that his case remain in Sierra Leone , where he is accused of backing brutal rebels during the 1991 - 2002 civil war .
He argues that defence witnesses would find it difficult to travel to Europe ."
"Despite the problems that the arraignment of Charles Taylor before the special court in Freetown could cause in his native Liberia , it feels good to see this brash blood - sucker brought to face justice under such humiliating circumstances .
These African dictators who think nothing of other human beings just because they happen to have the support of men wielding AK-47s and machetes , ought to know that they can not ride rough - shod over others with impunity for ever .
The next African tinpot dictator on the list of those who should be punished is Hissene Habre , the former ruler of Chad , who killed thousands of his people in order to stifle opposition to his rule .
He 's currently in Senegal , where President Abdoullaye Wade , afraid to set a precedent , has tried to wash his hands of the Habre issue , by asking the African Union ( AU ) to rule on it .
It will be interesting to see whether that body - which in its former guise as the Organisation of African Unity ( OAU ) was described as a ' trade unioin ' of African heads of state - will decide on the lines that what happens to Habre could happen to some of the other Africa leaders , too , in future , or take the new enlightened line that the peers of African leaders who commit atrocities are those best placed to judge them .
Whatever happens , the days of impunity are numbered in Africa .
Of course , there is a danger that African leaders who succeed others might use the anti - impunity drive to reap vengeance on their predecessors .
This could result in a backlash , whereby leaders would take the risk of rigging elections in order to remain in power , rather than let go of the reins of authority .
That would create more instability on the continent .
But politics can not be played anywhere without risk , and if the ending of impunity brings risks with it , so be it .
The African people deserve to be ruled by leaders who respect the rule of law ."
"Am I alone in feeling a little uneasy about Charles Taylor 's arrest and indictment for war crimes ( Report , April 4 ) ?
To be sure , there can be few people to have ever been tried for more serious offences .
But that is not the point .
Taylor abdicated office in return for promises that he would be allowed a protected exile .
If he had not been given this , he would quite likely still be in power .
Allowing him immunity seemed a pragmatic solution .
Against its own inclinations the Nigerian government has now been persuaded to withdraw its protection .
If there were no more tyrants this might be viewed as desirable - perhaps cruel dictators do not deserve to be treated with good faith .
But harsh rulers remain in authority in Africa and elsewhere , and it is less likely now that they will believe any guarantees that might be offered in future to induce them to give up power .

"It was a day that they never thought would arrive : not the handless and one - legged victims of the brutal war in Sierra Leone , not the child soldiers who called him "" Pappy "" , and certainly not the former warlord as he enjoyed his comfortable exile on the Nigerian coast .
But on Monday , in a Freetown courthouse lined with barbed wire and guarded by UN troops and local soldiers , international justice finally caught up with Charles Taylor .
The former Liberian leader and strongman , who is accused of backing a rebel group that mutilated and raped thousands of civilians in Sierra Leone , was flanked by police as he was led into the UN - backed special court .
Wearing a suit and tie , he remained largely expressionless as 11 counts of alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity were read out by the Samoan judge , Richard Lussick .
When he was asked to plead , Mr Taylor , who was represented by a court - appointed lawyer , refused .
"" I do not recognise the jurisdiction of this court , "" he said .
But shortly afterwards he told the judge that he was not guilty , saying : "" Most definitely , I did not and could not have committed these acts against the sister republic of Sierra Leone .
I think this is an attempt to continue to divide and rule the ­people of Liberia and Sierra Leone . ""
Mr Taylor , 58 , was brought to the Sierra Leone capital last week , ­having been captured at the Nigeria-­Cameroon border .
He had been on the run for two days after Nigeria , which had granted him exile under a 2003 peace deal , agreed to give him up .
The former Baptist lay preacher who was president of Liberia for six years from 1997 was immediately deported to Liberia and then flown onwards to Freetown , capital of neighbouring Sierra Leone , by UN troops .
Lamine Jusu Jarka , who had both his hands cut off by Taylor - backed rebels in Sierra Leone , was among those attending the court .
"" I will raise my hands to show him what he did to the people of Sierra Leone , "" Mr Jarka , who is head of the Amputees and War Wounded Association of Sierra Leone , told the IRIN news agency on the eve of the trial .
Relief at seeing Mr Taylor brought to justice is tinged with fear of retribution from Mr Taylor 's supporters .
­Citing concerns over security the court in Freetown has requested that the trial be moved to The Hague in the Netherlands .
The main trial is not expected to begin for months , to give Mr Taylor time to organise a defence .
The arrest and prosecution of the first former African leader to be tried for war crimes has been hailed as a fillip for peace in West Africa .
It has also been seen as a clear signal to other African "" big men "" that they should not expect sanctuary from neighbours when they leave office ."
"Anger is growing in Sierra Leone over a plan by Britain and the US to move the war crimes trial of the former Liberian President , Charles Taylor , from Freetown to The Hague .
Taylor is the first African ' big man ' to face such charges , and there were expectations that a trial would prove Africa capable of dispensing its own justice .
But now London and Washington say security in this war - torn former British colony is too precarious . '
We want to see justice done , ' said James Matthew of Sierra Leone 's Movement of Democracy and Human Rights . '
Other trials have gone on peacefully here ; why should the Taylor trial change that ? '
In 1991 Taylor supported a Sierra Leone rebel group , allegedly to plunder the country 's diamond fields .
The fighting saw cannibalism , murder and mass rape .
Prosecutors say that Taylor used diamonds to fund a criminal empire .
He fled to Nigeria in 2003 .
In March this year Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo ordered Taylor 's arrest .
In 1999 Alusan Konte , a chef , was stopped by Taylor 's forces and given a choice : the rebels would chop off one of his hands and one of his four - year - old son 's , or take both his hands and spare his son . '
I thought I 'd better do it , ' he said . '
They took both my hands . '
He is angry the trial will take place far away . '
Charles Taylor should be tried here , tried according to the law , ' he said ."
"The British government yesterday broke the international deadlock over the war crimes trial of the former Liberian president Charles Taylor by offering to imprison him if he is found guilty .
Mr Taylor would be one of the most high - profile foreign leaders to be held in a British jail since Hitler 's deputy , Rudolf Hess , was incarcerated before his transfer to Spandau prison in west Berlin .
The former Chilean president Augusto Pinochet was also detained in Britain but under house arrest , not in jail .
The government is planning to put Mr Taylor , 58 , in Belmarsh high - security jail .
The former warlord is accused of backing a rebel group in Sierra Leone responsible for killing an estimated 50,000 people during the 1991 - 2002 civil war and for chopping the limbs off tens of thousands of other men , women and children .
At present he is being held in Freetown , Sierra Leone , awaiting trial along with eight others .
The Sierra Leone government , fearing a trial at home might lead to unrest or an attempt to free him , requested a trial at an unused courtroom at the international criminal court in The Hague .
The Netherlands government agreed , but only on condition that , if found guilty , he be jailed in a third country .
So far Austria , Denmark and Sweden have refused to take him .
Margaret Beckett , the foreign secretary , said yesterday that Britain had decided to respond positively to a request by Kofi Annan , the UN secretary - general , for Mr Taylor to serve a sentence in the UK .
She said : "" My decision was driven by two compelling arguments .
Firstly , that Taylor 's presence in Sierra Leone remains a threat to peace in that region .
Secondly , that we are demonstrating through concrete action the UK 's commitment to international justice . ""
Mr Taylor faces 11 counts of war crimes and crimes against humanity .
He would be deported immediately on completion of his sentence , providing another country could be found , she said .
Parliament will have to pass a bill in the coming session to permit the imprisonment of Mr Taylor in Britain ; existing laws cover only the UN courts , such as that for Rwanda .
The Sierra Leone court does not fall under UN jurisdiction .
Imprisonment of national leaders for crimes against humanity is a relatively new development , although various European countries have taken those convicted of crimes during the Balkans conflict .
The US holds Manuel Antonio Noriega Moreno , the former Panamanian leader , in jail in Miami , Florida , after he was tried for drug trafficking .
Britain played an active role in bringing the civil war in Sierra Leone to an end .
Tony Blair sent troops to defend the airport near Freetown and the capital in 2000 when the country appeared about to fall to the Revolutionary United Front , the rebel group allegedly backed by Mr Taylor .
The leader of Liberia from 1997 to 2003 , Taylor allegedly sent drugged child soldiers into battle and mutilated and raped civilians in the neighbouring west African state ."
"Charles Taylor Former Liberian president Charles Taylor could be imprisoned in the UK if he is convicted of war crimes by a UN - backed court , the foreign secretary , Margaret Beckett , announced .
She said she has , subject to parliamentary approval , agreed to a request by the UN secretary general , Kofi Annan , to allow the African dictator to serve any sentence in the UK .
She hailed the move as removing "" one potential obstacle "" to the trial proceeding .
Afghanistan The defence ministry is to send 130 extra troops to Afghanistan to help protect Kandahar airfield .
The defence secretary , Des Browne , said 34 Squadron of the RAF Regiment will leave the UK for the deployment "" within the the next weeks "" , describing the airfield as being of "" central importance to the success of the wider Nato mission in Afghanistan "" .
New £ 2 coin The chancellor , Gordon Brown , announced that a £ 2 coin will be issued next year to mark the 300th anniversary of the Act of Union between England and Scotland .
He announced that the Queen had approved his recommendation that the coin should be issued to mark the 1707 unification .
Mr Brown said the coin would be issued alongside three others : a collectable crown piece worth £ 5 to celebrate the diamond wedding anniversary of the Queen and Prince Philip , a £ 2 coin to mark the 200th anniversary of the abolition of the slave trade and a 50p coin to commemorate the centenary of the Scouting movement .
Publication of MPs ' addresses MPs ' lives could be at risk by the listing of their home addresses in Who 's
Who , Labour 's Jim Devine ( Livingston ) warned .
He said he had received his draft entry for the 2007 edition .
"" It contained my London address , which at a time of trouble is a bit concerning , recognising that a terrorist organisation in the 70s used Who 's
Who to get the address of an individual who they murdered , "" he added .
Commons Leader Jack Straw added : "" I am certain that Who 's Who will allow for House of Commons or other accommodation addresses in place of a private address . ""
Sentencing The Tories called for "" honest sentencing "" as the row over time served by serious offenders broke out again .
The shadow Commons leader , Theresa May , blamed the prime minister for failings in the criminal justice system despite introducing 54 Bills .
But Mr Straw hit back angrily , accusing the Tories of not voting for a raft of criminal justice measures and apparently suggesting they wanted rapists and murderers to go free .
Climate change levy
The Treasury called on Tories to back the climate change levy , accusing them of "" talking tough and voting soft "" on the environment .
Financial secretary John Healey said the measures strike the right balance between helping the environment and protecting UK industry .
The Tory leader , David Cameron , has previously said he would scrap the levy in favour of other measures to tackle carbon emissions .
Tax credits Mr Brown was again challenged to take personal responsibility for the widely - criticised tax credits system .
For Tories , Mark Francois said this week thinktank the Institute for Public Policy Research had said there were "" real doubts "" about whether tax credits were effective .
The paymaster general , Dawn Primarolo , said : "" It does n't matter how much you wriggle here in trying to disguise the fact that the Conservative opposition want to abolish tax credits . ""
Education spending Gordon Brown acknowledged that his pledge to raise spending on state school pupils to that of the private sector was an "" ambition "" .
But he came under fire after David Bell , education department permanent secretary , told MPs the chancellor had only laid out "" an aspiration "" .
Mr Brown told Tory Michael Fallon ( Sevenoaks ) : "" We have also set the ambition that we will increase spending per pupil .
By 2011 capital spending per pupil will equal that in private schools in this country .
I would have thought Tory MPs would want to support our ambitions in this area . ""
Evacuation procedures for motorists stranded on motorways Labour 's Andrew Mackinlay ( Thurrock ) called for proper evacuation procedures to help people stranded for hours on motorways after major incidents .
He referred to last week 's chaos near Leatherhead , Surrey , when police airlifted bottles of water to thousands of motorists stranded in sizzling temperatures on the M25 after a lorry blaze .
Mr Straw said he knew of "" great concern "" that some people were trapped for eight hours .
"" What I will do is pass on your concerns to the secretary of state for transport and I hope that he will follow those up . ""
Bonuses for Foreign Office staff Staff bonuses at the Foreign Office have risen by 50 % in three years .
More than £ 6 m was shared out among 6,455 staff in non - pensionable bonuses last year - up from £ 4 m in 2003 - 04 .
The bonuses now represent more than 3 % of the UK - based staff paybill of £ 192.5 m , Europe minister Geoff Hoon said .
Fairtrade sales Sales of Fairtrade coffee and bananas have doubled in two years , it was disclosed .
The total volume of Fairtrade certified products sold in the UK has grown by 111 % since 2003 , reaching £ 195 m in 2005 , trade minister Ian McCartney said .
Sales of Fairtrade coffee in the UK totalled £ 65.8 m last year , up from £ 34.3 m in 2003 .
Sales of Fairtrade bananas rose from £ 24.3 m to £ 47.7 m over the same period .
Commissioner for older people in Wales Wales looks set to get what could be the world 's first commissioner for older people , after the Welsh secretary , Peter Hain , introduced a measure that would allow the Welsh assembly to appoint a commissioner as "" an independent champion for older people "" .
Opening debate on the commissioner for older people ( Wales ) bill , he said : "" The commissioner will be the first of its kind in the UK - possibly in the world . ""
The shadow Welsh secretary , Cheryl Gillan , said pensioners in Wales had been "" badly "" hit under Labour by property revaluation .
New peers Celia Thomas , who ran the Liberal Democrats ' Lords whips ' office for 28 years , took her seat in the upper house as Baroness Thomas of Winchester .

"In agreeing to imprison the former Liberian president , Charles Taylor , if he is found guilty by the international criminal court , the British government is taking on a responsibility that it may later regret .
For Taylor is a shady character with so many connections that the possibility of his international allies trying to spring him out of jail - and grossly embarrassing Britain - can not be ruled out .
Look at what happened to Taylor in September 1985 : Taylor was then the ex - director of the Liberian government 's General Services Agency , who had been imprisoned in the US , on an extradition warrant .
The then Liberian government , headed by General Samuel Doe , had asked the US to extradite Taylor home to face trial on charges claiming that Taylor had embezzled about $ 900,000 belonging to the Agency .
While being held in the Plymouth County house of corrections , in Massachusetts , Taylor escaped .
Now , as Hollywood has illustrated with countless films , American prisons are generally built like fortresses kept under armed watch by guards who usually look trigger - happy .
So how did a mere foreigner manage the feat of escaping from such an American prison ?
But that 's not all - having escaped from jail in the US , Taylor also succeeded in leaving the country undetected .
It was these feats in the US that convinced many of the Liberians then ranged against Doe that Taylor had the backing of the CIA .
In fact , within weeks of Taylor escaping from prison in the US , an unsuccessful attempt was mounted to overthrow Samuel Doe , led by Doe 's former army commander , General Thomas Quiwonkpa .
Whether Taylor had any part to play in this coup is not known .
But in the minds of Liberian enemies of Doe , Taylor 's escape from jail and the Quiwonkpa coup attempt became interlinked , and when Taylor later surfaced in west Africa himself , seeking to recruit a guerrilla army , he obtained a ready ear .
By December 1989 , he had trained a considerable force in Libya , Burkina Faso and the Ivory Coast , with which he invaded Liberia .
In less than a year , Doe had been killed by one of Taylor 's allies .
But Taylor could not control all the warlords seeking power in Liberia , and the long drawn - out civil war that crippled that country until Ellen Johnson - Sirleaf was inaugurated as its leader earlier this year , had begun .
During the civil war , Taylor used foreign businessmen to obtain arms , by selling them diamonds - mainly won by his brutal allies in the arm - chopping Revolutionary United Front ( RUF ) of Sierra Leone , to whom Taylor supplied arms - as well as timber and rubber from Liberia 's richly - endowed forests .
A Dutch national has just been jailed in Holland for his part in these activities , but there are countless others unknown , who also served Taylor well .
These undoubtedly include "" ex - mercenary "" elements in Britain .
Given Taylor 's "" American past "" in particular , is Britain wise to welcome him to its jails , if he is convicted ?
The Netherlands , where Taylor will be tried by the international criminal court in the Hague , has declined to be his permanent gaoler .
So have Austria and a few Scandinavian countries .
They have probably studied Taylor 's file and concluded that if whoever - or whatever - helped spring Taylor from jail in America was not averse to embarrassing the mighty FBI , then embarrassing a foreign government would not trouble it too much either .
And remember that in 1985 , nothing like extraordinary rendition was in the vocabulary of the intelligence communities of the western world .
This is 2006 , and it is only fair to ask : If the practice of extraordinary rendition can work in one direction without troubling too many consciences , why not in the other ?"
"Charles Taylor , the former president of Liberia , was transferred to the Hague on Tuesday for a war - crimes trial related to Sierre Leone 's brutal civil war .
A United Nations helicopter took a sombre - looking prisoner from his jail in Freetown , Sierre Leone 's capital , to a nearby airport .
He then flew to the Netherlands in a chartered commercial jet .
The transfer paves the way for Mr Taylor to face 11 charges of war crimes and crimes against humanity for backing the Revolutionary United Front , a rebel group which killed and maimed thousands in the 90s .
The governments of Sierre Leone and neighbouring Liberia wanted the 58-year - old out of west Africa to prevent him creating instability by rousing supporters , many of them child soldiers who still refer to their fallen leader as Poppy .
The Dutch foreign ministry said Mr Taylor would be held at the jail of the international criminal court ( ICC ) in Scheveningen , near The Hague .
The ICC will provide the court facilities but the trial will be conducted by Sierra Leone 's special court , an independent UN - backed tribunal , which will remain based in Freetown . ""
This means the focus can now be on the trial , "" said the Dutch foreign minister , Ben Bot .
"" This is a signal from the international community that exemption from punishment will not be tolerated . ""
The Netherlands agreed to host the trial if a third country would jail Mr Taylor in the event of him being convicted .
Last week Britain volunteered .
A UN security council resolution authorising the transfer was swiftly drafted .
Liberia 's president , Ellen Johnson - Sirleaf , expressed confidence that justice would be served and said her government would focus on rebuilding the shattered country .
"" We 've got three million Liberian people we want to concentrate on . ""
Mr Taylor , accused of embezzling almost $ 1 m ( £ 540,000 ) from government coffers , fled his homeland for the US in 1983 .
He returned in 1989 to launch a rebellion which installed him as president in 1996 at the cost of 200,000 lives .
When Sierre Leone erupted in civil war he backed the rebels , many of them children high on drugs who were notorious for rape and chopping off limbs .
In return , the Liberian leader allegedly gained access to timber and diamond fields .
Mr Taylor , who was also accused of fomenting unrest in Guinea and Ivory Coast , fled to exile in Nigeria in 2003 after rebels closed in on Liberia 's capital , Monrovia .
He compared his decision to step down to the sacrifice of Jesus Christ .
After Nigeria agreed to extradite its guest he tried to escape in March , but was caught and flown to Freetown .
His charge sheet includes terrorising civilian populations , unlawful killings , sexual violence , physical violence , use of child soldiers , abductions and forced labour , looting and burning , and attacks on UN personnel ."

"Gordon Brown is seeking to put fresh impetus behind debt relief for the world 's poorest countries by pressing Britain 's G8 partners to back the write - off of the $ 3bn ( £ 1.53bn ) owed by Liberia to its creditors .
The chancellor met Liberia 's president , Ellen Johnson - Sirleaf , in Davos late last week and assured Africa 's first woman leader that he would back her in her attempts to free the country - one of the poorest in the continent - from the debt burden built up by its corrupt former leaders , Samuel Doe and Charles Taylor .
Two brutal civil wars which cost an estimated 200,000 lives left the country impoverished , but Mr Brown believes the efforts of Ms Johnson - Sirleaf , a Harvard - trained economist , to bring peace , stability and good governance to the west African state should be rewarded .
Yesterday Mr Brown said : "" I met the Liberian president , who explained to me why debt relief is so critical for her country 's democracy and future . ""
The chancellor sees Liberia as a test case of whether debt relief can be extended to countries in Africa hobbled by the effects of conflict .
Liberia owes $ 1.5bn to the international financial institutions but bilateral debts to individual countries mean the country 's total debt burden is at least double that , and more than six times the annual output of the economy .
Ms Johnson - Sirleaf made a public appeal for debt forgiveness to the prime minister when she joined Tony Blair at a round table discussion on Africa at the World Economic Forum last Friday .
"" Get rid of the debt , "" Liberia 's president said .
"" It would free us to do all the things that we need to do to achieve our objectives . ""
With Data , the NGO launched by the Bob Geldof and Bono , also pressing the case for Liberia , Mr Brown intends to call for debt relief at the spring meetings of the IMF and the World Bank in Washington .
A Treasury source said : "" We want to show countries that it is worth staying with the process .
[ Liberia ] has come out of conflict , it has a reforming government and it has a president who wants to do economic reform . ""
Liberia is eligible for debt relief under the HIPC ( highly indebted poor country ) initiative , but is in arrears with debt payments to the international institutions .
The chancellor wants the G8 to provide financial help so Liberia can clear its arrears , a prerequisite for HIPC relief ."
"Richard Dawkins , Oxford 's atheist- in - chief , may be up for the Galaxy British Book Awards , but he could well be grinding his teeth at the announcement that the world 's most valuable individual benefaction , the Templeton Prize - worth £ 800,000 - has gone to a 75-year - old Canadian philosopher whose life 's work has been to argue that dependence on a solely secular world view leads to faulty insights .
The philosopher , Charles Taylor , a former Rhodes scholar at Oxford and now holder of professorships at McGill University , in Montreal , and North - western University , Illinois , says : "" The divorce of natural science and religion has been damaging to both , but it is equally true that the culture of humanities and social sciences has often been surprisingly blind and deaf to the spiritual . ""
The Templeton Prize was founded in 1973 by the British - born philanthropist Sir John Templeton and was designed to underscore his belief that benefits from spiritual discoveries are quantifiably more vast than those from other worthy human endeavours .

"On 2nd May 2007 , Prince Philip , Duke of Edinburgh , bestowed the prestigious Templeton Prize for progress toward discoveries about spiritual realities on Professor Charles Taylor , the Canadian Philosopher .
For half a century , Charles Taylor has argued that those who pursue a secularist agenda alone prevent crucial insights which might otherwise help a global community exposed increasingly to clashes of culture , morality , nationality and religion .
Taylor 's key argument is that we need both secular and spiritual dimensions in discussions of public policy , history , linguistics , literature and every other facet of humanities and social sciences .
"" We urgently need new insight into the human propensity for violence , "" he states , "" including a full account of the human striving for meaning and spiritual direction , of which the appeals to violence are a perversion .
But we do n't even begin to see where we have to look as long as we accept the complacent myth that people like us - enlightened secularists or believers - are not part of the problem .
We will pay a high price if we allow this kind of muddled thinking to prevail . ""
He is right .
Avoiding future conflict requires engagement with all different ideologies without excluding or giving priority to one or other .
Government initiatives to work with faith bodies as well as humanists and secularists are intended precisely to formulate policy that fits all .
If we are to live within value systems we can all own , this engagement process needs to be inclusive .
Yes , it has problems ; power struggles have ensued among various faiths , which has had the effect of rubbishing multi - culture in the UK and , instead of focussing on the greater good , have instead chosen the path of self - promotion over the needs of their wider communities , ultimately increasing polarisation and community alienation .
They have played the religious identity card to promote out - dated ideologies rather than as a protective measure for self - respect .
But we must persevere .
It is only through such an inclusive process that the bigoted , antiquated injunctions of believers , seemingly immune to change , will engage with present challenges .
While the revelations of a religion and the words of holy scripture may remain fixed , interpretations change over time , as does the conduct of adherents .
And , when interpretation and conduct changes , for all practical purposes , the practice of religion changes , the moral code changes and culture evolves .
Conversely , if we exclude religion altogether , compounding the feeling of "" victimisation "" among the already narrow - minded , this bigotry remains locked in centuries past .
Including religion in public life also restricts the risk of unchecked materialism running rife through our social and legal systems .
Because the positive aspects of religion seek the meaning of life and a purpose beyond this world , they add a longer - term dimension to policy .
Morality is not the monopoly of religion alone and through interaction with secular and cross - faith ideologies it finds a new meaning in this increasingly global world .
According to Charles Taylor the worst thing is when people use moral certitude or religious belief in the name of battling injustice because they believe "" our cause is good , so we can inflict righteous violence .
"" We set out to destroy others ' way of life , blinded by our own self - righteousness .
Charles Taylor asks , "" What role does spiritual thinking have in the 21st century ? ""
Let us hope that cross - faith engagement along with the secularists and the humanists will bring about a greater respect in society ."
"1980
The president of Liberia , William Tolbert , is overthrown by Sergeant Samuel Doe after food price riots .
Charles Taylor is given the job of running the general services agency , where he controls much of Liberia 's budget .
Mr Taylor later falls out with President Doe , who accuses him of embezzling almost $ 1 m .
1989 Taylor invades Liberia with about 100 Libyan - trained troops , quickly gaining the support of the groups that had suffered under Mr Doe .
1990
A rival warlord , Prince Yormie Johnson , seizes , tortures and executes Mr Doe in front of video cameras .
But the end of Mr Doe 's corrupt , abusive regime fails to bring about stable democratic government .
Mr Johnson and Mr Taylor turn on each other , plunging Liberia into seven years of horrific civil war .
1997
Mr Taylor is elected president amid fears that conflict would resume if he lost .
His slogan during the campaign was : "" He killed my ma , he killed my pa , but I will vote for him "" .
1999
Liberia 's second civil war breaks out as rebels launch attacks in the north .
Mr Taylor accuses Guinea of supporting the rebellion .
Ghana , Nigeria and others accuse Mr Taylor of backing the Revolutionary United Front led by the notorious Foday Sankoh - the two men know each other from Libya where they received guerrilla training in the 1980s - in an equally vicious civil war in Sierra Leone .
2000 British , Guinean and United Nations troops intervene to crush the RUF , notorious for hacking off the hands and legs of civilians .
Mr Sankoh is arrested and handed over to the British .
He is eventually indicted along with Mr Taylor and others for their role in the Sierra Leone conflict .
2002
The special court for Sierra Leone is established by agreement between the UN and Sierra Leone .
The court has a mandate to "" prosecute persons who bear the greatest responsibility for serious violations of international humanitarian law and Sierra Leonean law "" in Sierra Leone since 1996 .
The crimes include killings , mutilations , rape and other forms of sexual violence , sexual slavery , the recruitment and use of child soldiers , abduction , and the use of forced labour by armed groups .
2003
Under international pressure to quit and hemmed in by rebels , Mr Taylor steps down and goes into exile in Nigeria .
The special court issues an arrest warrant for Mr Taylor for war crimes and crimes against humanity during the civil war in Sierra Leone .
He is charged on the basis of his alleged role as a major backer of the RUF and close association with a second warring faction , the Armed Forces Revolutionary Council .
Mr Sankoh dies from a stroke while awaiting trial .
2006
Mr Taylor is handed over to the court for trial after being arrested while trying to flee Nigeria .
After the special court 's request , the Netherlands agrees to the trial being held in The Hague amid fears that a trial in Freetown , Sierra Leone , would trigger unrest .
2007
Mr Taylor becomes the first African head of state to go on trial for serious crimes before an international criminal court ."
""
"The trial of Charles Taylor - the former president of Liberia and the first former African leader to face an international court - opens in The Hague today where he is accused of war crimes during the diamond - fuelled conflict in neighbouring Sierra Leone .
Human rights groups have welcomed the trial at a special court of international and Sierra Leonean judges as an important erosion of the climate of impunity that has encouraged atrocities in some of Africa 's most brutal wars .
The prosecutor will open the trial , which is expected to last for a year , by detailing 11 war crimes charges against Mr Taylor .
He is accused of forming a "" joint criminal enterprise "" by giving Sierra Leonean rebel groups weapons and training in return for access to the country 's diamond fields .
It alleges that Mr Taylor was complicit in the Revolutionary United Front rebel group 's campaign against civilians , which included mutilation , usually the chopping off of arms or hands , and the abduction of women and girls as sex slaves and men and boys as soldiers .
Many were held for years .
Mr Taylor , who ruled Liberia from 1997 to 2003 , has pleaded not guilty , saying he has immunity because he was a head of state at the time of the alleged crimes .
But at an earlier hearing , the court invoked the precedents of the Nuremberg and Tokyo war crimes trials , and the tribunals for Rwanda and the former Yugoslavia , to rule that immunity does not extend to crimes against humanity .
Mr Taylor faces up to life in prison if convicted .
Britain has offered to jail him .
The former Liberian president will not be called to account by the special court for the long list of crimes he is alleged to have committed in his own country during an equally brutal 14-year civil war .
Even so , Human Rights Watch , one of several groups that pressed for many years for Mr Taylor to be brought to justice , said the trial showed that leaders responsible for war crimes could be called to account .
"" To see someone [ tried ] of the standing of Charles Taylor , who has been associated with abuses throughout west Africa , is really significant , "" said Elise Keppler , legal counsel for the group 's international justice programme .
The court was jointly established by the Sierra Leonean government and the UN after a security council resolution in 2000 .
Mr Taylor was indicted in 2003 , but he sought refuge in Nigeria - which eventually agreed to extradite him .
Mr Taylor fled and was captured near Nigeria 's border with Cameroon .
He is being held at the Hague for fear that a trial in Sierra Leone could destabilise the country .
It is not his first stint in prison : in 1984 , he was jailed in the US on an extradition warrant for allegedly embezzling $ 922,000 from the Liberian government .
He escaped from a Massachusetts prison by sawing through a bar of his cell and sliding down a knotted sheet .
He resurfaced in Libya , establishing a relationship with Muammar Gadafy that proved fateful for Liberia and Sierra Leone .
Mr Taylor also met the future RUF leader , Foday Sankoh , at a military training camp in Libya .
After Mr Sankoh launched his insurgency in 1991 , he turned to Mr Taylor and Mr Gadafy for support , offering diamonds in exchange for weapons .
Although diamonds are not mined in Liberia , under Mr Taylor the country became a major diamond exporter .
Human rights groups also want Mr Taylor held to account for crimes in Liberia after his rebellion against the president , Samuel Doe , in 1989 .
Mr Doe was tortured to death by one of Mr Taylor 's allies , Prince Johnson .
A video of the killing sold well in west Africa .
But Mr Johnson split with Mr Taylor soon afterwards and seized control of the capital , Monrovia , prompting a long civil war underpinned by ethnic divisions ; Mr Taylor went on to exploit practices of ritual killings in Liberia to sow terror in his 14 year war for power ."
"Liberia 's former president Charles Taylor dramatically failed to appear at the start of his trial for war crimes in the Hague today , with his British lawyer walking out of the court after a furious row with the presiding judge .
The prolonged disruption marred what was meant to be an historic occasion as the first time a former African head of state was put on trial for crimes against humanity and war crimes .
During the exceptionally barbaric civil war in Sierra Leone between 1989 and 2001 , it is alleged Mr Taylor directed child soldiers , fuelled with drugs and alcohol , to kill their own parents in a conflict that saw tens of thousands of murders , mutilations and rapes .
The dominant , searing image was of people with their limbs or ears hacked off or eyes gouged out .
Mr Taylor 's counsel , Karim Khan , who was repeatedly threatened with contempt by Justice Julia Sebutinde , said he had been sacked because his client had lost confidence in the ability of the UN - backed court to try him fairly because of a lack of resources .
In a letter read out by Mr Khan , Mr Taylor declared that he recognised the court but wanted to represent himself .
He went on : "" It is with great regret that I must decline to attend any further proceedings in this case .
I can not participate in a charade that does no justice to the people of Liberia and Sierra Leone .
I choose not to be a figleaf of legitimacy for this court . ""
He complained that he had only one senior lawyer , compared to nine on the other side .
Although the judge directed Mr Khan to continue representing Mr Taylor for the opening address from the chief prosecutor , Stephen Rapp , Mr Khan insisted he could not .
As he made to leave the courtroom , the judge snapped at him : "" You do n't just get up and waltz out of here . ""
Mr Khan replied : "" I must , and I do apologise . ""
Mr Rapp insisted Mr Taylor had been given every assistance .
Mr Taylor , 59 , who has pleaded not guilty to 11 charges of war crimes and crimes against humanity , faces a maximum sentence of life imprisonment if convicted .

"While Tony Blair has recently enjoyed a new position as a Sierra Leonean paramount chief , other important events are taking place for the tiny West African country .
Today , the trial of former Liberian president Charles Taylor began in The Hague , although Mr Taylor himself failed to make an appearance .
Mr Taylor faces 11 counts of war crimes , crimes against humanity and other serious violations of international humanitarian law for his role in the decade - long civil war that engulfed Sierra Leone .
This trial , taking place at a special court for Sierra Leone , is part of the international community 's efforts to bring to justice those who bear the greatest responsibility for the atrocities committed .
Nine others from the three main factions involved in the war are also facing trial .
While many see the special court and the trial of Charles Taylor as a triumph for international justice , what , if anything , does this mean for justice in Sierra Leone ?
The president of Sierra Leone , Ahmad Tejan Kabbah , has stated on numerous occasions that justice is a prerequisite to ensuring peace in Sierra Leone .
He requested the creation of the special court on this basis .
But surely this can not be limited to justice as meted out by the special court .
Ensuring peace must mean creating a fair , humane and accessible justice system for all Sierra Leoneans , not just the 10 individuals tried before the special court .
As the Taylor trial begins and President Kabbah 's term in office comes to an end , it is worth looking at what his government has done to ensure justice in Sierra Leone .
Beyond the trial of Charles Taylor , is Sierra Leone well on its way towards a peaceful future , or a few steps away from a new conflict ?
The Truth and Reconciliation Commission ( TRC ) , created in 2002 , found that one of the root causes of the war was an absolute failure of governance , and that the government was largely irrelevant to the Sierra Leonean people .
Disturbingly , the TRC detected no sense of urgency among government officials to address the immense challenges facing the country , including those within the justice sector .
This is a deeply troubling revelation and a damning indictment against a government that has consistently espoused the need for justice to ensure lasting peace in Sierra Leone .
When the special court began operating in Freetown in 2003 , half a kilometre away in the Pademba Road maximum security prison hundreds of ex - combatants were waiting for their trials to begin in connection with war - related incidents .
Their detention and subsequent trials in 2005 were characterised by gross judicial abuses , detention without charges , a lack of defence counsel , the taking of statements under severe duress , and physical abuse that resulted in a number of deaths .
These lower ranking former rebels , some former child soldiers , faced the death penalty as an outcome of a trial with few , if any , judicial guarantees , Meanwhile , those considered "" most responsible "" were being tried at the special court , an international court where millions of dollars have been invested for prosecution , defence and the proper functioning of trials with no possibility of a death sentence .
The disparities were alarming in 2003 and remain the same today .
The international community has invested millions of dollars in improving the justice sector .
But without the leadership and commitment of the Kabbah government , change is exceedingly slow .
Appeals can not be heard because there is no paper to type out the trial record .
It can take months , even years to locate a case file as there is no discernible system of record keeping .
Court and prison officials appear to be motivated by bribes and little else .
In Pademba Road prison , it is not uncommon to find people serving four to five - year prison terms because they can not pay the alternative $ 150 fine .
This is not justice .
This is criminalising poverty .
Perhaps one of the most striking examples of the empty legacy of President Kabbah within the justice sector is that in Sierra Leone one can get the death penalty simply for being in the wrong place at the wrong time .
Take the case of nine former members of the Sierra Leone army .
In December 2004 , the high court convicted them of treason and sentenced them to death .
A number of those convicted were guilty only of being present at the barracks where the alleged treason attempt was made .
The death sentence was imposed two months after the TRC report recommended immediate abolition of the death penalty .
The government ignored these recommendations , although President Kabbah has apparently given reassurances that the death penalty will not be used .
That is little comfort for these men , living their lives in cells just steps away from the door that will lead them to their death , waiting for an appeal that the court seems to have no interest in hearing .
The Charles Taylor trial will be a massive step forward towards justice in Sierra Leone .
In August President Kabbah 's term in office finishes .
Some might say that his presidency has left behind many lasting legacies .
But ensuring justice for all Sierra Leoneans will certainly not be one of them .
And sadly , this does not bode well for the future of Sierra Leone ."
"Liberia 's former president , Charles Taylor , failed to appear at the opening of his trial for war crimes in The Hague yesterday , with his English lawyer walking out of the court after a furious row with the presiding judge .
The prolonged disruption , coupled with embarrassing procedural confusions , delayed the first ever trial of a former African head of state for crimes against humanity .
During the civil war in neighbouring Sierra Leone , between 1996 and 2002 , it is alleged that Mr Taylor supported the main rebel group there , the Revolutionary United Front , in order to exploit the country 's resources , especially diamonds , which were used to buy guns and ammunition .
He is accused of having directed child soldiers , fuelled with drugs and alcohol , to kill their parents in a conflict that saw tens of thousands of murders , mutilations and rapes .
Mr Taylor 's counsel , Karim Khan , who was repeatedly threatened with contempt by Justice Julia Sebutinde , said he had been sacked because his client had lost confidence in the ability of the UN - backed court to give him a fair trial .
The former warlord remained in his cell at the Scheveningen high security prison , 20 minutes away , where he has been held for the past year .
In a letter read out by Mr Khan , Mr Taylor said that he recognised the court but - in an echo of former Yugoslav president Slobodan Milosevic , who frustrated the efforts of war crimes prosecutors for more than four years - wanted to represent himself .
The judge repeatedly interrupted Mr Khan 's reading of the letter , saying : "" We are not interested in political speeches . ""
She directed Mr Khan to continue to represent Mr Taylor : "" You do n't just get up and waltz out of here .
Sanity will return to this court , "" she said .
Mr Khan replied : "" I must , and I do , apologise . ""
At the end of the day , however , the judge conceded that Mr Taylor 's legal team had not been given proper facilities , and that the blame for any delay lay with the court administration .
Setting out the broad charges against the former president , the chief prosecutor , Stephen Rapp , said the war in Sierra Leone was one of the "" ugliest in living memory - the very worst of what human beings are capable to do to one another "" .
Mr Taylor had engaged in a joint criminal plan to terrorise the people of Sierra Leone and bring death and destruction to that country .
With an inner circle of colleagues bearing nicknames such as Jungle , Superman , Baddie and Mosquito , his forces had forced women and girls to be sex slaves , pressed captured villagers into forced labour , recruited and corrupted children and looted and destroyed property .
But the most horrifying charges were the mutilations .
The court was told that the Taylor - backed forces would attack villages and kill at random .
Then "" the attackers would mutilate - amputating arms , limbs , gouging eyes - with children conscripted by the attackers killing their own parents "" , he said .
Giving more detail , Muhammad Bangula , the prosecuting attorney , told the court that hundreds of boys and girls were abducted as child soldiers after raids on their villages .
They were taken to training camps where the conditions were "" harsh beyond measure "" .
The children would be made to crawl on the ground while live bullets flew over their heads .
Those that survived were given military ranks , organised into the Small Boys ' Units and the Small Girls ' Unit , and sent into battle .
Mr Taylor does not deny that these events took place , but argues that he was not responsible for them and did not order others to carry them out .
But several of his closest associates are due to give evidence against him in return for immunity .
He has pleaded not guilty to 11 charges of war crimes and crimes against humanity and faces a maximum sentence of life imprisonment if convicted .
The UK has offered to jail him if he is found guilty .
This was part of the complex diplomatic efforts to move the trial to The Hague as it was felt that a trial in Freetown , Sierra Leone 's capital , could destabilise the region .
After leading a brutal rebel guerrilla campaign in Liberia , Mr Taylor was elected president in 1997 .
His autocratic rule led to further insurgencies and he was forced out of office in 2003 .
He sought refuge in Nigeria , but fled to the Cameroon border when Liberia 's new president , Ellen Shirleaf Johnson , asked for his extradition .
He was arrested after US pressure and handed over for trial .
The next hearing is due on June 25 , with evidence from the first of more than 130 witnesses .
The trial is expected to last up to 18 months ."
"The former Liberian president Charles Taylor , who is accused of war crimes , today appeared at a UN special court for the first time after previously boycotting the trial .
Mr Taylor , looking calm in a dark suit and pale tie , spoke only to re - enter a not guilty plea to a count of sexual slavery , which had been slightly reworded in an amended indictment .
"" I think he has got the message that he can not gain anything by absenting himself and that he gains from being present , "" the prosecutor , Stephen Rapp , told the Reuters agency from Sierra Leone .
Mr Taylor had earlier pleaded not guilty to 11 counts of war crimes and crimes against humanity , in connection with the 1991 - 2002 civil war in Sierra Leone .
An estimated 50,000 people died and thousands more had limbs hacked off as rebels mounted a reign of terror .
Mr Taylor sacked his lawyer when his trial opened in June before the UN - backed court of Sierra Leonean judges in The Hague .
At first he said he wanted to defend himself , but is now demanding a top lawyer .
Prosecutors plan to call dozens of witnesses they say will directly link Mr Taylor to the Sierra Leone rebels .
They claim he shipped rebels arms , ammunition and supplies such as alcohol and drugs used to intoxicate children who were then forced to fight .
In return he received diamonds , often mined by slave labourers , it is alleged .
He is suspected of similar atrocities in his native Liberia , but that country is holding a truth and reconciliation commission instead of a war crimes tribunal .
Mr Taylor is being tried in the Hague because of fears the trial would have triggered fresh unrest in Sierra Leone 's capital , Freetown , where the court is normally based .
At the start of his trial , Mr Taylor announced in a letter to the three - judge panel that he had fired his attorney .
He demanded a more senior trial attorney , arguing that prosecutors had far more lawyers on their team .
Mr Rapp dismissed Mr Taylor 's concerns as administrative issues "" blown out of proportion in order to create a reason for what we view as obstructive conduct in this case "" .
He said Mr Taylor was getting more money for his defence - up to $ 2 m ( £ 1 m ) for the trial - than any other suspect charged by the court ."
"Charles Taylor ends war crimes court boycott Former Liberian president Charles Taylor appeared in court yesterday for the first time since the start of his trial for alleged atrocities committed during Sierra Leone 's bloody 10-year civil war .
Mr Taylor did not explain his decision to attend the procedural hearing after earlier boycotting the trial .
The only time he spoke was to plead not guilty to a slightly amended charge of sexual slavery .
Mr Taylor has pleaded not guilty to 11 charges linked to accusations that he controlled and armed rebels who murdered , raped , mutilated and enslaved civilians during Sierra Leone 's civil war , which ended in 2002 .
Associated Press in The Hague Defence minister quits over Hiroshima gaffe Fumio Kyuma , Japan 's defence minister , resigned yesterday after suggesting that the second world war atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki , estimated now to account for 360,000 deaths , were inevitable .
He apologised , saying he was trying to express the thinking in the US at the time , but Japan 's official line rejects all use of nuclear arms .
His remarks bred anger , with Hiroshima bomb survivors saying he was not welcome at the next memorial event , and Nagasaki mayor Tomihisa Taue writing a protest letter .

"The prosecutor in the special Sierra Leone tribunal said today he was optimistic that the trial of Charles Taylor , the former Liberian president accused of war crimes , will proceed on schedule despite recent delays .
Stephen Rapp , formerly a US attorney in Iowa , told Guardian Unlimited that Mr Taylor 's trial should resume at The Hague next month .
"" I see the trial proceeding , "" Mr Rapp said during a visit to London .
"" The challenge is that he needs a new defence team .
The judge has ordered legal aid to be substantially increased to $ 100,000 a month and work is under way to get that team in place this month for the next session on August 20 . ""
Mr Taylor sacked his lawyer when his trial opened in June and boycotted the special UN - backed court because , he said , he wanted a stronger legal team .
Mr Taylor subsequently appeared before the court last week to re - enter a not guilty plea to a count of sexual slavery , which had been slightly reworded in an amended indictment .
The special court has since agreed to a new "" financial package "" of $ 100,000 ( £ 50,000 ) a month so that he can hire a top legal team for his defence .
The 59-year - old Mr Taylor could go through $ 2 m depending on how long his trial takes .
Estimates range from 12 to 18 months .
Mr Taylor faces 11 charges of war crimes and crimes against humanity for allegedly backing the Revolutionary United Front , a rebel group that killed , maimed and raped thousands of Sierra Leoneans during a war that lasted 11 years and ended in 2002 after British military intervention .
If Mr Taylor is found guilty , he is likely to spend the rest of his life in a British jail .
Today , the court is expected to initial an agreement with the British authorities for the UK to accept him as a prisoner .
The court has been criticised for being too expensive and too slow in bringing people to trial .
Set up in 2002 , the ad - hoc court consisting of international and Sierra Leonean judges issued its first verdicts last month , when three militia leaders were found guilty of war crimes , including mutilation , rape and the use of child soldiers in Sierra Leone 's civil war .
The court made legal history as it was the first time an international tribunal ruled on the charge of recruitment of child soldiers .
The president of the special court , Justice George Gelaga King , rejected charges of slowness .
"" When the special court was set up in 2002 , it had to start from scratch .
It was given 11 and a half acres of virgin jungle land , there was no electricity and no water .
It took time to put facilities in place , "" he said .
"" The court ought to be commended for working in difficult and adverse circumstances . ""
The cost of the court from 2002 to 2009 , when it is expected to wind up , is put at $ 102 m .
Some Sierra Leoneans wonder whether the money could have been better spent on rebuilding their shattered country rather than on a court where three - quarters of the judges are foreign .
Holding Mr Taylor 's trial at The Hague has added to the costs , but it was felt by the Sierra Leonean government and the UN security council that holding the trial in Freetown , where the court is based , would be too dangerous .
Both the Liberian and Sierra Leonean governments feared that a trial in west Africa might spark fresh unrest by rousing Mr Taylor 's supporters , many of whom are former child soldiers .
"" There is peace in Sierra Leone , but the situation is not 100 % stable , "" said Judge King .
"" It is very delicate . ""
Human rights groups have also faulted the tribunal for failing to spread the word to the public in Sierra Leone and Liberia about its work .
"" It 's important for people to know that Charles Taylor is being held to account , "" said Tania Bernath , an Amnesty International researcher on Sierra Leone .
If people are failing to get the correct information from the tribunal , she said , Taylor supporters in Liberia could manipulate public opinion .
There have been rumours , for example , that Mr Taylor is being starved by the court .
Part of the reason for members of the special court visiting London and other capitals is to raise money .
The court depends on voluntary contributions , with the US and the UK stumping up two - thirds of the money .
The court needs to raise more cash or it will run out by the end of October .
"" We need $ 89 m over the next three years , "" Mr Rapp said .
"" Of the $ 89 m we 've raised $ 26 - 27 m , so there 's $ 60 m to go .
It does involve me talking to people and telling them why it 's important for countries to support the court . """
"Liberia has lifted a self - imposed moratorium on the mining , sale and export of diamonds , which had been in place for six years , government officials said .
Liberia 's diamonds came under United Nations sanctions in May 2001 , when then - president Charles Taylor 's government was accused of using revenues from the stones to fuel war in neighbouring Sierra Leone .
In an effort to show compliance , Liberia placed a moratorium on all mining activities .
The UN lifted sanctions in April .
The current president , Ellen Johnson - Sirleaf , was elected after the war ended two years ago ."
"Judges today agreed to delay until January the trial of the former Liberian president Charles Taylor on war crimes charges .
The trial at The Hague - the first time an African leader has faced an international tribunal - was to have restarted this month .
Mr Taylor faces 11 charges of war crimes and crimes against humanity for allegedly backing the Revolutionary United Front , a rebel group that killed , maimed and raped thousands of people in neighbouring Sierra Leone during a war that lasted 11 years .
The conflict ended in 2002 after Tony Blair sent British troops to help the government in Freetown .
Mr Taylor , who attended today 's hearing , sacked his defence team when his trial opened in June and boycotted the special UN - backed court , saying he wanted stronger legal representation .
Judge Julia Sebutinde said the demand was a fair one , noting that the prosecution had left it unchallenged .
"" In the chamber 's view , the period of four months is indeed a reasonable time ... to grapple with a complicated case , "" she said .
Mr Taylor 's new chief defence counsel , Courtenay Griffiths , a British lawyer , said : "" We are anxious to get on with this trial .
We appreciate the accused has spent a considerable amount of time in custody
and we appreciate that there are other pressures on this court .
Time allowed now will help reduce the length of the trial in due course , and save money . ""
Since the trial opened , the special court has agreed to a new "" financial package "" of $ 100,000 ( £ 50,000 ) a month so that Mr Taylor can hire a top legal team for his defence .
The 59-year - old could spend up to $ 2 m , depending on how long his trial takes .
Estimates range from 12 to 18 months .
Mr Griffiths said prosecutors had submitted some 40,000 pages of material for examination , and a further 50,000 pages of potentially crucial material from Mr Taylor 's personal archives had surfaced in Liberia .
If Mr Taylor is found guilty , he is likely to spend the rest of his life in a British jail .
The court has been criticised for being too expensive and too slow in bringing people to trial .
Set up in 2002 , the ad hoc court , consisting of international and Sierra Leonean judges , issued its first verdicts in June , when it found three militia leaders guilty of war crimes including mutilation , rape and the use of child soldiers in Sierra Leone 's civil war .
In doing so , it made legal history .
It was the first time an international tribunal had ruled on the charge of recruitment of child soldiers .
Mr Taylor 's trial is being held at The Hague because of fears it could lead to instability if held in Freetown .
On Saturday , Sierra Leone held its first elections since UN peacekeepers left , two years ago ."
"Whenever a head of state or government faces trial these days , human rights activists say the event is unprecedented .
Slobodan Milosevic 's trial was "" ground - breaking "" ; the conviction of Jean Kambanda of Rwanda was "" historic "" ; the trial of Charles Taylor of Liberia was "" a break with the past "" .
No surprise , therefore , that Human Rights Watch welcomed Alberto Fujimori 's extradition from Chile to his native Peru , where he will stand trial next month , saying it was "" the first time that a court has ordered the extradition of a former head of state to be tried for gross human rights violations in his home country "" .
It is true that , in the past , ex - leaders have usually been handed over for trial by the same politicians who overthrew them , not by the courts .
Milosevic was sent to The Hague in 2001 by his enemies in the government of Serbia , in contravention of a court order issued against his extradition by the Yugoslavian constitutional court .
However , the illegality of that transfer did not trouble Human Rights Watch at the time , which welcomed the appearance in the dock of a man whom , like Fujimori , it had already proclaimed to be guilty .
But there is nothing new about trials of former heads of state as such .
Fujimori is the 24th head of state to face criminal trial for acts of state since Charles
I was executed in 1649 , and there have also been numerous additional trials of heads of government .
Yet in three centuries of trials of former political leaders , there has not been a single acquittal .
In the grim words of Danton to a French exile who returned from England to help Louis XVI 's defence in 1792 , "" Can one save a king who is on trial ?
He is dead as soon as he appears in front of his judges . ""
Erich Honecker and Slobodan Milosevic are the only ex - leaders to have escaped conviction - the former by being about to die , the latter by actually dying during his trial .
This 0 % acquittal rate is due to the fact that the trials are organised by victorious regimes against defeated ones .
The conviction of the old leader is an essential source of legitimacy for the new one .
Just as the new international tribunals are run by the great powers to justify their doctrine of military and judicial interventionism against weak and third world states , so the original prosecutions against Fujimori in 2000 were not brought by the Peruvian police but by the then president himself , Alejandro Toledo .
Toledo forced his governments to file more than 60 charges against Fujimori , indicting him for everything from his resignation in 2000 to the purchase of tractors from China while in office .
Yet Toledo is hardly a neutral figure .
He led the opposition against Fujimori and he was still clinging on to power when Fujimori announced he would return to Peru to stand for election last year .
Fujimori 's detention in Chile on the Peruvian warrant torpedoed that challenge .
Trials of ex - leaders are often used by a victorious regime to cover up its own crimes .
The Americans phrased the prosecution of Saddam Hussein in such a way that the invasion of Kuwait in 1990 could be regarded as a crime but not the invasion of Iran in 1979 .
Although the latter cost a million lives , the Americans presumably did not want their support for Iraq then to be discussed in court .
Fujimori 's trial will now take place under the aegis of President Alan García , whom Fujimori defeated in 1990 .
When García was first president ( 1985 - 90 ) , far more Maoist guerrillas were killed than under Fujimori , who in fact brought Peru 's dirty civil war to an end .
But it is "" El Chino "" who will be prosecuted for human rights abuses , not García .
Fujimori is being accused of corruption as well , which was also more rampant under García .
The guilt of the defendant is often pre - announced in such trials .
In 1941 in France , Marshal Pétain said publicly that the Third Republic prime ministers , Edouard Daladier and Léon Blum , were guilty before their trial had started , and insisted that the court 's job was simply to dole out the appropriate sentences .
Both Fujimori 's successor and predecessor as president have declared him guilty , as have the world 's main human rights organisations - Amnesty , Human Rights Watch and the Inter - American Commission on Human Rights - who are in fact his main accusers .
They seem uninterested in the presumption of innocence , and the media generally do not question the accusations .
However inevitable their conviction , former leaders often seem to relish their day in court .
Vidkun Quisling of Norway in 1945 and Monsignor Tiso of Slovakia in 1947 both spoke for two whole days at their trials .
They were shot shortly thereafter .
Ex - leaders often make pompous appeals to the world outside and say that history will be their judge - although when the Greek military leader , George Papadopoulos , tried this in 1975 , the judge snapped back : "" Do you think history is absent from this courtroom ? ""
Alberto Fujimori has many supporters in Peru , and maybe he will adopt this strategy .
If it succeeds , that really will be unprecedented .

"A Secular Age by Charles Taylor 874pp , Harvard , £ 25.95
In March this year , Charles Taylor joined Mother Teresa , Billy Graham and Aleksander Solzhenitsyn as a winner of the Templeton prize for progress toward research or discoveries about spiritual realities .
Not only did the award make the professor emeritus of philosophy at Montreal 's McGill University nearly £ 800,000 richer , it also brought him into the crosshairs of Richard Dawkins who , in his 2006 bestseller The God Delusion , argued that the Templeton involved "" a very large sum of money given [ ... ] usually to a scientist who is prepared to say something nice about religion "" .
The implication was that any professor prepared to have their palm thus greased was intellectually dishonest .
Now comes Taylor 's thumping great volume ( weighing in at 1.3 kilos to The God Delusion 's 730 g ) in which he traces the story of faith 's decline and of how learned despisers of religion such as Dawkins became not only possible but popular .
It has one big question .
"" Why , "" asks Taylor at the outset , "" was it virtually impossible not to believe in God in say , 1500 in our western society , while in 2000 many of us find this not only easy but even inescapable ? ""
In 1500 , our ancestors thought the natural world testified to divine purpose .
Floods , plagues , periods of fertility and flourishing were seen as acts of God .
Now "" acts of God "" is a dead metaphor used by lawyers .
How did that happen ?
In the following 800-plus pages he tries to provide an answer that only a fool would deride as intellectually dishonest .
The Templeton guys probably really like A Secular Age .
True , it hardly amounts to research into spiritual realities ( whatever that means ) , but Taylor hints obligingly at a time in which secularism 's "" hegemony of the mainstream master narrative "" could be over ( a great elucidator of Hegel , Taylor does n't so much turn a phrase as let it curdle in philosophical jargon ) .
They will also no doubt like the fact that Taylor is highly critical of so - called "" subtraction stories "" , those Whig versions of secularism 's history , whereby human nature steadily casts off its shackles of ignorance and superstition , finally emerging from a Bastille of the mind into the bright morning of truth .
Taylor 's account is much more complicated .
There is chronology , but hardly a straightforward narrative that might explain why the only recent bestseller about religion was written by a vituperative atheist .
One might think that the cumulative impact of the Reformation , Renaissance , Enlightenment and myriad scientific revolutions was to make it possible to think about the material world without reference to any transcendent power ( Taylor calls this the "" immanent frame "" ) , but that is not the whole story .
He argues that the west has been changed by what he calls a "" nova effect "" : once a humanistic alternative to the transcendent frame established itself , it spawned an ever - widening variety of moral and spiritual positions , in the professor 's words , "" across the span of the thinkable and perhaps even beyond "" .
Let 's stay with the thinkable .
What 's especially compelling about Taylor 's , admittedly sometimes long - winded , book is his charge that cracks in Christianity provided places where secularism 's weeds flourished .
In this he 's not just talking about the reformation , but , for example , the movement called deism , prominent in 17th- and 18th - century Britain , France and America , which rejected the theistic position ( common in Judaism , Islam and much Christianity ) that relied on revelation in sacred scriptures or the testimony of others .
Instead , deism drew the existence and nature of God from reason and personal experience .
Deism , of course , for some became a way - station from theism to atheism , but not for all .
From deism , Taylor shifts focus to what he calls the west 's current age of authenticity .
By this he means an individualistic era in which people are encouraged to find their own way or do their own thing .
The idea that one had to use one 's own reason and experience to find God instilled a sense of intellectual autonomy that led some to abandon God altogether . ""
As a result , "" writes Taylor , "" the nova effect has been intensified .
We are now living in a spiritual super - nova , a kind of galloping pluralism on the spiritual plane . ""
Paradoxically , that gallop leads some of us back to communal worship and to yearn for something more than the self - sufficient power of reason .
Some long for ultimate meaning , and that longing may end with God .
God , Taylor tells us , is always breaking in , stepping through the immanent frame of secularism .
But when God makes his appearance , Taylor finds , he sounds just like Peggy Lee , singing ""
Is That
All There Is ? "" .
Secularism , he charges , has left us leading hollow , atomised lives , devoid of what he ( to my mind bafflingly ) calls "" fullness "" .
To be sure , Taylor allows that some atheists find "" fullness "" , by which he may mean human dignity and meaning , in the absence of a comprehensible God .
Camus , for instance , suggests in his writings that this sense of humans facing a meaningless , hostile universe and rising to the challenge of devising our own rules of life can be inspiring .
It may even serve to fill the God - shaped hole Taylor sometimes implies lies in the atheist 's breast .
He is at his best when finding God breaking into art , eloquently analysing the intimations of transcendence in Wordsworth 's poetry and Wagner 's music and why those two artists might be so important in our increasingly godless times .
Intriguingly , he argues too that there are certain works of art - Dante , Bach , Chartres cathedral - "" whose power seems inseparable from their epiphanic , transcendent reference .
Here the challenge to the unbeliever is to find a non - theistic register in which to respond to them , without impoverishment . ""
But the unbeliever need n't respond to that challenge : even secularists , if we have learned anything from Taylor 's book , must realise that we are haunted by the ghost of God .
As a result , we are capable of responding in a theistic register to Bach , Dante and Chartres without ( necessarily ) believing in God .
On such occasions , Taylor is too shrill in insisting on secularism 's purported impoverishment of sensibility .
It recalls Keats 's accusation that Newton destroyed the beauty of the rainbow by explaining it .
In Dawkins 's Unweaving the Rainbow , the zoologist retorted that science does not destroy , but rather discovers poetry in the patterns and laws of nature .
It is at least arguable that godless science is enchanting rather than disenchanting .
What 's more , the godless may not be in the sometimes glum state Taylor fears .
He should have attended more closely to Peggy Lee .
She did n't only ask "" is that all there is ? "" .
She also answered her own question , singing "" if that 's all there is , then let 's keep dancing "" .
It is not a song lamenting a lack of God or ultimate meaning .
Instead , it was an indomitable , scornful , humanistic shrug at a world abandoned by God and filled with other disappointments .
It would n't have won Peggy Lee the Templeton prize , true ; but , if it is n't quite atheistic , then it 's in tune with the secular age that Taylor diagnoses , for the most part , well ."

"The trial of the former Liberian president Charles Taylor was reopened today , six months after the dictator boycotted the opening session .
Taylor , the first former African leader to face an international court , is accused of orchestrating war crimes committed by militias during Sierra Leone 's civil war .
The 59-year - old faces 11 charges , including murder , rape , enslavement and conscription of child soldiers .
He is also accused of forming a "" joint criminal enterprise "" by giving Sierra Leonean rebel groups weapons and training in return for access to the country 's diamonds .
"" This is a huge moment as a former head of state is being tried for these most serious crimes , "" said Elise Keppler , the legal counsel for Human Rights Watch 's international justice programme .
"" For crimes like that to be committed with impunity would be a travesty . ""
Today , Ian Smillie , a Canadian expert on the international trade in blood diamonds , began proceedings at the International Criminal Court in The Hague as the prosecution 's first witness .
He told the three - judge panel how diamonds had fuelled much of the violence in Sierra Leone and briefed the court on the country 's history .
The prosecution alleges that Taylor was complicit in the Revolutionary United Front rebel group 's campaign against civilians during Sierra Leone 's 10-year civil war , which ended in 2003 .
The group is widely understood to have been responsible for mass mutilations , usually by chopping off arms or hands , and the abduction of women and girls as sex slaves .
Taylor , who ruled Liberia from 1997 to 2003 , has pleaded not guilty to all the charges .
Since firing his attorney six months ago , he has appointed a team led by the British lawyer Courtenay Griffiths .
The former dictator , who faces life in prison if convicted , claims that because he was head of state at the time of the alleged crimes , he has immunity to prosecution .
Today , Taylor , who was wearing a grey suit and tie and gold - rimmed glasses , listened carefully to proceedings but showed no emotion as his trial resumed .
The complex hearing is expected to last nearly two years .
An appeal could carry the legal process into 2010 .
Smillie was the first of 144 prosecution witnesses , although trial attorneys expect only half of them to appear in person .
Nearly 60 witnesses will be called to draw links between Taylor and the militias , with most expected to do so anonymously for fear of reprisals by Taylor 's supporters .
"" I think they 're desperate , "" Griffiths said today .
"" Let us now see what the firm concrete evidence is that he [ Taylor ] was directly involved ordering the atrocities in Sierra Leone . """
"The trial of the first African leader to be prosecuted for international war crimes finally got under way today when the former Liberian president Charles Taylor entered the dock at a special tribunal in The Hague after months of wrangling and boycotts .
In what is being seen as a key test for the efficacy of international justice , the prosecution launched its lengthy attempt to put the 59-year - old former warlord and head of state behind bars , probably in Britain , for alleged war crimes in Sierra Leone .
Taylor - previously convicted of embezzlement in the US - is pleading innocent to 11 counts of war crimes and crimes against humanity .
The court has been set up especially to deal with the atrocities perpetrated during Sierra Leone 's 11-year civil war , which was ended by British military intervention , ordered by Tony Blair , in 2002 .
Taylor , accused of being deeply complicit in the war in neighbouring Sierra Leone in order to profit from the wrecked country 's diamonds trade , is alleged to have encouraged mass murder , the sexual enslavement of girls , mass rape , the recruitment of child armies , and the systematic amputation of limbs , all with the aim of terrorising civilian populations .
He is the first former head of state from Africa to stand trial as a war crimes suspect .
Human Rights Watch , which has long lobbied for an end to the impunity commonly enjoyed by dictators and warlords in leading political positions , described the start of the case as a huge moment . ""
A former head of state is being tried for these most serious crimes , "" Elise Keppler , a lawyer with the pressure group 's international justice programme , said .
Taylor , who was the president of Liberia for six years until 2003 , was indicted in the same year and arrested while attempting to flee Nigeria in 2006 .
Before winning power in Liberia , he spent 14 years engaged in vicious conflict in his own country and then , as the Liberian leader , supported the rebel army of the late Foday Sankoh in Sierra Leone .
He allegedly supplying weapons to the insurgents in return for access to the lucrative diamond mines of Sierra Leone .
Taylor is alleged to have operated in cahoots with some of the world 's most notorious arms traders , such as Viktor Bout or Leonid Minin , traffickers from the former Soviet Union who enjoyed extensive links with former KGB mafias .
The prosecution launched its case today with testimony from Ian Smillie , a Canadian expert on the "" blood diamonds "" rackets .
However , it suffered an early setback when the panel of judges supported Taylor 's defence objections that Smillie was not qualified to testify about atrocities allegedly linked to the former president .
The trial opened last June amid scenes of chaos , with Taylor boycotting the court , sacking his defence lawyer and refusing to acknowledge the tribunal 's legitimacy , triggering a six - month adjournment .
As a result of his complaints , the judges doubled the funding available for his defence to £ 50,000 a month despite the widespread suspicion that Taylor is a multi - millionaire .
The trial is being held in The Hague because of fears it could destabilise Liberia , where the special tribunal is based .
The judges are keen to finish the case by the end of next year to avoid the kind of mishaps that have affected some of the trials at the Yugoslav war crimes tribunal , also held in The Hague ."

"The brutality of civil war in Sierra Leone was described by a survivor testifying at the international war crimes trial of former Liberian president Charles Taylor in The Hague yesterday .
The courtroom in the Netherlands heard evidence from Alex Tamba Teh , a churchman from Sierra Leone .
He told the trial of watching young men cut off the hands and feet of another teenager , hearing women being raped , and unloading weapons for rebels from a Liberian helicopter .
Taylor , the 59-year - old former warlord turned head of state , has pleaded not guilty to 11 charges of war crimes and crimes against humanity , including mass murder , the sexual enslavement of girls , mass rape , the recruitment of child armies , and the systematic amputation of limbs .
He is also accused of fuelling the civil war in neighbouring Sierra Leone to profit from the country 's million - pound diamond trade .
Tamba Teh , 47 , said he was part of a group of 250 civilians captured by rebels in April 1998 in the diamond - mining district of Kono .
He was brought before a group of 30 rebel commanders and narrowly survived a vote against killing him , before being taken to a rebel camp where captured women were repeatedly raped and forced to forage for food .
The men were separated from women and children , and taken to a shelter near a mosque .
There , a rebel commander , known as Rocky , told the churchman to pray for his fellow captives .
Rocky then shot them all with a machine gun and later told another commander called "" Rambo "" that he had killed 101 men . ""
After he had killed the civilians ... he gave instructions that they be decapitated , "" said Tamba Teh .
He went on to describe how a group of child soldiers known as a Small Boys Unit beheaded the corpses with machetes and cutlasses , although some were too small to lift the guns they were carrying .
The churchman did not give evidence of any solid links between Taylor and the rebels he is accused of supporting , particularly the Revolutionary United Front , or RUF .
Taylor , the first African president to be tried by an international court , sat calmly throughout the testimony , taking notes and sipping water .
Taylor was president of Liberia for six years until 2003 .
He was indicted that same year and later arrested while attempting to flee Nigeria in 2006 .
Before coming to power in Liberia , he spent 14 years engaged in vicious conflict in his own country and then , as Liberian leader , supported the rebel army of the late Foday Sankoh in Sierra Leone , allegedly supplying weapons to the insurgents in return for access to the country 's lucrative diamond mines .
The trial opened last June , with Taylor boycotting the court and refusing to acknowledge the tribunal 's legitimacy , triggering a six - month adjournment .
It is being held in The Hague because of fear that it could destabilise Liberia ."
"A commander in Charles Taylor 's militia has told a war crimes trial that the former Liberian president ordered his fighters to eat their enemies , including UN peacekeepers , as a means of terrorising the population .
Joseph "" Zigzag ""
Marzah , chief of operations for Taylor who is on trial at The Hague , also testified that he oversaw horrific crimes such as cutting the babies out of pregnant women , and that the former president told his men that their enemies "" are no longer human beings "" .
Taylor , 59 , has pleaded not guilty to 11 counts of war crimes and crimes against humanity at a special international court over his collaboration with anti - government rebels in Sierra Leone , which borders Liberia .
But in establishing the record of Taylor 's leadership of a rebellion in his own country before he finally won power in 1997 , Marzah this week described a reign of terror .
Marzah , who led the Death Squad group of killers , said many of the victims of cannibalism were members of the Krahn people of the then Liberian president , Samuel Doe , who Taylor was attempting to overthrow .
But those eaten also included soldiers from UN and West African "" Ecomog "" peacekeeping forces . ""
He said we should eat them ...
Even the UN white people - he said we could use them as pork to eat , "" Marzah told the court .
"" We ate a few [ Ecomog soldiers ] , but not many .
But many were executed , about 68 . ""
He said Taylor said eating people "" set an example for the people to be afraid "" .
Taylor 's defence lawyer asked Marzah how the fighters would "" prepare a human being for the pot "" .
The former commander described decapitating , carving up , cleaning and cooking corpses seasoned with salt and pepper .
"" We slit your throat , butcher you ... throw away the head , take the flesh and put it in a pot ...
Charles Taylor knows that , "" said Marzah .
He told the court how rebel leaders who fell out with Taylor met a terrible end .
The former commander described dismembering the body of another rebel leader known as Superman and then taking his hand to Taylor who gave him "" cigarette money "" in return .
Marzah said the pair then cooked and ate Superman 's liver .
Marzah said that he had killed so many men , women and children he had lost count .
He described drowning and bludgeoning babies to death and murdering women with penknives .
He said that when he was serving with Taylor 's rebel National Patriotic Front of Liberia he had established checkpoints on roads using human intestines and severed heads mounted on sticks .
Asked whether Taylor knew about this , Marzah replied : "" He was aware .
He made us understand that you have to play with human blood so that enemies would be afraid . ""
Asked how he felt about these actions now , Marzah said : "" I regret nothing "" .
Although Taylor is not on trial for those crimes the testimony that he encouraged barbaric acts will undercut his attempts to distance himself from rebels in Sierra Leone who he supported as Liberia 's president and who were also responsible for crimes such as mutilation , mass rape and murder .
Taylor is accused , among other things , of laundering funds for the Revolutionary United Front by selling diamonds mined by forced labour and using the proceeds to buy weapons smuggled to the rebels in Sierra Leone .
Marzah testified that he took weapons stored at Taylor 's presidential mansion and delivered them to Sierra Leone in return for diamonds that he brought back to Taylor .
The RUF was notorious for hacking the limbs off of civilians in the 11-year civil war that ended in 2002 after British military intervention .
Taylor was overthrown five years ago and fled into exile in Nigeria which handed him over to the special international court for Sierra Leone under pressure from the US and other countries .
Taylor 's trial was moved to The Hague because of fears his presence in Sierra Leone could renew instability ."
"A Long Way Gone : Memoirs of a Boy Soldier , written and read by Ishmael Beah ( 8½hrs unabridged , Isis , £ 26.99 )
When Ishmael , aged 12 , his older brother , Junior , and a schoolfriend , Talloi , say goodbye to friends and family in their Sierra Leone village in 1993 to take part in a talent contest in Mattru Jong ( they 're budding rap artists ) , they are unaware that this is the last time they 'll see any of them .
For two years the rebels of the Revolutionary United Front , founded by Charles Taylor of Liberia ( who is currently on trial in The Hague for war crimes ) , have been burning and butchering their way through the country .
Beah 's village is overrun , the survivors flee , and so begins Ishmael 's quest ( Junior and Talloi have disappeared ) to be reunited with his family .
He 's not alone .
The jungles of Sierra Leone are full of lost children desperate for food , and even more desperate to avoid capture by the RUF , whose brutality is legendary .
The only alternative is to enlist as a boy soldier with the regular army , who , it turns out , are every bit as brutal as the rebels .
Military life is divided into three activities : frontline killing , watching war films ( "" We all wanted to be like Rambo "" ) and taking drugs - marijuana and brown - brown , a mixture of cocaine and gunpowder .
This is not for the squeamish : some of the massacres Ishmael witnesses and participates in are spinechilling , but you 'd be pushed to find a truer or more powerfully told eyewitness account of the reality , cruelty and futility of war .
Rathcormick :
A Childhood Recalled , by Homan Potterton , read by Gerry O'Brien ( 9½hrs unabridged , Soundings , £ 26.99 )
And now , as they say , for something completely different - so different that it 's hard to believe that these two boyhood memoirs describe the lives of children living on the same planet .
Homan is the youngest of eight children growing up in the 1950s at Rathcormick , a Georgian farmhouse in County Meath that has been inhabited over the last 300 years by 10 generations of Pottertons .
It 's the sort of old - fashioned childhood - bicycles , picnics , holidays by the sea , eccentric relatives - that you associate with Enid Blyton , except that there is n't a single adventure of any kind .
Unless you count Mr Potterton , referred to by the family as "" Himself "" , driving his Ford Prefect at 30 miles an hour in the middle of the road to avoid being hit by stray croquet balls from the gardens he passes .
The Pottertons are protestants , but not the snooty Anglo - Irish kind of protestants with titles .
Mrs Potterton wins the bottled fruit prize at the local show every year with the same jar of pickled pears , and every December puts the bottle of Sanatogen Tonic Wine her husband has given her for Christmas on the same shelf in the pantry .
It 's not exactly life 's rich tapestry , but the author 's dry wit , elegant style and fascination with domestic minutiae somehow keep you gripped .
The Last Cigarette , written and read by Simon Gray ( 4¾hrs abridged , Faber , £ 14.99 )
This is the third in Gray 's series
The Smoking Diaries ( the first two are coming out later this year -
no , do n't ask me why audio publishers do things backwards ) , but if you count his other autobiographical books , this is his seventh published diary .
So why , you may ask , should we be interested in how a second - division playwright ( albeit one with premier - division playwright friends such as Pinter and Stoppard , to whom he refers constantly ) manages to quit smoking ?
Because he 's a very good diary writer - nearly as good as Tony Benn .
There 's an art to describing what you 've done on holiday , why you do n't want to commit suicide , what Pinter sounds like when he 's angry ( terrifying ) .
It 's clearly what stops Gray turning into a grumpy old man and becoming a very funny and entertaining grumpy old diarist instead .
It helps enormously that he 's reading it - grumpily , of course ."

"There have been pre - emptive complaints that the indictment of Sudanese president Omar al - Bashir and his governmental accomplices for crimes against humanity would make diplomacy more difficult .
People said the same thing about Slobodan Milosevic and Liberia 's amputator - in - chief Charles Taylor .
In all three cases , the argument does not hold water .
Diplomacy , without the big stick , without the hint of handcuffs , is having little or no success at all in stopping Bashir 's murderous recidivism .
In fact , the years of envoys queuing up for audiences with Milosevic simply persuaded him that he was so indispensable that he could carry on killing with no personal consequences .
The International Criminal Court ( ICC ) had already indicted Bashir 's surrogates in Darfur .
It would certainly be a travesty of justice not to follow up the chain of command and indict the man without whom none of these massacres would have been possible .
We still have judgement here , that we but teach Bloody instructions which , being taught , return To plague th'inventor .
Macbeth mused these words while contemplating ordering the death of Duncan .
At least , in the end , he and the missus had the courage to do the deed themselves and paid for it .
But no one ever saw any of our latter - day genocidaires walking the balconies of their presidential homes wrestling with their consciences .
At least in part , that was because they thought they had impunity .
Killing a king may have consequences , but what are a few million peasants , trade unionists or scribblers to a sovereign statesman ?
Ban Ki - moon 's statement recognised the independence of the ICC prosecutor – a concept that may be a shock to many of the regimes he has had to deal with .
And the secretary - general will persist in trying to talk to Bashir in an attempt to get him do the right thing , but the talking will be done by phone .
Bashir 's travels to many parts of the world will be circumscribed until a one way ticket to the Hague can be arranged by the next coup in Khartoum .
Sadly , however , if he can get a non - stop flight to New York he will be fine , since , for increasingly obvious reasons , the Bush administration does not accept the ICC 's jurisdiction .
While the White House 's handpicked attorneys have provided legal opinions to authorise torture , rendition and similarly Cheneyesque deeds , most lawyers in the Pentagon and the US state department are well aware that those idiosyncratic opinions have little or no currency in the rest of the democratic world .
US top brass have been warned to be careful where they travel .
Over indiscreet drinks at an international conference a few years ago , a US official explained Washington 's resistance to the ICC by recounting that French police detained Henry Kissinger at the airport in Paris on a warrant issued over his responsibility for the Chilean coup and subsequent killings .
It took top - level calls from Washington to get him out , he complained .
One of the few positive auguries as the 20th century came to its sanguinary end was the ending of impunity , so that the Pinochets , Sharons , Kissingers and their ilk had to consult their lawyers as well as their travel agents before they set off on journeys .
In fact , Kissinger should have been arraigned for much more , from East Timor to Central America .
The time has passed that so - called statesmen could wash their hands of the crimes they ordered .
As that Scottish coup practitioner , Macbeth , recognised : Will all great Neptune 's ocean wash this blood Clean from my hand ?
No , this my hand will rather The multitudinous seas incarnadine , Making the green one red .
It may make sovereign torturers , kidnappers and murderers see red , but they deserve no more immunity or impunity than any other criminal conspirators ."
"The son of former Liberian president Charles Taylor ran a security force in his father 's government with a brutal agenda marked by the beating , burning and beheading of people opposed to his rule , a federal prosecutor said Monday during a landmark torture trial in Miami .
Charles "" Chuckie "" Taylor Jr , born in Boston and raised in Orlando , Florida , was tapped by his father to command an anti - terrorist unit called the Demon Forces that cut a man 's penis with a sharp knife before dumping him in a dirt pit , Justice Department prosecutor Christopher Graveline said in opening statements .
"" You will hear witness after witness tell about the fear they felt when they heard that name , "" Graveline said , referring to the nickname , "" Chuckie , "" that Taylor went by in Liberia from 1999 to 2003 when he served as a security - force boss .
The Miami criminal case - taking place at the same time the father faces a war crimes tribunal in The Hague , Netherlands - marks the first US prosecution of torture committed in a foreign country .
Taylor , a 31-year - old U.S. citizen , is charged with conspiracy , torture and carrying a firearm during a violent crime .
Taylor 's court - appointed defence attorney depicted his client as an innocent man who helped protect his father 's government against rebels seeking to overthrow it .
The defence argued that witnesses wrongly accused Taylor of torture in an attempt to get out of the impoverished , violent African nation .
Assistant Federal Public Defender John Wiley said if this case were a newspaper headline it would read : "" Desperate and disgruntled Africans accuse American to escape war - torn Liberia . ""
He said some are seeking protected status such as asylum in the United States in exchange for their testimony against Taylor .
If convicted of the horrific allegations - burning victims ' flesh with molten plastic , shocking their genitals with an electrical prod , ordering the beheading of one victim with a knife - Taylor would spend the rest of his life in prison .
Taylor was charged under a 1994 law that permits the federal government to prosecute anyone suspected of carrying out torture outside the United States as long as the suspect is a US citizen , legal resident or is present in this country , regardless of nationality .
He was arrested on false passport charges when he arrived in Miami from Trinidad in March 2006 .
Taylor 's goal in the alleged conspiracy was to "" strengthen the power and authority "" of his father 's presidency and to "" eliminate actual and perceived opponents and threats to his administration by means of torture , "" according to the indictment .
The indictment accuses him of using Liberia 's antiterrorist unit to seize , imprison , interrogate and mistreat those opposed to his father 's government "" by acts specifically intended to inflict severe physical pain and suffering "" .
The Taylor trial is expected to last up to eight weeks , said district judge Cecilia Altonaga .
Prosecutors will call government agents as well some of the seven alleged victims cited in the indictment .
Taylor 's attorneys also plan to put on a defence , saying they will call witnesses to testify he did not commit any acts of torture ."
"Son of ex - Liberian president Charles Taylor was sentenced to 97 years in prison today in landmark torture case that grew out of a US investigation into arms trafficking in Liberia .
Charles ' ' Chuckie '' Taylor Jr was convicted in October of leading a campaign of torture against people opposed to his father 's rule .
Although he was n't charged with killing any of them , his indictment alleged that he killed at least one of seven victims .
Federal prosecutors had cited the murder allegation in recommending that US District Judge Cecilia Altonaga send the former Orlando , Florida , resident to prison for 147 years , stemming from his convictions on eight conspiracy , torture and firearm charges .
Assistant US Attorney Caroline Heck Miller called Taylor 's violent conduct a ' ' gross offence against the public , '' urging the judge to impose consecutive sentences .
His defence lawyers countered that Taylor , 31 , was not convicted of murder and therefore should be imprisoned for seven to 20 years .
Taylor Jr was tapped by his father to command an anti - terrorist unit called the ' Demon Forces ' that beat , burned and beheaded Liberian civilians from 1999 to 2003 , the jury concluded .
The Miami criminal case - which took place at the same time the father , Charles Taylor , faced a war - crimes tribunal in the Netherlands - marked the first US prosecution of torture committed in a foreign country .
The son was charged under a 1994 law that permits the federal government to prosecute anyone suspected of carrying out torture outside the country as long as the suspect is a US citizen , legal resident or is present in this country , regardless of nationality .
Federal authorities , from Immigration and Customs Enforcement to the FBI , said they were proud of prosecuting the landmark case because it sends a powerful message to torturers who might try to evade justice by sneaking into the United States - as Taylor tried to do in March 2006 when he was arrested after flying from Trinidad to Miami on a false passport . ' '
We see this as a landmark investigation and conviction that provides a deterrent against those who want to use the United States as a safe haven , '' said ICE Acting Assistant Secretary John Torres .
Federal officials said the torture investigation spanned three continents and involved dozens of legal attaches , agents and prosecutors travelling abroad to interview hundreds of witnesses - including five victims who were brought to Miami to testify against Taylor Jr.
At trial , witnesses accused him and his soldiers of horrific torture in the west African country .
Among the techniques : electric shock , molten plastic , lit cigarettes , hot irons , bayonets and biting ants shovelled onto people 's bodies .
Prisoners were kept in water - filled pits covered by heavy iron gates and barbed wire .
Federal authorities said that the torture case was an offshoot of a 2003 investigation into arms trafficking in Liberia to support the senior Taylor 's oppression of rebels . ' '
As we interviewed witnesses in the arms trafficking investigation , many of them said they had been tortured by Chuckie Taylor , '' Torres said ."
"The son of the former president of Liberia was yesterday sentenced to 97 years in prison for torture overseas , in the first US case of its kind .
Charles McArthur Emmanuel , 31 , was found guilty of heading an elite paramilitary unit that routinely tortured and killed people viewed as rebels or opponents in the West African country during the presidency of his father , Charles Taylor .
"" It is hard to conceive of any more serious offences against the dignity and the lives of human beings , "" said US district judge Cecilia Altonaga , announcing the sentence .
"" The international community condemns torture . ""
Emmanuel , a US citizen also known as Charles "" Chuckie "" Taylor Jr , was convicted in October in what was the first use of a 1994 law permitting prosecution in the US for torture committed in foreign countries .
Prosecutors had asked for a 147-year sentence , to send a strong worldwide message against torture .
Yesterday Emmanuel showed no emotion at the sentence , but told Altonaga he would appeal .
He had rejected an offer to plead guilty in exchange for a lighter sentence , he said .
"" My innocence was important to me then , as it is now .
My sympathies go out to all the people who suffered in the conflicts in Liberia and Sierra Leone . ""
His father , who left power in 2003 under US pressure , is on trial before the UN in The Hague , the Netherlands , for crimes allegedly committed during the Sierra Leone civil war .
Victims testified that Emmanuel , as chief of Taylor 's anti - terrorist unit , either personally tortured them or directed others to do so , using electric shocks , bayonets , cigarettes , scalding water and molten plastic , ants and water - filled holes topped by iron bars and barbed wire .
He personally shot several men and ordered one man to be beheaded , witnesses said .
The sentence is the culmination of a US Immigration and Customs Enforcement ( Ice ) investigation that began in 2002 with a single agent looking into illegal arms exports to western Africa .
Emmanuel was arrested in Miami for a passport violation in 2006 , and was then indicted on torture , firearms and conspiracy charges .
John Torres , acting Ice assistant secretary , said the case would have immense value for "" the deterrence for others who think they can come to the US for safe haven "" ."
"The former Liberian president Charles Taylor could be set free because of the effect of the global economic crisis on funding for the court trying him for war crimes , according to its chief prosecutor .
Stephen Rapp said the special court for Sierra Leone , which is prosecuting those responsible for the worst atrocities during the country 's 1991 - 2002 civil war , faced a shortfall of more than $ 5 m from May due to cuts in donations from individual states .
The UN - backed court is entirely reliant on voluntary contributions - the first international tribunal to be funded this way . ""
With the economic crisis continuing , to get funds is not easy ...
If we run out , it is now possible the judges will have to release him [ Taylor ] .
That 's our real anxiety , "" Rapp told Reuters .
Taylor is accused of closely backing Sierra Leone 's Revolutionary United Front rebels , arming and training them in return for diamonds .
The rebels were notorious for hacking off the limbs of civilians and recruiting child soldiers .
Although the court is based in Freetown , the capital of Sierra Leone , Taylor is being tried in The Hague due to fears that his trial could affect regional stability .
He was arrested on the Nigeria - Cameroon border in 2006 after escaping from his seaside villa in Nigeria , where he had been living in exile for three years .
Charged with 11 counts of war crimes and crimes against humanity , Taylor went on trial in 2007 .
His links with the RUF rebels were alleged to be so close that prosecutors have charged him as a "" co - perpetrator "" of acts including murder and rape .
A verdict is expected next year .
Rapp said that even if Taylor was released , the indictments against him would remain .
While it seems unlikely that leading donor governments will allow this to happen , the dire financial situation of the court does indicate how the worldwide financial difficulties have spread to unlikely areas .
The court 's bill for 2008 - 10 is $ 68.4 m , and it has now turned to the US and countries in the Middle East for the $ 30 m not yet secured .
"" A few important donors have so far not been able to provide financial support to the court or have provided less than in previous years , "" said Herman von Hebel , the court registrar .
"" These countries include Ireland , France and Germany , as these have always been important donors to us , but there are other donors as well . ""
The UK saw its annual £ 3 m contribution drop in value because of the pound 's slide against the US dollar .
The Freetown session of the court is due to finish today with verdicts against three senior rebels , leaving Taylor as the only remaining defendant .
The court has already convicted five people of war crimes ."
"For more than a dozen years a fleet of ancient Antonov aircraft owned by the former Russian military officer Viktor Bout would land on the precarious desert and jungle airstrips in conflict zones around the world .
With access to vast piles of ex - Soviet weapons , he armed the Taliban and the Northern Alliance in Afghanistan , the Revolutionary United Front in Sierra Leone , Charles Taylor 's regime in Liberia , Unita in Angola , various Congolese factions , and Abu Sayyaf , a militant Islamic group in the Philippines .
In Africa the arms were paid for with diamonds .
At the same time , after 2001 , his fleet was also hired by the US and its contractors to ship goods into Iraq and by the UN for relief flights to Somalia and post - tsunami Sri Lanka .
With hindsight it seems extraordinary that he could have operated for so long .
He was first outed as a "" merchant of death "" by a British minister in 2000 and named by the UN in the same year as a major sanctions buster in Africa 's civil wars .
Arrest warrants were issued in 2002 by Belgium – where his first fleet was based until it was moved to South Africa – and then Sharjah in the United Arab Emirates .
But even when the UN froze his assets and ordered a travel ban , his planes – displaying the flags of Liberia and the Central African Republic – kept flying .
Bout himself returned to Russia where he clearly enjoyed high - level protection .
The Russian Federal Security Service issued a statement in 2002 saying : "" There is no reason to believe that this Russian citizen has committed any illegal actions . ""
Trained as an interpreter at the Military Institute of Foreign Languages in Moscow , Bout went into business after the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 , with half a dozen languages at his command and as many passports .
He is variously described as having been born in the Soviet republics of Tajikistan , Turkmenistan , or Ukraine .
He is married and has a daughter who lives in Spain .
The years of impunity must have damaged his antennae for danger when he flew into Thailand last year , ostensibly for a holiday , and into the clutches of the US Drug Enforcement Administration ."
"When former Liberian president Charles Taylor – on the run in Nigeria – was captured , it was a United Nations helicopter that delivered him for trial in Sierra Leone .
On the day of his capture , it was the UN 's then - secretary general Kofi Annan who was first to express relief . ""
The capture and trial of Taylor will send a powerful message to the region and beyond that impunity will not be allowed to stand and that the rule of law must prevail "" , he said .
And when Taylor later went on trial – a trial which continued this week – for 11 counts of war crimes and crimes against humanity , it was before the United Nations - backed special court .
This is the kind of pattern one might expect from an organisation whose stated aims are facilitating co - operation with international law and achieving world peace .
The capture and trial of Taylor , at the time the first African leader to stand trial at an international court , was hailed at the time as a significant step towards accountability and the rule of law .
So when Sudanese president Omar al - Bashir was indicted last year by the international criminal court , it would n't have been unreasonable to expect a similar level of enthusiasm for his arrest on the part of the UN .
Although the ICC is independent and not created by the UN – as the special court for Sierra Leone was – links between the institutions are supposed to be strong , governed by a "" relationship agreement ' "" with provisions for co - operation , exchange of information and logistical support .
The ICC reports to the UN each year on its activities .
And crucially , there is a power under the Rome statute whereby the UN security council can refer situations otherwise outside the ICC 's jurisdiction – because the states involved have not signed the Rome statute – to the court 's prosecutor .
This is this is how the ICC began investigating the situation in Darfur in the first place ; in 2005 the security council passed resolution 1593 , which formally referred to case to the prosecutor Luis Moreno - Ocampo .
But here the plot thickens .
UN peacekeepers in Sudan have been left in a precarious situation by the indictment .
Diplomatic murmurings are of the potentially disastrous consequences of long - term justice for short - term peace .
And so instead of supporting the ICC 's attempts to try Bashir , Ban Ki - Moon has left many wondering whether his head is in the clouds by urging Sudan to bring its own legal proceedings against its president .
It does n't take a legal expert to work out that the security council would not have referred the case to the ICC in the first place were it not for the widespread acknowledgement that no credible alternative within Sudan exists .
You have to feel for Moreno - Ocampo .
Authorised by the UN security council , he then undertakes an investigation that three years later produces what can only be presumed the intended result – a warrant for Bashir 's arrest for crimes of genocide , crimes against humanity and war crimes in Darfur .
His efforts have been rewarded with some astonishing diplomatic acrobatics on the part of Ba Ki - Moon .
Faced this morning with delivering a speech in the same room as Bashir at the Arab League summit in Qatar , he managed to avoid any encounter , hopping onto a London - bound plane before there was any chance of being placed in the embarrassing position of remaining in the room while Bashir spoke .
Although this avoided the problematic handshake and "" nice to see you "" scenario ( remember Jack Straw getting stuck in that trap with Mugabe ? )
it is definitively not the support for the ICC that prosecutors had hoped for .
Moreno - Ocampo is keeping quiet in public , but is reported to have been furious behind the scenes .
And it 's difficult not to sympathise .
The ICC does not have its own enforcement capacity but relies on member states .
The UN is not bound by international treaties but I 'd happily challenge any secretary general to say publicly they are not supposed to co - operate ( if you listen carefully you 'll notice Ban Ki - Moon has avoided saying anything of the sort ) .
The Sudanese have been boasting that the ICC indictment is "" not worth the ink it is written with "" .
The last thing you 'd expect is for the UN secretary general , albeit in more diplomatic language , to send the same message ."

"Gloria Sherman was 13 years old when Charles Taylor 's soldiers came for her in 2001 .
Flushed from her hiding place in the bush outside her village in Lofa , northern Liberia , she was forced to watch as her father and brother were skinned alive .
Then she was taken into a captivity lasting nearly two years : a conscript child soldier and a sexual slave in the former president 's army .
She is 18 now , but the memories are still raw .
"" We used to do bad , bad things that they told us to do , "" she said last week .
"" Sometimes even if you were only 10 years old they would put guns and ammunition on your head to carry to the battle ; you have to do what they said or they 'd kill you .
They killed many children , many girls .
All the time many soldiers would have sex with you , every night they would come and have sex and beat you , and if you said no they would kill you or hit you with guns . ""
Tomorrow Taylor will become the first African leader to be tried for crimes against humanity by the Special Court for Sierra Leone , sitting in The Hague .
He faces 11 charges - including the deployment of child soldiers - relating to a decade - long civil war in the neighbouring state of Sierra Leone .
But it was in Liberia , as a rebel leader and then as president , that his juvenile bands of killers first began to roam in the 1990s , a military model that was then exported across the border .
Across the towns and villages of the north , countless atrocities took place and thousands of young lives were irredeemably brutalised .
Nobody who managed to survive them has forgotten the days when Taylor was the power in the land .
During and after Taylor 's successful rebellion against the corrupt and violent government of Samuel Doe , his National Patriotic Front of Liberia ( NPFL ) army controlled much of the country .
The Small Boys Unit , made up of children under 11 , was among his most feared rebel battalions , a regiment of innocent murderers .
When the rebel warlord was eventually elected president in 1997 , one of his election campaign slogans was : "" He killed my ma , he killed my pa , but I will vote for him . ""
The Taylor presidency was savagely violent as constant insurgencies locked the country in a cycle of war until he was forced to resign in 2003 .
His son , the infamous Chucky Taylor , who ran Taylor 's paramilitary anti - terrorism security forces , was jailed by a US court for 97 years this year after it was found that , between 1999 and 2002 , his "" Demon Forces "" squads had tortured to death scores of people accused of being anti - Taylor rebels .
By 2003 , as Taylor lost control of large tracts of the country to the equally ruthless Liberians United for Reconciliation and Democracy ( Lurd ) rebel force , backed by Guinea , some 15,000 children were fighting in Taylor 's government forces .
Defeated at last , Taylor resigned , went into exile in Nigeria and now faces life imprisonment if found guilty at The Hague .
Meanwhile the children and adolescents who killed and suffered in his name have grown into a traumatised , desolate adulthood .
In Lofa county , where the child soldiers once rampaged , bullet - scarred buildings and burnt - out checkpoints still stand as monuments to the relentless fighting this province endured .
Rebel activity and government raids forced hundreds of thousands of civilians in Lofa to flee their homes and surge over the borders of Guinea and Sierra Leone , where they filled sprawling refugee camps until the peace in 2003 .
When they came back , they found Lofa in tatters , its infrastructure destroyed and villages burnt .
Although the region is now peaceful and the land is once again lush , the scars of the war are everywhere .
Many villages in the region are little more than temporary shelters dotted with shattered buildings and burnt - out churches .
Rows of tanks sit behind barbed wire as bored Bangladeshi peacekeeping soldiers sit fingering their rifles at lookout posts in United Nations encampments scattered throughout the area .
The vast majority of people here have no electricity and struggle to scrape a living from the land .
As for the thousands of former child combatants who returned here after the war , they are now obliged to endure new horrors as they try to rebuild their lives .
Two years of systematic rape and beatings have left Gloria with jagged scars and internal injuries so severe that she has little chance of ever becoming a mother .
When she managed to escape from her captors and make her way back to her village , she found that she was now an outcast .
Labelled a "" rebel wife "" and accused of collaborating in the violence inflicted on her village by drugged and ruthless soldiers during the war , she says that the only way she can survive is by having sex with men - NGO workers , government officials and businessmen - who often pay her in food , sanitary towels or soap . ""
They say we are bad girls because of what we did in the war and what we do now , "" Gloria said .
"" But they took me and I had no choice . ""
The Observer talked to dozens of Taylor 's former child soldiers in Lofa who said that they have been abandoned by the state , ostracised by their families and forced into prostitution and crime in order to survive .
Elijah Kollie , a frail 19-year - old taken from his home by Taylor 's government troops in 2000 , talked impassively of children 's stomachs being slit open in front of him and of the multiple rapes and murders he witnessed on the front line .
"" When I came back , I did n't have anyone : everyone in my family was dead , "" he said with a shrug .
He points to a patch of earth in the centre of the village where he said that Lurd rebels used to boil alive people they suspected of aiding Taylor 's government forces .
"" I still do n't know where to go because I ca n't forget what happened .
I feel angry because of what happened to me and now people here are causing many problems for us .
I just wish my father was still here . ""
A recent report by Plan , a leading international children 's organisation , said that the phenomenon of child soldier armies in conflicts across west Africa has left a devastating footprint of psychological trauma and spiralling suicide rates across the region .
Interviews conducted with child soldiers across Liberia for the report revealed that 60 % of them had witnessed another child being beaten to death , 87 % had seen a family member killed and 84 % had found themselves "" surrounded by , lying underneath or stepping on "" dead bodies .
In Sierra Leone , Plan researchers deemed 70 % of girls and 80 % of boys interviewed for the report were at serious risk of suicide , with 30 % of children interviewed having already attempted suicide on at least one occasion . ""
The war broke the bonds between children and their parents and extended families .
Those who fought as soldiers are now treated as pariahs and this stigma goes all the way up the chain from village level up to local and central government , "" said Joseph Henah , a counsellor at one of Plan 's child soldier support programmes in Lofa .
"" The situation that is faced by many of these children is desperate .
The majority , if not all , of the girls are forced into transactional sex .
Many are living alone , they are on drugs , they can not go to school and this is the generation which is supposed to be leading our country out of poverty and into a better future . ""
Child rights groups say that the plight of Liberia 's former child soldiers is going unheeded as the government struggles to provide even basic services to its 3.5 million people , 2.4 million of whom are surviving on less than $ 1 a day .
As one of the world 's poorest countries - with only 50 government doctors and the eighth highest global maternal mortality rate - Liberia has no money to spend on the casualties of its shocking recent history .
When asked about why the government is failing to help former child soldiers , Dr Wilhemina Jallah of the John F Kennedy Memorial Hospital in the capital , Monrovia , points to the hundreds of women waiting for treatment in the hospital 's steamy outpatient clinic . ""
The majority of women who come in to give birth have malaria , many have terrible injuries which makes childbirth dangerous , there is no transport to health centres in rural areas and we do n't have enough drugs , "" she said .
"" Although they are needed , mental health services are not our priority . ""
Many fear the country 's fragile peace now hangs in the balance after Liberia 's Truth and Reconciliation Commission released its final report last week , recommending that the current president , Ellen Johnson - Sirleaf , and other key political figures face sanctions for their role in the civil war .
The report recommended that the popular Johnson - Sirleaf be banned from holding public office for 30 years for her role in financing Taylor 's invasion in 1989 .
Testifying before the commission earlier this year , Johnson - Sirleaf apologised for her support of Taylor , saying that she had been "" fooled "" into it . ""
If there is anything that I need to apologise for to this nation , it is to apologise for being fooled by Mr Taylor in giving any kind of support to him , "" the president told the commission .
"" I feel it in my conscience .
I feel it every day . ""
The commission , which was launched by Johnson - Sirleaf herself after she was elected in 2005 , heard testimonies from thousands of victims in an effort to move the country towards reconciliation before launching its final report .
Several of the former warlords who are recommended for prosecution by the commission , many of whom now hold public office , have already pledged to oppose any attempt to bring them to justice , sparking fears of a return to violence .
In Monrovia , many Liberians say their desire for peace outweighs their need for justice .
"" We just want to forget the war and move on ; we do n't want a return to violence : we want peace and jobs , "" said Charles Muyan , who drives a taxi downtown .
"" We do n't want this whole thing brought up again . ""
But in Lofa , hundreds of miles away , there is no indication that life will get any better for the thousands of former child soldiers struggling to survive .
"" I think about my father and my brother every day and my sister who I have n't seen since she was taken by rebels , "" said Gloria .
"" When I close my eyes , all I can see is the war .
I often think about taking my own life .
It would have been better if I 'd died in the war , but I am still alive and I hope one day something will be different and I will be a good person . ""
The burden of being a "" rebel child "" has proved too much for some .
Two months ago , Mardy Samuka 's body was found swinging from the roof of the bullet - scarred church near the village of Foya in Lofa - another , belated victim of Taylor 's terrifying reign .
Samuka 's aunt , Moidee , wept as she talked of the desperation her nephew felt .
Crippled when a stray bullet lodged in his leg during fighting around the village in 2001 , it was what happened to him after the war that drove the 19-year - old to put the noose around his neck , she said .
"" I tell people that he was never a soldier , that he never did any of those terrible things that the children did to this village , but any child missing a limb is known as a former soldier here , "" she said .
"" He carried that stigma , we all did ; his life could come to nothing .
There was nobody to help him . ""

The prosecution asks for the trial to be switched to The Hague ."
"Lawyers for the former president of Liberia Charles Taylor began his defence against war crimes charges today , arguing that Taylor was not responsible for the murder , rape and mutilation of civilians by rebels in Sierra Leone and should not be blamed simply out of disgust at the atrocities .
The 61-year - old 's defence began this morning at the UN - backed special court for Sierra Leone in The Hague , where he denies charges that include enlisting and drugging child soldiers , enforcing sexual slavery , and commanding and arming rebels from his presidential palace in Monrovia during the 11-year conflict , which ended in 2002 .
Taylor , the first African head of state to be tried by an international court , has pleaded not guilty to 11 charges in a hearing that has heard 91 witnesses since January 2007 .
His defence is being led by Courtenay Griffiths , a British lawyer .
Taylor will take the stand tomorrow for what is expected to be several weeks of testimony in his own defence . ""
No one who has seen the procession through this courtroom of hurt human beings reliving the most grotesque trauma would have been unmoved , "" Griffiths told the three - judge panel .
"" We are human too , even while we declare this accused man to be not guilty of the charges he faces . ""
The court has already heard witness testimony of radio exchanges between Taylor and the rebels , arms smuggled from Liberia to Sierra Leone in sacks of rice , and diamonds sent back in a mayonnaise jar .
One former aide said he had seen Taylor eat a human liver .
"" We say , and have said all along , that they are lying , "" Griffiths said of the prosecution witnesses . ""
His case is that he was not involved – that he was a peacemaker , not a warmonger . ""
Taylor will take the stand in his own defence tomorrow and Griffiths said he would give a detailed account of his version of the conflicts in Liberia and Sierra Leone and his role in them .
Wearing a brown double - breasted suit , brown tie and dark glasses , Taylor sat impassively as he listened to Griffiths 's opening statement .
The defence team has a list of more than 200 witnesses , including unnamed former African heads of state and high - ranking UN officials .
Griffiths will argue that Taylor was asked by the 15-member Economic Community of West African States and the UN to help halt the atrocities in Sierra Leone .
Some 500,000 people are estimated to have been killed or systematically mutilated , or to have suffered other atrocities , in Sierra Leone 's civil war .
Some of the worst crimes were carried out by gangs of child soldiers given drugs to desensitise them to the horror of their actions .
Taylor is accused of arming them in exchange for diamonds .
Taylor was forced into exile after being indicted in 2003 , and was finally arrested in Nigeria in 2006 .
He was sent for trial in The Hague because officials feared that staging the case in Sierra Leone could spark further violence .
He boycotted the start of his trial , in June 2007 , and fired his attorney , holding up proceedings until January 2008 , when prosecutors called their first witness ."

"The former Liberian president Charles Taylor dismissed charges of murder and crimes against humanity today as he launched his own defence at a war crimes trial by professing his "" love for humanity "" .
Taylor told the special Hague court that the 11 charges against him , including murder , sexual slavery and the use of child soldiers , were based on lies and misinformation .
Prosecutors have accused the former warlord of arming and instructing rebels during 1991 - 2002 civil war in Sierra Leone in order to gain control of its rich diamond fields .
In court , Taylor , a lay preacher who once compared himself to Jesus in a BBC interview , introduced himself to the three judges as the 21st president of Liberia .
His defence lawyer , the British QC Courtenay Griffiths , asked Taylor what he thought of an indictment that accused him of being "" everything from a terrorist to a rapist "" .
"" It is incredible that such descriptions of me would come about , "" Taylor said .
"" It is very , very , very unfortunate that the prosecution – because of disinformation , misinformation , lies , rumours – would associate me with such … descriptions . ""
On Monday , Griffiths told the court that Taylor , 61 , had been a "" broker of peace "" in the region rather than a war criminal and would testify about his efforts to restore calm in Sierra Leone .
The description was at odds with evidence offered by the prosecution since January 2008 .
The 91 witnesses included a man whose hands were hacked off by rebels and a former aide of Taylor , who said he saw him eat a human liver .
Taylor insisted he had done no wrong .
"" I am a father of 14 children , grandchildren , with love for humanity , have fought all my life to do what I thought was right in the interests of justice and fair play .
I resent that characterisation of me .
It is false , it is malicious . ""
He is the first African leader to be tried by an international court .
Though the war crimes charges relate only to Sierra Leone and the period from 1996 to 2002 , Taylor 's influence extended wider to include not only his own country but also Guinea and Ivory Coast , where he is also accused of fomenting rebellions .
Taylor rose to prominence as a civil servant in Samuel Doe 's military regime in Liberia in the 1980s .
Accused of stealing nearly $ 1 m in state funds , he fled to the US , where he was arrested on a Liberian warrant .
But he escaped from prison and , according to his indictment , ended up in Libya , where he received military training and befriended Foday Sankoh of Sierra Leone , with the two men agreeing to assist each other to take power in their countries .
In 1989 , Taylor launched an uprising in Liberia , enlisting children .
By 1997 , when the war - weary population elected Taylor president , Sankoh 's Revolutionary United Front ( RUF ) rebels had begun phase two of their war against the government of Sierra Leone .
The prosecutor , Stephen Rapp , said Taylor provided important assistance , encouragement and direction to the RUF rebels from the start of the civil war , sending in his own fighters as backup and offering financial support and weapons .
In return , Taylor received payments of "" blood diamonds "" .
Though Taylor had not physically committed the crimes , his involvement made him a "" co - perpetrator "" , the prosecution said .
Taylor denied having assisted the RUF in the invasion of Sierra Leone , and said the allegation that he had been paid in diamonds was a "" diabolical lie "" .
After his indictment in 2003 Taylor fled to Nigeria , where he believed he had been given immunity in return for leaving power .
In March 2006 , when Nigeria accepted that he should face international justice , he was arrested trying to cross into Cameroon .
Taylor was transferred to The Hague , rather than the Sierra Leone capital , Freetown , where the court is based , because of fears the trial might affect regional stability .
A verdict is expected next year ."

"The image this week of the former Liberian president Charles Taylor , defiant in a black suit and dark sunglasses , taking the stand in a courtroom in The Hague – the first time an African head of state has been prosecuted for mass crimes – resonates powerfully .
For many , the trial represents another victory for international justice and another signal of the end to impunity for the likes of Taylor , Slobodan Milosevic , Saddam Hussein and Alberto Fujimori – presidents who murdered , raped and tortured civilians before eventually finding themselves in the dock .
In Africa , however , the Taylor trial elicits mixed – and more complex – reactions .
Current debates across Africa emphasise the need for accountability for African leaders .
But they also demand the same justice for western leaders who have committed grave crimes and greater transparency and effectiveness from the institutions that deliver justice , especially the International Criminal Court ( ICC ) , which is hosting the special court for Sierra Leone 's prosecution of Taylor because of security concerns in Sierra Leone .
Civil society actors in Nairobi , Kinshasa , Cairo and Freetown have lauded the Taylor prosecution , given the egregious crimes he directed rebels to commit in Sierra Leone between 1996 and 2002 .
However , there should be no triumphalism over this trial .
There is much disquiet across Africa at the tendency of the ICC and other justice institutions to target deposed African leaders while turning a blind eye to African despots still in power , such as Robert Mugabe , as well as ignoring western perpetrators and their allies .
Two recent events form the backdrop to the Taylor trial and shape interpretations of it across Africa .
Earlier this month , delegates to an African Union summit in Libya agreed a resolution to halt co - operation with the ICC over its indictment of the Sudanese president , Omar Hassan al - Bashir , for crimes committed in Darfur .
The AU leaders stated that the ICC represented a form of neo - colonial intervention in Africa 's affairs that would ultimately jeopardise peace and stability on the continent .
A week later , in his speech in Ghana , Barack Obama argued that , while "" Africa is not the crude caricature of a continent at war "" , it nonetheless suffers from rampant corruption and a lack of accountability among many of its leaders .
Obama pledged greater US development support for African countries that tackled elite criminality and chose peace over conflict .
Obama 's statements have chimed with African citizens much more than those of their ostensible leaders in the AU .
Rwandan , Congolese , Ugandan and Sudanese colleagues have told me over the last week that the AU stance on Bashir is yet another case of African leaders seeking safety in numbers and using the smokescreen of neo - colonialism to hide the same crimes that Obama condemned .
They see little wonder in the head of the AU , Libyan president Muammar Gaddafi , defending Bashir against calls for international justice .
Gaddafi himself is responsible for arms dealing and fuelling conflict in Chad and Darfur and may yet be implicated during the Taylor trial , given the support he provided to the Taylor - backed rebels in Sierra Leone .
At the same time , much of Africa sees hypocrisy in Obama 's call for accountability for African leaders , as he equivocates over whether to launch an official inquiry into the Bush administration 's policies after 9/11 , not least the use of torture against suspected terrorists .
Accountability is as necessary in Washington as it is in Khartoum .
Nevertheless , we should not interpret widespread African support for the prosecution of leaders such as Taylor and Bush as an unbending African faith in international justice .
To date , most promises of international justice in Africa have gone unfulfilled , leaving the perception that justice is usually delivered for the sake of international judges and lawyers rather than for the victims of violence .
While the special court for Sierra Leone 's reasons for moving the Taylor trial away from Freetown are sound , in taking the trial to The Hague , the court is repeating a mistake made by the ICC and the international criminal tribunal for Rwanda – prosecuting suspects at a great distance from the populations most affected by their crimes .
This denies local populations the chance to see and hear the alleged murderers , rapists and torturers firsthand .
As a result , international justice institutions continue to have little direct impact on communities recovering from conflict .
There are also major concerns in Africa over these institutions ' choice of trial targets .
In the case of the ICC , the court 's policy to date has been to pursue ( usually middle - ranking ) rebel leaders , while eschewing the more difficult cases of sitting government officials in countries such as Uganda and the Democratic Republic of Congo .
As a new institution , the ICC has pursued "" small fish "" in order to secure rapid judicial results and thus achieve international legitimacy .
However , in doing so , the court has ignored crimes committed by state actors , such as Ugandan president Yoweri Museveni and Congolese president Joseph Kabila – both complicit in atrocities against their own civilians but both also important regional allies of the west .
Africa has a long history of political elites manoeuvring to ensure that interventions by international actors ultimately play to their advantage .
In extending this historical pattern , the ICC has forfeited legitimacy in its most important constituency – local populations that have directly endured those crimes .
The dismal irony is that after seven years of operation the ICC – the host but not conductor of the Taylor trial – has failed to prosecute any suspects as senior as Taylor .
This is unlikely to change any time soon , as Sudanese president Bashir continues to evade the ICC 's grasp .
While Africa seeks justice for mass crimes , the ICC – and the entire enterprise of international justice – have a long way to go in convincing African populations that this brand of accountability is ultimately for their benefit ."
"Watch Pray the Devil Back to Hell via 4oD Watch The Choir via iPlayer In 2002 , after enduring decades of civil war , Liberian social worker and mother of three Leymah Gbowee had , literally , a dream .
The bloodshed at the hands of the former warlord and current president , Charles Taylor , was intensifying .
The dream told her to gather the women of her church together and start fighting for peace .
She did , and at the end of her speech another woman , Asatu Bah - Kenneth , assistant director of the Liberian National Police and a Muslim , got up and pledged her support to Gbowee 's plan .
Thus was born a grassroots , cross - religion peace movement among the women of Liberia , the subject of Gini Reticker 's extraordinary film Pray the Devil Back to Hell ( More4 ) .
The film comprised archival images of mayhem and misery – bloodied bodies being carried through the streets , drugged child soldiers turning glazed eyes to the camera – and interviews with key figures in the peace movement .
It was the story of a growing number of women finding a way to speak truth to power by directing an essentially maternal force – love and discipline , combined and extraordinarily magnified by extraordinary circumstance – at those habitually assumed to be beyond the reach of any moderating influence .
Good mothers are practical .
The women began with protests at the local fish market , where they knew they would daily be seen by Taylor and his convoy of trucks , full of boys taken off to fight in the morning , returning empty at night .
Good mothers do not indulge their children .
Every time the women spoke it was to strip away another layer of myth that the men responsible for the carnage had tried to build up around themselves . ""
Warlords do n't come to help anyone .
They come for their own selfish greed , most of them to get rich , to get power , "" said one .
Another described the peace talks in Ghana .
"" It was like being on vacation .
They were living their dream lives there . ""
"" ' I want to be the minister of justice ! ' "" said another woman , bitterly mocking the men 's attempts to secure themselves a fruitful position in the transition government . "" '
So I can steal ! '
So – we have to pay you for killing us ? ""
After six weeks of talks without progress , while the women outside the hall listened to radio reports of devastation in their home towns , Gbowee and her cohorts linked arms and formed a ring , refusing to let anyone out until they broke the stalemate .
"" We are their conscience , "" she said .
Sometimes you have to let children make their own mistakes .
When the UN peacekeeping force started a process of disarmament in Monrovia , Etweda "" Sugars ""
Cooper said wearily , "" We have been through many disarmaments in Liberia , which means we have some idea of what works and what does not work .
But we were constantly told that they were the experts . ""
The UN ignored this coded warning about tears before bedtime and , as thousands of drunken , drugged and armed soldiers turned up to exchange weapons for cash , violence duly erupted .
The women moved in , and over three days brought the situation under control : mothers separating and pacifying a group of murderous toddlers in the throes of the bloodiest of tantrums .
In Ghana , Taylor was indicted for war crimes , beginning the long , slow journey to his exile and the democratic ( in Liberian terms ) election of the first female African head of state , Ellen Johnson Sirleaf in 2005 .
The women 's movement disbanded soon afterwards . ""
But Liberians knew , "" says Gbowee , "" that if things ever got bad again , we would be back . ""
The Choir ( BBC2 ) crescendoed last night .
The final episode saw Gareth Malone – who looks as fragile as a semi - quaver but is possessed of a will of steel – bringing the three choirs he has created out of the variously recalcitrant , unpromising and bewildered material yielded by the Watford suburb of South Oxhey together as one huge and exuberant community choir .
It duly poured , but steely wills do not rust .
Gareth praised the stagehands , bounded energetically round the stoic stallholders and went backstage to warm up his choir .
The rain ceased and people started to pour in instead .
The choir , after begging Gareth to remain as choirmaster , sang their hearts out to an audience of 6,000 and , although someone perilously near a microphone was sharp throughout , the series ended on a sweet note , with Gareth deciding to stay on .
Sing hallelujah !"
"Charles Taylor , the former president of Liberia , claimed today that he was indicted for war crimes as part of a US "" regime change "" plan to gain control of west African oil reserves .
In a typically defiant performance , Taylor also testified that he was duped by Nigeria into being arrested there in 2006 .
Taylor questioned the fairness of his trial by the Special Court for Sierra Leone , which is trying the 61-year - old former warlord on allegations that he controlled and supported rebels who murdered and mutilated thousands of civilians during Sierra Leone 's 1992 - 2002 civil war .
"" I am convicted already , "" Taylor told the three international judges , in his final day of direct testimony in his own defence after 13 weeks in the witness box .
Taylor told the panel that the American authorities believed he was a destabilising factor in west Africa , a region Washington saw as a possible future source of oil .
He said the US standpoint was that "" we can not have anyone in Liberia that we do n't think is going to dance to our tune "" .
The tribunal prosecutor who indicted Taylor was an American , David Crane .
Crane did not immediately respond to a request for comment .
After Crane unsealed the indictment in June 2003 , Taylor went into exile in Nigeria .
Taylor said Nigeria 's then - president Olusegun Obasanjo had assured him the UN security council would put the indictment on ice if he left Liberia , but said Obasanjo eventually "" cracked "" under international pressure to give him up . ""
He lied to the world when he said I was escaping , and he knew nothing about it , "" he said .
"" Why he lied ?
I do n't know , but as a brother and a friend , I think he ought to speak and tell the truth about it . ""
Taylor denied reports that he was arrested early in 2006 while trying to flee Nigeria with millions of dollars in cash .
"" It is all lies , "" he said , telling judges he was only planning a visit to Chad and was carrying around US$ 50,000 ( £ 30,000 ) to pay hotel and other bills .
As his testimony concluded , Taylor rejected allegations not part of the indictment against him that he harboured al - Qaida terrorists while he was still in office , calling them yet another US attempt to undermine his administration .
"" I am associated with al - Qaida and providing sanctuary in Liberia and the United States government would just overlook it ?
Never ever , "" Taylor said .
"" This shows how desperate they have been to destroy me . ""
Taylor has frequently hit out at the US in sometimes venomous monologues , accusing the country of seeking to overthrow him and of hypocrisy on human rights .
His testimony of more than 250 hours on the stand chronologically reviewed his life , from his mixed parentage and boyhood in Liberia to university in the US , his leadership of a Liberian rebel movement , presidency and in his version peace - seeking west African leader .
The final days of his account had little bearing on the 11 charges he faces and denies including murder , rape , sexual slavery and recruiting child soldiers in neighbouring Sierra Leone .
Taylor is now likely to face weeks of cross examination as prosecutors attempt to pick holes in his claims that he did not support Sierra Leone rebels whose signature atrocity was to hack off the limbs of villagers .
Taylor 's is the last trial at the Special Court for Sierra Leone .
Eight other rebel leaders have been tried , convicted and sentenced to prison terms ranging from 15 to 52 years ."
"The American - born son of former Liberian dictator Charles Taylor has been ordered to pay more than £ 14 m in compensation to five people tortured during the West African country 's civil war .
A judge in the US made the order a year after the same Miami court sentenced Charles McArthur Emmanuel Taylor , known as Chuckie , to 97 years in prison for his role in one of Africa 's bloodiest chapters ; he was the first person to be convicted by a federal court of committing offences outside the US .
The 32-year - old led the notorious Anti - Terrorist Unit , a band of pro - government paramilitaries nicknamed the Demon Forces who carried out murder and torture during his father 's presidency from 1997 to 2003 .
Witnesses at his criminal trial in 2008 spoke of hearing him laugh as prisoners were abused and how the Anti - Terrorist Unit "" did things like beating people to death , burying them alive , rape – the most horrible kind of war crimes "" .
His father , also Charles Taylor , is currently on trial at the Hague facing 11 counts of crimes against humanity .
The former warlord 's regime was accused of involvement in murder , rape , gun running and diamond smuggling in both Liberia and neighbouring Sierra Leone .
The trial – in which Taylor denies all the charges – has been going on since June 2007 .
"" Chuckie "" Taylor was the result of a teenage romance when the former president was at college in Boston , Massachusetts , and lived in Florida with his mother until he was a teenager when he went to live with his father in Liberia .
He was first arrested on a fake passport charge at Miami airport in 2006 but later indicted under the 12-year - old anti - torture law , the first time it had been used .
This latest civil case heard that five Liberians had testified before the court that they had been tortured and abused by the Anti - Terrorist Unit .
They described being held in jungle pits filled chest - high with water , being exposed to electric shocks to the genitals and other body parts and witnessing the killing of others by ­Taylor 's men .
At the end of the civil trial last week , Taylor , who is currently in prison in Illinois , dismissed the torture allegations as deceptive propaganda .
However , human rights groups have welcomed this latest ruling against him .
They say it is a move that might serve as a warning to others who commit similar abuses that they will be held accountable for their actions .
A spokesman for United States immigration and customs enforcement said that it was a "" clear message the US would not be a safe haven for human rights violators "" ."
"UN war crimes prosecutors in The Hague today called for the British supermodel Naomi Campbell to be compelled to testify over claims that she was given "" blood diamonds "" by Liberia 's former president Charles Taylor .
A request to subpoena Campbell , the actor Mia Farrow and Campbell 's former agent , Carole White , was presented to the special court for Sierra Leone , which was set up in 2002 to try those responsible for war crimes and crimes against humanity committed during that country 's civil war .
Much of the violence was blamed on Taylor , who was arrested while trying to escape in a car stuffed with cash in 2006 and extradited to stand trial in The Hague .
One of the charges is that he used diamonds seized from Sierra Leone 's gem mines to enrich himself and fund his Revolutionary United Front rebels , responsible for mass killings and mutilations in the fighting that lasted from 1991 to 2001 .
The prosecution has asked to reopen its case after Farrow claimed that Campbell had told her that she had been given a rough diamond by Taylor in September 1997 while she was a guest of Nelson Mandela in South Africa .
White has testified that she heard Taylor say he was going to give Campbell diamonds and was present when they were delivered .
Campbell has refused to comment , storming out of one interview when asked about the issue , knocking over a camera on her way out .
She told the US chatshow host Oprah Winfrey : "" I do n't want to get involved in this man 's case –
he has done some terrible things .
I do n't want to put my family in danger . ""
The court documents issued yesterday state : "" Ms Campbell , as the actual recipient of the accused 's gift of diamonds , is clearly in a position to provide material evidence about this event . ""
The court documents also say repeated attempts to interview the model had been unsuccessful and that she had publicly stated she did not want to be involved . ""
Thus , judicial intervention in the form of a subpoena is necessary , "" the prosecution argues .
Farrow told prosecutors that Campbell told her that "" she had been awakened in the night by knocking at her door .
She opened the door to find two or three men –
I do not recall how many – who presented her with a large diamond which they said was from Charles Taylor . ""
Taylor has pleaded not guilty to 11 counts of war crimes and crimes against humanity .
He has dismissed the Campbell diamonds story as "" total nonsense "" ."
"Encouraging news from The Hague , where the war crimes trial of former Liberian president Charles Taylor looks finally to have secured a much - needed celebrity angle .
Naomi Campbell will now be summoned to give evidence in Taylor 's trial , after the Special Court for Sierra Leone granted a request by prosecutors to call the supermodel .
You might recall that last year , Mia Farrow provided a written testimony to the court suggesting that Taylor had given Naomi a huge uncut blood diamond after a South African reception in 1997 .
Naomi , alas , refused to elaborate .
Her only public statement on the matter came in a recent TV interview with Oprah Winfrey , when she declared dismissively , "" I do n't want to be involved in this man 's case , "" as though it were a matter of choice on a par with declining a Roberto Cavalli ad campaign or the chance to spend a weekend in St Tropez .
For their part , Hague prosecutors spoke of their "" many unsuccessful attempts "" to contact her .
And one can only picture Naomi 's crystal - encrusted BlackBerry ringing out in the back of whichever maid 's skull into which it had just been embedded , following the failure to locate a specific pair of jeans or suchlike .
Happily , this communication glitch should be ironed out by the fact of the formal summons issued on Wednesday , in which the court 's four - judge panel ruled Naomi 's evidence "" highly probative and material to the indictment "" .
That Naomi will find a war crimes trial slightly harder to get out of than a fashion shoot seems guaranteed .
Less certain , however , is Radovan Karadzic 's ability to hang on to his record for arsiest behaviour in a Hague courtroom , with madam 's fabled timekeeping skills likely to challenge even the former Bosnian Serb leader 's reputation for arrogant no - shows ."
"Trucks loaded with undressed timber are on the move again around Buchanan in River Cess county , south - east Liberia .
The dust recalls the not - so - distant time when the timber trade was synonymous with war .
For 14 years , from 1989 to 2003 , destruction of the forest paid for one of Africa 's worst conflicts , subsequently filling the coffers of President Charles Taylor , now on trial at The Hague for crimes against humanity .
At the end of April the first ship loaded with azobe and niangon , two highly prized species of timber , left the port of Buchanan , the United Nations having lifted the embargo it imposed in 2003 - 6 to deprive the armed militia of their main source of revenue .
Logging in Liberia is gradually gathering speed , but the country is still on its knees .
The pitiful state of much of its infrastructure is probably the forest 's best friend , making parts of it inaccessible .
Work is starting from scratch as all the pre-2006 concessions having been scrapped .
Only a few companies have been allowed to launch forestry operations and new , stricter regulations apply .
Trees felled for export must all bear a barcode to track their progress as far as the port of departure .
In a country still patrolled by 10,000 UN peacekeepers , timber is as closely watched as the diamond and iron ore mines .
Last year the government registered only $ 2 m in forestry income , according to the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative established in 2007 .
In Taylor 's time the trade was worth tens of millions of dollars .
How long can this respite last ?
"" Look at what happened in Ghana and Ivory Coast .
The forest vanished in 20 years .
There is no reason why that should n't happen in Liberia , "" said Jessica Donovan of Conservation International ( CI ) .
Liberia has almost half of the last forest in west Africa , which once reached from Guinea to Togo and is home to most of the surviving wildlife too .
But pressure on the forest is growing .
Driven by rising population , villagers are extending their clearings to grow more crops and collect firewood .
"" If the government fails to take the right decisions it will soon be too late , "" said Donovan .
CI is calling for a two - year ban on new logging concessions .
Until recently conservationists had few arguments to persuade developing countries to protect their timber resources .
Now efforts to limit climate change and tropical forests ' part in CO2 capture have changed the picture .
"" We can say : ' Protecting nature will not cost you any money .
It may even earn some ' , "" Donovan added .
This is based on the hope that industrialised countries will soon compensate countries for not cutting down their forests , either by allocating part of development aid to combating deforestation or by setting up a market for forestry carbon credits , open to western firms .
No one can foresee the outcome of the climate negotiations but the prospect of this reward , titled Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation ( Redd ) , has raised such hopes that none of the rainforest nations can afford to miss out .
In Liberia , CI is lobbying the government directly , with access to expert advice and funds .
"" Redd is our priority .
It represents the future for building a development model less predatory on natural resources , "" said Donovan .
To neutralise the main forces driving deforestation , CI recommends slowing down forestry and boosting the creation of natural parks , which would become forest - carbon concessions .
Farming should move on from slash - and - burn to more intensive techniques .
Each tonne of sequestered carbon is worth an average of $ 5 , so such policies could earn the exchequer an estimated $ 40 m a year , about a tenth of current income .
Some weeks ago the CI report was submitted to Christopher Neyor , the Liberian president 's energy adviser .
He is still undecided : "" Until now our economy has always been linked to exploitation of the forest .
I 'm not saying it 's the right strategy , but when your concern is surviving from one day to the next , you do not see climate change as a priority . ""
Time is short and Liberia can not afford to wait .
Conservationists need to show on the ground that Redd is not just idle talk .
Otherwise the chainsaws will have the last word .

This column was amended on 21 July 2010 .
The original omitted the date of the original article in the first item .
This has been corrected ."
"Naomi Campbell has been granted special protection when she testifies at a UN war crimes tribunal on Thursday over claims that she was given a blood diamond by Liberia 's former president Charles Taylor .
The court ruled that no one may photograph or film the supermodel as she enters or exits the court building , or while she is in it .
She will also have a lawyer on hand to make sure she does not say anything incriminating .
Judges said there were "" legitimate grounds of concern "" for Campbell 's security and privacy because of her high public profile and the intense media scrutiny of her anticipated testimony .
A spokesman for the court in the Hague could not say definitively if this would prevent the model from being photographed by journalists on her way to the court .
A request that restrictions be extended to her transit to and from court within the Netherlands was turned down as being outside the court 's jurisdiction .
Measures to protect witnesses in war crimes cases are routine , especially when disclosure of their identity could endanger them or their families .
Such witnesses testify under pseudonyms and with their images blurred in recordings of their testimony .
But blocking the media from photographing a known witness is unusual .
The court said it was "" in the interests of justice "" to allow the supermodel extra help during her testimony from a lawyer with a limited right to intervene on whether to allow questions if she might incriminate herself by answering them .
She is due to appear on Thursday , but the court has not yet ruled on a motion submitted last week by Taylor 's lawyers to delay her appearance .
Legal representatives for Campbell including the former director of public prosecutions Lord Ken Macdonald QC , had filed a confidential application to the court requesting a wide range of protective measures .
Media lawyers questioned the court 's decision . ""
These kinds of provisions in war crimes trials are quite exceptional , "" said Mark Stephens , of Finers Stephens Innocent .
"" She is being treated in a preferential way to other witnesses . ""
The prosecution called Campbell to testify after the actor Mia Farrow claimed the supermodel had told her that she had been given a rough diamond by Taylor in September 1997 while a guest of Nelson Mandela in South Africa .
Farrow told prosecutors Campbell told her that "" she had been awakened in the night by knocking at her door .
She opened the door to find two or three men –
I do not recall how many – who presented her with a large diamond , which they said was from Charles Taylor . ""
Taylor , 62 , is accused of arming and controlling Sierra Leone 's Revolutionary United Front , a rebel force responsible for widespread atrocities .
His alleged possession of rough diamonds is a "" central issue "" and supports allegations that he was given the stones by the RUF to buy weapons for them .
Taylor has pleaded not guilty to 11 war crimes and crimes against humanity .
He has dismissed the Campbell diamond story as "" total nonsense "" ."
"In her reluctant testimony at The Hague today Naomi Campbell did not go as far as the prosecution might have hoped .
The defence was able to claim that the model 's appearance at Charles Taylor 's war crimes trial amounted to a "" spectacular own goal "" after she stopped short of saying that the former Liberian president had given her diamonds , and instead revealed only that she had received "" dirty - looking stones "" and did not know who they were from .
The prosecution 's questioning was "" weak and ineffectual "" and failed to highlight "" inconsistencies "" in Campbell 's testimony , said one lawyer who has been following the case at the special court of Sierra Leone .
Mark Stephens , of Finers Stephens Innocent , said : "" Naomi Campbell got the damp flannel treatment .
The story just did n't hang together for me . ""
A source close to the court suggested that Campbell 's request – granted by the court – that she be allowed a lawyer standing by to intervene if she looked like she might incriminate herself was an "" unwise "" move that implied she may have something to hide .
Campbell 's credibility as a witness has also been questioned because of her history –
this is not the first time that she has found herself involved in legal proceedings .
At one stage even the prosecution seemed to distance itself from its high - profile witness , suggesting she be considered a court witness , rather than one for the prosecution – an offer the court declined .
The fact that Campbell was even called to give evidence in the first place has been dismissed by some as a publicity stunt , a way for the court to draw attention to the trial of a man charged with war crimes and crimes against humanity .
But sceptics had to concede that Campbell 's 90 minutes on the stand was pertinent to the case against Taylor in terms of trying to establish a link between him and "" blood diamonds "" , even if it does not incriminate him .
And while Taylor denies the charges against him , his credibility could be called into account if he now denies what Campbell has said .
The testimony on Monday of the other witnesses key to this part of the trial – actor Mia Farrow and Campbell 's former agent
Carole White – will be essential .
At this stage , the only thing that can be concluded with confidence , say law experts , is that Campbell 's appearance at The Hague has served to bring the focus of the world 's media to the ongoing issue of blood diamonds and the human rights abuses to which they are linked ."
"Bothered and bewildered was I , not to mention bemused , that Naomi Campbell managed to persuade the special court for Sierra Leone that she needed "" protective measures "" when she gave evidence at Charles Taylor 's war crimes trial today .
The court 's order banned anyone from filming or snapping her as she went in and out of the court in the Hague or while she was waiting in the lobby .
We might call this an everything - but - the - frills reporting restriction because her testimony , about the gift of "" dirty - looking "" diamonds from the former president of Liberia , was shown live from the courtroom .
While the rules allow the court to order protective measures to safeguard the "" privacy and security "" of witnesses , war crimes tribunals usually make these sorts of provisions only when a witness , fearing for his or her safety , asks to give evidence anonymously .
This was a confidential request so we do n't know all the legal arguments the war crimes tribunal considered , but we do know the reasons it gave for making the order .
"" There are legitimate grounds of concern for Ms Campbell 's security and privacy by virtue of her public persona and the extremely intense media scrutiny relating to her anticipated testimony , "" the court said .
Campbell knows a thing or two about the law of privacy .
Six years ago she persuaded three out of five judges in the House of Lords that a tabloid newspaper interfered with her right to a private life when it published photographs of her leaving a Narcotics Anonymous meeting .
While the law lords decided that the treatment she was undergoing was her own business , they said she could not usually expect privacy in a public place .
"" If this had been , and had been presented as , a picture of Naomi Campbell going about her business in a public street , there could have been no complaint , "" said Barones Hale .
"" She makes a substantial part of her living out of being photographed looking stunning in designer clothing .
Readers will obviously be interested to see how she looks if and when she pops out to the shops for a bottle of milk . ""
A court is , of course , a public space par excellence and most of us would not consider entering or leaving one to be a private matter .
We can assume too that a court building , especially one that hosts war crimes tribunals , is a super - safe place to be .
The security must be pretty good , comparable , if not better than that at , say , a football match .
It would appear that the "" security and privacy issues "" at the special court in the Hague gave the ubiquitous Campbell more cause for concern than attending the World Cup last month , where she was pictured ensconced in the crowd .
It takes some chutzpah and , let 's face it , a lack of perspective for a celebrity to ask a war crimes tribunal for these sorts of restrictions , but perhaps we should expect no more from a woman who said that she had never heard of Liberia when she met Charles Taylor at a charity dinner given by Nelson Mandela in 1997 .
The model told the court today that she had been reluctant to appear because of the "" inconvenience "" and concerns about the safety of her family .
We 're not privy to the details of the arguments her lawyers made when they asked for this no - frills approach to reporting her court appearance , but I hope they were spectacularly good because , to those of us not in the know , this order makes Naomi Campbell look like a prima donna indulging in behaviour of the flouncy kind .
Afua Hirsch is away"
"The supermodel Naomi Campbell appeared before a war crimes tribunal in the Hague today where she admitted receiving "" dirty - looking "" diamonds that she was later told came from the former Liberian ruler Charles Taylor .
Campbell told the court that she talked to Taylor at a charity dinner hosted by Nelson Mandela in South Africa in September 1997 .
She denied flirting with Taylor or sitting next to him at the dinner , and said she had never heard of Liberia at the time , the tribunal heard .
Campbell described how she was woken in the middle of the night after the dinner by two men at her door .
She said they offered her a pouch and said it was a gift for her with no further explanation .
At breakfast the following day , she said , either the actor Mia Farrow or Campbell 's former agent
Carole White had told her the rocks must be diamonds and were probably a gift from Taylor .
Prosecutors say the story , if true , would provide evidence that Taylor traded guns to neighbouring Sierra Leone rebels in exchange for uncut diamonds , sometimes known as blood diamonds , during that country 's 1992 - 2002 civil war .
Campbell said she gave the "" dirty looking stones "" to a friend , Jeremy Ratcliffe , who at the time was the director of Mandela 's children 's charity .
She asked him to "" do something good with them "" .
A letter from the charity was read out in court "" categorically "" denying that it had received diamonds from Campbell .
She said Ratcliffe had told her lawyers that he still had the diamonds , the tribunal heard .
Contacted by telephone today , Ratcliffe was not prepared to discuss the trial or Campbell 's accusation that he still had the diamonds in his possession , saying : "" The matter is sub judice and I 'm not prepared to comment . ""
Asked about the Children 's Fund 's denial , he said : "" The Children 's Fund is correct . ""
Dressed in a cream outfit , Campbell said she was reluctant to appear before the court because of the "" inconvenience "" and safety concerns .
She resisted the prosecution 's entreaties to give evidence until she was issued last month with a subpoena .
"" I do n't want my family in danger in any way , "" she said .
She described how she had read on the internet that Taylor had supposedly "" killed thousands of people "" .
Taylor , the first former African leader to be tried in an international war crimes court , is accused of arming rebels in neighbouring Sierra Leone in return for diamonds .
He denies the allegations and looked on impassively as Campbell spoke .
The supermodel 's testimony contradicts media interviews on the subject .
Asked earlier this year by ABC News about claims made to the court by Farrow and White , she said : "" I did not receive a diamond
and I 'm not going to speak about
that thank you very much . ""
Moments later , when pressed on the issue , she walked off set , apparently hitting a camera as she went .
At a later date , speaking on Oprah Winfrey 's chatshow , the famously truculent Campbell refused to comment further , saying simply : "" I do n't want to be involved in this man 's case –
he has done some terrible things
and I do n't want to put my family in danger . ""
According to Farrow , who was one of several high - profile guests at Mandela 's now infamous Cape Town dinner party , Campbell had said over breakfast the next morning that she had "" an unforgettable story "" to tell . ""
She told us … she had been awakened in the night by knocking at her door .
She opened the door to find two or three men –
I do not recall how many – who presented her with a large diamond which they said was from Charles Taylor , "" Farrow said .
This version of events is largely supported by evidence given by White , who said she heard the African leader say he wanted to give Campbell some diamonds .
Both women are due to testify in the special court for Sierra Leone next week .
Campbell said she was no longer talking to either White or Farrow .
Taylor has asserted that he never had any of the gems in his possession and that he does not , as he told the court , "" have any real experience with the diamond business "" .
The prosecution accuses Taylor , now 62 , of obtaining illegally mined diamonds in Sierra Leone from Revolutionary United Front rebels , smuggling them over the border in "" mayonnaise jars "" and arming the rebels in return .
The former West African "" big man "" would thus have played a central role in perpetuating a war that cost tens of thousands of lives and caused countless atrocities , the prosecution says .
It argues that the diamond allegedly given to Campbell was likely to have been part of a batch obtained by Taylor from the war - torn country and taken to South Africa for sale or exchange for arms .
There is no suggestion that Campbell would have known that .
Along with the claims of his midnight gift to Campbell , Taylor denies all 11 counts of war crimes and crimes against humanity including murder , rape and cannibalism ."
"Naomi Campbell received a gift of several "" dirty looking stones "" after first meeting former Liberian president Charles Taylor , she told a war crimes tribunal today , in a testimony that prosecutors hope will lend weight to allegations that the former warlord traded in conflict diamonds .
Giving evidence before the special court for Sierra Leone , the international tribunal set up in The Hague to put Taylor in the dock , Campbell confirmed that she had accepted the stones , believed to be diamonds , in September 1997 .
When previously asked about the alleged gift , the supermodel was tight - lipped , storming off a TV set this year and telling journalists she had no desire to be associated with a man she considered to have done "" some terrible things "" .
Today , however , appearing as a reluctant witness under subpoena , Campbell told the court she had been visited late at night by two men she had never met , who delivered a pouch of jewels to her room .
A guest in Nelson Mandela 's house in South Africa , she had attended a charity dinner with guests who included her former agent Carole White , the US actor Mia Farrow , and Taylor himself .
During a 90-minute court session that veered between farce and forensic inquisition , the 40-year - old insisted she had not had a private conversation with the then president .
Not only had she not known about his reputation , she said , she had never heard of Liberia , and had never heard the term "" blood diamond "" .
The gifts arrived at her bedroom , she told the court , with "" no explanation , no note "" .
She did not look in the package , she added , until the next morning .
If she was blase about it , she said , it was because she often received gifts from unknown fans .
Over breakfast the next morning with Farrow and White , she said she was given the first clue as to their origin . ""
One of them said : ' That 's Charles Taylor , ' and I said : ' Yeah , I guess it was , ' "" she told the court .
She said she remembered handing them over to a friend , Jeremy Ratcliffe , the then director of the Nelson Mandela Children 's Fund , that day .
"" They were in my possession for , I do n't know , about six hours , "" she testified , adding : "" Once I 'd given them over it was out of my hands …
and I did n't really care about it anymore .
"" Ratcliffe , she said , had held on to the diamonds ever since .
A statement from the NMCF said that acceptance of the gems would have been "" improper and illegal "" .
The next time she was reminded of the diamonds ' existence , she said , was last year , when Farrow and White signed declarations to the special court for Sierra Leone referring to the alleged gift .
According to Brenda Hollis , chief prosecutor for the court , the episode could be crucial in attempts to prove that Taylor , despite his vehement denials , systematically traded weapons to Revolutionary United Front ( RUF ) rebels in Sierra Leone in exchange for uncut diamonds , which he then allegedly sold on "" in mayonnaise jars "" for huge profit .
In doing so , the prosecution says , he fomented a conflict that claimed more than 100,000 lives .
While he has not yet been prosecuted in his own country , the erstwhile "" big man "" of west Africa faces 11 counts of war crimes and crimes against humanity allegedly committed during the civil war in natural resource - rich Sierra Leone .
He denies them all , with the bombast of a man who once reportedly compared himself to Jesus Christ . ""
Never , ever did I receive , whether it is mayonnaise or coffee or whatever jar , any diamonds from the RUF , "" he told the court last year .
"" It is a lie , a diabolical lie . ""
Today , as the 62-year - old sat quietly in court making notes , British defence lawyer Courtenay Griffiths denied any suggestion that Campbell 's testimony was detrimental to his client .
By calling a witness who was incapable of confirming that Taylor was without doubt the giver of the diamonds , he said , the prosecution had plunged the trial into "" total confusion "" .
"" You do n't deal with speculation and probabilities in a court of law …
Where is the proof ?
"" he asked after the hearing .
In his cross - examination of Campbell , a smile playing on his lips throughout , Griffiths sought to demolish the credibility of Farrow and White , whose versions of that night 's events , he argued , differed not only from each other 's , but also from the supermodel 's .
While White claimed in her declaration to have witnessed the handover of the gems , Campbell told the court that "" she may have been around the corner but she was n't in front of my face "" .
And while White said that Campbell had sat next to Taylor at the dinner and that she had overheard him talking of giving her diamonds , the model responded , tetchily : "" That 's not true at all .
I was sat next to Mr Mandela and if there was a conversation about diamonds it was n't to me . ""
Alleging that White , who is involved in ongoing legal conflict with her former employer , is "" a woman with a powerful motive to lie "" about Campbell , Griffiths later told journalists : "" Our view is that the prosecution scored a spectacular own goal by calling Naomi Campbell . ""
It was , he said , a "" distraction "" that had proved a huge media draw but which had little or no significance for the trial .
The verdict from observers of the trial , and of the trade in conflict diamonds in general , was more mixed .
Amy Barry , a spokesperson for the NGO Global Witness , said that , while it was unclear whether Campbell 's testimony had provided "" concrete proof "" of Taylor 's possession of conflict diamonds , her testimony had proved useful in drawing attention to the issue .
"" From our point of view , the link between diamonds and the conflict in Sierra Leone and Liberia is irrefutable , "" said Barry .
""
Hopefully today 's testimony will strengthen the case against Taylor and move us one step closer to justice and some sort of reparation for the victims of his violence . """
"Congratulations , murdered and mutilated Sierra Leoneans !
You finally have a celebrity angle , meaning your obscure little story has been given its brief moment in the limelight , before being reassigned the sort of news value that could n't hope to trump a Cesc Fabregas transfer rumour .
And so to Naomi Campbell 's testimony at the war crimes trial of former Liberian president Charles Taylor in The Hague .
Who 'd have thought the first Campbell to be summoned to The Hague would be Naomi ?
At this rate , the first Blair to be subpoenaed will be Lionel , with the old trouper accused of accepting a ruby tie - pin from the Burmese military junta during his ill - fated Name
That Tune , Rangoon ! tour in 1987 .
But back to Naomi , of whose historic appearance you will no doubt be aware , on account of it having led every major TV and radio news bulletin today , with Sky News and the BBC News channel obligingly screening an uninterrupted feed of it .
Print and webwise , this newspaper ran a live blog of madam 's turn , as did the Times .
A terrible oversight by Der Spiegel and the New York Times , you 'll agree , but the good news is that a most prodigious array of news outlets gave madam blanket coverage , and we shall explore that edifying clearing of the schedules in more detail shortly .
As you will know , Naomi was ordered to give evidence after Mia Farrow alleged that representatives of Taylor gave the supermodel a diamond in the dead of night in 1997 , after they 'd all been guests of Nelson Mandela at some charity dinner in South Africa .
Despite earlier denials , the supermodel today conceded that she had been given a few "" dirty looking pebbles "" in this manner – and news outlets streamed every ruddy word .
If you wished to distil the entire apocalypse - hastening event into a single exchange , it would probably be the following .
Declaring she and Taylor had met only once , Naomi attempted a winningly self - deprecating smile and told the court : "" I 'd actually never heard of Liberia at that time . ""
"" Many people had n't , "" purred Taylor 's defence lawyer , "" until you turned up today . ""
Yet call Lost in Showbiz a stick - in - the - mud , but is it entirely seemly to find news organisations so mesmerised by Naomi , for all that she served up the obligatory odious soundbite about having to appear being "" a big inconvenience "" to her ?
Without wishing to let daylight in on magic , being odious is pretty much what Naomi does , as evidenced by those court appearances for beating her staff .
One does not look to her to provide us with a considered perspective on life .
One might , however , look to a plethora of so - called respected mainstream media outlets for said perspective , which makes their slavering interest in this single witness at Taylor 's trial so emetically disproportionate .
An academic covering the trial describes attention on Naomi 's testimony as "" off the scale "" , with a court normally attended by 20-odd accredited journalists under siege from several hundred .
At this point , do let me to take a moment to address inevitable concerns about why Lost in Showbiz is covering the matter .
To make it super - simple for the casual visitor , who quite understandably may have dropped by to a column called Lost in Showbiz expecting to read about the Pakistan floods or hard - hitting analysis of the latest fluctuations in the Hang Seng , this extremely small weekly offering is supposed to be about celebrities , in the same way that the Sport section is about sport .
Naomi is its stock in trade .
Indeed , to make it crystal clear , it is not any coverage of Naomi 's appearance which Lost in Showbiz regards as such a charming testament to modern priorities – a supermodel at The Hague is obviously a very newsy quirk .
It is the prominence given to said appearance compared to other testimony from the trial that feels faintly out of whack .
Given that both Sky News and the BBC News channel cleared their schedules for over an hour and a half , Lost in Showbiz 's guess is that they lavished more time on the model 's appearance than they have on live coverage of the whole of the rest of Taylor 's trial since its inception - proper in 2007 .
In fact , Sky confirm that they have not covered any of the other 90 witnesses live – not even Taylor himself .
The Guardian website led on the trial when the former president testified , but attempts to establish from outlets ranging from the Today programme to Channel 4 News whether they had done the same before today found them explaining that it would be too complex to check .
Hats off the to chap from ITV news who conceded ""
it seems unlikely "" .
Hang on , you might be protesting .
Maybe there simply were n't any other mildly intriguing bits of testimony in the trial of man who has been accused of 11 counts of war crimes , from the grimmest atrocities to the recruiting of child soldiers .
Admittedly , none of the other witnesses has ever produced something as inspirational as Naomi 's ghostwritten novel Swan .
But we have heard from the likes of Joseph "" ZigZag "" Marzah , one of Taylor 's erstwhile military commanders , who in five hours of astonishing testimony in 2008 claimed , "" We executed everybody – babies , women , old men .
There were so many executions .
I ca n't remember them all . ""
Taylor had encouraged his commandants to cannibalise victims , he said , in exchange for $ 200 of "" cigarette money "" .
Um , whatever ?
Unless this is about Mia Farrow
I am way
B - O - R - E - D.
Clearly , then , the message from The Hague today is simple : you can kill and rape and mutilate as much as you like , but if you really want to gain a purchase on early 21st - century western discourse and are not simply pissing about , you do need to have once had contact with a celebrity in some incredibly minor way .
Even now , let 's hope that Janjaweed militia are making a pitch for posterity by sending baskets of muffins to Lindsay Lohan , because if and when they are ever brought to justice , they sure as Shirley are n't going to make the major bulletins without that kind of news peg .
What else is there left to say ?
Other than : this is your world .
Try not to choke on it ."
"There were several minutes this morning , after the prosecutor had trumpeted her arrival , when it seemed entirely possible that Naomi Campbell had failed to show up for her most eagerly awaited show in years .
The hands of the clock crept forward , and the judge looked menacingly at the empty witness seat opposite .
Lawyers shuffled their papers ; the former Liberian president Charles Taylor realigned the array of multi - coloured ballpoint pens he had brought with him .
But , like any celebrity worth her salt , Campbell was simply biding her time .
At a little after 9 am , with a lateness some might describe as fashionable , the supermodel from Streatham trotted into Tribunal Chamber II , and swore on the Bible .
A vision of chic in cream cardigan and tight - fitting dress , she wore an "" evil eye "" pendant around her neck .
True to fashion , she had no qualms about reminding the judge of her status : "" I want to get this over and done with …
this is a big inconvenience for me . ""
Ordered by the prosecution of the special court of Sierra Leone to give evidence in connection with allegations that Taylor had engaged in the illicit trade of blood diamonds , Campbell had previously made no secret of her reluctance to testify about claims that she had received such a gem from him in 1997 .
Even some tough questioning on Oprah Winfrey 's TV sofa had gone unanswered .
But today was different .
This was n't the set of a chatshow but the drab Dutch court in which Taylor is facing 11 counts of war crimes and crimes against humanity for his allegedly murderous activities during Sierra Leone 's bloody civil war .
Even for Campbell –
who said she had had no idea who Taylor was when she met him 13 years ago , and told the court repeatedly that she had "" never heard of "" Liberia before then –
this appeared to count for something .
Yes , she said , she had spent an evening at Nelson Mandela 's house in September 1997 .
Yes , she had dined with Liberia 's newly elected president , along with the actor Mia Farrow and Carole White , her former agent .
And yes , she said – to the raised eyebrows of the journalists in the public gallery above and the impassive stare of Taylor –
she had been awoken that night by men who presented her with "" a pouch "" , and announced : "" A gift for you . ""
"" I saw a few stones in there .
They were very small , dirty looking stones , "" she recalled , scarcely masking her contempt .
The press corps giggled .
But the implication of her testimony , said the prosecution , was deeply serious .
The prosecution argues that if the men were sent by Taylor , it would disprove his claims that he had nothing to do with the diamond business .
The "" dirty pebbles "" could yet , it is alleged , become a smoking gun .
Speaking in her distinctive blend of south London vowels and Manhattan drawl , Campbell , 40 , was keen to distance herself from Taylor 's past .
Had she conversed with him over the feast , wondered chief prosecutor Brenda Hollis .
"" Not pacifically [ sic ] , "" she replied .
Had she given him her telephone number , asked a brave defence lawyer . ""
No I did not .
"" She had subsequently read up on Taylor on the internet , she said , and discovered he had "" supposedly killed thousands of people "" . ""
This [ the summons to testify ] is a big inconvenience for me .
I really do n't want anything to do with this , and I care about the protection of my family .
This is someone [ Charles Taylor ] that I read on the internet has killed thousands of people , supposedly , and I do n't want my family in any danger in any way . ""
Hollis , who , with her grey hair and unflappable manner was the unashamed counterpoint to Campbell 's perfect pout , was keen to know why it was that the witness had not asked her midnight visitors where the gems came from .
Hollis , however , who has spent two years questioning former rebels , government soldiers and diamond dealers , had clearly fallen short in her knowledge of international supermodels .
"" I was exhausted , "" Campbell explained patiently .
Before arriving at Mandela 's she had hopped between New York , London and Milan .
And anyway , while for most people the present of several diamonds would be sufficiently unusual to merit investigation , for Campbell it was nothing special .
"" It is not abnormal for me to get gifts , "" she said .
"" I get gifts all the time .
Sometimes in the middle of the night , without knowing who they are from . ""
By this time , the mood in the court was somewhere between horror and hilarity .
Those who expected the famously short - tempered diva to explode under the questioning were disappointed .
Only once , when asked about her reasons for not wanting to attend , did she betray her frustration : "" I did n't really want to be here .
I was made to be here , "" she snapped .
Ever aware of this fact , and wary , perhaps , of the shortness of the Campbell fuse , the court obligingly released its star witness after no more than 90 minutes of testimony .
"" We want to thank you for taking time out of your busy schedule , "" said the chief judge .
And , with that , she was gone .
The press gallery emptied , and Taylor put down his pens .
•
This article was amended on 6 August 2010 , to give the full version of Naomi Campbell 's "" inconvenience "" quote ."
"Naomi Campbell arrived at The Hague today amid intense media scrutiny to appear as a witness for the prosecution in the war crimes trial of the former Liberian president Charles Taylor .
The Streatham - born supermodel , who appeared at the court surrounded by a police escort , is alleged to have received a "" blood diamond "" from the then recently elected leader while staying at Nelson Mandela 's home in September 1997 .
Taylor , the first former African leader to be tried in an international war crimes court , is accused of arming rebels in neighbouring Sierra Leone in return for diamonds .
He denies the allegations .
Campbell , whose appearance today prompted the arrival in The Hague of hundreds of journalists , has been unwilling to testify over the claims .
She resisted the prosecution 's entreaties to give evidence until she was issued last month with a subpoena .
She was granted a special protection order for today 's appearance and was accompanied in court by her QC , the former director of public prosecutions Lord Ken Macdonald .
Under the order she is not allowed to be photographed arriving at or leaving the court .
Asked earlier this year by ABC News about the claims , made to the court by the US actor Mia Farrow and Campbell 's former agent ,
Carole White , she said : "" I did not receive a diamond
and I 'm not going to speak about
that thank you very much . ""
Moments later , when pressed on the issue , she walked off set , apparently hitting a camera as she went .
At a later date , speaking on Oprah Winfrey 's chatshow , the famously truculent Campbell refused to comment further , saying simply : "" I do n't want to be involved in this man 's case –
he has done some terrible things
and I do n't want to put my family in danger . ""
According to Farrow , who was one of several high - profile guests at Mandela 's now infamous Cape Town dinner party , Campbell had said over breakfast the next morning that she had "" an unforgettable story "" to tell . ""
She told us … she had been awakened in the night by knocking at her door .
She opened the door to find two or three men –
I do not recall how many – who presented her with a large diamond which they said was from Charles Taylor , "" Farrow said .
This version of events is largely supported by evidence given by White , who says she heard the African leader say he wanted to give Campbell some diamonds .
Both women are due to testify in the special court for Sierra Leone next week .
If the 40-year - old supermodel confirms she was the recipient of one or more rough diamonds – which she allegedly said she would give to Mandela 's children 's charity – it would contradict Taylor 's assertion that he never had any of the gems in his possession and that he does not , as he told the court , "" have any real experience with the diamond business "" .
However , it is precisely through this business that the prosecution accuses Taylor , now 62 , of having made his bread and butter – by obtaining illegally mined diamonds in Sierra Leone from Revolutionary United Front rebels , smuggling them over the border in "" mayonnaise jars "" and arming the rebels in return .
The former West African "" big man "" would thus have played a central role in perpetuating a war which cost tens of thousands of lives and caused countless atrocities , the prosecution says .
It argues that the diamond allegedly given to Campbell was likely to have been part of a batch obtained by Taylor from the war - torn country and taken to South Africa for sale or exchange for arms .
There is no suggestion that Campbell would have known that .
Along with the claims of his midnight gift to Campbell , Taylor denies all 11 counts of war crimes and crimes against humanity including murder , rape and cannibalism ."
"Quite frankly , only the gossamer - touched Fiona Phillips could do justice to a link between Charles Taylor 's war crimes trial and Bristol Palin 's marital disappointment .
Lost in Showbiz simply is n't up to the task , so do just accept a grinding change of pace as we catch up with the Palins .
Among America 's nuclear families , Sarah 's brood is the Chernobyl – which brings us to the fallout from their latest meltdown .
It concerns Sarah 's eldest daughter and her babyfather Levi Johnston , whom you might recall recently made an audacious bid to divert the spotlight from Chelsea Clinton 's nuptials , by announcing on the cover of a magazine that they were reconciled co - parents of little Tripp , and were once more engaged to be married .
Incidentally , every time someone said , "" I think it 's a publicity stunt , "" a unicorn died .
Alas , how quickly magazine covers turn to dust .
Or rather to different magazine covers , as this week the reticent Bristol confides : "" He 's just obsessed with the limelight "" .
She confides this in a world exclusive interview with People magazine , explaining that the couple 's joy at being reunited was tarnished somewhat when Levi chose the very evening they had announced their engagement to mention he might have fathered a child with another teenage girl .
"" The final straw was him flying to Hollywood for what he told me was some hunting [ TV ] show , "" said Bristol , "" but which I 've come to find out was that music video mocking my family . ""
Ah .
Just another one of those romance - killing diary mixups .
So let 's not be pessimistic .
Sure , right now , Bristol is sobbing out lyrical soundbites such as , "" I got played . ""
( God , would n't it be amazing if she became a country star ? )
But Lost in Showbiz refuses to believe these two lovebirds really know how to quit each other , and suspects Palin 2012 is already covertly scheduling the greatest October surprise of them all ."
"It 's easy to get bedazzled by the spectacle of the tempestuous supermodel testifying against the power - hungry dictator about a pouch of mysterious blood diamonds , which were delivered , in true noir style , in the dark of night by some henchman long after the other guests of the luxurious villa – including a Hollywood movie star , a famous statesman , and other celebrities – had gone to bed for the evening .
Add a violent storm to cut the phones and a muffled gunshot in the night , and you 've all the ingredients of a pulp mystery .
But the truth behind this tale hardly needs another body added to the tens of thousands Charles Taylor , the former Liberian leader , is said to be responsible for .
And fictional embellishments are not necessary to turn the world 's attention once again to the issue of conflict diamonds that tore apart the West African country of Sierra Leone from 1991 - 2002 .
For that , you only need the involvement of a celebrity .
The last instance of consumer hand - wringing over whether their beloved diamond earrings may have been mined by ruthless Sierra Leonean rebels and sold for the enrichment of bloodthirsty strongmen like Taylor was in 2006 , with the release of the Leonardo DiCaprio film Blood Diamond .
The international diamond industry , which turns approximately $ 13bn ( £ 8bn ) in global rough - diamond sales into about $ 72bn worth of jewellery sales per year , reacted to the film before it was even released , afraid that gruesome depictions of the rebel war would impact its bottom line .
It was a sensible fear ; the war in Sierra Leone was particularly atrocious .
Illiterate men wielding rusted blades routinely amputated civilians ' limbs , children were turned into drug - crazed warriors , and mass rape and execution were commonplace .
Diamonds mined at gunpoint fuelled the bloodshed – they were sold through Taylor 's Liberia into a diamond - marketing system that had been a century in the making ; one that did n't care where or from whom they came so long as they could be snatched off the open market before threatening global prices .
Blood diamonds were mixed with legitimate goods from every corner and sold to unsuspecting consumers , oblivious that their desire to showcase a diamond on their finger sometimes came at the expense of someone who could never wear jewellery themselves .
Now it 's Naomi Campbell drawing attention yet again to these atrocities , amplified by her trademark petulance at being called to court .
The diamond industry 's only claim to have changed things for the better is an increasingly rickety - looking certification system for diamonds implemented in 2003 , the Kimberley Process ( KP ) .
Theoretically based on robust internal controls in producing countries – which are supposedly enforced through site visits , statistical analysis and peer reviews – the KP purports to guarantee that diamonds exported from participating countries are certifiably conflict free .
Although launched with great hope , the system is looking more like a joke each year .
It has no leadership other than a rotating chairmanship with few real powers , no accountability and no willpower to use its one punitive tool at its disposal : suspension or expulsion from the club .
Site reviews for some countries are thorough ; others are phoned in .
Internal diamond - tracking systems in countries like Guinea , Angola and Democratic Republic of Congo are so poor there 's no telling where the diamonds they export originate .
Venezuela simply stopped issuing KP certificates in 2005 , but it took until 2008 for the KP to address the matter .
Venezuela then opted to "" self - suspend "" from the program , but continues to mine diamonds – every carat of which is smuggled to neighbouring countries for export under cover of their certificates .
Rebels in Cote d'Ivoire , the only official source of conflict diamonds at the moment , freely smuggle illicit goods through their neighbours .
And against great outcry , even from within the diamond industry itself , the KP has allowed Zimbabwe to continue exporting diamonds in the face of gross human rights violations by the government itself – violations that mirror the very atrocities the Kimberley Process was meant to prevent .
As a result , Zimbabwe 's diamonds are certified "" conflict free , "" although hundreds of people were killed and brutalised to send the stones on to the jewellery store .
Through her antics , Naomi Campbell is adept at drawing attention to herself .
For once it 's welcome , so long as some of that attention spills over onto more important matters ."
"Fourteen people were sitting in court number two at the pristine UN - backed war crimes court in Freetown , Sierra Leone .
There was capacity for scores more , but only nine diehards had come to watch the live streaming of Naomi Campbell 's testimony in the trial of the former Liberian president , Charles Taylor .
The other five were security guards working at the court .
On the streets of Freetown , people were not sure who Campbell was , let alone that she had come to testify at a hearing relating to Sierra Leone 's diamond - fuelled civil war in the 1990s .
Some said that they had grown weary of the trial anyway , and wanted to move on . ""
The court and this trial have lasted for too long , "" said Aiah Ngaujah , a victim of the war , who had both his arms hacked off by rebels who allegedly had been backed by Taylor .
Conteh , another amputee , was convinced that the former Liberian president was guilty as charged . ""
He is living in luxury in Europe while we suffer here , "" he said , dashing to pick up 1,000 leones ( about 16p ) dropped for him from a passing car .
Murtala Kamara , a journalist , said he was pleased to see Campbell in the witness box .
"" It was good she came , you know , "" he said .
Peter Andersen , the spokesman for the court , said the poor attendance could be attributed to a lack of publicity , uncertainty over when the model would appear , and the fact that the proceedings were shown on satellite news channels , allowing people to watch from home – though very few homes here have access to satellite television .
Leon Jenkins - Johnston , a lawyer , who was in court to watch the online streaming of the event , was angry about the low attendance .
"" It 's a shame !
A big shame , "" he said , looking around the near empty courtroom .
"" We are pawns in this whole game . ""

"Two witnesses in the trial of ex - Liberian President Charles Taylor have said the model Naomi Campbell received diamonds from Liberian warlord Charles Taylor .
Campbell 's former agent Carole White and the actor Mia Farrow – both of whom were present at a dinner hosted by Nelson Mandela and attended by Taylor and Campbell – have given evidence in a court in the Hague today , some of which appeared to contradict the testimony given by the model last week .
Both White and Farrow said Campbell had been given diamonds while she was staying at Mandela 's home in South Africa in September 1997 .
Last week Campbell alleged that she had no idea who had sent her the "" dirty looking stones "" until breakfasting with Farrow and others the morning after .
White told the court that Campbell had flirted with Taylor at the dinner , and that he arranged to send her a gift of uncut diamonds .
She said she waited up with Campbell for some men to arrive at the guesthouse with the diamonds , and said the model was in contact with them by phone , either directly or via text message .
Eventually the two women went to bed but White was woken by a tapping on her window which she took to be small stones .
She let the men in and they handed "" five or six "" stones to Campbell , White said .
However , pressed as to whether the men said they were sent by Charles Taylor , White was forced to admit they had not .
Earlier Farrow testified that Campbell had told her the diamonds came from Taylor .
Asked whether , as Campbell had claimed , it was Farrow herself who had said that the gift must have come from Taylor as "" no one else "" would have done it , Farrow replied : "" Absolutely not .
Naomi Campbell said they came from Charles Taylor . ""
She added : "" What I remember is Naomi Campbell joined us at the [ breakfast ] table but before she even sat down she recounted an event of that evening . ""
She said that in the night she had been awakened and some men were knocking at the door and they had been sent by Charles Taylor and
… they had given her a huge diamond .
And she said she intended to give the diamonds to Nelson Mandela 's children 's fund . ""
Pressed by the prosecution on whose suggestion it was that the mysterious donor was Taylor , the then recently elected president of Liberia , Farrow said : "" Only hers .
I did n't know anything about it . ""
Campbell , she added , was "" quite excited "" about the gift .
In her testimony on Thursday , the 40-year - old model said she believed it had been Farrow who had told her that Taylor was behind the gift .
However , a defence lawyer for Taylor argued that all Farrow 's testimony was "" based on your recollection of what you heard 13 years ago "" .
A lot had happened during that period , the lawyer added , mentioning the suicide of Farrow 's brother and the death of her daughter .
But Farrow insisted she was sure of her account .
Campbell 's story , she said , had been "" an unforgettable moment "" .
The defence also pressed her on her claims that Graça Machel , who is now Mandela 's wife , had "" seemed a little distressed "" about the presence of Taylor at the dinner .
Farrow had arrived at the presidential residence to be greeted by Machel telling her , she said , "" in effect , ' you do n't want anything to do with him ' . ""
"" I remember clearly this : that Mrs Machel shepherded me and the children "" away from him , she said .
Despite this recalled anxiety , the defence lawyer pointed out , Machel had subsequently allowed Taylor , Mandela , Farrow and herself to all appear in a photograph together .
Farrow was also asked to try to remember how many people were at the dinner .
She said she could not be sure that Taylor had even stayed for the dinner . ""
I believe he may have departed , "" she said , adding later : "" I can not swear that he was there or that he was not . ""
Dressed in a black suit with her distinctive curly hair falling around her shoulders , Farrow , 65 , spoke softly while questioned by a lawyer for the prosecution , which is attempting to gather evidence to link Taylor to a trade in conflict diamonds from Sierra Leone rebels fighting a bloody civil war .
The 62-year - old former president denies the allegations , as he does all 11 counts of war crimes and crimes against humanity put to him by the SCSL .
Questioned about her relationship with Campbell , Farrow spoke in glowing terms about the model , whom she said she got to know through their charitable activities in South Africa .
"" She was very maternal not only with my kids but with the models [ she had brought over for a charity fashion show ] , "" said the Golden Globe winner , adding Campbell had once even given her daughter a dress .
"" She was absolutely great , "" she added ."
"Mia Farrow told the war crimes tribunal in the Hague today that she used the Guardian for information about blood diamonds and Naomi Campbell 's appearance at a UN tribunal – but admitted making crucial changes .
The Hollywood star admitted cutting and pasting a Guardian article on the subject on her own blog , but left out the caveats in the original Q&amp;A :
Guardian 's blood diamond
Q&amp;A
Prosecutors say the story , if true , would back up allegations that Taylor traded guns to neighbouring Sierra Leone rebels in exchange for uncut diamonds .
The prosecution argues that the diamond allegedly given to Campbell was likely to have been part of a batch obtained by Taylor from Sierra Leone and taken to South Africa for sale or exchange for arms .
Mia Farrow 's blog Prosecutors say the story , backs up allegations that Taylor traded guns to neighbouring Sierra Leone rebels in exchange for uncut diamonds .
The prosecution argues that the diamond allegedly given to Campbell was likely to have been part of a batch obtained by Taylor from Sierra Leone and taken to South Africa for sale or exchange for arms .
The defence spent about 20 minutes questioning Farrow about her use of the Guardian article , to show that she had preconceived ideas about Taylor and was therefore not a credible witness .
When asked by the defence why she took out the phrase "" if true "" , Farrow replied : "" Because I know that it was true . ""
Farrow told the court that she could not bring herself to use the phrase because "" I feel it 's true "" .
She went on to say that she uses material from the internet all the time , editing it to convey what she feels . ""
The blog is simply about my feelings and I used the Guardian to convey my feelings , "" Farrow told the court .
Acknowledging to Taylor 's defence that she removed the qualification contained in the Guardian piece , Farrow said : "" I probably should n't have used the Guardian . ""
In her testimony , Farrow contradicted parts of evidence given by Campbell last week , in which the supermodel alleged that she had no idea who had sent her the "" dirty looking stones "" until breakfast with Farrow and others the morning after .
Asked whether , as Campbell had claimed , it was Farrow herself who had said that the gift must have come from Taylor as "" no one else "" would have done it , Farrow replied : "" Absolutely not .
Naomi Campbell said they came from Charles Taylor . """
"Naomi Campbell 's testimony to the war crimes trial of Charles Taylor , the former Liberian warlord , is expected to be contradicted today by evidence given to the court by her former agent , Carole White .
The supermodel 's claims that she did not know who had sent her a pouch of uncut diamonds 13 years ago are likely to be challenged by White , who accompanied Campbell to the now infamous dinner hosted by Nelson Mandela .
In 90 minutes of testimony given to the Special Court for Sierra Leone ( SCSL ) on Thursday , the Streatham - born supermodel said that while she had accepted the "" dirty looking stones "" when they were presented to her in the middle of the night in September 1997 , she had no idea who had sent them .
At a charity dinner held earlier that night at Mandela 's residence in Pretoria , she said she had engaged in no conversation specifically with Taylor , then newly elected to the Liberian presidency .
She added that there had been no other contact with him , and that the first people to suggest it was he who had sent her the stones were White and the US actor Mia Farrow , when she told them of the diamonds over breakfast .
In evidence already given to the prosecution , however , White claims Campbell and Taylor were sitting next to each other at the dinner and were "" mildly flirtatious "" with each other .
She said she heard him tell Campbell he would send her some diamonds .
"" It was arranged that he would send some men back with the gift , "" the founder of the leading London agency
Premier Model Management told the prosecutors , adding that her former protege "" seemed excited about the diamonds and she kept talking about them "" .
Her testimony today is due to be followed by that of Farrow , who has also said that Campbell knew Taylor had given the gift . ""
She told us that she had been awakened in the night by knocking at her door , she opened the door to find two or three men ... who presented her with a large diamond which they said was from Charles Taylor , "" read a statement from Farrow .
For the prosecution , the possibility that Taylor sent Campbell uncut diamonds is evidence that he was linked to a trade in which he has denied all involvement .
At the time of the dinner , prosecutors allege , the warlord had recently received a delivery of blood diamonds from Sierra Leone .
They say he then used the profits from their sale , and his trip to South Africa , to buy arms for rebels committing atrocities in the country 's civil war .
Taylor , now 62 , denies this , as he denies all 11 counts against him at the SCSL .
During her cross - examination , Campbell , 40 , said she had sat between Mandela and Quincy Jones ; had not spoken of diamonds to anyone ; and had given the stones away not because she felt it would be inappropriate to accept gifts while in South Africa because of her work with underprivileged children .
For Taylor 's defence lawyer , Courtenay Griffiths QC , the theory that his client had sent the diamonds to Campbell is based on "" pure speculation "" .
He alleged White was using this court case as a means of smearing Campbell , against whom she is fighting a separate lawsuit , Griffiths said : "" This is a woman who has a powerful motive to lie about you . ""
"" Correct , "" answered Campbell ."
"7.45am : Last week the supermodel Naomi Campbell admitted accepting "" dirty looking stones "" after meeting the former Liberian leader Charles Taylor at a charity dinner in 1997 .
This added weight to the prosecution 's case that the former warlord traded blood diamonds in return for supplying weapons to the Revolutionary United Front rebels in Sierra Leone .
Campbell said she was told by her former agent Carole White and the actor Mia Farrow that the diamonds came from Taylor , but otherwise she had no idea who sent them .
That testimony is likely to be challenged by White and possibly Farrow .
In evidence to the tribunal , White said she heard Taylor tell Campbell he would send her some diamonds .
Taylor 's defence lawyer Courtenay Griffiths QC claims that White is using the case to smear Campbell as part of a separate dispute .
You can follow a web feed of today 's testimony , on a 30-minute delay , from the court 's website .
Lizzy Davies , who is at the court , writes : The mood at the Special Court for Sierra Leone at Leidschendam is a good deal calmer today than last week , but the tension is mounting .
Observers are keen to see whether Naomi Campbell 's fellow dinner guests will indeed contradict her testimony , as their declarations to the prosecution would seem to suggest .
We 're expecting White 's evidence to be lengthier – the court has predicted it will last two hours – and more detailed than Farrow 's , whose only knowledge of the diamonds seems to have been over breakfast the next morning .
Campbell 's former agent , on the other hand , has told prosecutors she was asked to help arrange the delivery of the diamonds , and that her protege invited the men in for cans of Coca - Cola in her bedroom .
Asked about all this on Thursday , Campbell denied it all .
Meanwhile , Campbell 's "" people "" are milling around the press room – which is , incidentally , far more sparsely populated than Thursday .
They do n't know where she is , they said , but they 'll be her eyes and ears today .
8.38am :
The hearing starts with a complaint from Taylor 's defence counsel Courtenay Griffiths about the order of who appears today .
Carole White was supposed to appear first , it now seems that Mia Farrow will take the stand first , and there 's no sign of White .
Griffiths says this reversal in the timetable is "" totally out of order "" and he accuses the prosecution of "" playing fast and loose "" with the court .
Apparently White has an appointment elsewhere today .
Griffiths says the tribunal is not being held for convenience of witnesses , in an echo of Naomi Campbell 's phrase last week .

9.22am : Farrow is cross - examined by Taylor 's defence lawyer , Morris Anyah .
She confirms she does n't know where the diamond or diamonds came from , and that she did not see the stone(s ) .
The defence is trying to suggest that Farrow 's memory is hazy .
9.26am :
Farrow says Campbell 's breakfast time story about the diamond from Taylor was an "" unforgettable moment "" .
She says her children also remember the story .
The children were 16 or 17 , 12 , and 10 years old at the time , the defence establishes .
9.29am :
The defence quizzes Farrow on whether there was one "" big diamond "" or several .
Campbell talked about two to three "" dirty looking stones "" , Anyah points out .
He also talks about White 's various accounts of the number of diamonds . ""
Yesterday , Carole White told her lawyer that there were five uncut diamonds , "" Anyah said .
Farrow says she remembers a discussion of only one big diamond .
Anyah says a lot has happened to Farrow in the last 13 years .

9.37am :
The tribunal is shown a copy of this BBC story which begins The former head of Nelson Mandela Children 's Fund , Jeremy Ractliffe , has said he did receive uncut diamonds from the model Naomi Campbell .
Anya reads out bits of the story including this : "" Three small uncut diamonds were given to me by Naomi Campbell on the Blue Train on 26 September 1997 , "" he [ Ractliffe ] said in a statement sent to the BBC .
South Africa 's special Hawks police unit has since confirmed to the BBC that they received the stones on Thursday from Mr Ractliffe , who first made contact with them on Tuesday .
9.43am :
Anyah , with Charles Taylor sitting behind him , presses Farrow again on whether there was one diamond or more .
A judge from the tribunal says Farrow has already answered this .
Farrow says what she knows is based on what Campbell said .
"" She said a ' large diamond ' singular , that 's what she said , "" Farrow said .
9.49am :
Farrow is asked to clarify whether Taylor stayed for the charity dinner .
"" I believe he may have departed , "" Farrow says .
"" He may have stayed , she [ Campbell ] may have a better recollection , "" she says .
Farrow says her attention was focused on her children during the dinner .
She remembers a "" large group "" at the dinner on three or more tables .
"" I 'm sorry I ca n't be more precise , "" she tells the president of the tribunal .
"" I did n't know much about him [ Taylor ] before the dinner , "" she says .
Anyah reminds the court that Campbell said there was only one table .
9.54am :
"" I did n't see any flirtation "" [ between Campbell and Taylor ] , Farrow says in reference to White 's testimony .

9.58am :
Farrow confirms that she appeared in the photograph wearing "" traditional African attire "" .

Farrow ca n't remember this .
Farrow recalls the names of the guests in the photograph , she apologises for describing Imran Khan as a soccer player earlier ( 8.49am ) .
10.05am :
The defence drifts way off topic by asking Farrow about when she split up with Woody Allen .
The court is shown a photograph of Farrow , Campbell and the models Christy Turlington and Kate Moss with Mandela at a fundraising party in 1998 .
Not quite sure where this is going .
10.10am :
"" Did you ask Campbell whatever happened to that diamond , "" Farrow is asked of the 1998 party . ""
No I did n't , "" she replies .
10.14am :
Back to the 1997 dinner picture featuring Charles Taylor .
Why is Graca Machel smiling in the picture if she warned Farrow not to be photographed alongside Taylor ?
Farrow is asked .
Maybe she had obligations , Farrow suggests .
10.24am
: Farrow said it was her impression that Charles Taylor overstayed his welcome at the Mandela dinner in 1997 .
Anyah points out that Machel was previously married to Samora Machel , a rebel turned president of Mozambique .
She is not someone who would be unnerved by the company of rebel leaders , Anyah points out .
Farrow confirms she is aware of Machel 's background .
10.31am :
The court takes a mid - morning break .
While we wait for more , here 's Lizzy Davies 's write - up of this morning 's testimony .
Naomi Campbell told guests staying at Nelson Mandela 's home in South Africa that she had received diamonds from the former Liberian warlord Charles Taylor , according to testimony given to a court in The Hague today by the actor Mia Farrow .
Speaking before the special court for Sierra Leone , the US film star contradicted parts of evidence given by the supermodel last week , in which Campbell alleged that she had no idea who had sent her the "" dirty looking stones "" until breakfasting with Farrow and others the morning after .
10.56am :
My colleague Adam Gabbatt has talked to Lizzy Davies who was in court as Mia Farrow gave her evidence .
Lizzy says Farrow told the court "" very clearly "" that Naomi Campbell had told her that the diamonds had come from Charles Taylor .
Taylor 's lawyer is arguing that if Farrow can not remember other points from 13 years ago ( the actor has been hazy on what happened at the dinner hosted by Nelson Mandela ) then perhaps her evidence is faulty .
Farrow insists she remembers what Campbell said about the diamond accurately , however .
11.03am :
The proceedings have resumed and Farrow appears again after another discussion about the order the witness should appear .
Was Carole White present at the breakfast meeting , Anyah asks .
"" I do n't remember , "" Farrow says .
Farrow confirms that she travelled on the Blue Train in September 1997 with other guests including Mandela , Campbell and Archbishop Desmond Tutu .
She says it is likely that Ractliffe was also on the train
but she ca n't remember if he was .
She ca n't remember whether White was on the train .
11.14am :
The court is shown testimony stating that White and Campbell discussed what to do with the diamonds while on board the Blue Train .
Farrow repeats that she heard that Campbell wanted to give the diamonds to the charity at the breakfast - in other words before the Blue Train ride .
"" You knew the country Liberia ? ""
Farrow is asked .
"" Yes , "" she replies with a smile in apparent reference to Campbell 's stated ignorance of the country .
11.18am :
Campbell said it was you or Carole White who said the stones were diamonds and that they came from Charles Taylor , Farrow is told .
One of you is not telling the truth , it is put to her .
Farrow says is not possible that she did not remember the events accurately .
11.23am :
Is it possible that the gift could have come from anyone in South Africa ?
Anyah asks .
"" But for the fact that she said it came from Charles Taylor , "" Farrow replies .
The prosecution name - checked the Guardian referring to an interview in which Farrow said she was interested in books .
"" You are an enlightened person ? ""
Anyah asked .
"" I 'm working on it , "" Farrow said .
Is this the article ?
Here 's an extract : Farrow reported that the previous night she had watched Schindler 's List and could n't stop crying .
She has been reading Hermann Hesse 's Siddhartha and Paramahansa Yogananda 's Autobiography of a Yogi - Thomas Moore 's Care of the Soul is next up - and listening to the slow movements of Bach and Mahler . ""
Alongside my bed is a large window through which I can see the sky , a lake , trees , birds and , at dusk , the deer .
I am at peace and busy with my thoughts . ""
She also mentions reading in this interview .
11.34am
: As a well - read person with an interest in Africa , did it occur to you to contact the tribunal about what you had heard ?
Farrow is asked .
"" I did n't know this incident would be so consequential , "" she says .
"" My focus was on Sudan , "" she says .
Farrow says the Rwandan genocide "" changed my life "" .
Farrow says she had forgotten about the diamond story . ""
Yes , I regret not putting it together earlier , "" she says .
If Taylor is found guilty of the crimes , I am "" gratified "" that he was arrested , Farrow says clarifying her declaration to the court .
She says she is "" happy "" to provide evidence .
11.40am :
"" I am willing and pleased to offer whatever I can , "" Farrow says .
She says using the word "" pleased "" in that context is a figure of speech and does n't mean she is "" elated "" .
The court is shown a clip of a news item in which Farrow talks about hearing of Campbell receiving the large diamond .
In the clip Farrow says that she stands by the story in the face of denials from Taylor .
"" I 'm eager to see the people of Liberia and Sierra Leone see justice .
They deserve that , "" Farrow says in the clip .
Anyah points out that Taylor is not accused of anything in relation to Liberia .
Farrow admits she did n't know that .
11.54am :
The court is shown extracts of Farrow 's blog .
These bits are read out : Mr. Bashir is indicted by the International Criminal Court ( ICC ) for war crimes and crimes against humanity , but the African Union Panel on Darfur has clearly aligned itself with Khartoum .
For seven years , the people of Darfur have been pleading for protection and for justice .
They do not believe either peace or justice can come while Mr. Bashir - orchestrator of their suffering - remains president of Sudan .
Nor do they believe "" locally owned accountability "" is remotely possible under the current regime .
When Barack Obama was elected president of the United States , hope abounded , even in Darfur 's bleak refugee camps .
Darfuris believed this son of Africa could understand their suffering , would end the violence that has taken so much from them , and bring Mr. Bashir to justice .
I have held new babies named Obama and watched as Darfuris began to dream again .
It is past time for us to step up and accept our moral obligation to protect a defenseless people .
The American people should urge Mr. Gration and the Obama administration to lead a diplomatic offensive to convince the world to isolate Omar alBashir as a fugitive from justice , and to whole - heartedly support the only body offering Darfur 's people a measure of authentic justice : the International Criminal Court .
12.00pm :
What has all this got to do with what Naomi Campbell told the witness about receiving diamonds , one of the judges asked of the defence 's line of questioning .
Anyah is allowed to continue .
"" Do you really believe that the international criminal court is the only body that can offer the people of Darfur justice ? "" he asks . ""
Yes , "" Farrow replies .
She also talks about her hunger strike over Darfur .
It lasted 12 days , she says .
"" I just could n't sit by and watch "" Farrow says .
The court is shown another video , this time of Farrow campaigning against Omar al - Bashir 's regime in Sudan .
In the clip she talks of thugs "" who hack their way to power "" .
Farrow says she believes Bashir is guilty of genocide before the verdict of the international criminal court .
12.20pm
: Farrow is challenged about a blog entry last Thursday in which she cut and pasted a Guardian article about blood diamonds .
The article is shown to the court .
Mark Tran , who wrote the article , is sitting next to me chuckling .
( Mark says he himself cut and pasted much of the article from another one that he wrote on the subject in 2007 ) .
Farrow admits she made changes to the Guardian article before pasting it on her blog .
12.27pm :
Farrow admits taking out the crucial words "" if true "" from the Guardian article .
Farrow said she could n't bring herself to write "" if true "" because she knows it to be true .
Here 's the extract from Mark 's Q&amp;A.
The supermodel was called to testify by the prosecution for having allegedly received a diamond as a gift from Taylor in 1997 .
There is no suggestion that Campbell knew the possible origin of the diamond .
She admitted in court to receiving "" dirty - looking "" diamonds that she was later told came from Taylor .
Prosecutors say the story , if true , would back up allegations that Taylor traded guns to neighbouring Sierra Leone rebels in exchange for uncut diamonds .
Here 's how it appeared in Farrow 's blog : Naomi Campbell was called to testify by the prosecution for having allegedly received a diamond as a gift from Taylor in 1997 .
There is no suggestion that Campbell knew the possible origin of the diamond .
Prosecutors say the story backs up allegations that Taylor traded guns to neighbouring Sierra Leone rebels in exchange for uncut diamonds .
The prosecution argues that the diamond allegedly given to Campbell was likely to have been part of a batch obtained by Taylor from Sierra Leone and taken to South Africa for sale or exchange for arms .
Farrow says she probably should n't have edited the article .
"" I used the Guardian to explain what the trial is about , "" Farrow said .
12.39pm : Farrow is asked to clarify a few points about her testimony by the tribunal 's judges .
She says she wants to retract her estimate of the number of guests at the party .
She also says that Mandela 's partner , Graca Machel , pointed out Charles Taylor at the party and said that he "" should have gone by now "" .
"" What was Campbell demeanour at breakfast ? "" , the president of the tribunal asks .
She seemed excited , Farrow says .
"" She did n't sit down before telling the diamond story . ""
Charles Taylor definitely was n't on the Blue Train ride , Farrow said .
There are no more questions .
Before she leaves , Farrow tries to clarify a point about the breakfast conversation .
"" I assumed there was a diamond as Miss Campbell was accustomed to receiving .
I did n't know it was diamonds in the rough .
I pictured a diamond in a box
, she did n't say it was a diamond in the rough . ""
That 's it from Farrow .
She is thanked for her evidence and leaves the court .
12.56pm :
Carole White , Naomi Campbell 's former agent , takes to the stand .
"" I was her agent in London , then I became her mother agent , "" White says .
She says she worked with Campbell for 17 years .
White confirms that she went on the Blue Train trip in September 1997 and stayed the night in Mandela 's guesthouse .
White says she kept a record of the itinerary of the trip , but before she goes into details the court adjourns for its lunch hour .
1.08pm : While the court is at lunch , here 's a summary of the main points from Mia Farrow 's testimony :
• Farrow contradicted key parts of Naomi Campbell 's testimony about rough diamonds she received after meeting Charles Taylor at a charity dinner with Nelson Mandela in September 1997 .
Farrow , who believed there was only one large diamond , said it was Campbell who suggested that the gift came from Taylor .
•
Farrow said Campbell was excited as she recounted receiving the gift .
Farrow said it was an "" unforgettable story "" , but her recollection of other details about the event seemed hazy .
•
Campbell told Farrow that she planned to donate the diamond(s ) to Nelson Mandela 's children 's charity .
Jeremy Ractliffe , who last week admitted receiving the diamonds from Campbell , was probably on the Blue Train ride that guests took after Campbell was given the stones , Farrow said .
•
Charles Taylor 's lawyers suggested that Farrow was an unreliable witness by pointing out that she had preconceived ideas about alleged African warlords .
The defence revealed that Farrow had omitted the words "" if true "" when she cut and pasted a Guardian article referring to the allegations that Taylor had given Campbell rough diamonds .
There 's more in our news story on Farrow 's evidence .
2.06pm :
The trial continues with questions to White from prosecution lawyer Brenda Hollis about Campbell 's trip to South Africa .
White describes Mandela 's guesthouse as "" baronial "" .
White says that Taylor attended the dinner at Mandela 's house together with Campbell and Farrow .
White says she met Taylor briefly before the dinner .
"" I was seated three down from him "" [ during the dinner ] she says .
Campbell told White that Mandela 's partner , Graca Machel , was annoyed that Taylor was at the dinner .
2.17pm :
"" Naomi leant back and Charles Taylor leant forward .
Naomi was very excited , and told me ' he 's going to give me some diamonds ' ""
White told the court .
"" They were being charming to each other .
Mildly flirting , "" White said .
"" They were just being affable , "" she clarifies .
"" Naomi was flirting with him [ Taylor ] and he was flirting back , "" she adds .
"" I heard them laughing and talking , but I ca n't recall the conversation , "" White says .
2.23pm :
One of Taylor 's ministers discussed bringing diamonds to Campbell 's room in the guesthouse , White said .
She does n't recall which minister .
She said he was wearing African dress and was about 35 to 40 years old .
White said she heard this conversation but did not take part in it .
"" Naomi was very excited about these diamonds "" White says describing the moment she and Campbell were waiting for the diamonds to arrive .
On two occasions White and Campbell went into the garden to see if the men with diamonds had arrived . ""
She knew they were on their way , "" White said .
She said Campbell was in touch with someone on her phone .
"" I do n't recall if it was a phonecall or a text , "" White says .
2.28pm : "" As I was getting ready for bed I heard some chinky news at the window as if someone was throwing pebbles , "" White says .
"" ' We have something for Miss Campbell ' .
I told them to wait , "" she said .
White told Campbell that the guys with the diamonds had come , White recalled .
"" She really wanted to let them in "" [ to the guesthouse ]
White says .
"" The guys came in .
I gave them a Coca - Cola each .
They took out a scruffy piece of paper [ containing the diamonds ] .
They were quite disappointing because they were n't shiny . ""
White said there were five or six diamonds and that she handled the paper containing the stones .
2.33pm :
"" I was quite worried about the gift , because if she took them out of South Africa
I thought it would be me who would have to carry them and that it was illegal to take diamonds out of South Africa , "" White says .
White says she told Campbell the next morning to "" do some good "" with the diamonds and that she should donate them to Mandela 's charity .
We both discussed that the diamonds were not very impressive , White recalled .
2.36pm :
"" When we were on the Blue Train we went to see Jeremy Ractliffe in his carriage , "" White says .
By then the diamonds were in a pouch , White says .
She does n't recall how many diamonds were given . ""
He looked shock and horrified .
He did n't want them .
Reluctantly he did take them , "" White says .
Both White and Campbell pressed Ractliffe to take the stones , she adds .
"" We explained to him that we knew it was bad to take them out of South Africa , and that he could do something better with them , "" she says .
2.45pm :
White is asked to label a photograph taken by David Bailey showing Mandela , Ractliffe and Campbell .
( It must be one of the worst photographs David Bailey has ever taken ) .
Hollis says she does n't want to ask any more questions .
2.48pm :
Taylor 's defence counsel Courtenay Griffiths begins cross examination by asking White whether she watched Campbell 's testimony .
White says she saw snippets on the news .
White admits she may have been expected to appear live on CNN tonight for an interview with Anderson Cooper .
Many people have asked me to appear on TV tonight , she says .
"" I did not agree , my attorney might have agreed , "" she says .
White says she was n't sure whether she wanted to appear , and wanted to wait until after she had given testimony before agreeing to the request .
2.58pm : "" Did you have a blood diamond party in your offices last week ? ""
Griffiths asks White referring to a Facebook posting by White booking agent Annie Wilshire .
White says she was with Wilshire last Friday but denies going to such a party .
3.03pm :
There was a party on Thursday night , White says , but it was nothing to do with blood diamonds .
It was a party to mark the purchase of new house for models .
No one referred to it as blood diamond party , White insists .
A caption of a photo from the party refers to it as a "" blood diamond night "" Griffiths points out .
White is asked to label the people in the photo .
3.10pm :
White says she is surprised that the party was referred to as a "" blood diamond night "" .
She confirms Campbell 's testimony was discussed at the party .
"" It does surprise me that terminology , because I 'm not crass enough to organise a party like that , "" White says .
Griffiths confirms that "" the whole of my office "" was watching Campbell 's testimony live last Thursday .
When Campbell said her appearance was an "" inconvenience "" the whole office laughed , according to a Facebook posting from one of White 's employees .
The comment was made by a former employee White says .
Here 's the offending Facebook page .
3.21pm : White confirms that she has a legal claim against Campbell worth around £ 600,000 . ""
You have a powerful motive to lie about her , "" Griffiths states .
She later accepts that she is looking for more than £ 600,000 .
You are looking for ammunition against Campbell , Griffiths states .
"" That 's not true "" , White replies .
3.28pm : Why did your lawyer think it important that you go public with this story ?
Griffiths asks .
Did your lawyer say it would help with your lawsuit against Campbell ?
Griffiths asks .
No , White insists .
"" You are not being frank with this court , "" Griffiths replies .
3.33pm : "" Would you have had an opportunity to meet Nelson Mandela , were it not for Miss Campbell ? ""
Griffiths asks . ""
Probably not , "" White accepts .
While all this is going on Taylor continues to take notes in his seat behind Griffiths .
"" I suggest you are the one who owes Naomi Campbell , "" Griffiths says .
3.39pm :
White says the last time she spoke to Mia Farrow was 1997 on the Blue Train .
She has made no contact with her since , she says .
Griffiths asks her to provide telephone records to prove this .
White says she is willing to do this .
She says it is coincidence that Farrow provided written testimony to the court two weeks after White launched her lawsuit against Campbell .
White again insists that she has not spoken to Farrow since 1997 .
She adds that no one else , to her knowledge , has contacted Farrow on her behalf .
3.46pm :
White says she knew nothing about blood diamonds in 1997 , but she knew who Charles Taylor was , and she knew a little about Liberia .
3.49pm :
White admits her knowledge of Mandela 's compound in Pretoria is sketchy .
She ca n't remember if the compound is surrounded by fields .
Were you there ?
Griffiths asks .
I was there , I may have been asleep when we drove there , White says .
She says she ca n't recall if there were lots of armed guards at the compound .
How did two burly black men get into the compound to through stones at your window ?
White is asked .
"" It is question I ask myself , "" she replies .
She insists that two men came into the compound with diamonds .
She admits that she ca n't recall whether they came from Liberia or whether they had been sent by Charles Taylor .
4.01pm :
White is thanked for her evidence and asked to return tomorrow .
She is told not to discuss the case with anyone including her lawyer .
That 's it for now .
Thanks for your comments ."

"The testimony that Naomi Campbell 's former agent gave to the Charles Taylor war crimes tribunal was branded "" a complete pack of lies "" yesterday after she admitted that parts of her evidence linking Taylor to a mysterious gift of diamonds were either mistaken or based on her own assumptions .
Speaking on the second day of testimony to a court trying the former Liberian president for crimes allegedly committed in Sierra Leone , Carole White appeared shaken during cross - examination by Courtenay Griffiths QC .
Asked whether , as she had previously told prosecutors in May , she had heard the former warlord tell the supermodel over dinner at Nelson Mandela 's house that he was going to "" send her diamonds "" , she eventually admitted that she had not .
"" I ca n't recall those words , "" she said .
She had interpreted a nod from Taylor to Campbell as a sign of "" acquiescence "" from the warlord to the model , she said .
The presiding judge pressed her on how she had managed to see this while seated three places away and leaning back to speak to Campbell . ""
How is that possible ? "" asked the judge . ""
For me , mathematically and geographically , it 's a little hard to understand what happened .
"" Wearing a black dress with her blonde hair loose over her shoulders , the co - founder of the London - based Premier Model Management agency appeared flustered by the questioning .
She told the court that despite at first having remembered the story as "" quite funny "" , she realised it was "" very serious "" , adding : "" It was my duty to tell my story . ""
Prosecutors claim that , if true , the story would be a key piece of evidence linking the former warlord with an illicit trade in diamonds , in which rebels fighting in Sierra Leone 's civil war were receiving weapons in return for gems .
Taylor denies the allegations .
However , White 's account – in which Taylor and Campbell allegedly arranged the delivery of the diamonds during a "" mildly "" flirtatious dinner – was attacked on all fronts by Griffiths today .
"" I suggest you 're a liar , "" he said .
White replied : "" That 's nice of you . ""
The agent admitted she had only assumed and not known for sure that Campbell had been in touch with Taylor or one of his representatives in the run - up to the delivery of the diamonds . ""
That was an assumption on my part , "" she said .
"" Quite frankly , Ms White , I suggest your account is a complete pack of lies and you 've made it up to assist in your lawsuit against Ms Campbell , "" Griffiths told the court , referring to a separate court case between the former friends over an alleged breach of contract by Campbell . ""
Put bluntly , "" he added , appearing to quote from a song by veteran hip hop star Grandmaster Flash , "" This is all about the money .
There ai n't nothing funny . ""
Taylor 's defence claims White stands to gain hundreds of thousands – if not millions – of dollars from the lawsuit in New York and that therefore her testimony is compromised .
The former "" mother agent "" of Campbell rejected those accusations .
Her decision to testify at The Hague had nothing to do with the other case , she insisted , and she vehemently denied bending the truth to suit her own purposes . ""
Well , I can tell you , your honour
, it 's not a lie .
This happened , "" she said .
After her testimony , Daniel Bright , White 's lawyer in the New York lawsuit , dismissed accusations that his client was using the Taylor case to tarnish Campbell 's reputation as "" complete nonsense "" .
"" I do n't really need any more material , "" he added , claiming that the Streatham - born supermodel was known in New York "" mainly for hitting people "" .
Urging his client to appear in Taylor 's trial , Bright said , had been a "" moral issue "" as his grandfather had died in Auschwitz and his mother was a Holocaust survivor .
He had felt so strongly about her appearance , he told journalists , that he would even have considered severing his professional relationship with White had she refused to testify .
Griffiths was scathing not only about yesterday 's evidence , but about the entire treatment of the Campbell question . ""
This whole body of evidence is worthless , "" he said , accusing the prosecution of indulging in cheap publicity .
Announcing the next witness on the stand today , the former RUF rebel leader , Issa Sesay , the presiding judge , was heard to tell those still present in court : "" Lets see what we can salvage from this morning . """
"Naomi Campbell came out fighting last night against suggestions that she had lied during her testimony to the war crimes trial of Charles Taylor , insisting that she had "" nothing to gain "" from telling anything other than the truth .
"" I 've no motive here .
Nothing to gain .
I am a black woman who has and will always support good causes especially relating to Africa , "" the supermodel said , in a statement that was released after her former agent Carole White and the actress Mia Farrow finished giving their evidence .
Both women contradicted Campbell 's account that she did not know who gave her the pouch of diamonds after a party hosted by Nelson Mandela in September 1997 .
Five days after she had told the court in the Hague that her appearance under subpoena as a witness for the prosecution of the former Liberian warlord was "" a big inconvenience "" , Campbell also said she had accepted that her choice of language had been unfortunate .
But , she insisted , it had been a misleading indication of her attitude towards the trial . ""
Campbell accepts the use of the word ' inconvenient ' was a poor choice of word but it was made off the cuff and was taken massively out of context , "" said a statement from her management .
It added that the model , from south London , had "" fears for her family "" after she read about Taylor 's alleged crimes on the internet .
In her evidence to the Special Court for Sierra Leone ( SCSL ) on Thursday , the 40-year - old model admitted that , when she met the former Liberian president at a charity dinner held by Nelson Mandela , she had never heard of his country and had only that evening been told who Taylor was .
But any impression of nonchalance or ignorance was misleading , said Campbell 's spokespeople last night .
"" The suggestion that Campbell in some way does n't care about the plight of those suffering in Africa is ridiculous and hurtful , "" they said in a statement , mentioning the model 's fundraising and charity work in Tanzania and South Africa .
The supermodel was yesterday photographed in Sardinia with her Russian partner , accompanied by Leonardo DiCaprio , the Hollywood star of the 2006 film Blood Diamond .
While Campbell was holidaying , White , her former agent was facing a bruising cross - examination from Taylor 's defence lawyer , Courtenay Griffiths QC .
Asked whether , as she had previously told prosecutors in May , the agent had heard the former warlord tell Campbell during the dinner that he was going to "" send her diamonds "" , White eventually admitted that she had not .
"" I ca n't recall those words , "" she said .
She had interpreted a nod from Taylor to Campbell as a sign of "" acquiescence "" from the warlord to the model , she said .
After picking holes in other parts of her testimony , Griffiths branded her account "" a complete pack of lies "" and alleged she had "" made it up "" to further her own case in a separate lawsuit against Campbell being fought in the United States over a contract dispute .
"" Put bluntly , "" he added , appearing to quote from a song by veteran hip - hop star Grandmaster Flash , "" this is all about the money .
There ai n't nothing funny . ""
White , the former so - called "" mother - agent "" of Campbell , rejected those accusations .
Her decision to testify at the Hague had nothing to do with the other case , she insisted , and she vehemently denied bending the truth to suit her own purposes . ""
Well , I can tell you , your honour
, it 's not a lie .
This happened , "" she said , sticking by her claims that Campbell had known all along that the diamonds had come from Taylor .
The model told the court the gift had come with no explanation and she had no inkling that it could have come from the Liberian until breakfast the next day ."
"The involvement of Naomi Campbell , Carole White and Mia Farrow is just a celebrity sideshow to the key questions about Charles Taylor 's involvement in Sierra Leone 's brutal civil war ( Report , 11 August ) .
As David Keen 's scholarly book Conflict and Collusion in Sierra Leone clearly argues , Taylor was only one element in the brutality .
He is being made the one scapegoat for many elements in the government , army and private militias run by tribal chiefs that took part in the war .
This civil war was more a general uprising by disaffected youth in a country that was , and probably still is , being pillaged and its rich resources , including diamonds , being sold cheaply to line the pockets of corrupt politicians and the upper levels of the military .
Charles Taylor has a lot to answer for , but there are many others that now hope to hide behind him being the only person being prosecuted and the myth being perpetuated that this was a war only about blood diamonds .

"People Model witness
Naomi Campbell
It 's an old story – boy meets girl at a party , showers her with diamonds , girl ends up giving evidence ( despite it being "" a big inconvenience "" ) against him at a war crimes tribunal .
We 've all been there .
Supermodel Naomi Campbell insisted to the inquisitive souls at The Hague that she had no idea that Charles Taylor was a – nay , the – Liberian warlord .
She was as surprised as anyone when two men turned up at her hotel door after a dinner hosted by Nelson Mandela and gave her some "" dirty looking stones "" , and remains astonished and appalled by the news that they were likely to be blood diamonds , used to fund the civil war in somewhere called Sierra Leone .
FBoth fellow guest Mia Farrow and Campbell 's agent dispute this version of events and so theTaylor 's alleged terrible crimes look set to be safely relegated to sideshow status for a while yet .

"The man who received alleged "" blood diamonds "" from former supermodel Naomi Campbell has resigned from the Nelson Mandela Children 's Fund ( NMCF ) , it emerged today .
Jeremy Ractliffe is the first major casualty of the war crimes trial of former Liberian president Charles Taylor , a case that also put the reputations of Campbell , her former agent Carole White , and the actor Mia Farrow in the dock .
A former chief executive of the fund , Ractliffe was questioned by its trustees over why he accepted three uncut diamonds from Campbell in 1997 and kept them for 13 years without informing the fund 's board .
He handed them to police only when he was named in Campbell 's testimony at the court in The Hague .
The fund said today that Ractliffe , 74 , apologised for endangering its reputation and leaving himself open to criminal prosecution .
He will step down from the fund at next week 's annual general meeting .
Oupa Ngwenya , the fund 's strategic projects , initiatives and partnerships coordinator , said : "" Mr Ractliffe regrets his omission to inform the chairperson , CEO and the rest of the board of trustees of the [ fund ] of his receipt of the uncut diamonds until now and acknowledges that had he done so , he and the board would have found a better and lawful way to manage the situation . ""
He has apologised to the chairperson , CEO , the board and the NMCF for the anxiety and possible reputational risk his conduct may have caused to the NMCF . ""
Ractliffe has claimed that he kept the diamonds to protect Campbell , the fund and former president Mandela himself .
Ngwenya continued : "" Mr Ractliffe has stated that he acted in what he sincerely believed to be in the best interest of the NMCF and its founder and realises that he has left himself open to possible prosecution . ""
For these reasons , he considers it correct and proper for him not to make himself available for re - election as a trustee at the forthcoming annual general meeting of NMCF on 27 August 2010 .
Mr Ractliffe has also undertaken to resign as a board member of the USA affiliate of the NMCF with immediate effect .
""
The board has accepted Mr Ractliffe 's apology , his decision not to make himself available for re - election on 27 August 2010 and to resign as a board member of the USA affiliate of the NMCF . ""
South African police have sent the three stones to the country 's diamond board for authentication before deciding on their next step .
It is illegal for an individual to be in possession of uncut diamonds .
Ractliffe endorsed the NMCF 's statement .
"" I do think it 's a fair statement , "" he added .
"" I wo n't go to the AGM . """

"Viktor Bout , the notorious international arms dealer , has been extradited to America to face charges of selling weapons to some of the most nefarious strongmen and terrorist actors of modern times – including Jonas Savimbi , Charles Taylor and Mullah Omar .
But while Victor Bout 's arrest in Thailand in 2008 and prospective lifetime incarceration is a win for US law enforcement , his capture is , at best , an anecdotal episode in the much larger narrative of an uncontrolled global gray market involving the trafficking of narcotics , small arms , humans , dual - use nuclear items and all manner of contraband from one corner of the globe to willing consumers in another .
Evidence suggests that a "" guards , guns and gates "" approach will not suffice to overcome the momentous growth of this shadow trade .
Nor is any overhaul and harmonisation of global export controls likely soon .
A new strategy is required to prevent future Viktor Bouts from flourishing in the globalised economy of the 21st century .
Halting the inexorable corrosion of the legitimate economy , and by extension , our security , may yet prove to be one of the greatest challenges of our era .
Offshore outsourcing , supply chaining and just - in - time delivery conspire today to form the lifeblood of the global economy , together helping to generate the greatest mass exodus from poverty in human history over the last half century .
Annually , more than 8bn tones of international seaborne trade and the millions of tonnes of airfreight are transported worldwide .
Yet , as the rapid movement of goods around the planet has grown , so too has the trans - shipment of illicit items that threaten the very stability of this trade .
In unprecedented numbers , small- and large - scale traffickers exploit legitimate carriers to transport their illegal wares undetected .
In the face of massive growth in international trade , governments ' efforts to stem the tide of contraband have proven at best insufficient , and at worst , grossly ineffective .
Warlords and terrorists , for instance , were not Victor Bout 's only clients .
In May of 2004 , it was revealed that the US government had itself been a client of Bout 's network , using him to ship American military materiel to Baghdad in the wake Operation Iraqi Freedom .
The inability of the US government to prevent subcontracting to a known outlaw suggests that traditional law and order approaches to trafficking prevention have hit the buffers .
While enhanced government intervention may be necessary in vulnerable environments , the global transportation infrastructure remains largely in private hands .
And in a world economy based upon the rapid and efficient movement of goods , overzealous new regulation would be unwelcome and unproductive .
So , it falls on the private sector – whose interests are equally imperiled by illicit trafficking – to take a greater role in tackling these threats .
But for governments , too , recruiting the market itself to squeeze out traffickers like Victor Bout would be an obvious win .
And the United States government is one of the largest single clients of the global transportation industry .
According to the Pentagon , the US Army alone procures $ 1.8bn annually in commercial freight services .
In addition , it is estimated that the Defense Department also directly influences an additional $ 4bn in shipping contracts worldwide .
In an overall market estimated to be $ 430bn , the US military alone has huge leverage .
Adding the purchasing power of the US federal government and other like - minded governments and the market forces currently slanted in favour of the illicit trafficker could be bent back in favour of those willing to play by the rules .
Such state actors could help the industry to develop a voluntary "" shipping code of conduct "" , by which enhanced scrutiny of cargo would filter out a great proportion of contraband from the legitimate supply chain .
Firms tend to resist such measures because they 're seen as additional "" red tape "" , slowing down transactions .
Committed governments could help reinforce positive behaviour up and down the supply chain by recognising this code and dealing only with "" white - listed "" companies that choose to abide by it .
Ultimately , rogue companies would be forced out of the industry by their buying power .
In an era of diminished government resources to combat transnational threats , the solutions to these challenges must go beyond locking up individual bad guys like Bout – whose market niche has undoubtedly been filled by the next unscrupulous profiteer .
Solutions designed by industry , enforced by governments and adopted by responsible businesses everywhere are the logical next step in global counter - trafficking efforts ."
"Judges in one of the world 's most controversial war crimes trials have been deliberately slowing down proceedings , senior US officials believe , causing significant delays to proceedings .
Secret cables reveal US doubts about the trial in The Hague of Charles Taylor , the former president of Liberia , amid allegations that one of the judges has manipulated proceedings so that she can personally give the verdict in the case . ""
[ Sources ] speculate that Justice [ Julia ]
Sebutinde may have a timing agenda , "" one senior US diplomat states .
"" They think she , as the only African judge , wants to hold the gavel as presiding judge when the trial announces the Taylor judgment . ""
The cable alleges that Sebutinde , from Uganda , had slowed proceedings while she waited for her turn at the court 's rotating presidency , which finally came up in January .
Experts say such moves are common in international criminal proceedings .
"" It is certainly the case that the identity of the presiding judge is a factor that those involved in an international trial pay careful attention to , "" said international law expert Philippe Sands QC .
"" That has been very clear in my experience . ""
Taylor , who was the president of Liberia but is on trial for alleged crimes relating to the conflict in Sierra Leone , remains in custody in The Hague , where the trial continues in the premises of the international criminal court .
Sierra Leoneans have expressed anger at the slow proceedings .
"" People are frustrated that this case is taking so long , "" said AB Jalloh , a Sierra Leonean journalist .
"" Sierra Leoneans are really frustrated that they have not been able to reach the final decision at the set time , and that they have kept on extending proceedings .
Many feel that the money could have been better spent elsewhere in Sierra Leone . ""
The court denied that proceedings had been deliberately slowed down , stating that the judges had tried to speed up proceedings . ""
Since she became presiding judge last January , Justice Sebutinde has worked to expedite the Taylor trial , "" a spokesperson said .
"" All of the judges of the trial chamber have worked tirelessly , and made personal sacrifices , to expedite the Taylor trial .
The allegations that any or all of the judges have sought to slow down the proceedings is untrue . ""
But the cables reveal America 's lack of confidence in the proceedings , as officials at the court explored possibilities for eventually putting Taylor on trial in the US .
"" The best we can do for Liberia is to see Taylor is put away for a long time and we can not delay for the results of the present trial to consider next steps , "" another high - ranking US official stated in a cable .
"" All legal options should be studied to ensure Taylor can not return to destablise Liberia .
Building a case in the US against Taylor for financial crime such as wire fraud would probably be the best route .
There may be other options , such as applying the new law criminalising the use of child soldiers or terrorism statutes , "" the cable adds .
Americans were so keen to see Taylor 's trial begin quickly that they were willing to ignore reports that a senior official at the court was being abusive towards employees , the documents also reveal .
The Taylor trial has been dogged by controversy from the outset .
It had originally been anticipated that proceedings at The Hague would have concluded by the end of this year .
Earlier this year the model Naomi Campbell was summoned to give evidence at the court , amid allegations that she had received a "" blood diamond "" from the former Liberian leader , which prosecutors said proved Taylor 's connection to the conflict in neighbouring Sierra Leone ."

( C ) Chief Prosecutor Stephen Rapp 's ill considered announcement in the press February 24 that Charles Taylor may walk free because of a supposed budget shortfall for the Special Court for Sierra Leone , where Taylor is presently on trial , made headlines in the local press , and raised anxiety here about Taylor 's imminent return .
The GOL was alarmed enough that President Sirleaf called Ambassador on February 28 to raise her concerns .
Sirleaf pointed out that Liberia 's stability remains fragile , and such remarks reverberated throughout the country , as people are still traumatized by Taylor and the war .
3 .
( C )
The press accounts out of The Hague have also emboldened the pro - Taylor factions here , including his extended family members , financiers and National Patriotic Party ( NPP ) loyalists , raising their hopes that Taylor might be acquitted soon .
Despite their rhetoric about "" moving on , "" they have thus far refused to appear before the Truth and Reconciliation Commission ( TRC ) to account for their activities , and those on the UN Sanctions lists continue to request delisting on the basis they have done nothing wrong rather than demonstrating what they have done to provide restitution for their activities .
GOL TREADING CAREFULLY WITH TAYLOR
FACTIONS -------------------------------------------
4 .
( C )
The government itself is caught in the middle .
There is quite little the GOL can do legally to arrest , prosecute or freeze assets of those who were close to Taylor , even if the political will were there , which remains an open question .
The TRC has recommended a domestic war crimes court be set up , but under statute an Independent National Commission on Human Rights ( INHCR ) would implement the recommendation , and the Legislature ( some of whom had close ties to Taylor ) has thus far failed to establish the INCHR .
The Legislature has also refused to pass any law that would allow the GOL to freeze assets of those on the UN sanctions list , and the Supreme Court has ruled that any confiscation of property can be done only after a trial .
5 .
( C )
The Accra Comprehensive Peace Agreement ( CPA ) of August 2003 that ended the 14-year civil war , did not require the NPP to disband and in fact permitted the NPP to participate in the transitional government and in the 2005 elections .
The NPP now holds seven seats in the Legislature ( which may be one reason the legislation is being blocked ) .
As well , none of Taylor 's properties have been seized by the government and they remain in good shape and remarkably free of squatters , as no one dares to take the risk of retribution .
COMMUNICATIONS AMONG TAYLOR SUPPORTERS REMAIN STRONG ---------------------------------------------
------- 6 .
( C )
The pro - Taylor forces still have the ability to organize themselves .
An NPP rally in December 2008 gathered a sizeable crowd , and Taylor supporters in June 2008 succeeded in preventing FBI investigators from entering Taylor 's residence "" White Flower "" to obtain evidence for the Chucky Taylor trial in Florida .
The most recent example was their effort on March 7 to disrupt the International Women 's Colloquium .
Taylor remains popular within many rural communities , especially in Bong , Lofa and Nimba counties , and is seen as someone who was able to unite Liberia 's different ethnic groups .
We also suspect there is some sympathy within the Americo - Liberian population who saw him as their deliverance from their losses following the 1979 coup .
While we do not suggest they would want Taylor to return , we are sure that they do no want too many rocks to be turned over .
7 .
( C )
Although we do not have any direct evidence to support the belief that pro - Taylor factions are behind much of the MONROVIA 00000188 002 OF 002 armed robbery on the premise that crime will keep the government weak and the country unstable , the GOL is certainly convinced of this , and has taken steps to counteract the threat .
The most recent act was to put Taylor - era head of police Paul Mulbah into the LNP as an "" advisor "" that some accuse ( and the government denies ) was in order to placate the Taylor people in advance of the March 7 - 8 International Women 's Colloquium .
That the Taylor crowd can still motivate such a reaction in the government is a testament to their influence .
8 .
( C ) Lines of communications within Taylor 's faction , the National Patriotic Front of Liberia ( NPFL ) remain intact .
To be sure , the disarmament of the factions following the CPA has been extremely successful , and we have thus far been unable to confirm the existence of any large weapons caches , despite the persistent rumors .
But the reintegration of the ex - combatants is far from complete .
Former NPFL commanders Roland Duo ( the only senior Taylor supporter to have testified before the TRC ) , Christopher "" General Mosquito "" Vambo and Melvin Sogbandi
( none of whom are on the sanctions lists ) remain in contact with the ex - combatants , and would have the capability to organize an uprising or even criminal activity .
9 .
( C )
Certainly , the same is true for the other factions , the Liberians United for Reconciliation and Democracy ( LURD ) and the Movement for Democracy in Liberia ( MODEL ) .
While apparently unarmed and not active in Liberia , we continue to receive reports that LURD is recruiting ex - combatants for militias in Guinea and MODEL is doing the same for Cote d'Ivoire .
THREAT OF TAYLOR 'S RETURN ADVANCES THEIR CAUSE
--------------------------------------------- - 10 .
( C ) XXXXXXXXXXXX 11 .
( C )
The threat of a return of Taylor strengthens their hand and for now they see no need to give in at all .
However , if Taylor is put away for a long time , the government may feel a bit bolder in recovering assets and bringing Taylor backers who committed war crimes to justice .
12 .
( C )
The international community has just a few tools to pressure the Taylor people into accepting the new reality .
The UN sanctions appear to have the intended effect of keeping them somewhat marginalized and fearful of further attempts to strip them of their ill - gotten gains .
However , we have regularly heard of travel outside Liberia of those on the travel ban list without prior approval .
NEXT STEPS FOR THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY ------------------------------------------ 13 .
( C )
However , the best we can do for Liberia is to see to it that Taylor is put away for a long time and we can not delay for the results of the present trial to consider next steps .
All legal options should be studied to ensure that Taylor can not return to destabilize Liberia .
Building a case in the United States against Taylor for financial crimes such as wire fraud would probably be the best route .
There may be other options , such as applying the new law criminalizing the use of child soldiers or terrorism statutes .
14 .
( C )
The peace in Liberia remains fragile , and its only guarantee is the robust and adaptable UNMIL presence .
The GOL does not have the ability to quell violence , monitor its borders or operate independently to fight crime .
A free Taylor could tip the balance in the wrong direction .
THOMAS - GREENFIELD"
"Charles Taylor 's lead counsel in his war crimes trial in The Hague has stormed out of court after angry exchanges with the judges , later accusing them of having made up their minds about his client 's guilt before the hearing began .
London barrister Courtenay Griffiths , who represents Taylor , walked out of proceedings after judges refused to accept a written summary of the ex - Liberian president 's defence at the end of his trial .
Griffiths defied judges ' orders to stay in court , saying his actions were a protest at the court 's conduct since the Guardian published a story based on WikiLeaks cables in December , which he believed revealed a witch - hunt against Taylor .
"" I have been led to believe that some of the judges might have made their minds up a long time ago , even before proceedings begun , "" Griffiths told the Guardian .
"" I can not allow myself to be used to give credibility for a totally unfair set of circumstances .
This is not a question of personal anger , it is a point of principle .
This is not how a criminal trial – particularly one of this gravity – should be run . ""
The row stems from an article published in the Guardian in December which revealed the US government 's determination to see Taylor convicted .
Cables from the US embassy in the Hague stated that the US government wanted "" to see Taylor is put away for a long time "" , and would consider putting him on trial in the US if he were acquitted in the current proceedings .
In December Taylor 's defence team filed a motion stating that the cables revealed political interference in the court .
"" The cables clearly indicate the US government 's desire to ensure that Mr Taylor not return to Liberia and proof that there is and have been contacts between the [ court ] and the US government outside the official lines of communication , "" the motion states .
"" This … raises serious doubts about the independence and … impartiality of the Special Court 's prosecution of Taylor . ""
Griffiths says that the court 's failure to deliver a ruling on the motion resulted in a delay to the defence filing its final brief , which was submitted 20 days late .
On Monday , the three - judge panel decided to reject the brief , with the only African judge dissenting .
This morning , Griffiths walked out , arguing that the court 's decision to reject his brief was unfair .
"" Against the interests of justice , the court is not going to look at our closing brief , even thought they have got it , "" said Griffiths .
"" I 'm not going to sit in court listening to arguments from the other side pretending that two of three judges are listening when they are not even going to look at submissions in front .
What 's the point of me wasting my breath in court ? ""
Asked what would happen now , Griffiths said he would appeal against the decision immediately , but would not be returning to court .
"" I 'm certainly not going to court tomorrow , "" Griffiths said .
"" If the current temper is anything to go by , they will hold me in contempt .
I 'll have to do my best to resist it . ""
The debacle is the latest in a series of dramatic events at the trial of Taylor , the first former African head of state to be tried by an international court .
Last year the model Naomi Campbell was summoned to give evidence at the court , amid allegations that she had received a "" blood diamond "" from the former Liberian leader , which prosecutors said proved Taylor 's connection to the conflict in neighbouring Sierra Leone .
Taylor , who has pleaded not guilty to 11 counts of war crimes and crimes against humanity including murder , torture and using child soldiers , has cast himself as a statesman who tried to pacify west Africa .
The former president boycotted the opening of his trial in June 2007 and fired his initial defence team , saying he had not had enough time to prepare his defence .
He is understood to have agreed to Griffiths 's decision to walk out of the proceedings .
However prosecutors criticised the move . ""
The accused is not attending a social event .
He may not RSVP at the last minute , "" said Brenda Hollis , prosecuting .
"" He is the accused at a criminal proceeding . """
"The former head of Nelson Mandela 's children 's charity , who received alleged "" blood diamonds "" from the British supermodel Naomi Campbell , has been cleared of wrongdoing by a South African court .
Jeremy Ractliffe , founder of the charity , had been charged with illegally keeping uncut diamonds .
The gems were passed to him by Campbell after she allegedly received them as a gift from former Liberian president Charles Taylor .
A judge said that the case against Ractliffe , who could have faced 10 years in jail if convicted , was not proven . ""
Mr Ractliffe , you are not guilty and discharged , "" said magistrate Renier Boshoff after hearing half a day of testimony .
Ractliffe , 74 , the former chief executive of the Nelson Mandela Children 's Fund , had been accompanied to court by his wife and five daughters , who embraced and wept after hearing the verdict .
Ractliffe claimed he kept the stones and did not report them to authorities in an attempt to protect the reputations of Mandela , Campbell and the charity .
He insisted that he had no regrets and did not blame Campbell for his trouble .
"" I was just doing my job , "" he said outside court .
"" I did what I did for what I felt were totally valid reasons .
I have always thought I was innocent and it was very nice to have this proven . ""
His wife , Gail , added : "" My husband is a good and honourable man . ""
The existence of the stones emerged last year during the war crimes trial of Taylor at The Hague .
Prosecutors said they were "" blood diamonds "" given by Taylor to Campbell in 1997 after a charity dinner hosted by Mandela with guests including the Hollywood actor Mia Farrow .
Campbell testified that she received "" dirty - looking stones "" from three men who came to her hotel room .
The supermodel said that she did not know the source of the diamonds , but other witnesses claimed she had bragged about getting them from Taylor .
Campbell said she gave Ractliffe the diamonds the morning after she received them , during a trip on the luxury Blue Train , as a donation to Mandela 's charity .
Ractliffe said he did not tell the foundation about the diamonds and kept them in a safe for 13 years until he handed them over to police after Campbell 's August 2010 testimony .
Ractliffe had already stepped down as chief executive by last August .
He resigned as a trustee after the diamond controversy became public .
It is illegal in South Africa to possess a rough diamond because of its possible links to funding fighters in African civil wars , money laundering and other crimes .
Taylor has denied using illegally mined diamonds to buy weapons for Sierra Leone 's Revolutionary United Front rebels during the 1991 - 2001 civil war .
His three - year trial closed in March and judges are expected to deliver their verdict later this year ."
"In his influential book , A Secular Age , philosopher Charles Taylor contrasts the "" porous self "" of the Middle Ages with the "" buffered self "" of modernity .
Aquinas can be seen as a figure who stands between these two worlds .
Taylor argues that our medieval ancestors inhabited an enchanted universe that was alive with magical powers .
The boundary between the individual human and the rest of nature was porous , and humankind belonged within a vast organic cosmos of seen and unseen beings .
This helps us to understand why Aquinas regards angels and demons as real creatures who invite philosophical reflection as much as any other life form .
Modern rationalism sealed off the mind from such ideas , eradicating the hidden forces of nature and subduing the power of the imagination .
But it was Aquinas and his scholastic contemporaries who set in motion this transformation in the order of western knowledge , when they married philosophy to theology .
Aquinas might have been appalled to know that eventually the scaffolding of reason would no longer rest on the bedrock of faith , but he played a significant role in erecting that scaffolding .
That is why , despite his medieval context , we might acknowledge him as a father of modernity .
Aquinas 's understanding of the human soul was very different from our modern concept of the mind .
It was perhaps closer to the Freudian idea of the soul .
Freud was an atheist , but in German his work refers to the soul ( seele ) , wrongly translated into English as "" mind "" .
The mind , or soul , that psychoanalysis reveals tells us that our unconscious is home to the fantasies , desires and terrors of a more primordial self , so that a turbulent otherness seethes within the ostensibly rational and autonomous mind of scientific modernity .
We need only think of computer - generated creatures to realise that angels , demons , gargoyles and monsters retain their ability to fascinate and terrify us .
So maybe the differences between Aquinas 's world and our own are not that great , if we expand what we mean by "" the mind "" .
Nature , including human nature , is for Aquinas essentially good because existence itself is good .
He said repeatedly that "" grace perfects nature "" – our desire for God makes us more , not less , natural .
A more pessimistic view emerged when the theologians of the reformation set grace over and against nature , insisting that the goodness of human nature had been entirely destroyed by original sin .
This paved the way for the Enlightenment and the scientific revolution when nature , including human nature , was finally subjugated to the control of the rational mind , severed from its scriptural and theological inheritance .
For Aquinas , reason is natural to our species , because it is what a creature needs if it has choice .
Other animals , lacking freedom , naturally do what is good for them according to the kind of species they are .
They too have souls , but the human is uniquely endowed with intellect and will because we are made in the image of God and therefore enjoying a relative freedom in relation to the world .
Our intellect enables us to imagine the world as other than it is , and to weigh up the choices which present themselves to reason through our senses and experiences .
Intellect , will , and reason , all have precise , technical meanings for Aquinas .
Reason is the natural activity by way of which we organise and conceptualise these experiences , but the intellect enables us to discern the truth within them .
It is the intellect that transforms knowledge into wisdom as we are drawn to the goodness and beauty of God by the diverse goods of the world , and enables us to choose those goods that best express our desire for the ultimate good .
Our will directs our activities so that we can act on these insights .
This has an important consequence .
For Aquinas the will is about love and desire , not about power and control .
The modern concept of willpower emerged when "" man "" set reason against nature and began to use his will as an expression of control , rather than of desire in relation to the things of the world .
But our desire is influenced by sin , so that we are vulnerable to addictive cravings which destroy our freedom and our capacity for happiness .
The good life therefore requires us to discipline desire if we are to be truly free and happy .
But it 's important to realise that Aquinas does not think we can be motivated by evil .
We can be mistaken – innocently or even culpably – in what we think would be good for us , but we can not be motivated by evil , because evil can not be more than an absence of the good .
Aquinas is first and foremost a reasoned Christian optimist .
Life is very good , because all beings participate in God 's being .
As one scholar writes , "" the being of God is the doing of the world "" .
We 'll start from there next week .

"The start of the rainy season in Freetown does n't dampen the vibrancy of the city .
Blue , pink and green houses line its narrow winding roads .
Street sellers wrapped in brightly printed cloth swarm through the neverending traffic .
People are trying to move on from the horrors of Sierra Leone 's civil war .
Some can even forgive , but very few can forget , the death and devastation of one of the most brutal conflicts in Africa .
"" I was n't a beggar before .
Now I have come to be a beggar .
Just to get food for my children , to send them to school , "" says Kadiatu Fofana , who lives with a constant reminder of the atrocities committed in the war .
She sits outside her concrete shack in a wheelchair , having lost both her legs after an attack by the notorious Revolutionary United Front ( RUF ) rebels .
They came to her village in 1999 .
As she ran , they started hacking at her legs with machetes .
Both legs had to be amputated in hospital .
Between 1991 and 2002 , at least 50,000 people were killed across the country , thousands more were mutilated and 2 million displaced from their homes – close to half the population .
For many , there is one man they hold responsible – Charles Taylor , former president of neighbouring Liberia .
The first African head of state to be tried in an international court , Taylor will on Thursday hear the verdict of the Special Court for Sierra Leone in his five - year trial on charges of war crimes and crimes against humanity , including murder , rape , sexual slavery and using child soldiers .
Edward Conteh , another of Sierra Leone 's amputees who lost his left arm just below the elbow to an RUF axe , wants Taylor punished . ""
He should never be free to breathe the free air that we breathe again .
He once told Sierra Leoneans that we are going to taste the bitterness of war , so Charles Taylor should taste the bitterness of the law .
"" Taylor is alleged to have said Sierra Leone would "" taste the bitterness of war "" in an interview with the BBC in 1990 .
A year later , war came to Sierra Leone – and the RUF entered from Liberia .
Taylor is accused of funding and supporting the rebels .
But not everyone holds Taylor responsible for the crimes in Sierra Leone and there is a widespread feeling that the court did not pursue all those involved .
Ansumana Fowai , a former RUF fighter living in Freetown , believes there are Sierra Leoneans who have escaped justice for crimes committed in their own country .
"" Why was Pa Kabbah left out of the trial ?
Instead they indicted Charles Taylor , while we have people we see every day [ in Sierra Leone ] who committed atrocities . "" '
Pa ' Kabbah is former president Tejan Kabbah , who was head of state between 1996 and 2007 .
It was Kabbah who asked the international community for a war crimes tribunal when peace finally came to Sierra Leone .
Thirteen people , including Taylor , were indicted .
Nine have already been convicted and jailed .
But three of the top names , including the RUF leader Foday Sankoh , died before standing trial .
Johnny Paul Koroma , leader of another rebel faction , is still missing .
That leaves Taylor , who was held in 2006 and shipped to The Hague , as the only big name in the dock .
Many lower - ranking commanders were left out of the prosecution .
Peter Andersen , head of public affairs at the Special Court in Freetown , says prosecutors had to draw the line somewhere on who to bring to trial .
"" The mandate was to try those only who bore the greatest responsibility , "" he says .
"" And that means that a lot of the mid - level commanders , the people who noticeably had blood on their hands , escaped from the court .
No tribunal can go after everybody .
At some point , the country has to move on . ""
The Sierra Leonean government believes the trial has brought lasting benefits to the country , particularly in strengthening the judicial system .
"" Justice has been delivered , "" says Frank Karbo , the justice minister .
"" The trials have also heightened awareness that you can not get away with impunity .
It was essential that certain persons be taken out of circulation , and that has been done . ""
Five hours east of Freetown , heading towards Liberia , the Taylor trial seems to figure little in people 's minds .
The small , dusty town of Kenema looks like any other in Sierra Leone , until you notice the diamond shops .
They are everywhere .
Dozens of beautifully hand - painted pictures of diamonds decorate wall after wall .
Shop owners sit on their porches waiting for their next customer , the windows behind them barred with thick steel .
At the bus station , a man clutching two grubby stones asks if anyone thinks they are diamonds .
Kenema is the centre of Sierra Leone 's diamond business , a trade at the heart of the allegations against Taylor , who is accused of fuelling the war by selling the rebels weapons and ammunition in exchange for blood diamonds .
During the civil war , control of the diamond mines was viciously fought over .
Children , women and men were forced to work in the mines in appalling conditions .
Yet few details of Taylor 's trial seem to have reached this far out of Freetown .
The closer you get to Liberia , the more opinions change .
The Taylor family still has a significant presence in the country , where his former wife is a state senator .
"" I still do n't see the connection of how he could be held responsible for those things done in Sierra Leone when they were actually done by Sierra Leonean armed forces , "" Jewel Howard Taylor says in her office in Liberia 's parliament building .
The wall behind her is lined with mementoes from her time as first lady – an honorary plaque from the Liberian national football team , a signed photograph of her with Hillary Clinton and a framed photo of the Taylors with former French president Jacques Chirac .
"" I do n't think he should be held responsible for problems in Sierra Leone .
However , if you talk about the crisis in Liberia , then that 's a different story , "" says Taylor .
Liberia has its own history of war .
For 14 years , the country was in an almost permanent state of fighting , with atrocities like those committed in Sierra Leone .
War began in 1989 when Taylor led a rebel army to oust the then president , Samuel Doe .
In 1997 , Taylor was elected as head of state but , within a few years , new groups of rebels were trying to overthrow him .
He was forced in to exile in Nigeria in 2003 .
As part of its peace process , Liberia chose to have a truth and reconciliation commission , rather than a war crimes tribunal .
"" I would hate to see a war crimes tribunal brought to Liberia , "" says Jewel Taylor .
"" It will not reconcile us .
It will not bring back the past .
It will not pay for the destruction of our nation , and it will definitely not put back the fabric of our country that has been destroyed as a result of the war . ""
A former warlord whose links to Liberia 's violent past many can not ignore ran for president in recent elections .
Prince Johnson fought alongside Charles Taylor in 1989 before forming a rival force .
He ordered the torture and execution of Doe in 1990 – a video showing Johnson relaxing in a chair with a beer while his men slice Doe 's ear off is on YouTube . ""
Everyone in life has a past .
No one will ever rejoice even if you kill your enemy , because we are all Liberian , one blood .
It is unfortunate for political power we had to fight ourselves .
Definitely , it is regrettable , "" he says , from his home in Monrovia .
He chastises his former comrade .
"" It 's pathetic that he [ Taylor ] got himself into what he 's into .
I would have focused on Liberia and developed my country after becoming president rather than promoting a war in another country , "" he says , adding , "" if it is true . ""
Johnson did not make it to the second round of voting in the elections .
Taylor , however , still has strong support in Liberia .
He was seen as a freedom fighter in 1989 , liberating the country from the corrupt and violent rule of Doe .
Despite the years of conflict that followed , many still see him a strong figurehead .
"" We want him to come back to Liberia , "" says Jacob Anjai , breaking off from a game of Scrabble in one of Monrovia 's open - air cafes , where people gather to talk politics and play board games .
If Taylor ever returned and stood for president , would they vote for him ?
About half the customers said they would .
"" We love him .
Even if he stands tomorrow to be president of this nation , I know we will vote for him and he will be victorious , "" says Anjai .
That neither Johnson nor Taylor have been held to account for atrocities committed in Liberia , however , leaves many people with a bitter taste in their mouth .
Visible signs of Liberia 's past are falling away in Monrovia , as bombed - out , bullet - ridden buildings are replaced .
The presidential elections in November gave Nobel prize winner Ellen Johnson Sirleaf a second term by Liberians wanting continued peace and development .
Most people have no desire to return to conflict and have spent the years while Taylor has been on trial trying to rebuild their lives .
Both Sierra Leone and Liberia are still desperately poverty - stricken , and daily survival can seem more important than justice .
Fofana , sitting in her wheelchair sheltering from the sun in Grafton , knows her life will remain on the breadline , whatever the verdict .
"" They could jail him for 100 years and it would n't make a difference , "" she says .
"" I still need to find food for my family . """
"The former president of Liberia Charles Taylor is due to appear in a war crimes court at The Hague to learn his fate at the end of a four - year trial and begin a journey that may end in a British prison cell .
The first African head of state to be brought before an international tribunal will be in the dock at the special court for Sierra Leone to hear verdicts read out by the judicial panel on 11 charges , including recruitment of child soldiers and looting conflict ( "" blood "" ) diamonds .
Other offences , alleged to have been committed in Sierra Leone between 1996 and 2002 under his direction , involve terrorising civilian populations , murder , rape , sexual slavery and enforced amputations .
As the former colonial power in Sierra Leone , the UK has offered to make prison space available for the disgraced Liberian leader if he is convicted .
Home for Taylor in the coming years could be a solitary cell in a high - security prison , perhaps Belmarsh or Whitemoor .
The gesture of hospitality , made in 2006 by the then foreign secretary , Margaret Beckett , resolved a diplomatic standoff and paved the way for his case to commence .
It was proof , she said , of the UK 's "" commitment to international justice "" .
The Dutch government had said it would host the trial only if another country agreed to imprison him .
But the final decision on where a convicted Taylor serves his time will be made by the president of the special court for Sierra Leone , currently Justice Jon Kamanda , once any appeal is completed .
That is a process that may run on into 2013 .
Court regulations stipulate that the decision will , among other issues , "" take into account the desirability of serving sentences in states that are within close proximity or accessibility of the relatives of the convicted person "" .
The court is even empowered to keep the location secret , if it can .
The "" enforcement agreement "" between Britain and the special court says the UK will bear the cost of imprisonment and must open the facilities to inspection by the European committee for the prevention of torture and inhuman or degrading treatment .
A spokeswoman for the Ministry of Justice confirmed : "" We are one of the countries that is able to host [ Taylor ] .
We may give him prison room .
We do n't comment on prisoner location until the trial is finished .
We have hosted other prisoners [ from trials in The Hague ] before . ""
But the UK 's record on holding such inmates is not unblemished .
In 2010 , the Bosnian - Serb general Radislav Krstic , who was serving a 35-year sentence in Wakefield prison , was stabbed in his cell by three Muslim inmates .
Krstic was convicted at the international criminal tribunal for the former Yugoslavia in The Hague in 2001 over his role as a senior officer in the Bosnian Serb army , including involvement in the massacre of Bosnian Muslim men at Srebrenica in 1995 .
Indrit Krasniqi , Iliyas Khalid and Quam Ogumbiyi were already serving life for murder when they forced their way into Krstic 's cell .
They were , the prosecution claimed , intent on killing him in revenge for the deaths at Srebrenica .
Whether Taylor will need special protection or a solitary cell inside a British jail may have yet to be decided .
In the meantime , he remains incarcerated in Scheveningen prison , in a suburb of The Hague He has described the cooking in Dutch jail as an "" abomination "" .
But for all Taylor 's complaints about life inside – he wants conjugal visits , his own cooking and regular basketball –
his aides admit things could be worse .
A recent biography , Charles Taylor and Liberia , claimed he had managed to father a child by his wife when she called on him in the Dutch jail ; others sources suggested it was two .
The Jewish press has reported that Taylor has received regular visits from a rabbi after converting to Judaism .
He also has frequent access to the internet .
Scheveningen 's prison 's spacious , individual cells and family rooms for visits may soon seem luxurious in comparison with the cold comfort of life behind bars in England ."

"The first African president to be prosecuted at an international court has been found guilty of aiding and abetting war crimes and crimes against humanity for supporting rebels who carried out atrocities in Sierra Leone in return for "" blood diamonds "" .
The historic judgment leaves Charles Taylor , the former president of Liberia , facing a lengthy term in a British prison and will set a precedent that heads of state can no longer consider themselves immune to international justice .
After four years of hearings at the UN - backed special court for Sierra Leone in the Hague , the former warlord was convicted on 11 charges including murder , rape , sexual slavery and enforced amputations .
The three - judge panel unanimously found that he had been criminally responsible for "" aiding and abetting "" the rebel Revolutionary United Front ( RUF ) and other factions carrying out atrocities in Sierra Leone between 1996 and 2002 .
The court heard that the Liberian leader knew from August 1997 about the campaign of terror being waged against the civilian population in Sierra Leone .
Among the atrocities detailed was the beheading of civilians .
Victims ' heads were often displayed at checkpoints .
On one occasion a man was killed , publicly disembowelled and his intestines stretched across a road to form another checkpoint . ""
The purpose , "" Judge Richard Lussick said , "" was to instil terror "" .
Wearing a blue suit and red tie , Taylor showed no emotion as Lussick delivered the guilty verdict .
Taylor was found not guilty of either ordering or planning the atrocities .
But Lussick said that Taylor told RUF commanders to seize and hold the diamond producing areas of Sierra Leone so that he could continue trading arms and ammunition in return for looted diamonds .
He is expected to serve his sentence in a British jail once the appeal process has been completed .
In the course of the trial , the British model Naomi Campbell and American actor Mia Farrow were called as witnesses as the prosecution attempted to show that Taylor was knowingly handling blood diamonds .
Prosecutors said that Taylor had sent a pouch of uncut gems to Campbell after a dinner in Pretoria in September 1997 hosted by Nelson Mandela .
Campbell told the court she had no idea who had sent her the diamonds , which she called "" dirty little pebbles "" .
Prosecutor Brenda Hollis welcomed the guilty verdict as bringing "" some measure of justice to the many thousands of victims who paid a terrible price for Mr Taylor 's crimes . ""
[ This ] judgment reinforces the new reality , that heads of state will be held to account for war crimes ...
With leadership comes not just power and authority , but also responsibility and accountability .
No person , no matter how powerful , is above the law . ""
Taylor 's lead counsel , Courtenay Griffiths QC , said that the conviction was based on "" tainted and corrupt evidence , and accused the international justice community of targeting African leaders excessively .
"" I have for long expressed my concerns about the way in which international justice has been targeting African countries , "" he said .
"" All those currently awaiting trial at the International Criminal Court are from Africa . ""
In Sierra Leone , the verdict was met with relief mingled with frustration .
"" There is an impunity gap .
The foot soldiers who held the machete , the ones who raped and burnt – to the common man there is a sense of bitterness these people are walking free , "" said Souleymane Jabah , outside the Freetown - based court .
Taylor is the first former head of state to face judgment in an international court on war crimes charges since judges in Nuremberg convicted Karl Doenitz , an admiral who led Nazi Germany for a brief period following Adolf Hitler 's suicide .
Slobodan Milosevic , the former Yugoslav president , faced trial by an international criminal tribunal , but he died before a judgment was issued .
Human Rights Watch said the trial of Taylor signalled an end to an era of impunity . ""
Taylor 's trial has immense significance for people in the West African sub - region who suffered as a consequence of the violence and instability he allegedly fomented in Sierra Leone , Liberia , Guinea , and Côte d'Ivoire , "" the organisation said .
The cost of the Charles Taylor trial may have been as much as $ 50 million , according to Stephen Rapp , the court 's former prosecutor who is now US Ambassador
At Large for war crimes .
The overall cost of the Special Court for Sierra Leone , which was established in 2002 is estimated at $ 200 million .
Taylor has 14 days from the receipt of the full judgment to file a written notice of appeal with the registrar against his convictions .
His sentencing has been scheduled for 30 May.
The foreign secretary , William Hague , said : "" This landmark verdict demonstrates that those who have committed the most serious of crimes can and will be held to account for their actions ; it demonstrates that the reach of international law is long and not time limited and it demonstrates that heads of state can not hide behind immunity .
The verdict can only be a small comfort for the victims and relatives of those killed but the court 's authoritative view of what occurred will play an important role in helping the people of Sierra Leone come to terms with the past and consolidate national reconciliation . """
"For far too long , dictators and warlords who have inflicted extensive atrocities on the African people have gone unpunished .
This is true when one looks at the scale of crimes against humanity committed across the continent in the recent past in places such as Sudan , Rwanda , the Democratic Republic of the Congo , Liberia and Sierra Leone .
But this record of impunity is changing , thanks to the long arm of international justice .
Increasingly , Africans suspected of committing crimes against humanity are under investigation by the international criminal court and a few have already been charged and are awaiting trial .
International intervention has far - reaching implications on the continent , especially regarding governance and reform of judicial systems .
On Thursday Charles Taylor , warlord turned president of Liberia , was convicted of aiding and abetting war crimes by the Sierra Leone special court in The Hague .
The court was established in 2002 to try those who bore the greatest responsibility for crimes against humanity during the prolonged conflict in Sierra Leone .
Taylor was convicted in connection with offences including murder , rape , sexual slavery and using child soldiers .
It was alleged that Taylor was responsible for these crimes through his support of rebels fighting in Sierra Leone .
The prosecutor alleged that Taylor was personally responsible for these crimes because he was involved in the planning , instigating and commissioning but the court found him not guilty of direct personal responsibility for the atrocities carried out by rebels .
Taylor 's conviction is significant .
First , the successful conviction of a man whose accession to the top public job in Liberia had been achieved through a savage and vicious war in which his troops engaged in an orgy of violence that resulted not only in the abuse of the human rights of many Liberians , but also in the massacre of many of them , augurs well for the development of a peaceful and just dispensation in the country .
Second , Taylor 's conviction reinforces the fact that no one , even those elites who serve in the government , including the executive and members of the judiciary and legislature , is above the law – the law is supreme .
Third , that justice had to come from international courts does not reflect well on Africans and Liberia in particular .
The process exposes the failure by Liberians to provide themselves with a legal and judiciary system capable of effectively administering justice .
Taylor committed his crimes in Liberia and he should have been brought to justice by his own people in domestic courts .
However , this was not possible given the country 's failure to provide a system capable of dealing fully and effectively with Taylor 's subversion of justice .
Fourth , Taylor 's successful prosecution informs future Liberian , and indeed African , dictators and tyrants that they can not escape justice by hedging their bets on a dysfunctional domestic legal system .
Where national systems are incapable of adequately and effectively prosecuting leaders who engage in wanton violations of human rights , citizens can look to the international criminal court for justice .
With the Taylor affair concluded , Liberians must now insist on and devote their efforts to providing themselves with institutional arrangements that promote democracy , stability , human rights , sustainable development and social justice .
Specifically , the country must provide itself with a constitution that guarantees the just rule of law – under such a system , no one , even imperial presidents and military men with their own armies , is above the law .
Hopefully , a new and fully reconstituted legal system , one obtained through a bottom - up , participatory and inclusive institutional reform process , would allow Liberians to bring anyone who violates the law , including even those who are politically well connected , to justice .
Finally , the verdict and the process should be a wakeup call to Africans .
The successful conviction for such crimes is a glaring example of the failure of Africans to govern themselves effectively .
That the international criminal court has to be used to deal with issues that we as Africans should be able to deal with is a demonstration of our collective failure .
That we have to rush to The Hague for others to solve our problems is probably the best example of abuse of our political independence .
If anything , Africans must focus on building strong institutions to deal with human rights violations ourselves , else we should not claim to be independent and instead should let others define and enforce the rules .

"There will be celebrations in Sierra Leone following the conviction of Charles Taylor at The Hague , not least because April 27 is independence day and a public holiday .
And there are other reasons to celebrate .
Ten years after the end of a decade - long civil war , Sierra Leone is undergoing an economic boom .
For years the bottom - ranking country on the UN human development index , Sierra Leone is predicted by the IMF to experience economic growth of a world - leading 34 % this year .
On my last visit there , the plane was full of oil workers from Aberdeen following the discovery of offshore oil reserves .
In the capital , Freetown , Chinese investment was carving a major traffic route through the city and new beachfront hotels were going up .
The boom has been largely resource - driven – primarily by iron ore , but also gold , titanium and aluminium .
The Taylor verdict will bring the country full circle from a war that left thousands dead and maimed .
People will certainly welcome the verdict of guilty on 11 counts of aiding and abetting war crimes in Sierra Leone , but for most peoplein the country the war was about much more than Charles Taylor .
I was in Freetown when Taylor was arrested in Nigeria in 2006 , accused by the special court for Sierra Leone of backing RUF rebels in an attempt to gain control of the country 's diamond and mineral wealth .
I heard about his imminent arrival and drove to the court , but found no waiting crowds .
Later that evening I was at a reception at the British high commission when the fleet of helicopters carrying Taylor flew in low over the hills that surround the city .
It was certainly a moment of drama : everyone stopped to watch from the veranda , and then went back to drinking .
I wrote about the special court when it opened in 2004 , with its brief to try those most responsible for the war in Sierra Leone .
I canvassed opinion from everyone I met : working girls , unemployed young men , soldiers , a government minister .
Feelings about the court were mixed ; many people felt the wrong men were being tried – that the men they wanted to see on trial , those truly responsible , were not and would never be held to account .
The court prosecuted the leaders of the fighting groups .
The people I spoke to were referring to the political leaders , whose corrupt and inept governance brought the country to its knees long before Taylortook advantage of the vacuum , and brought hell down on the civilian population .
I followed David Crane , the special court 's chief prosecutor , on an outreach mission to take the court 's message to the populace .
In Makeni deaf school I watched a girl of 14 dare to ask Crane what everyone else was thinking .
"" Are you , "" she signed through an interpreter , "" going to indict the president ? ""
Crane ducked the question .
People want the court 's net cast wider and deeper , as far back as the 1970s when Siaka Stevens , the country 's long - term dictator , dispensed with the rule of law , emptied the government coffers and ran up huge debts with the IMF and the World Bank .
When it declared independence 51 years ago on 27 April , Sierra Leone was more fortunate than most African countries , as it possessed a middle class of administrators and professionals .
But in the years to come , the middle class would choose apathy over action .
Stevens had emasculated both the police and the army , from whom he feared rebellion .
Hence by the time Foday Sankoh 's embryonic Revolutionary United Front ( RUF ) went to Liberia for training by Taylor ( backed , lest we forget , by Muammar Gaddafi ) , they walked back into a country incapable of defending itself .
There they found a generation of angry and disenfranchised young men without jobs or prospects , with nothing to lose .
The background to the civil war has been established by the special court , and the road map to how a country implodes may be the court 's most important legacy .
Democracy requires eternal vigilance .
Sierra Leone learned the lesson in the hardest possible way .
Elections are in November , but there is already sporadic violence .
One of the main opposition candidates is a former coup leader , Maada Bio .
Now a businessman , Bio says he has "" grown up a lot "" since then .
A return to war is highly unlikely , but for the Taylor verdict to mean anything , the country has to grow up politically too , learn to hold its leaders accountable , and say "" never again "" ."
"Ever since Charles Taylor was extradited to the Hague in 2006 , there have been two trials going on .
One – the criminal inquiry into whether he is guilty of the 11 counts of war crimes and crimes against humanity relating to his involvement in the decade - long civil war in Sierra Leone in the 1990s .
For many , including the thousands of victims in Sierra Leone , the fact of the trial was only an important precursor to establishing his obvious guilt ; a fair process to add the stamp of legitimacy to the inevitable outcome .
Today , as they watched Taylor be convicted of aiding and abetting war crimes on all counts , they have seen justice done .
The second – the one popularly discussed in Liberia , which has watched its former president become the first African head of state to be convicted for war crimes – is the trial of the system of international criminal justice itself .
Here , and perhaps here alone , many people believe Taylor is innocent and his conviction an injustice .
The fact that guilt for joint criminal enterprise and command responsibility of the RUF – more serious charges than aiding and abetting – could not be proved against Taylor , for them is only a cursory nod to his general innocence .
His trial is the product of an ornate plan designed by the international community to humiliate Liberia and cement its status as a pawn at their mercy .
Vox pops by the Liberian press on the streets of Monrovia report views that his trial has been "" nothing but a western conspiracy "" and that "" there has been no tangible evidence provided "" in court .
The claim that no evidence has been involved in Taylor 's trial may seem surprising .
Over the nearly six years since the trial started , there have been 91 prosecution witnesses , 1,520 exhibits and more than 50,000 pages of witness testimony .
Perhaps if the special court had invested in making its proceedings accessible in Liberia – as it did so successfully in Sierra Leone –
Liberians would have felt better informed about the trial process .
But the fact that Taylor 's fate is a divisive issue in the country is far from a surprise .
Taylor may have been held to account , but Prince Johnson – to pick one of many , many other former rebel leaders as an example – is enjoying life as a senator .
Current president Ellen Johnson Sirleaf may have won the Nobel peace prize , but Taylor supporters are a huge presence in Liberia 's tiny ruling elite .
The United Nations peacekeeping mission in Liberia ( Unmil ) is still a crucial ingredient in maintaining peace .
Moving on is a luxury that Liberia can not yet afford .
But the Taylor trial was never about Liberia .
Instead the prosecution case has been about establishing linkage with Sierra Leone 's rebels the RUF , and not just simply whether he was involved , but whether his involvement extended to aiding and abetting or the more serious legal standards of command responsibility and joint criminal enterprise .
Sierra Leoneans have benefited from an extensive outreach programme by the special court , they have been well informed about the trial , and for the victims of this – now proven – collaboration from hell , today 's verdict is a kind of justice .
The double amputee , who asked for another of his hands to be cut off rather than see the machete taken to his son 's arm , or the woman who was made to carry a heavy bag with her children 's severed body parts inside on her head – the blood trickling down – know now that their courage in travelling to the Hague and giving evidence against Taylor has played its part in history .
There is no doubt that today 's verdict is historic .
Taylor 's conviction goes a long way to answering decisively the lingering questions surrounding responsibility for the complex events of a decade of brutal war .
The trial has been the product of no end of delicate manoeuvering – from the initial attempts to persuade Nigeria 's then - president Olusegun Obasanjo to extradite Taylor , who had been granted asylum in Nigeria , then the decision to relocate Taylor 's special court trial to the Hague out of fears for instability in Sierra Leone – to the blatant leniency of the trial judges , so keen to avoid any possibility of the appearance of bias that they gave Taylor a more or less free reign to talk , as he did , for seven months .
And if international criminal justice is on trial , its verdict is not yet out .
The special court has been far from perfect .
On the one hand it has faced endemic funding problems , unbelievable delays and serious questions about the competency of its appeals chamber .
On the other , it has been accused of presiding over payments to prosecution witnesses which defence lawyers say fundamentally undermine the fairness of many special court trials .
But ironically it is the thoroughness of special court defence teams – and Taylor 's most of all – that added the necessary element of legitimacy to the process .
Some observers felt that the quality of Taylor 's lawyers – led by the formidable Courtenay Griffiths QC – played a significant role in inspiring confidence in the fairness of proceedings .
And then there 's the expense .
Taylor will also go down as the most expensive defendant in the history of international criminal justice , receiving $ 100,000 per month , which together with the move to the Hague and other costs amounts to an estimated $ 35 - 40 m per year .
Griffiths , staying true to form and going beyond the call of duty to criticise the process , has helpfully described the trial as "" a complete waste of time and money "" , painful indeed for the international taxpayer – mainly in the US – who have shelled out the $ 50 m
or so his conviction has cost .
That does n't go down well with those in west Africa who are supposed to be benefiting from the contribution of the trial to a – in theory – stronger rule of law and weaker culture of impunity for the subregion , the continent and the world , as a whole .
Are those really the legacies of today 's verdict ?
Only time will tell . •
This article was amended on May 3 2012 .
The original said Charles Taylor 's trial cost $ 250 m .
That is the figure for all the trials and investigations the special court for Sierra Leone has pursued .
The Charles Taylor trial cost $ 50 m"
"Charles Taylor , the former president of Liberia , has been found to have "" aided and abetted "" war crimes by a United Nations - backed tribunal in The Hague .
After four years of hearings at the special court for Sierra Leone , the disgraced one - time guerrilla leader was found to have provided sustained support for rebels during their reign of terror in the neighbouring west African state .
He was also said to have participated in the planning of certain attacks , including the assault on Freetown , the capital of Sierra Leone .
The judge said Taylor would be sentenced on 30 May after a hearing on 16 May. Taylor , 64 , the first African head of state to be brought before an international tribunal , had pleaded not guilty to all 11 charges .
He stood at the back of the court while the judge formally found him "" criminally responsible "" of aiding and abetting in the commission of 11 crimes .
Hands clasped in front of him , Taylor blinked as the long list of his criminal responsibility was read out .
His eyes shifted not knowing where to focus .
Between 1996 and 2002 , the rebel Revolutionary United Front ( RUF ) , which Taylor supported , was found by the court to have committed crimes involving terrorising civilian populations , murder , rape , sexual slavery and enforced amputations in Sierra Leone .
Judge Richard Lussick of Samoa said more than 1,000 children had the letters "" RUF "" carved into their backs to prevent them escaping .
Children were used to amputate limbs , guard diamond mines and hunt for food .
Some were involved in fighting .
The judge said Taylor told RUF commanders to seize and hold the diamond - producing areas of Sierra Leone so that he could continue trading gems for arms and ammunition .
One diamond was said to have weighed as much as 36 carats .
The court found that despite Taylor 's denials , he knew from August 1997 about the campaign of terror being waged against the civilian population in Sierra Leone , including murder , rape and amputations .
Taylor continued privately fuelling the conflict by providing arms and ammunition to the RUF in Sierra Leone , the judge said .
His clandestine dealing helped undermine the peace process even when there was a regional arms embargo in force .
Taylor 's conviction will be widely welcomed in Sierra Leone but the response in Liberia , where he was once seen as a freedom fighter and retains support , may be more critical .
Human Rights Watch pointed out that he was the first former head of state to face judgment in an international court on war crimes charges since judges in Nuremberg convicted Karl Dönitz , an admiral who led Nazi Germany for a brief period following Adolf Hitler 's suicide .
Slobodan Milosevic , the former Yugoslav president , faced trial by an international criminal tribunal , but he died before a judgment was issued .
Another head of state , the one - time president of Ivory Coast , Laurent Gbagbo , is also detained in The Hague .
He will appear at the international criminal court on charges of crimes against humanity .
Human Rights Watch said the trial of Taylor signalled an end to an era of impunity . ""
Taylor 's trial has immense significance for people in the west African sub - region who suffered as a consequence of the violence and instability he allegedly fomented in Sierra Leone , Liberia , Guinea , and Côte d'Ivoire , "" the organisation said .
"" For decades , so - called "" big men – people who either led armed groups or wielded significant political power – have been allowed to carry out abuses , seemingly with no fear of being investigated or held accountable by a credible judicial body . ""
In this trial , for the first time , such a ' big man ' was taken into custody and forced to answer for his alleged crimes . ""
The judges also had to consider how the 11 charges against Taylor fitted into three legal levels of proof : whether he aided or abetted in the execution of the crimes ; whether he was involved in the offences as a joint enterprise with paramilitary groups in Sierra Leone or , most damningly , whether he exercised control and command over the other rebel groups that perpetrated atrocities .
In the end they decided his role amounted to the lesser of the three categories .
Taylor has 14 days from the receipt of the full judgment to file a written notice of appeal with the registrar against his convictions .
Despite previous suggestions that he would not be able to attend , his lead counsel , Courtenay Griffiths QC , was in court to hear the final verdict .

Found guilty of aiding and abetting war crimes"
"Student activist , accountant , fugitive from US justice , Libyan - trained guerrilla , warlord , president , cannibal , dealer in blood diamonds , war crimes scapegoat – the multiple masks worn by , or imposed on , Charles Taylor would tax any actor portraying the dapper Liberian showman .
As a child , he helped his father cut sugar cane on their farm in rural Liberia , 30 miles north of the capital , Monrovia .
He later recalled walking to school shoeless – but Taylor was not from a deprived background .
His father was one of the relatively privileged Americo - Liberian elite that had run the west African state since its foundation in 1847 as an independent republic for freed US slaves .
His mother was an indigenous Liberian from the Gola tribe .
That dual inheritance in a divided country enabled him to reach out to followers across both Africa and the United States .
Born with the middle name McArthur , he later changed it to Ghankay , meaning "" strong one "" in the Gola language .
After leaving school , Taylor became a teacher and fathered a child at 20 .
He moved to Monrovia , became an accountant in the ministry of finance then decided a US college education would help him to move up in the world .
At Bentley College , Massachusetts , Taylor acquired a Chevrolet Cougar sports car , a Trinidadian girlfriend and a second child , Chucky .
He switched to economics and forged links with the expatriate Liberian community .
His political ambitions flourished , as he addressed rallies demanding democracy and development in his homeland .
One protest outside the White House involved the carrying of a mock coffin of the Liberian president , William Tolbert .
An increasingly prominent critic of the regime , Taylor was invited back to Monrovia in 1980 to advise on modernising the country .
Two months later , a military coup removed Tolbert and the Americo - Liberian ascendancy , initiating decades of bloodletting and civil war .
The junta leader Samuel Doe , a former army sergeant , made Taylor head of the country 's procurement unit and gave him a cabinet post .
In 1983 , Taylor fell out with Doe over allegations of overpayments by his agency to a New Jersey manufacturer .
Discredited , he fled the country .
The following year , he was arrested by the FBI in Boston after Doe issued an international arrest warrant .
Taylor denied he had taken the missing cash and implied corruption lay elsewhere in the junta .
He was detained in a Massachusetts house of correction for more than a year .
In 1985 , he escaped , triggering rumours of US government complicity .
( In evidence to the court in The Haque , Taylor claimed he had simply been released . )
Soon over the border into Mexico , he returned to west Africa .
There he established a movement to overthrow the increasingly tyrannical president , Doe .
Taylor also charmed his way into a desert training camp for revolutionaries run by Colonel Muammar Gaddafi of Libya ; another guest was Fodoy Sankoh , leader of a rebel group in Sierra Leone – Liberia 's western neighbour – who would soon become a close ally .
The National Patriotic Front for Liberia ( NPFL ) launched its military invasion in 1989 , a conflict characterised by recruitment of child soldiers , massacres , looting and rapes .
Doe was eventually captured and tortured to death by a rival faction .
African peacekeepers intervened to protect the civilian population .
Amid the chaos , Sankoh 's Revolutionary United Front ( RUF ) , backed by Taylor 's NPFL , crossed into Sierra Leone , and began a campaign of violence and intimidation .
Within a few years , the RUF had seized the country 's gold and diamond fields .
Precious stones began flowing out through Liberia .
Battle lines surged back and forth .
Elections were called in 1996 .
Defeated in the first round of the polls , Sankoh targeted civilians .
His soldiers mutilated villagers , amputating their arms with machetes .
The slogan "" No arms , no elections "" was intended to spread terror and panic .
It is Taylor 's contested role during the period between 1996 and early 2002 – when the civil war in Sierra Leone ended – for which he has been on trial at the special court for Sierra Leone in The Hague .
Taylor has admitted giving "" small amounts of arms and ammunition "" to help the RUF during the very early 1990s but denied giving assistance during the later period .
He argued in court that he used his influence to end the war in the neighbouring west African state and eventually sealed the border , formally withdrawing his support for the rebels .
In response to prosecution allegations that he traded arms for Sierra Leonean blood ( or conflict ) diamonds , Taylor testified that it would not have been possible because neither of the two roads that led to the Sierra Leone border could support vehicles laden with weapons .
Having fought his way to military dominance in Liberia , the flamboyant rebel leader was finally elected president in 1997 with more than 75 % of votes in an election that most poll monitors deemed to be largely a fair contest .
His nearest rival , Ellen Johnson Sirleaf , who is now president , took only 10 % of the votes .
Why a man commonly derided as a brutal warlord should win so clearly puzzled many foreign journalists .
But Taylor , nicknamed "" Papay "" , had gained a reputation as a family man .
As head of the strongest military faction , it was also reasoned by Liberians that he could bring stability to a wartorn country .
A series of murders and disappearances attributed to his personal security forces early in his presidential term rapidly disillusioned supporters in Monrovia and abroad .
One militia , the Anti - Terrrorist Unit , was controlled by his son Chucky , who had moved from the US to join him .
( In 2009 , Chucky Taylor was convicted by a Florida court under a law that allows US citizens to be tried for acts of torture committed overseas .
He is serving a 97-year sentence . )
The president 's reputation abroad suffered .
A further surge in violence in Sierra Leone in 1999 led the Clinton administration to impose a travel ban on Taylor and his family to put pressure on him to end support for the RUF .
Sierra Leone accused its neighbour of shipping to Antwerp 40 times the quantity of diamonds that Liberia was capable of producing from its own mines .
Allegations that Taylor had participated in ritualistic cannibalism surfaced in this period .
He sued the Times for libel but the case never came to trial .
In The Hague courtroom , a prosecution witness , Joseph "" Zigzag ""
Marzah , maintained that he and Taylor had eaten human hearts together .
The juju practice is supposed to enable the victor to absorb his victim 's powers .
The former president 's lawyers dismissed the claims as untrue and denied that Marzah had ever been close to Taylor .
"" I felt like throwing up when I heard that nonsense , "" Taylor told the court , "" and I think even the prosecution were shocked at listening to that foolishness . ""
A showman by nature , Taylor often appeared dressed head to toe in white robes to proclaim his innocence and stress his supernatural or pseudo - angelic status .
An eager adapter of religious symbols , he even announced once that he had converted to Judaism .
The formation in 1999 of Liberians United for Reconciliation and Democracy ( LURD ) marked the beginning of the end .
There were UN security council resolutions condemning his regime for arms sales and in 2002 the UN - sponsored special court for Sierra Leone was established .
The next year , Taylor was indicted for war crimes , LURD forces stormed into Monrovia and the president boarded a plane bound for exile in Nigeria .
It took several more years to manoeuvre him into the hands of the court .
As his arrest neared , he fled his villa and was eventually captured at 5 am in a car heading for the border with Chad .
He was carrying $ 50,000 in cash .
Sent to Freetown , the capital of Sierra Leone , he was transferred in June 2006 to the Netherlands to face the protracted process of international justice .
The death of Sankoh , from a stroke while in detention , left Taylor in the international limelight .
Opening his defence before the war crimes court , his lawyer , Courtenay Griffiths QC , presented Taylor as a victim of western powers who wanted regime change in Liberia , a peacemaker in regional conflict who had become a scapegoat of the international community ."
"The Streatham - born model Naomi Campbell and the US actor Mia Farrow made up a star - studded cast of witnesses summoned to testify about blood diamonds before the special court for Sierra Leone .
Campbell admitted receiving a pouch of uncut gems after a dinner in Pretoria hosted by the then South African leader , Nelson Mandela , in September 1997 .
Charles Taylor was also a guest .
Campbell and the then Liberian president were sitting together and had been "" mildly flirtatious "" with one another , evidence to the court suggested .
She had accepted the "" dirty - looking stones "" , she told the judges , when they were presented to her later in the night but insisted she had no idea who sent them .
Farrow , who was also present at the meal , contradicted aspects of the model 's testimony .
She said the next morning at breakfast Campbell told her Taylor had dispatched his men to present her with a "" huge diamond "" and that she intended to hand it over to Mandela 's charity .
The diamond donation goes to the heart of the main allegation against Taylor : that he organised and sustained the Revolutionary United Front 's ( RUF ) invasion of Sierra Leone , trading weapons shipments for looted diamonds .
The former warlord faced 11 charges of war crimes and crimes against humanity during the five - year trial .
They included charges of terrorism , murder , rape , sexual slavery , use of child soldiers , forced amputations , enslavement and pillage .
He pleaded not guilty on all counts .
Established jointly by the UN and the government of Sierra Leone , the special court has been mandated to "" try those who bear the greatest responsibility for serious violations of international humanitarian law and Sierra Leonean law committed in the territory of Sierra Leone "" between November 1996 and January 2002 .
Three trials , resulting in the imprisonment of eight leaders of the RUF , the Armed Forces Revolutionary Council and the Civil Defence Forces , have already been completed in Freetown , the capital of Sierra Leone .
The UN security council expressed concerns about the potentially destabilising presence of Taylor in Freetown so his trial was transferred to the international criminal court in The Hague .
It was subsequently heard in a nearby courtroom in the UN - backed special tribunal for Lebanon .
An initial six - month delay was caused by Taylor dismissing his first legal team and boycotting the court for a time .
Prosecution evidence began January 2008 .
The trial heard from more than 115 witnesses .
Closing arguments were made in March 2011 .
The complexity of the evidence , the long timespan involved and multiple , international dimensions have added to the judicial burden .
The bench consisted of presiding judge Justice Richard Lussick of Samoa , Justice Teresa Doherty of Northern Ireland , Justice Julia Sebutinde of Uganda , and alternate judge Justice El Hadji Malick Sow of Senegal .
Relations between Taylor 's charismatic counsel , Courtenay Griffiths QC , and the court were not easy .
At one stage Griffiths was summoned to defend himself at a disciplinary hearing after walking out of the courtroom in protest at the refusal to accept his final brief .
The judges claimed it had been filed too late ; Griffiths said the delay was caused by other outstanding motions from the court .
One judge , Sebutinde , then declined to attend the disciplinary hearing and the matter was ultimately settled by means of an apology .
In his closing speech , Griffiths denied there was any evidence of joint criminal enterprise between Taylor and the leaders of the RUF or other paramilitary factions in Sierra Leone .
"" We say , and have said all along , that they are lying , "" Griffiths said of the prosecution witnesses . ""
His case is that he was not involved – that he was a peacemaker , not a warmonger . ""
Taylor , now 64 , has repeatedly denied claims by prosecution witnesses that he met Fodoy Sankoh , the RUF leader , at a Libyan training camp .
Throughout most of the trial he sat in the dock , wearing a neat suit and tinted glasses .
The court has heard evidence of arms smuggled from Liberia to Sierra Leone in sacks of rice , and diamonds sent back in a mayonnaise jar .
Gangs of child soldiers were given drugs to desensitise them to the horror of their actions , the court was told .
As many as 500,000 people are estimated to have been killed , systematically mutilated or suffered other atrocities in Sierra Leone 's civil war .
During the trial the Boston Globe published a report claiming that Taylor had been once used by the Pentagon 's Defence Intelligence Agency as an informant .
Two US government cables released by WikiLeaks and published by the Guardian were also admitted as late evidence by the court .
One quoted the US ambassador to Liberia , Linda Thomas - Greenfield , as saying that "" all legal options should be studied to ensure that Taylor can not return to destabilise Liberia "" .
The second suggested that sensitive information about the trial had been leaked to the US embassy in The Hague ."
""" For the victims of this – now proven – collaboration from hell , today 's verdict is a kind of justice , "" wrote Afua Hirsch as Charles Taylor was found guilty at The Hague of aiding and abetting war crimes in Sierra Leone .
"" The double amputee , who asked for another of his hands to be cut off rather than see the machete taken to his son 's arm , or the woman who was made to carry a heavy bag with her children 's severed body parts inside on her head – the blood trickling down – know now that their courage in travelling to the Hague and giving evidence against Taylor has played its part in history .
"" Not everyone wanted it to happen this way - not just because of the cost of prosecuting and trying Taylor , but because the trial took place in Europe and not Africa , where his crimes were committed . ""
Africans must focus on building strong institutions to deal with human rights violations ourselves , else we should not claim to be independent and instead should let others define and enforce the rules , "" said Mwangi Kimenyi and John Kbaku .
Taylor is due to be sentenced on May 30 and could end up in a UK jail , where the regime is likely to be harsh than in Scheveningen prison .
Taylor is said to have fathered at least one child since his incarceration .
LATEST FROM LORD JUSTICE LEVESON
A number of questions arose from the Murdochs ' appearances before the Leveson inquiry this week , not least the question of whether Jeremy Hunt 's contact with News International meant that he was unable to fulfil his "" quasi - judicial "" role in deciding whether the corporation could take over BSkyB.
"" I do n't think any decision by Hunt could have been legally sustainable if these emails had been disclosed to a court , "" said Carl Gardner .
The QC charged with questioning the Murdochs was Robert Jay .

That is the figure for all the trials and investigations the special court for Sierra Leone has pursued .
The Charles Taylor trial cost $ 50 m"
"The former US Middle East peace envoy , George Mitchell , has said that the Syrian president , Bashir al - Assad , could be tried as an alleged war criminal over the brutal crackdown on opponents of his rule .
Mitchell , who was the US special envoy for Middle East peace until last May , said Assad could be tried for war crimes in the same way as Charles Taylor , the former president of Liberia who was this week found to have "" aided and abetted "" war crimes by a UN - backed tribunal in The Hague .
Speaking at an international security conference in Dublin , Mitchell was asked if he could envisage Assad facing a special war crimes court as Taylor did . ""
Certainly , I do n't think that anyone could rule that out at this time , "" he said .
The retired US senator , who also oversaw the peace talks that led to the Good Friday Agreement in Northern Ireland , called on Assad to step down and "" permit a free , open choice of leadership "" .
He added that the international community should consider further sanctions against the Assad family and leading figures in his regime .
"" I think there are more actions that could be directed at the regime and all those that are supporting what is occuring there particularly the grievous number of deaths and injuries at present . ""
Mitchell said he believed the Syrian people would eventually be able to "" freely choose their own leaders "" and that there would be a "" democratic transition "" .
He denied that Europe and the US had abandoned the Syrian people to its fate .
The peace negotiator 's comments came as a Syrian government newspaper accused the UN secretary general Ban Ki - moon of encouraging rebel attacks by focusing his criticism of violence on the government .
The editorial in the state - run Tishrin paper on Saturday comes a day after Ban said Assad 's continued crackdown on protests has reached an "" intolerable stage "" .
Tishrin said Ban has avoided talks about rebel violence in favour of "" outrageous "" attacks on the Syrian government ."
"The convicted , former president of Liberia , Charles Taylor , should be punished with a sentence of 80 years for committing atrocities in west Africa , the chief prosecutor at a UN - backed tribunal has urged .
Taylor , who is 64 , was found guilty at the special court for Sierra Leone in The Hague last month of aiding and abetting war crimes and crimes against humanity by supporting rebels in Sierra Leone in return for "" blood diamonds "" .
Any prison sentence is likely to be served in the UK which has offered to accommodate him once his trial and appeal is finally completed .
Sentencing for the 11 counts of which he was found guilty – including murder , rape , sexual slavery , enforced amputations and pillage carried out – is scheduled to take place on 30 May.
The offences took place between 1996 and 2002 .
In a submission to the special court this week , the prosecutor Brenda Hollis argued that : "" Taylor was not a simple weapons procurer or financier who sat on the sidelines of a civil war raging in a neighbouring country … "" [ His ] positions both as president of Liberia and within the west African regional bodies distinguish him from any other individual that has appeared before this court .
Taylor 's abuse of his authority and influence is especially egregious given that west African leaders repeatedly entrusted him with a role to facilitate peace . ""
The [ court 's ] findings reveal the reality of Taylor 's role in the peace process , noting that ' while the accused publicly played a substantial role in the Sierra Leone peace process secretly he was fuelling hostilities between the AFRC / RUF and the democratically elected authorities in Sierra Leone , by urging the former not to disarm and actively providing them with arms and ammunition … acting as a two - headed Janus ' . ""
Hollis added : "" Considering the extreme magnitude and seriousness of the crimes that were committed against the people of Sierra Leone for which Taylor has been found responsible … the prosecution recommends that Charles Taylor be sentenced to a prison term of no less than 80 years .
No significant mitigating circumstances exist in this case .
"" The request for such a long jail term reflects common practice in the US .
Hollis was formerly a US military prosecutor .
The special court for Sierra Leone can not impose the death penalty or life sentences .
In interview with the Guardian after the trial , Hollis pointed out that Taylor had been involved in planning some of the bloodiest episodes of the civil war in Sierra Leone , including the attack on the capital , Freetown .
If given 80 years , the former Liberian president , who has been in custody in a Dutch jail since 2006 , would receive a far longer sentence than the leaders of the Sierra Leonean militias already imprisoned for their part in the atrocities .
One of them , Issa Sesay , a former leader of the Revolutionary United Front ( RUF ) was given 52 years for his role .
He is currently in a Rwandan prison .
Taylor was found guilty of aiding and abetting in the offences rather than of being directly in command of the rebel groups .
He was convicted unanimously by the three - judge panel at The Hague .
In a highly unusual move , the reserve judge , Justice El Hadji Malick Sow , from Senegal , who did not deliver the verdict , interrupted the end of the hearing to voice his opposition and make clear that he dissented from his colleagues ' finding .
His words were cut off as the proceedings ended last month but he did warn that the "" international justice system was in grave danger of losing all credibility "" .
After the trial , Courtenay Griffiths QC , Taylor 's lead counsel , accused the international justice community of targeting African leaders excessively .
He said that Africans were being sent for trial and detention thousands of miles away to Europe "" in handcuffs and chains "" .
He added : "" This is a 21st - century form of colonialism . ""
The cost of the trial , which has so far lasted four years , is estimated at ( £ 30 m ) $ 50 m ."
""
"This Wednesday former Liberian president Charles Taylor will be sentenced in The Hague by the special court for Sierra Leone ( SCSL ) for his part in Sierra Leone 's bloody conflict .
Chances are , even if judges impose a sentence much less than the prosecution 's fanciful request for 80 years imprisonment , Taylor could soon be on his way to the UK to serve out his time .
Some - notably Taylor 's own lawyer , Courtenay Griffiths QC - have been vocal in identifying Taylor 's prosecution as part of an inherently biased and flawed international criminal justice system , in furtherance of a neo - colonial , anti - African , agenda .
It 's true that of the seven situations currently before the permanent international criminal court ( ICC ) , all are from the continent of Africa .
True also that two other international tribunals , the Rwanda Tribunal and the SCSL , are dedicated to African conflicts .
But the foundations of the new system of international criminal justice lay not in Africa , but Europe .
It was the United Nations ' decision , back in 1993 , to establish the Yugoslavia tribunal that set the precedent for the other international tribunals that followed .
But for his untimely passing , Slobodan Milosevic , not Taylor , may well have been the first former head of state to be convicted by an international court .
And as the Taylor trial nears its end , the very un - African cases against Mladic and Karadzic carry on in earnest .
Are African perpetrators singled out more than others ?
Perhaps .
But try telling that to their victims .
From a man forced to choose which healthy hand to have amputated , to a woman gang raped by 20 men , to a child forced to kill his parents and join a rebel gang , justice , even if selective , will almost always be welcome .
It is the victims of the crimes overlooked that have the right to complain , not the defendants in the dock .
Moreover , in the main , it has been African states themselves that have demanded international justice .
It would be wrong to think that the SCSL , and the pursuit of lasting peace through justice , was somehow foisted upon the people of Sierra Leone .
It was the newly elected government of Sierra Leone itself that entered an agreement with the United Nations to establish the SCSL .
Similarly , the Democratic Republic of Congo , the Central African Republic , and Uganda all self - referred themselves to the ICC for investigation .
The Kenyan cases , although initiated by the ICC prosecutor , continue to receive support from the Kenyan Human Rights Commission , and at least one of the suspects prefered the ICC to prosecution before a Kenyan court .
Nations opposed to the ICC , such as the United States , show a shortsighted reluctance to cede any sovereignty over their nationals to international institutions , and for this they come in for justifiable criticism .
By contrast , those African states that have demonstrated the confidence to open up to international justice should not be seen as the targets of neo - colonial victimisation ; they themselves have decided to be at the vanguard and usher in a new era of international justice , and for that we are indebted .
As recently observed by the new Gambian prosecutor at the ICC , Fatou Bensouda , these are "" principled states … determined to use the power of the law , not the power of arms , to protect their citizens and their territories . ""
The UK , thanks in part to efforts of the late Robin Cook , when foreign secretary , played a key role in helping establish the ICC .
In so doing , the UK chose to place itself at odds with its US ally and stand with the majority of the international community in laying the foundations for an historic institution ( even if it could one day extend its reach over any British citizen ) .
In the fullness of time it may be this , and not the unlawful war in Iraq , nor even the momentous passing of the Human Rights Act , that proves New Labour 's lasting legacy to the international legal order .
For sure , there are flaws in our new system of international justice .
For one thing , those who choose not to sign up to it - or have a powerful friend on the security council - face little immediate prospect of being brought before an international court .
The downside of this is that people claim , as Seumas Milne did recently , that "" international law simply does n't apply to the big powers or their political leaders "" .
But this is only part of the story , precedents are being set , precedents that will no doubt one day be applicable to all .
The fact is , international criminal justice is young .
With time it will develop its full potential .
Today it is Taylor , tomorrow … who knows ?
Taylor 's crime , and the basis of his conviction , was providing arms to a group he knew were using them to commit atrocities .
Those who knowingly peddle the hardware of abuse - no matter which continent they are from - should now sit up and take notice .
With the Taylor conviction , another new precedent has been set .

"The former Liberian president Charles Taylor will be sentenced on Wednesday for aiding and abetting war crimes during the long - running civil war in Sierra Leone .
The Special Court for Sierra Leone ( SCSL ) in The Hague can not impose capital punishment or life imprisonment but prosecutors have called for him to be given an 80-year prison term .
Any sentence handed out on Wednesday is likely to be served in the UK , which has offered to accommodate Taylor once his trial and appeal are completed .
The civil war left more than 50,000 dead in the west African state .
Taylor 's defence lawyers have told the court that exiling him to Britain 's jails – where a Serbian war crimes convict was attacked in his cell two years ago – would leave him "" culturally isolated "" and constitute a "" punishment within a punishment "" .
Taylor was found guilty last month of 11 counts of aiding and abetting war crimes and crimes against humanity by supporting rebels in Sierra Leone between 1996 and 2002 in return for conflict diamonds .
Offences of which he was found guilty included murder , rape , sexual slavery , recruiting child soldiers , enforced amputations and pillage .
In an interim sentencing hearing , the court 's chief prosecutor , Brenda Hollis , a former US military prosecutor , said : "" Considering the extreme magnitude and seriousness of the crimes that were committed against the people of Sierra Leone for which Taylor has been found responsible … the prosecution recommends that Charles Taylor be sentenced to a prison term of no less than 80 years .

[ His ] positions both as president of Liberia and within the west African regional bodies distinguish him from any other individual that has appeared before this court .
Taylor 's abuse of his authority and influence is especially egregious given that west African leaders repeatedly entrusted him with a role to facilitate peace . ""
In his final address to the UN - backed tribunal in The Hague , the 64-year - old denied encouraging human rights abuses during the prolonged civil war in neighbouring Sierra Leone , insisting he had in fact been trying to stabilise the region .
The court should deliver its sentence in a spirit of "" reconciliation , not retribution "" , said Taylor , who offered no admission of wrongdoing or words of remorse .
"" I express my sadness and sympathy for crimes suffered by individuals and families in Sierra Leone , "" he told the panel of judges at the SCSL . ""
What I did to bring peace to Sierra Leone was done with honour .
I was convinced that unless there was peace in Sierra Leone , Liberia would not be able to move forward .
I pushed the peace process hard , contrary to how I have been portrayed in this court . """
""
"Liberia 's former president , Charles Taylor , has been sentenced to 50 years in jail for being "" in a class of his own "" when committing war crimes during the long - running civil war in neighbouring Sierra Leone .
Judges at a UN - backed tribunal in The Hague said his leadership role and exploitation of the conflict to extract so - called "" blood diamonds "" meant he deserved one of the longest prison sentences handed down so far by the court .
Taylor , 64 , was found guilty last month of 11 counts of aiding and abetting war crimes and crimes against humanity , when supporting rebels between 1996 and 2002 in return for conflict gems .
The offences included murder , rape , sexual slavery , recruiting child soldiers , enforced amputations and pillage .
Delivering the decision at the special court for Sierra Leone , Judge Richard Lussick said Taylor 's crimes were of the "" utmost gravity in terms of scale and brutality "" .
He added : "" The lives of many more innocent civilians in Sierra Leone were lost or destroyed as a direct result of his actions .
"" Taylor was "" in a class of his own "" compared with others convicted by the court . ""
The special status of Mr Taylor as a head of state puts him in a different category of offenders for the purpose of sentencing .
"" Prosecutors had asked the judges to impose an 80-year prison term .
Lussick said such a long term would have been excessive as Taylor was convicted of aiding and abetting which "" as a mode of liability generally warrants a lesser sentence than that imposed for more direct forms of participation "" .
Issa Sesay , a leader of the Revolutionary United Front ( RUF ) which carried out many of the atrocities , has been sentenced to 52 years in jail .
Taylor , in a suit and yellow tie , gave no response as Lussick handed down what will effectively be a life sentence .
His lawyers have 14 days to lodge an appeal against verdict and sentence .
Adama Dempster of the Liberian Human Rights Protection Forum was in the courtroom .
"" I was watching Mr Taylor , "" he said .
"" He was quiet .
He was moving his head from one position to another .
He had a little bit of red in his eyes .
"" Fifty years is a lot but it 's about bringing redress for the victims .
It 's also about reinforcing the principle that no man is above the law .
It serves as a precedent to dictators and those who encourage war .
From our standpoint we saw justice being done .
There was no sense of jubilation in court . ""
Aid agencies and organisations in Sierra Leone welcomed the sentence .
Korto Williams , director of ActionAid Liberia , said : "" Not only is this verdict an opportunity for Sierra Leone and Liberia to move forward , it also signals the international community 's clear intent that any leader who misuses their power and carries out state - sanctioned violence will be held responsible for their crimes and will be punished . ""
Adama Coulibaly of the children 's rights organisation Plan International , which works in Sierra Leone to help former child soldiers and civil war survivors , said : "" Many young people in Sierra Leone witnessed their parents being killed .
Some were pulled into the fighting forces as soldiers or bush wives .
Those who experienced this war as children continue to be haunted by its atrocities .
"" Taylor 's trials in The Hague seem very far away from the reality of people 's actual lives .
For a region where peace and political stability are extremely fragile , this trial is of important symbolic value , rather than bringing actual redemption to those who suffered during the war . ""
Geraldine Mattioli - Zeltner of Human Rights Watch said : "" It is really significant that Taylor 's status as a former head of state was taken as an aggravating factor as far as his sentence was concerned .
"" That is a very important precedent and I hope that Syria 's Bashar al - Assad and Sudan 's Omar Hassan al - Bashir take note .
"" Taylor is the first former head of state convicted by an international war crimes court since Admiral Karl Dönitz , Hitler 's successor , was jailed at Nuremberg .
The civil war left more than 50,000 dead in the west African state .
Thousands had their arms or hands forcibly amputated .
During the conflict , the country 's average life expectancy dipped to 37 years .
Taylor 's sentence is likely to be served in the UK , which has offered to take him once his trial and appeal are completed .
Taylor 's defence told the court that exiling him to Britain – where a Serbian war crimes convict was attacked in his cell two years ago – would leave him "" culturally isolated "" and constitute a "" punishment within a punishment "" .
In his last address to the tribunal , Taylor denied encouraging human rights abuses during the prolonged civil war in Sierra Leone , insisting he had in fact been trying to stabilise the region .
"" What I did to bring peace to Sierra Leone was done with honour .
I was convinced that unless there was peace in Sierra Leone , Liberia would not be able to move forward .
"" I pushed the peace process hard , contrary to how I have been portrayed in this court . ""
The court 's prosecutor , Brenda Hollis , said that she may appeal the sentence on the grounds that it is too lenient .
"" We will carefully review the sentencing judgment keeping in mind the critical role Mr Taylor played in the commission of the crimes of which he has been convicted , the horrible suffering of the victims , and the devastating impact of the crimes , "" she said .
"" It is important that those responsible for criminal misconduct on a massive scale are not given a volume discount . ""
The sentence imposed today does not replace amputated limbs , does not bring back to life those who were murdered , does not heal the wounds of those who were victims of sexual violence and does not remove the permanent emotional , psychological and physical scars of those enslaved or recruited as child soldiers . """
"The head of the US war crimes office has warned Rwanda 's leaders , including President Paul Kagame , that they could face prosecution at the international criminal court for arming groups responsible for atrocities in the Democratic Republic of Congo .
Stephen Rapp , who leads the US Office of Global Criminal Justice , told the Guardian the Rwandan leadership may be open to charges of "" aiding and abetting "" crimes against humanity in a neighbouring country – actions similar to those for which the former Liberian president , Charles Taylor , was jailed for 50 years by an international court in May.
Rapp 's warning follows a damning United Nations report on recent Rwandan military support for M23 , an insurgent group that has driven hundreds of thousands of people from their homes since April as it has seized territory in the eastern DRC .
The group is led by Bosco Ntaganda , known as the Terminator , who was indicted by the international criminal court six years ago for war crimes including the forced recruitment of child soldiers .
The UN report accuses Rwanda of shielding Ntaganda from justice .
On Saturday , Washington said it would halt some military aid to Rwanda after the UN report .
The aid freeze and Rapp 's public intervention mark a significant shift away from once - solid US support for Kagame , which was rooted in lingering guilt over international inaction during the 1994 genocide of Rwandan Tutsis .
Rapp , who previously served as chief prosecutor at the Rwanda genocide tribunal and later initiated the prosecution of Taylor over his crimes as president of Liberia in supporting rebels in neighbouring Sierra Leone , said Rwandan support for M23 and other armed groups "" has to stop "" because it "" maintains the lawlessness and at the end of the day enables the ongoing commission of atrocities "" .
"" There is a line that one can cross under international law where you can be held responsible for aiding a group in a way that makes possible their commission of atrocities , "" he said .
"" Charles Taylor never set foot in Sierra Leone , and aided and abetted , and was convicted of aiding and abetting , the Revolutionary United Front with assistance that was substantial and , the judges said , without which the RUF could not have committed the atrocities to the extent they did commit them .
Because of that evidence , Charles Taylor was convicted and sentenced to 50 years . ""
Rapp said the evidence by the UN group of experts of Rwandan government support for M23 and other armed groups , including sending weapons and troops into the DRC , exposed Kagame and other senior officials to investigation for war crimes . ""
At this stage , I 'm not sure if we are there in terms of criminal conduct , "" he said .
"" But if this kind of thing continued and groups that were being armed were committing crimes
…
then I think you would have a situation where individuals who were aiding them from across the border could be held criminally responsible . ""
The UN report , by a group of experts appointed by the security council , said it had "" found substantial evidence attesting to support from Rwandan officials to armed groups operating in the eastern DRC "" , including shipping weapons and money to M23 in breach of a UN arms embargo and other sanctions . ""
Since the earliest stages of its inception , the group documented a systematic pattern of military and political support provided to the M23 rebellion by Rwandan authorities , "" it said .
The report said the Rwandan government gave "" direct assistance in the creation of M23 through the transport of weapons and soldiers through Rwandan territory "" , and recruited Rwandan youths , demobilised ex - combatants and Congolese refugees as M23 fighters .
It also offers evidence of "" direct Rwandan Defence Forces ( RDF ) interventions into Congolese territory to reinforce M23 "" and "" support to several other armed groups "" . ""
RDF operational units are periodically reinforcing the M23 on the battlefield against the Congolese army , "" it said .
Many M23 members formerly served in another Rwandan - backed militia , the National Congress for the Defence of the People ( CNDP ) , which was responsible along with other militias for widespread atrocities over several years , including ethnic killings and mass rape .
Ntaganda was the CNDP 's military chief .
The experts accuse Rwanda of shielding Ntaganda from prosecution by the ICC for war crimes .
"" Rwandan officials have insisted on impunity for their armed group and mutineer allies , including ex - CNDP General Bosco Ntaganda , "" they said .
Earlier this week , Kagame denounced western criticism of Rwanda 's role in the DRC and blamed the continuing conflict on foreign powers that "" do n't listen "" , as well as the continuing threat from anti - Tutsi extremist forces , led by Hutus responsible for the 1994 genocide .
"" This problem has not been caused by Rwanda and it has not been abetted by Rwanda , "" said Kagame .
"" Actually the problem of DRC came from outside .
It was created by the international community , our partners , because they do n't listen … and in the end they do n't actually provide a solution .
They just keep creating problems for us .
We know better our problems , we know better about this region 's problems .
"" Kagame also denied arming M23 . ""
The international community was saying that Rwanda is helping rebels , but helping them with what , and for what reason ?
They say we supply them with ammunition , but these people get guns from the Congolese army .
The ammunition they have is from their Congolese armouries , "" he said .
"" We are not supplying even one bullet , we have not and we will not . ""
Kagame rejected accusations that Rwanda is shielding Ntaganda from the ICC .
He said he told DRC 's government that it should deal with the renegade general , but warned that arresting Ntaganda would only create more conflict . ""
After that , members of the international community developed an idea that if Rwanda ca n't support them to arrest someone in another country , then they would put us together with those they want to arrest , and this is really how it turned out to be , "" he said .
The Rwandan leadership has faced accusations from the UN before , but the latest report has exposed it to unusual public criticism from Washington .
"" We have a lot of influence with the Rwandans .
We 've been very supportive of them .
We 're prepared to speak frankly to them as we have privately in the past , and now publicly , "" Rapp said .
"" M23 was reinforced by Rwanda , and that has to stop .
And that 's the message we 're delivering . ""
The US and Britain have long been accused of shielding Kagame from criticism over Rwanda 's support for armed groups in the DRC and its plunder of minerals there .
Tony Blair , the former British prime minister , has been among the Rwandan president 's strongest supporters , praising him as a "" visionary leader "" for the reconstruction and economic development of his country after the genocide .
Rwanda 's invasion of what was then Zaire in 1996 to clear out refugee camps sheltering armed groups responsible for the genocide two years earlier was quietly backed by Washington and London , which did not challenge a second invasion two years later and Kigali 's attempt to create a proxy administration in eastern DRC using loyal armed groups .
But the solid public support of Kagame grew increasingly difficult to defend given the scale of the suffering in DRC , with hundreds of thousands murdered and millions dying from disease and malnutrition caused by the conflict , and untold numbers of women raped , often repeatedly .
Earlier UN reports accused Kagame 's forces of war crimes , including possibly genocide , in the eastern DRC .
Others have criticised the increasingly authoritarian nature of the Rwandan president 's rule , including the effective barring of political opposition ."
"In the 90s , the forests of Liberia became inexorably linked to arms , violence and bloodshed as civil war raged throughout this small west African state .
For nearly a decade President Charles Taylor used Liberia 's 4 m hectares of primary forest as a wartime piggy - bank .
His trade of lucrative tropical wood for arms and cash helped fund a brutal civil conflict that left the country decimated and 250,000 dead .
Since the end of the conflict in 2003 , a new government under the Nobel prize - winning President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf has tried to break with the past and clean up Liberia 's forests .
Instead of conflict timber , Liberia was to become the epitome of sustainable forestry .
The entire forestry sector was overhauled with help from the international community , particularly the World Bank , the EU and the US .
Millions of dollars were pumped into creating a sustainable and conflict - free timber industry .
Initial signs were good .
Liberia was praised internationally for its efforts to create a strong framework that protected its virgin rainforest and the communities who should be benefiting from it .
Yet in the process something has gone badly wrong .
In recent months , it has emerged that Liberia 's forests are being stripped by logging operators who now own more than a third of the country 's entire landmass .
Campaigning groups say that these companies are working through unregulated private contracts , operating outside Liberia 's sustainable forestry laws amid reports of widespread fraud and misconduct .
The situation in Liberia is now threatening wider EU drives to create a more sustainable global forestry industry , with the fear that potentially illegal Liberian timber could be exported directly into EU markets .
A dark history
The undermining of Liberia 's efforts to create a sustainable forestry strategy starkly reveals the faultlines that still exist in the drive to regulate the global logging industry .
Despite its efforts to overhaul Liberia 's dark past as a heartland for "" conflict timber "" and create a sustainable forestry sector that has learnt lessons from its bloody past , Liberia has created a "" broken system that never got off the ground "" , according to Jonathan Gant , a policy adviser at campaigning group Global Witness .
So where did it all go wrong ?
Sirleaf was praised for revoking the corrupt timber contracts when she came to power in 2006 .
New forestry laws were passed to ensure the country would never again slip back into the era of "" blood timber "" .
A UN timber ban , imposed in 2003 , was finally lifted .
With the help of SGS , a Swiss - based company hired to supervise the tracing of logs from felling to leaving the country , Liberia began exporting legal timber for the first time since the war .
Exploiting a loophole
Yet it was n't long before cracks began to surface .
Bad roads and unfinished ports forced some logging companies to leave their timber to rot .
Looking for a way to recoup profits , some logging companies discovered a way around Liberia 's new laws .
They began operating through private use permits ( PUPs ) , a type of logging licence designed to allow private land owners to cut trees on their property .
Because PUPs were never intended to be used for large - scale logging , they do n't adhere to many of Liberia 's carefully crafted sustainable forestry laws .
In the last year the use of these licences has swelled to the extent that PUPs now make up 70 % of Liberia 's current logging concessions .
According to Global Witness , this essentially means that logging operators are now in control of huge tracts of Liberian forest with nearly no regulation of their activities . ""
Companies holding these permits are not required to log sustainably and pay little in compensation to either the Liberian government or the people who own the forests for the right to export valuable tropical timber , "" explains Global Witness 's Gant .
"" What has developed is large - scale logging , but through a loophole [ that manages to ] circumvent the safeguards that were set up to try and promote industrial logging in a sustainable way . ""
Global Witness – along with the Sustainable Development Institute ( SDI ) and Save My Future Foundation ( SAMFU )
– also says it has found evidence of misconduct by both the government and the logging companies , including forged documents and communities being defrauded out of their forest rights .
More alarmingly , there is also a fear that "" the increasing use of private use permits could recreate an environment for conflict - financing "" , according to the latest UN Panel of Experts report .
Threatening future sustainability
The situation in Liberia also has much wider implications for global efforts to scale up sustainable forestry .
Liberia is on the verge of ratifying the EU 's Voluntary Partnership Agreement ( VPA ) , a legally - binding agreement that commits the EU to "" trading only in wood products that can be verified as legal "" .
SDI claims the PUPs are a threat to the credibility of this new EU timber regulation , which will come into effect in March 2013 .
According to the Swiss company SGS , nearly two - thirds of Liberia 's timber exports in 2012 have come from PUPs , with some of it entering the European market .
Thousands of logs are still being exported to China and the EU ; this year alone , France was the leading importer of Liberian timber behind China .
What next ?
Liberia is taking steps to try to stem the flow of timber out of the country .
President Sirleaf launched a full - scale investigation into PUPs in September , and last month the supreme court of Liberia upheld a suspension on logging activities of all but four PUPs , as well as the suspension of any new licences until further notice .
It is unclear what the investigation will bring , but NGOs , civil society organisations and international partners want the legality of every PUP to be verified before the suspension on their activities is lifted .
"" We will try to do whatever it takes to support the country to persecute those in [ cases where ] criminal evidence appears because it is important to give a strong commitment that criminal behaviour is not tolerated , "" says Attilio Pacifici , the EU ambassador to Liberia .
It is estimated the illegal logging trade robs governments in developing countries of around £ 7 - 10bn in lost revenue every year .
Campaigners hope that President Sirleaf 's rhetoric will now lead to decisive action if the country is to achieve its dream of ever becoming a model for sustainable forestry .

"Liberia 's former president , Charles Taylor , is expected to be moved to a British jail after his 50-year sentence for aiding and abetting war crimes in west Africa was upheld by a UN - backed tribunal .
The ruling means the 65-year - old will spend the rest of his life in a high - security prison cell .
A final decision by the special court for Sierra Leone ( SCSL ) on where he will spend his sentence will be made next week .
The UK is the only country that has publicly offered to accommodate him .
There had been speculation that the tribunal might overturn Taylor 's convictions , following stricter precedents set in the international criminal tribunal for the former Yugoslavia about what constitutes "" aiding and abetting "" .
A series of recent judgments in that court now mean proof is required that senior military commanders have "" specifically directed "" atrocities .
But the SCSL appeal judges dismissed the Balkans precedents as irrelevant and said Taylor had known at the time that atrocities were going to be committed by rebel forces attacking Sierra Leone 's capital , Freetown .
They found that the former warlord and political leader had not demonstrated "" real and sincere remorse "" for his actions .
The judgment was delivered by the appeal chamber of the SCSL in The Hague .
Taylor had challenged the 50-year sentence , having been found guilty on 11 counts that included participating in the planning of murder , rape , sexual slavery and enforced amputations .
Taylor 's lawyers argued that the original trial chamber made systematic errors in the evaluation of evidence and in the application of the law governing what constitutes "" aiding and abetting "" sufficiently serious to "" reverse all findings of guilt entered against him "" .
The prosecution also appealed against the original decision , saying that Taylor should have been found individually criminally responsible for ordering and instigating crimes committed by rebels in Sierra Leone .
It maintained a 50-year sentence was not "" reflective of the inherent gravity of the totality of his criminal conduct and overall culpability "" and should be increased to 80 years .
Last year the three - judge panel unanimously found that Taylor had been criminally responsible for "" aiding and abetting "" the Revolutionary United Front ( RUF ) and other factions carrying out atrocities in Sierra Leone between 1996 and 2002 .
The court heard that the Liberian leader knew from August 1997 about the campaign of terror being waged against the civilian population in Sierra Leone and about the sale of "" blood diamonds "" in return for weapons .
Among the atrocities detailed was the beheading of civilians .
Victims ' heads were often displayed at checkpoints .
On one occasion a man was killed , publicly disembowelled and his intestines stretched across a road to form a checkpoint . ""
The purpose , "" Judge Richard Lussick said , "" was to instil terror .
"" Taylor was the first former head of state to face judgment in an international court on war crimes charges since judges in Nuremberg convicted Karl Dönitz , the admiral who led Nazi Germany for a brief period following Adolf Hitler 's suicide .
Taylor 's conviction was widely welcomed in Sierra Leone but the response in Liberia , where he was once seen as a freedom fighter , was more critical .
Brenda Hollis , the SCSL 's prosecutor in the case against Taylor , told the Guardian : "" We are happy with the results .
My sense was that Taylor felt that nothing he had done was wrong or at least he was n't admitting to anything . "" Bad things may have happened but he did not know anything about them .
He was charismatic , very bright and very manipulative .
But sometimes the facts are so overwhelming you ca n't manipulate them . ""
Prison authorities in England and Wales have made preparations for Taylor 's arrival .
The Foreign Office said : "" We welcome this landmark verdict for international justice .
It demonstrates that the reach of international justice is long and that even heads of state can not hide behind immunity . ""
The verdict can not erase the suffering of the victims and relatives of those killed , but we hope it helps them to draw a line under that terrible period in Sierra Leone 's history .
"" We have an agreement with the SCSL to enforce any sentence handed down to Charles Taylor .
This is a reflection of our commitment to the SCSL , but it does not guarantee that the UK will enforce Taylor 's sentence .
The final decision on where Taylor 's sentence will be enforced will be taken by the SCSL President . ""
The average cost of keeping a prisoner in a British jail is around £ 40,000 a year .
Conditions in a British prison are likely to be more restrictive for Taylor than his experiences in Scheveningen jail in the Netherlands , where he has been detained for the past six years : a recent biography , claimed he had fathered a child with his wife during conjugal visits .
The UK 's record on holding war crimes inmates is not unblemished .
In 2010 , the Bosnian Serb general Radislav Krstic , who was serving a 35-year sentence in Wakefield prison , was stabbed in his cell by three Muslim inmates .
Welcoming the tribunal 's decision , Elise Keppler of Human Rights Watch said : "" Taylor 's conviction sends a powerful message that those at the top can be held to account on the gravest crimes . ""
With the conclusion of the Taylor case and eight others affiliated with the three main warring factions in Sierra Leone , the special court has been a major force in bringing justice for the horrific abuses committed during that country 's brutal armed conflict that ended in 2002 . ""
The ruling also finds that aiding and abetting can be established where there is a substantial effect – as opposed to a specific direction – on the crimes .
A recent controversial ruling at the ICTY required ' specific direction ' , making it harder to establish liability on aiding and abetting by high - level perpetrators . """
"Charles Taylor , the convicted former Liberian president , will serve his 50-year sentence for war crimes in a British prison , the ministry of justice has confirmed .
The announcement follows a final ruling by the United Nations - backed Special Court for Sierra Leone ( SCSL ) in The Hague last month .
The UK is the only country that has publicly offered to accommodate him .
The offer was made in 2006 by the then foreign secretary , Margaret Beckett , as part of a diplomatic deal to bring the onetime warlord to justice .
For the past seven years Taylor , now 65 , has been held in a small Dutch jail pending the last appeal stage of the UN tribunal .
Lawyers for Taylor had pressed the court to allow him to serve out his sentence in an African jail nearer home .
Justice minister Jeremy Wright told parliament in a written statement : "" Former President Taylor will now be transferred to a prison in the UK to serve [ his ] sentence . ""
He added : "" The United Kingdom 's offer to enforce any sentence imposed on former President Taylor by the SCSL was crucial to ensuring that he could be transferred to The Hague to stand trial for his crimes . ""
He said the decision had wide cross party support when it was passed in June 2007 and that "" Her Majesty 's government would meet the associated costs "" .
"" International justice is central to foreign policy .
It is essential for securing the rights of individuals and states , and for securing peace and reconciliation , "" he said .
"" The conviction of Charles Taylor is a landmark moment for international justice .
It clearly demonstrates that those who commit atrocities will be held to account and that no matter their position they will not enjoy impunity . ""
The minister did not identify which prison Taylor will be held in .
It is likely , at least initially , to be a high security jail .
The average cost of keeping a prisoner in a British jail is around £ 40,000 a year .
Conditions in a British prison are likely to be more restrictive for Taylor than his experiences in Scheveningen jail in the Netherlands , where he has been detained for the past seven years .
A recent biography claimed he had fathered a child with his wife during conjugal visits there .
The Hague court found Taylor guilty of 11 counts of war crimes , crimes against humanity , and other serious violations of international humanitarian law , including murder , forced labour and slavery , recruiting child soldiers and rape .
He had been criminally responsible for "" aiding and abetting "" the Revolutionary United Front and other factions carrying out atrocities in Sierra Leone between 1996 and 2002 .
The court heard that the Liberian leader knew from August 1997 about the campaign of terror being waged against the civilian population in Sierra Leone and about the sale of "" blood diamonds "" in return for weapons .

"A former chief prosecutor of the international criminal court has condemned its cases against Kenya 's president and vice - president , warning that the indictments could damage the fledgling international justice system .
David Crane , the US lawyer who built the case against Liberia 's former president Charles Taylor , said his successors at The Hague had ignored political realities in pursuing the Kenyan prosecution , which he said "" could be the beginning of a long slide into irrelevance for international law "" .
Uhuru Kenyatta , Kenya 's president , is due to stand trial next month at the ICC , the first time a sitting head of state will have done so .
Along with his deputy , William Ruto , whose separate but related trial has already begun , Kenyatta is accused of masterminding the violence that killed at least 1,300 people in the wake of a disputed election at the turn of 2007 - 08 .
Last week the African Union passed a resolution calling for immunity for all serving African heads of state .
"" I would never have indicted or gotten involved in justice for the Kenyan tragedy , "" said Crane , a former chief prosecutor of the special court for Sierra Leone , a precursor to the ICC .
"" It 's placed them in a situation where they are damned if they do or damned if they do n't . ""
The African Union has called on the Kenyan leaders not to attend hearings at The Hague until the UN security council , which oversees the ICC , has responded to its recent demands .
France is working on a UN resolution that would defer the Kenyan cases for 12 months , according to a senior diplomat in the Kenyan capital , Nairobi .
Human rights groups have said giving in to AU demands for immunity would set a terrible precedent that would encourage heads of state to trample constitutional term limits , cling to power and rig elections .
"" It 's become a lose - lose situation , "" said Crane .
Crane said the cases he built during three years of investigations in west Africa from 2002 - 05 had taken into account local politics as well as the law .
"" Politics is the bright red thread of modern international law , a successful prosecution must factor in the international stage . ""
After ad hoc tribunals dealt with the fallout from civil wars in the Balkans and west Africa , as well as the genocide in Rwanda , the ICC got a permanent home in the Netherlands and issued its first arrest warrants in 2005 .
Under the Argentinian lawyer Luis Moreno - Ocampo , the prosecutor 's office pursued high - profile African leaders , including Sudan 's Omar al - Bashir – who has ignored the warrant – and a number of alleged warlords in the Democratic Republic of the Congo .
Crane said Moreno - Ocampo had a "" political tin ear "" and had been overly ambitious in his indictments .
When Kenya came close to a civil war and as many as 400,000 people lost their homes after a contested election result in 2007 , mediators brokered a deal under which a national tribunal was meant to be set up to try the guilty .
The ICC stepped in as a court of last resort when the Kenyan parliament could not agree on a local alternative .
Moreno - Ocampo became a celebrity in Kenya , with minibus taxis named after him , but his initial popularity waned , and this was exacerbated by his decision to name Kenyatta and Ruto , political rivals whose supporters had fought during the violence , among the indictees .
The pair united in a "" coalition of the accused "" and won elections this year in a campaign that portrayed the ICC as a colonial throwback .
Moreno - Ocampo was replaced last year as chief prosecutor by Gambia 's Fatou Bensouda .
Crane said the ICC should have used the threat of its intervention to nudge for reform rather than launching prosecutions that the Kenyan elite would never support .
"" It 's a question of some justice versus no justice , "" he said .
"" If it 's perceived that Kenyatta and Ruto have won then we 're thrown back to the pre - Taylor era in Africa . """
"Charles Taylor , the Liberian warlord who is serving a 50-year term in a British prison , has launched a legal action seeking his removal to an African jail .
The 66-year - old former president of the west African state is making an appeal to the UN - backed tribunal in The Hague , which sentenced him , arguing that he is being deprived of his right to a family life .
Two years ago the special court for Sierra Leone convicted him of aiding and abetting war crimes , and crimes against humanity , by supporting rebels in Sierra Leone between 1996 and 2002 in return for "" blood diamonds "" .
Taylor has been held in HMP Frankland , near Durham , for the past eight months but has not received any family visits , according to his lawyers , because immigration officials have refused to issue visas for his wife and 15 children .
One of the grounds of his appeal , John Jones QC , told BBC radio , was that he was being denied his right to a family life as guaranteed by article eight of the European convention on human rights . ""
The UK has not given the family visas , "" Jones said .
"" Charles Taylor is the only person convicted by the tribunal to serve his sentence outside Africa .
It 's inexplicable .
Everyone else [ convicted by the court ] is in Rwanda . ""
At his appeal against sentence in The Hague two years ago , Taylor 's lawyers said that exiling the former Liberian leader to Britain 's jails would leave him culturally isolated and constitute a "" punishment within a punishment "" .
Taylor was found guilty of 11 charges , including murder , rape , sexual slavery , enforced amputations and pillage .
Before the four - year trial began the UK signed a "" sentence - enforcement agreement "" with the Dutch government , stating that Britain would give Taylor prison space .
His conviction was the first by an international court of a former head of state since the Nazi trials at Nuremberg in 1946 .
Taylor 's detention is reported to be costing the UK £ 80,000 a year .
The Foreign Office , which is leading on the Taylor case , said it could not comment on whether visa applications made by his family in Liberia had been refused .
An FCO spokesperson added : "" This is not a case against the UK .
A motion has been filed with the residual special court for Sierra Leone ( RSCSL ) who are responsible for determining where he serves his sentence .
The motion requests the RSCSL transfers him to a prison in Rwanda . ""
Conditions in Taylor 's British prison are far more restrictive than those while he was on remand in Scheveningen jail in the Netherlands , where he had been detained for the previous seven years .
A recent biography claimed he had fathered a child with his wife during conjugal visits there .
The UK 's record on holding war crimes inmates is not unblemished .
In 2010 , the Bosnian Serb general Radislav Krstić , who was serving a 35-year sentence in Wakefield prison , was stabbed in his cell by three Muslim inmates .
Lawyers objecting to Taylor 's removal to the UK after he was sentenced in the Hague during 2012 said : "" That [ he ] should serve his sentence in a prison , culturally and geographically thousands of miles from his home , should be considered a factor in mitigation , as it in fact amounts to exile .

"I do not need Michael Gove to explain to me what antisemitism is ( Gove attacks ‘ antisemitic’ Israel boycotts , 10 September ) .
I have been the object of antisemitism by two Conservative MPs , Sir Charles Taylor , who told me to “ Get back to Tel Aviv ” , and Sir Alec Douglas - Home , who admonished me that my loyalty should be to this country and not to Israel , bringing the proceedings of the House of Commons to a roaring halt .
Harold Macmillan referred to me antisemitically in his diaries .
Of course the Holocaust , the Nazi slaughter of 6 million Jews , including many members of my family , was an atrocity unparalleled in human history .
That does not provide justification for the Israelis murdering thousands of Palestinians .
Since governments take no action against these massacres , it is right that communities and individuals should boycott Israeli products .
Gerald Kaufman MP Labour , Manchester Gorton •
Mr Gove creates the all - too - common ( and deliberate ? ) confusion between antisemitism and anti - Zionism .
The Boycott , Divestment and Sanctions campaign ( BDS ) is symbol of opposition to the policies of the state of Israel ’s policies , in relation to the occupation , the continued building of settlements , the imprisonment of children and the murderous attacks on Gaza .
There should never be any devaluation of the Holocaust , and antisemitism should always be resolutely resisted .
Very unfortunately some protesters also confuse antisemitism and anti - Zionism .
Where Mr Gove is right is that “ we need to stand united against hate
” –
but that of course includes Palestinians , and even Hamas , who are at least partially a product of Zionism .
BDS should continue and grow , including a total arms embargo , until Israel is willing to seriously negotiate with all Palestinians , including Hamas .
That was how the original apartheid state was brought to the table , with the hated ANC , and that is what needs to happen again .
Rev David Haslam Evesham , Worcestershire •
Michael Gove needs to be reminded that one case is not a reliable basis for generalisation .
Yes , the Nazi boycott of Jewish goods was followed by the Holocaust but the campaign against South African apartheid was not followed by the mass killing of whites .
He also needs to be more careful in his assertions : the Tricycle theatre did not reject “ Israeli money ” because it came from Israel but because it came from the government of Israel , which is instrumental in the denial of Palestinian human rights and the ethnic cleansing of Palestine .
The Palestinian call for the boycott of Israel is absolutely clear in its opposition to all forms of racism .
Professor David E Pegg York • Antisemites and defenders of Israel seem united in the delusion that opposition to Israel means hatred of Jews .
Most people , I hope , can see the difference .
Responsible politicians and commentators should make it clear that many Jews and non - Jews are critical of Israel ’s policies without being antisemitic , and not fuel this dangerous fallacy .
Caryl Churchill London • Avi Shlaim
( Israel will find wisdom when it admits its mistakes , 8 September ) shamefully glorifies a designated terror group whose fighters , according to him , have “ reasons for rejoicing ” , for standing firm while their “ spirit did not break ” .
Shlaim admits that Hamas “ is guilty of terrorism
” , yet says it should not be labelled as terrorist , because it is “ also a legitimate political actor
” .
This argument makes little sense , and did not convince the European Union last year when it designated Hezbollah as a terror group , despite its role in the Lebanese government .
Terror groups should be isolated , not “ let off the hook ” , as demonstrated just a few days ago when the president of the Palestinian Authority , Abu Mazen , harshly criticised Hamas for the group ’s responsibility in instigating the Gaza conflict .
It seems that while both Palestinians and Israelis are seeing the situation for what it is – a conflict between moderates and radical terror –
Shlaim ’s piece reflects an outdated narrative that is not only anti - Israeli but arguably anti - Palestinian .
Yiftah Curiel Spokesperson , embassy of Israel , London • Avi Shlaim ’s excellent article explains why Israel ’s current policies can not bring it peace or security .
The article ’s flaw is the unspoken assumption that Israel wants peace and security .
Since 1948 , Israel ’s aim has , demonstrably , been ever greater expansion by means of dispossessing Palestinians .
The map of military conquests and settlements in the West Bank , including down the Jordan Valley , show over time how well that aim has been realised – and continues to be realised .
Israel wants not peace and security but Palestinian , Arab and world acquiescence in this continual expansion .
The various “ peace processes ” have nothing to do with peace and everything to do with providing a smokescreen to this end .
Mike Davies Chair , Alliance for Green Socialism •
While the author ’s intentions are no doubt good , articles such as this are detrimental to the cause of peace .
Mr Shlaim admits that “ Hamas is indeed guilty of terrorism ” and that it “ vehemently denies the legitimacy of Israel ” .
Surely , conferring any sort of political legitimacy to such an organisation ( as the author suggests ) would only reward terrorism , while weakening those Palestinians more amenable to a peaceful solution .
Hamas – which has claimed responsibility for numerous suicide bombings – is no more “ a legitimate political actor ” than Isis , al - Qaida , al - Shabaab or Boko Haram .
Peace has never been achieved by empowering extremists , or by placing demands on just one side ; but by working with the moderates in both camps .
Both sides need to recognise that this is a conflict of right v right , not right v wrong ; that both peoples are there by right , not sufferance .
This is key : once this is recognised , mutual concessions , accommodation and respect become the self - evident next steps .

I am a Jew , committed to the Jewish religion and the ethical values of justice , mercy and compassion .
As such , I deplore the Israeli aggression against the people of Gaza .
I hope that the present ceasefire will eventually lead to a wider agreement .
It has come to my attention that the deputy lord mayor of Cardiff , Cllr Ali Ahmed , has been reported to the south Wales police by the Liberal Democrat opposition , on the grounds that he referred to rockets fired by Hamas against Israel as “ toy rockets ” and that this reference was offensive to the Jewish community .
It would have been preferable , that instead of using the words “ toy rockets
” , he has said that “ the damage done by Israel is not comparable with the Israeli bombing on the people of Gaza ” ; that may have been more explanatory .
However , the sentiments that he expressed are the sentiments shared , not only by many Jews like myself but also of some Israelis with regard to their own government .
There is no need for the deputy lord mayor to resign .
He is a man who has a strong commitment to ethical principles .

One night , when I was 13 , I was woken by the sound of a door being broken down .
Boots stumbled up the stairs , there was loud shouting , and a terrifying series of crashes .
Nazi stormtroopers had identified our house as the home of a Jewish family , and this was the night of 9 November 1938 , when the Kristallnacht pogrom raged across Germany .
Our entire home was destroyed before our eyes , with axes and sledgehammers .
I have a vivid recollection of my father , after the monsters had gone , sitting on the one chair that remained and weeping .
I had never seen him weep before .
I now realise that , but for the presence of myself and my younger sister , my parents might not have survived the raid .
It was a brutal demonstration of our situation .
My sister and I left Germany on the last Kindertransport from Düsseldorf in May 1939 .
We have never had a full account of our parents’ fate .
Even now , I sometimes start up in bed , reliving that night .
But in recent weeks , it is more often images of devastation in Gaza – of homes and families destroyed in Israeli targetings of such “ military objectives ” as the homes of officials in the democratically elected Hamas government – that have recalled the terror of the Kristallnacht .
For I can hardly believe that a Jewish government is doing these things .
How can Jewish people , aware of their own history , undertake a campaign of collective punishment that kills a higher multiple of the casualties cited as justification , than did the Nazi reprisals for resistance in occupied Europe ?
Surely we have reached the point where every government not composed of utter humbugs must join in insisting that an Israeli renunciation of ambitions for expansion beyond the 1947 boundaries is a prerequisite for progress towards reconciliation and peace within a two - state solution .
The very doubtful prospect of a unified , multinational , secular state in Palestine appears to be the only alternative .

"A former chief accountant at a government - funded thinktank killed himself as he awaited trial for allegedly stealing £ 600,000 from the now defunct organisation , an inquest has heard .
Charles Taylor , who worked for the International Centre of Financial Regulation , was awaiting trial over the alleged theft when he took his own life at home on 14 May.
The 55-year - old was charged in January 2014 with fraud by abuse of position and false accounting for allegedly defrauding ICFR out of £ 598,705 .
The father of two , who was declared bankrupt , was found by his wife when she returned to their country home in Hermitage , near Newbury , Berkshire .
The ICFR was endorsed by Gordon Brown when it was set up in 2009 and was funded by £ 3 m of government grants and a further £ 1 m from banks including Barclays and HSBC .
Three years later it went into liquidation after it was discovered that £ 600,000 was missing .
A statement by his wife , Margaret , read to the inquest in Reading , Berkshire said she found her husband on the bed in a spare room at their home .
“
I shouted at him to try to wake him up
but he did n’t respond , ” she said .
The assistant coroner for Berkshire , Emma Jones , told the inquest that Taylor had been described as “ secretive and not facing up to the truth ” .
Recording a verdict of suicide , Jones said : “ I am satisfied that he took his own life and that is the formal conclusion which will be recorded today . ”"
"My mother , Mary Percy , who has died aged 102 , worked hard to sustain her considerable family and was a talented amateur actor .
Born Mary Taylor in Birkenhead , she was the seventh of eight children of Charles Taylor , a manager in a card manufacturers in Liverpool , and Ada ( nee Campbell ) , a housewife .
Mary experienced hardship early in life when her brother Charlie returned seriously injured from France in 1918 , and her father died when she was only eight .
Forced to leave Tranmere higher grade school at 14 , she found work in 1928 at Lever Brothers’ soap factory in Port Sunlight as a post girl on 10 shillings a week .
She rose to become a supervisor in the Hollerith department , which took its name from the inventor of the punch - card system used to process sales data .
After joining the Port Sunlight Players , she starred in the operettas
The Desert Song and Rose Marie and the musical comedy
No , No , Nanette .
One reviewer thought her “ an exceptional actress with an engaging style and infectious smile , [ she ] flashes a pretty leg and sings quite well ” .
Any thoughts of the professional stage , however , were constrained by the need to support her mother financially .
Mary met her future husband , Sydney Percy , when they both appeared in a play , The Middle Watch , in 1935 .
He was a Lever chemical engineer , also one of eight , and orphaned at 11 .
They were keen concert - goers , and saw many of the greats perform , including Rachmaninov , Kreisler , Menuhin , Robeson , Paderewski and Gigli .
They married in 1938 , waiting until Sydney had completed a six - month whaling expedition to the Antarctic as the factory - ship chemist .
With Sydney posted to a temporary Lever factory just outside Merthyr Tydfil , south Wales , in 1940 , Mary survived the air raids on Merseyside in an Anderson shelter in her mother ’s back garden , with her feet in rainwater trying to comfort her infant child while pregnant with her second .
In 1954 , Mary gave birth to her sixth child ; and when Sydney died in 1973 , Mary dedicated herself to her family with formidable energy and joie de vivre .
She was the vibrant centre of any family gathering .
She once told a bemused Tony Blair that her husband had been a Freudian ; she meant Fabian .
She kept fit by swimming and cycling well into her 90s , living alone until 99 .
Just weeks before she died , she was still doing the Guardian quick crossword daily .
She is survived by me and my five siblings , Michael , Alan , David , Elizabeth and Margaret , 17 grandchildren and 21 great - grandchildren ."
"For humanities dons grumpily watching their scientific counterparts becoming instant millionaires and global celebrities in the current Nobel prize season while they go unhonoured , there was one reason to rejoice this week : a philosopher securing a prize worth $ 1 m ( £ 810,000 ) more than the current value ( about $ 930,000 , or £ 750,000 ) of each Nobel .
Charles Taylor , a Canadian in his 80s ( now at McGill University , formerly at Oxford ) perhaps best known for Sources of the Self and A Secular Age , was awarded the inaugural Berggruen prize , for ideas “ shaping human self - understanding and the advancement of humanity ” ; and just as eye - popping as its value were the previous Taylor laurels offhandedly listed at the end of the New York Times ’s report , adding up to lifetime earnings of around $ 4.5 m just from awards .
This a figure would only put him 292nd if transposed to the current golf rankings , but still shakes up one ’s ideas of a profession traditionally associated with an austere devotion to thought alone .
When Alfred Nobel , a chemical engineer and businessman , established his prizes in his will , no humanities disciplines were included .
Fields beyond science were only reflected in the anomalous non - academic awards for literature – announced for 2016 next week – and peace ( the prize for economics was not introduced until the 1960s ) .
This denied all kinds of non - fiction authors the chance to win humongous sums and be crowned world
No 1 ,
but it also left gaps that other foundations and philanthropists have since moved to fill , making possible spectacular paydays for intellectual galacticos such as Taylor .
Among his other trophies , for example , are the thought and ethics category of Japan ’s 50m - yen ( about $ 480,000 )
Kyoto prize , won this year by Martha Nussbaum and previously by Jürgen Habermas and Paul Ricoeur ; and Britain ’s £ 1,200,000 , pointedly Nobel - rivalling Templeton prize for “ affirming life ’s spiritual dimension ” , recently also claimed by Martin Rees and Jonathan Sacks .
( He has n’t got an Erasmus prize or a Rolf Shock prize , won respectively by fellow philosophy giants Daniel Dennett and Derek Parfit , but may well feel that at $ 170,000 and $ 280,000 they ’re small beer ) .
Other lifetime awards open up lucrative opportunities for authors in further fields such as history , sociology , anthropology , cultural studies and even literary scholarship ; such as Norway ’s annual Holberg prize ( worth about $ 560,000 ) , chiefly for the arts and humanities , won by Michael Cook in 2014 , Marina Warner in 2015 and Stephen Greenblatt in 2016 .
Or the $ 1.5 m Kluge prize for the humanities and social sciences , which Taylor and Habermas shared last year .
While these names might suggest that anyone under 70 is ineligible for Nobel - size purses , agreeable cheques have also gone to mid - career dons ; notably via the Mellon awards ( worth $ 1.5 m over three years and often dubbed the “ richest prize in the humanities ” ) , whose winners have included Judith Butler and literature professor Eric Sundquist .
And comparative youth is positively favoured in the MacArthur “ genius ” awards ( $ 625,000 over five years ) , which are usually seen as enabling creative types to stay in their garrets but included 14 recipients with academic posts ( a linguist and an art historian among them ) in this year ’s 30-strong squad .
Like older non - fiction stars deprived of a chance to be feted and enriched in Stockholm , they ’re entitled to ask : who needs a Nobel ?"

The campaign group Global Witness , which investigates corruption and environmental despoliation , said it believed the case was the first war crimes conviction for a businessman profiting from conflict resources .
Global Witness gathered evidence about his company , the Oriental Timber Company , which Dutch prosecutors cited when they initially brought charges against him more than a decade ago .
The case against Kouwenhoven , who was born in Rotterdam , has been fought for years through the Dutch courts , reaching the supreme court before eventually being sent back to the appeal court for a retrial .
The Oriental Timber Company gained trading concessions from Taylor when he was president of Liberia at a time when conflict between rival militias spilled over into neighbouring Sierra Leone , claiming hundreds of thousands of lives .
Shipments for Kouwenhoven ’s timber operation in Liberia carried caches of hidden arms between 2000 and 2003 .
“
These weapons were used by Taylor in an armed conflict with rebels , in which over a period of many years countless civilians were victimised , ” the Dutch judges said in a written summary of their ruling .
Kouwenhoven “ has right up to the present day denied the facts and not given any clarity about his motives
” , they added .
His conviction would serve as an example to others that do business with governments such as Taylor ’s “ that they can thereby become involved in serious war crimes ” .
Taylor , who was subsequently extradited to face trial at an international tribunal in The Hague , was sentenced in 2012 to 50 years in prison for aiding and abetting war crimes in neighbouring Sierra Leone .
He is currently serving his sentence in a British jail .
Patrick Alley , the director of Global Witness said : “ This verdict sends a clear message to those who profit from war .
They can and will be held to account .
If you buy natural resources like timber in full knowledge that you ’re helping to fund a conflict or trafficking arms , there ’s only a cheque book between your company and the murder of thousands of people , in this case 250,000 .
”
Alley said that some of Kouwenhoven ’s exported Liberian timber had been bought by blue - chip European timber companies .
“
We believe this is the first case where buying conflict resources has resulted in a war crimes conviction , ” Alley said ."
"Agnes Reeves Taylor , the ex - wife of former Liberian president Charles Taylor , has been charged with four torture offences allegedly committed in the west African country , Scotland Yard said .
Agnes Taylor , 51 , was arrested by the Met police ’s war crimes team on Thursday and was accused on Friday of committing the offences between 1989 and 1991 .
She was charged with two counts of being involved in torture in Gbarnga , in the north of the country , and one count of the same in Gborplay , in its north - east .
Each charge was brought under section 134(1 ) of Britain ’s Criminal Justice Act 1988 .
She was also charged with planning to carry out torture between 23 December 1989 and 1 January 1991 under section 1(1 ) of the Criminal Law Act 1977 .
Gbarnga served as the headquarters of Charles Taylor ’s National Patriotic Front during the first Liberian civil war .
A final peace agreement led to the election of Taylor as president of Liberia in 1997 .
A second civil war broke out in 1999 and Taylor was forced into exile in 2003 .
Agnes Taylor , who lives in Dagenham , in east London , is due to appear at Westminster magistrates court on Saturday .
Charles Taylor was jailed for 50 years in 2012 for war crimes after a UN - backed tribunal in The Hague .
A year later , the Ministry of Justice confirmed he would serve the sentence in a British prison ."
