2009-07-05,"In little over two years Wikileaks has enabled anonymous web users to upload more than 1.2 m confidential documents and incurred the wrath of the US military , several national governments and the Church of Scientology .
Journalists revel in the gold mine of unfettered , highly sensitive information , yet the website has also been criticised for its unwillingness to edit or filter material .
Earlier this month , Wikileaks and its co - founder Julian Assange won the prestigious Amnesty media award for exposing hundreds of alleged murders by the Kenyan police - its reporting led to a United Nations investigation .
The award confirmed its role in exposing injustice and its growing status , and raised the public profile of a site that has remained largely anonymous .
So what is Wikileaks and who is behind it ?
Launched in January 2007 with a focus on exposing some of the world 's most oppressive regimes , it describes itself as an "" uncensorable version of Wikipedia "" ; that is , it looks like the online encyclopaedia but has no formal relationship with it "" for legal reasons "" .
Its targets have ranged from the former Kenyan ruler Daniel arap Moi , who was implicated in allegations of massive corruption , to the actor Wesley Snipes , whose social security number was published after his conviction for failing to file tax returns last year .
Sensitive nature
In an emailed interview , the elusive Assange says the site 's mission is to engender a climate where censorship is counterproductive .
"" Wikileaks is a public service that does what it says it does , corrects wrongs by exposing them ...
We do this in what has proven to be the most effective way , by republishing the censored material . ""
Described by Wikileaks as "" Australia 's most famous ethical computer hacker "" , Assange refuses to reveal his age , other than to say he was born in the 1970s , and attended 37 schools and six universities before editing an activist electronic magazine .
He has taken precautions to keep his whereabouts secret , citing the sensitive nature of his work .
Although the mostly self - funded site credits an international team of Chinese dissidents , journalists , mathematicians and startup company technologists for its birth , Assange points to an article in the newspaper the Australian that claimed it was almost solely down to him .
That article also claimed that Wikileaks has no headquarters and is run by a core team of five investigators who assess and verify documents , which are largely uploaded in Sweden .
Global servers then "" mirror "" the site .
The central idea that drives Wikileaks is the move away from centralised information , says the freedom of information campaigner Heather Brooke .
"" It 's a great mechanism to circumvent the state and avoid prosecution , "" she adds .
Steven Aftergood , the director of the Federation of American Scientists project on government secrecy , believes Wikileaks goes too far in allowing unfettered publication of documents .
He accuses it of giving short shrift to issues of "" personal privacy , intellectual property and security "" .
But Brooke says privacy concerns are often overstated : "" It 's not their role [ to edit material ] ... if they started subjectively deciding what to include it would create a new and complex set of issues .
"" The US military is critical of the site , branding it "" irresponsible "" for hosting documents purporting to detail how US forces in Iraq were authorised to pursue former aides of Saddam Hussein and terrorists across Iraq 's borders into Iran and Syria .
Assange argues the rules governing what Wikileaks publishes are transparent and followed with great care , saying it simply aims to correct wrongs by exposing them and help other individuals and organisations to show that censorship is counterproductive .
Brooke adds that Wikileaks acts as an encouraging example to potential whistleblowers , giving them confidence that identities can be protected .
In two years the site has broken a multitude of stories - its documents include a list of websites supposedly banned by the Australian government , copies of the Scientology "" bible "" , emails from inside the Hugo Chávez regime in Venezuela and an operations manual from Guantánamo Bay .
Yet Aftergood points out that not all forms of secrecy are pernicious : "" And not all cases of involuntary disclosure are beneficial . ""
An upload of a document purporting to be an early draft script of the recent film Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull , prompted some site users to question how this fitted in with its whistleblowing .
By way of a defence , Assange says that the material had been removed from the internet following a creative dispute and so making it "" publicly accessible "" again was a way of "" uncensoring "" it .
Sharp relief Critics say that the decentralised structure that makes Wikileaks comparatively immune to censorship also renders it unaccountable .
Yet the effectiveness of Wikileaks was thrown into sharp relief in March when Barclays took out an injunction against the Guardian , banning it from hosting documents relating to the bank 's tax avoidance scheme on its website .
The documents were available on Wikileaks but a gag order prevented the Guardian from saying that they were .
The fact that they were available on Wikileaks was then referred to in parliament . ""
The judge could n't do anything about it , "" says Brooke .
"" We think it [ Wikileaks ] is useful just for these dictatorship countries but the UK has some of the worst limits on freedom of expression . ""
Brooke says the site can be difficult to use and documents are not always well publicised , but this may help keep it under the radar .
Others worry that time - pressured journalists can not dedicate themselves to lengthy investigations and so seize upon information from websites too easily .
Assange thinks the problem is a more fundamental failure of traditional journalism , citing the fact that 50 stories were written about Wikileaks putting the Chávez regime emails online , but none about the contents of the 6,700 messages .
When it comes to reporting on the complex documents on Wikileaks , says Assange , "" journalists are so scared of being scooped before completing a review of the material that they say nothing at all . """
2010-03-31,"As far as "" national security threats "" go , real or imagined , it 's likely that few Americans lose much sleep over Wilkileaks , the website that publishes anonymously sourced documents which governments , corporations , and other private or powerful organisations would rather you not see .
It would appear the US security apparatus does not feel the same way .
On Friday of last week , editor and co - founder Julian Assange posted a letter to the site detailing a laundry list of rather Keystone Kop - like instances of surveillance of himself and other members of the Wikileaks team , likely carried out at least in part by members of the US intelligence or law enforcement community : "" We have discovered half a dozen attempts at covert surveillance in Reykjavik both by native English speakers and Icelanders .
On the occasions where these individuals were approached , they ran away . ""
Ironic if it were not so creepy , much of the observable surveillance took place while Assange and others were in Iceland advising the parliament on a groundbreaking set of laws … designed to protect investigative journalists and web service providers from spying and censorship .
Assange also described being tailed on a flight en route to an investigative journalism conference in Norway , by "" two individuals , recorded as brandishing diplomatic credentials ... under the name of US State Department "" .
So why are US tax dollars being spent spying on a bunch of volunteer journalists , human rights activists and web geeks , as appears to be the case ?
There are a few obvious motives , but the smoking gun might be a classified film Wikileaks claims to have in its possession that shows evidence of a US massacre of civilians .
Images have power – think Abu Ghraib , think Mi Lai – and efforts at "" perception management "" by the department of defence will be much complicated by documentary evidence that leaves little to interpretation or "" perception "" of a human rights crime committed by US forces .
Wikileaks plans to show the video at the National Press Club in Washington , DC on 5 April . ""
In my opinion , the operation points not to the CIA , but to the US Diplomatic Security Service ( DSS ) , which ( among other things ) is tasked with tracing information leaks believed to be originating from US diplomatic staff , "" Dr Joseph Fitsanakis tells me , founder of Intelnews.org and an expert in the politics and history of intelligence and espionage . "" If the US suspected that Wikileaks acquired restricted or classified documents through a US embassy official or staff member ( which Julian alludes to in his editorial ) , then the DSS would get involved . ""
As a target for surveillance Wikileaks is hardly the Kremlin – the mostly volunteer run site was temporarily shut down a few months ago due to lack of funds .
Yet it has provided all manner of scoops in its short life – documented corruption in Kenya , evidence of potentially criminal bank fraud in Iceland , and classified US army documents about the treatment of Guantánamo detainees .
And while its list of critics is long , openness and transparency are not chief characteristics regularly attributed to them .
North Korea , China , Russia , and Zimbabwe have all blocked access to the site at one time or another in response to controversial leaks .
It 's not a very heartening sign that the US government has joined such an illustrious roster .
Yet in an ironic twist one of the conclusions of a report prepared by the department of defence intelligence analysis programme ( DIAP ) , and published by Wikileaks earlier this month contains a surprising defence of the workings of a functioning , responsive democracy : "" It must be presumed that Wikileaks.org has or will receive sensitive or classified DoD documents in the future .
This information will be published and analysed over time by a variety of personnel and organisations with the goal of influencing US policy .
"" If the video Wikileaks plans to screen at the National Press Club on April 5 does indeed include scenes of a US massacre of civilians in Iraq or Afghanistan , as is purported , perhaps the "" goal of influencing US policy "" becomes a little easier to identify .
National security is better served by promoting a just and accountable foreign policy .
For starters , stop massacring civilians in the never - ending wars in Iraq and Afghanistan , and investigate and prosecute those responsible for past massacres and cover - ups when and where the burden of proof calls for it .
If the US army and the defence apparatus still need help from the muckrakers at Wikileaks to remind them of this fact , then let the leaks continue .
And if you think the work that Wikileaks is doing is important , then consider leaking them some money ."
2010-05-17,"Wikileaks founder Julian Assange had his passport confiscated when he returned to his native Australia last week , according to The Age .
Arriving at Melbourne , immigration staff told Assange his passport was looking worn and would be cancelled .
Thirty minutes after his passport was returned to him , a police officer then searched his bags and questioned him about his computer hacking offences he committed in 1991 when he was a teenager .

Some rights reserved Despite the search , Assange was then told his passport is still classified as ' normal ' on the immigration database and could therefore travel freely .
Speaking on Australia 's Dateline show , Assange said he is wary of travelling in Australia , where he was born , because of information that has been published on Wikileaks .
Assange had been told that the publication of a proposed blacklist of banned sites has been referred to the Australian Federal Police , who were investigating how it was leaked and then published on Wikileaks , though AFP told the Sydney Morning Herald yesterday that the case had been dropped .
Looking at the site , it 's hard to believe there are many countries where travel is not a problem .

2010-06-11,"American officials are searching for Julian Assange , the founder of WikiLeaks in an attempt to pressure him not to publish thousands of confidential and potentially hugely embarrassing diplomatic cables that offer unfiltered assessments of Middle East governments and leaders .
The Daily Beast , a US news reporting and opinion website , reported that Pentagon investigators are trying to track down Julian Assange – an Australian citizen who moves frequently between countries – after the arrest of a US soldier last week who is alleged to have given the whistleblower website a classified video of American troops killing civilians in Baghdad .
The soldier , Bradley Manning , also claimed to have given WikiLeaks 260,000 pages of confidential diplomatic cables and intelligence assessments .
The US authorities fear their release could "" do serious damage to national security "" , said the Daily Beast , which is published by Tina Brown , former editor of Vanity Fair and New Yorker magazines .
Manning , 22 , was arrested in Iraq last month after he was turned over to US authorities by a former hacker , Adrian Lamo , to whom he boasted of leaking the video and documents .
As an intelligence specialist in the US army , Manning had access to assessments from the battlefields in Afghanistan and Iraq , as well as frank diplomatic insights into Middle East governments .
In one of his messages to Lamo , obtained by Wired magazine , Manning said : "" Hillary Clinton and several thousand diplomats around the world are going to have a heart attack when they wake up one morning and find an entire repository of classified foreign policy is available . ""
Although it is likely that WikiLeaks has broken US laws in de - encrypting the video from Baghdad and publishing secret documents , the tone of an American official who spoke to the Daily Beast sounded more desperate than threatening .
"" We 'd like to know where he is ; we 'd like his cooperation in this , "" the official said .
It is , in any case , not clear what legal measures US officials could use to stop publication of the cables .
Assange has created an elaborate web of protection – with servers in several countries , notably Sweden , which has strong laws protecting whisteblowers .
WikiLeaks ' response to the news that the Americans are trying to track down Assange came on Twitter .
"" Any signs of unacceptable behaviour by the Pentagon or its agents towards this press will be viewed dimly , "" it said .
After Manning was arrested , WikiLeaks said in a Twitter message that allegations "" we have been sent 260,000 classified US embassy cables are , as far as we can tell , incorrect "" .
Before his arrest , Manning told Lamo he was in part motivated to leak the video and documents by being ordered to look the other way in the face of injustice .
Messages from Manning , obtained by Wired , say he found that 15 Iraqis arrested by Iraqi police for printing "" anti - Iraq "" literature had merely put together an assessment of government corruption .
"" I immediately took that information and ran to the [ US army ] officer to explain what was going on .
He did n't want to hear any of it .
He told me to shut up and explain how we could assist the [ Iraqi police ] in finding MORE detainees , "" Manning wrote .
"" Everything started slipping after that .
I saw things differently .
I had always questioned the [ way ] things worked , and investigated to find the truth . ""
But that was a point where I was … actively involved in something I was completely against . ""
The Pentagon has declined to comment on the grounds that what is in the documents is classified ."
2010-06-16,"The whistleblowing website WikiLeaks says it plans to release a secret military video of one of the deadliest US air strikes in Afghanistan in which scores of children are believed to have been killed .
WikiLeaks announced the move in an email to supporters .
It said it fears it is under attack after the US authorities said they were searching for the site 's founder , Julian Assange , following the arrest of a US soldier accused of leaking the Afghanistan video and another of a US attack in Baghdad in which civilians were killed .
WikiLeaks released the Baghdad video in April , prompting considerable criticism of the US military .
It says it is still working to prepare the film of the bombing of the Afghan village of Garani in May 2009 .
The Afghan government said about 140 civilians were killed in Garani , including 92 children .
The US military initially said that up to 95 people died , of which about 65 were insurgents .
However , American officials have since wavered on that claim and a subsequent investigation admitted mistakes were made during the attack .
The video could prove to be extremely embarrassing to the US military and risks weakening Afghan support .
The US said it was targeting Taliban positions when it used weapons that create casualties over a wide area , including one - tonne bombs and others that burst in the air .
But two US military officials told a newspaper last year that no one checked to see whether there were women and children in the buildings .
The US commander , General David Petraeus , said a year ago that the military 's video of the attack would be made public as evidence that the US assault on Garani was justified .
But it was not released .
In an email to supporters , Assange said WikiLeaks has the Garani video and "" a lot of other material that exposes human rights abuses by the US government "" .
Last week , it was revealed that US authorities are trying to make contact with Assange to press him not to publish information the Pentagon says could endanger national security .
Assange cancelled an appearance in Las Vegas last Friday .
In his email , Assange also calls on supporters to protect the website from "" attack "" by the authorities following the detention of a US soldier , Bradley Manning , who was arrested in Iraq after admitting to a former hacker that he leaked the Garani and Baghdad videos to WikiLeaks ."
2010-06-21,"The elusive founder of WikiLeaks , who is at the centre of a potential US national security sensation , has surfaced from almost a month in hiding to tell the Guardian he does not fear for his safety but is on permanent alert .
Julian Assange , a renowned Australian hacker who founded the electronic whistleblowers ' platform WikiLeaks , vanished when a young US intelligence analyst in Baghdad was arrested .
The analyst , Bradley Manning , had bragged he had sent 260,000 incendiary US state department cables on the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan to WikiLeaks .
The prospect of the cache of classified intelligence on the US conduct of the two wars being put online is a nightmare for Washington .
The sensitivity of the information has generated media reports that Assange is the target of a US manhunt . ""
[ US ] public statements have all been reasonable .
But some statements made in private are a bit more questionable , "" Assange told the Guardian in Brussels . ""
Politically it would be a great error for them to act .
I feel perfectly safe …
but I have been advised by my lawyers not to travel to the US during this period . ""
Assange appeared in public in Brussels for the first time in almost a month to speak at a seminar on freedom of information at the European parliament .
He said : "" We need support and protection .
We have that .
More is always helpful .
But we believe that the situation is stable and under control .
There 's no need to be worried .
There 's a need always to be on the alert . ""
Manning is being held incommunicado by the US military in Kuwait after "" confessing "" to a Californian hacker on a chatline , declaring he wanted "" people to see the truth "" .
He said he had collected 260,000 top secret US cables in Baghdad and sent them to WikiLeaks , whose server operates out of Sweden .
Adrian Lamo , the California hacker he spoke to , handed the transcripts of the exchanges to the FBI .
Manning was promptly arrested in Baghdad at the end of last month and transferred to a US military detention unit in Kuwait .
He has been held for more than three weeks without charge .
Assange said WikiLeaks had hired three US criminal lawyers to defend Manning but that they had been granted no access to him .
Manning has instead been assigned US military counsel .
While WikiLeaks declined to confirm receipt of the material from Manning , it has already released a film of a US Apache helicopter attack on civilians in Baghdad .
It has also posted a confidential state department cable on negotiations in Reykjavik over Iceland 's financial collapse and is preparing to disclose much more material , including film of a US attack that left scores of civilians dead in Afghanistan .
The material is believed to derive from Manning , although WikiLeaks does not reveal its sources and its operations are designed to mask the source of the files it receives .
Prominent US whistleblowers and lawyers have advised Assange to stay out of the US and to be ultra - careful about his travel and public appearances . ""
Pentagon investigators are trying to determine the whereabouts of [ Assange ] for fear that he may be about to publish a huge cache of classified state department cables that , if made public , could do serious damage to national security , "" US web paper the Daily Beast reported 10 days ago .
"" We 'd like to know where he is –
we 'd like his co - operation in this , "" a US official was quoted as saying .
Daniel Ellsberg , who leaked the Pentagon Papers – a top secret study about the Vietnam war – in 1973 , spoke to the Daily Beast .
He said : "" I would think that [ Assange ] is in some danger .
Granted , I would think that his notoriety now would provide him some degree of protection . ""
Assange said : "" Some fear for my life .
I 'm not one of them .
We have to avoid some countries , avoid travel , until we know where the political arrow is pointing . ""
He added that WikiLeaks had been trying , "" unsuccessfully so far "" , to contact Manning in Kuwait . ""
Clearly , a young man is detained in very difficult circumstances with the allegation he is the whistleblower .
We must do our best to obtain freedom for him . ""
Regarding his own predicament , Assange said the US state department had signalled it was not seeking any WikiLeaks people because the Pentagon 's criminal investigations command had assumed the lead role in the case .
Apart from preparing much more material for release , WikiLeaks is planning to publicise a secret US military video of one of its deadliest air strikes in Afghanistan in which scores of children are believed to have been killed in May last year .
The Afghan government said about 140 civilians were killed in Garani , including 92 children .
The US military initially said that up to 95 died , of whom about 65 were insurgents .
US officials have since wavered on that claim .
A subsequent investigation admitted mistakes were made .
In April WikiLeaks released the Baghdad video , prompting considerable criticism of the Pentagon .
The film was edited and produced in Iceland where Assange spends a lot of his time and which last week prepared the most radical and liberal freedom of information legislation anywhere in the world .
Birgitta Jonsdottir , an Iceland MP and anti - war activist who led the drive for the new laws , co - produced the WikiLeaks version of the Baghdad video .
"" I worked on it 18 hours a day through the Easter holidays , "" she said .
Jonsdottir , a close associate of Assange , said the WikiLeaks founder "" went into hiding when the story of Manning 's arrest was published "" ."
2010-07-08,"Julian Assange , the founder of WikiLeaks , is to speak tomorrow evening at the Centre for Investigative Journalism summer school .
Since its launch four years ago WikiLeaks has proved to be a great resource for investigative journalism by providing a secure publishing platform for leaked , sensitive documents while protecting the whistleblowers who make them available .
Assange , the site 's director , is an Australian internet and free speech activist .

2010-07-16,"Job : founder , WikiLeaks Age : born 1971 Industry :
digital media New entry Julian Assange is the undercover force behind WikiLeaks , the self - styled "" intelligence service of the people "" that has published more than a million confidential documents from top secret military information to the hacked emails of Sarah Palin .
Launched at the beginning of 2007 and with a mission to change the world by abolishing official secrecy , the website has posted the text messages of people killed in the September 11 attacks , controversial correspondence between climate change researchers at East Anglia University and the so - called "" Collateral Murder "" video of American forces killing unarmed civilians in Baghdad .
At the cutting edge of digital journalism , it has "" more scoops in three years than the Washington Post has had in 30 "" , according to the internet guru Clay Shirky .
Unlike traditional media , WikiLeaks has so far escaped censure by basing itself in Sweden , which has strong laws to protect whistleblowers .
When the Guardian was prevented from publishing documents about the activities of oil trader Trafigura , the material ended up on WikiLeaks soon afterwards .
Not that governments and big business have n't tried to shut the site down â€ “ Assange claims to have fought off more than 100 legal attacks since its launch . ""
To do that , and keep our sources safe , we have had to spread assets , encrypt everything , and move telecommunications and people around the world , "" he said .
A softly spoken Australian with a shock of white hair , little is known about Assange .
He does not discuss his background â€ “ he was raised in Melbourne and convicted of computer hacking when he was a teenager - or where he lives .
Favourite boltholes are said to include Kenya , Sweden and Iceland .
Assange was forced into hiding earlier this year following the arrest of a US intelligence analyst who claimed to have sent 260,000 incendiary US state department cables on wars in Iraq and Afghanistan to the site .
WikiLeaks claimed its founders comprised Chinese dissidents , hackers , computer programmers and journalists , but Assange is its driving force .
The website won the prestigious Amnesty Media award for exposing hundreds of alleged murders by the Kenyan police and is helping MPs in Iceland with their plans to become a bastion for global press freedom .
It has an annual budget of around $ 175,000 , funded by small donations and free legal support from big media organisations , but a shortage of funds led it to temporarily suspending operations at the beginning of the year .
The site has also come under attack , not just by governments and big business , but from critics who claim it is indiscriminate and unaccountable .
To which Assange replied : "" When governments stop torturing and killing people , and when corporations stop abusing the legal system , then perhaps it will be time to ask if free speech activists are accountable . """
2010-07-25,"Julian Assange is self - consciously an individual .
He thinks in his own way , primarily as a physicist , having studied pure maths and physics at university in Australia where he grew up .
So , for example , explaining his decision to found Wikileaks , he starts with his interest in the physics of a small release of energy triggering a much larger release ; asks what small actions might release energy for "" just reform "" ; identifies the role of information and observes the restriction on the amount of information flowing into the system ; and sees Wikileaks as a mechanism "" to maximise the flow of information to maximise the amount of action leading to just reform "" .
He also acts in his own way .
Other people carry laptop computers ; he carries a desktop machine in a rucksack on his shoulder .
He will stay up all night , fingers flittering across the keyboard , and then suddenly crash out fully clothed in the nearest chair when everybody else is getting up .
He is interested in "" doing things that are not trivial or meaningless – making the most of your time "" .
He reckons he is genetically predisposed to rebel .
His parents met at a demonstration against the Vietnam war .
His father , a lover of motorbikes who became an architect , taught him that "" a generous , capable man protects victims and does n't create them "" .
His mother , as a teenager , rode her horse into city hall to protest against the closing of pony trails , and later took off on a motorbike for Sydney where she survived as a painter , actor and artist 's model .
Assange 's whole lifestyle is independent .
At the age of 39 , he has no home .
Carrying his computer and a second rucksack with clothes , he moves wherever the cause takes him , usually arriving with no idea where he will sleep , a habit formed in childhood , when his mother 's new career running a travelling theatre company saw him pass through 37 different schools .
In his late teens , he says he was part of the computer underground , working on early versions of the internet , hacking into the email of the power elite .
An attempt to settle down to life as a university physicist ended , he says , when he discovered academic mathematicians and physicists were selling their discipline to military and intelligence agencies .
He denounced them in a paper , "" On the Take and Loving It "" , and set out to create a website as uncompromising as himself ."

2010-07-26,"Wikileaks founder Julian Assange gives a press conference at the Frontline club in London .
This live stream is not controlled by the Guardian ."
2010-07-26,"The Wikileaks founder , Julian Assange , said today that the organisation is working through a "" backlog "" of further secret material and was expecting a "" substantial increase in submissions "" from whistleblowers after one of the biggest leaks in US military history .
Speaking in London after his website published more than 92,000 classified military logs relating to the war in Afghanistan , Assange said that he hoped for an "" age of the whistleblower "" in which more people would come forward with information they believed should be published .
Assange said that the site , which currently operates with a small dedicated team but has a network of about 800 volunteers , had a "" backlog "" of more material which only "" just scratched the surface "" .
While he would not be drawn into commenting on the nature of the material , he said that the organisation held "" several million files "" that "" concern every country in the world with a population over 1 million "" .
He said the site had undergone a "" publishing haitus "" since December during a period of re - engineering .
Assange suggested a clear step - up of operations and said that there were difficulties in changing from a small to large organisation while ensuring it would still be able to work in a secure way .
"" My greatest fear is that we will be too successful too fast and wo n't be able to do justice to the material , "" he said .
He said that from past experience the organisation was expecting more material to add to the backlog .
He said that after the site leaked details of one incident that killed 51 people in Afghanistan , "" we received substantial increase in submissions "" .
"" Courage is contagious , "" he added .
"" Sources are encouraged by the opportunities they see in front of them . ""
He said that a further 15,000 potentially sensitive reports had been excluded from today 's leak and were being were being reviewed further .
He said some of this material would be released once it was deemed safe to do so .
He added that the majority of this material was threat reports and that it included more than 50 embassy cables .
Assange 's plans will cause concern in government agencies , which argue that the site 's leaks are "" irresponsible "" and pose a threat to military operations in Afghanistan and elsewhere .
But Assange and said that the site applied "" harm minimisation "" procedures before publishing material .
"" We do n't do things in an ad hoc way , "" he said .
We 've tried hard to make sure that it puts no innocents at harm .
This material is over seven months old so it 's of no operational significance , although it 's significant for journalistic investigation . ""
Assange said that although the raw material was there , the real work would now begin to make sense of its scale .
He said that a single report of an incident on 9 August 2006 – part of Operation Medusa – had a kill count of 181 but from reports of the official death count , the two figures did n't tally .
"" We add up all these deaths and we get around 80 .
The other 101 are unexplained . ""
He added that there was no single issue brought to light by the material .
"" There is no single damning , single person , single mass killing .
That 's not the real story .
The real story is that it 's war .
It 's the continuing small events , the continuing deaths of civilians , children and soldiers . ""
Assange said that although he did not believe that the material was a threat to the US military operation in Afghanistan it was clear that it "" will shape a new understanding of the war "" and made "" less room to gloss over what has happened in the past "" .
He added that although seven months had passed since the last revealed file , he did not believe that changes in military strategy made by Barack Obama necessarily meant a change on the ground .
Assange said that there was a problem with the way operations were reported from the ground . ""
Military units when self - reporting speak in another language , redefining civil casualties as insurgent casualties ...
When US military report on other US military they tend to be more frank .
When they report on ally military units , for the example the UK or the Polish , they 're even more likely to be frank .
But when they report on the Taliban then all evil comes out .
Internal reporting is not accurate .
The cover - up starts at the ground .
The whole task is to make the war more palatable . ""
He added : "" What we see is the US army as a huge boat that 's hard to turn around .
It 's hard to have a new policy and enact change .
[ Change ] has to come from the bottom not the top . """

2010-07-26,"The founder of the whistleblowing website Wikileaks today defended his decision to publish thousands of secret US military files about the war in Afghanistan , faced with criticism from the White House for placing troops in danger .
Julian Assange said his organisation was currently working through a backlog of further secret material and was expecting a "" substantial increase in submissions "" from whistleblowers after one of the biggest leaks in US military history .
He said the files showed that "" thousands "" of war crimes may have been committed in Afghanistan .
The documents have revealed unreported incidents of Afghan civilian killings and information about secret operations against Taliban leaders , as well as highlighting US fears that Pakistan 's intelligence service was aiding the Afghan uprising .
Assange rejected accusations that the leak had compromised America 's national security .
"" We are familiar with groups whose abuse we expose attempting to criticise the messenger to distract from the power of the message . ""
"" We do n't see any difference in the White House 's response to this case to the other groups that we have exposed .
We have tried hard to make sure that this material does not put innocents at harm .
All the material is over seven months old so is of no current operational consequence , even though it may be of very significant investigative consequence . ""
Speaking at a press conference at the Frontline Club in central London , Assange said that the 90,000 leaked US military documents about the war in Afghanistan would help shape understanding of the past six years of fighting .
On the question of whether crimes had been committed , he said : "" It is up to a court to decide clearly whether something is in the end a crime .
That said , on the face of it , there does appear to be evidence of war crimes in this material . ""
Earlier , the White House said the leaks "" could put the lives of Americans and our partners at risk , and threaten our national security "" .
It said that Wikileaks had made no effort to contact US security services , but insisted that what it called the "" irresponsible leaks "" would not "" impact our ongoing commitment to deepen our partnerships with Afghanistan and Pakistan ; to defeat our common enemies ; and to support the aspirations of the Afghan and Pakistani people "" .
In London , the security minister Lady Neville - Jones , former chair of the UK 's joint intelligence committee , described the leak as "" really serious stuff "" and questioned how the documents had been obtained .
"" We do n't know how they got that material – it may be a combination of leaking of documents , but also one strongly suspects they have hacked into systems as well . ""
This is a very , very big story .
But if you stop to think about it for a moment , military systems have to be secure because people 's lives are at stake . ""
The Guardian , along with the New York Times and German weekly Der Spiegel , were given access to the archive and have spent several weeks investigating the logs .
In order not to compromise intelligence sources or to put forces at risk , the Guardian has only published a selection of the logs , relating to significant events .
The White House national security adviser , General Jim Jones , stressed that the documents related to a period from January 2004 to December 2009 , during the administration of President George Bush and before President Obama ordered a "" surge "" in Afghanistan . ""
President Obama announced a new strategy with a substantial increase in resources for Afghanistan , and increased focus on al - Qaida and Taliban safe havens in Pakistan , precisely because of the grave situation that had developed over several years , "" he said .
Labour leadership candidate David Miliband , said the "" war logs "" showed that the war could not be won by military means alone .
"" We can not kill our way out of an insurgency .
Instead , the battle for power is fought in the minds of the local population , insurgents and western publics .
The purpose of military effort and civilian improvement is to create the conditions for political settlement .
"" There is now a race against time to persuade the Afghan people that the correct strategy is in place and show our own people it can succeed .
Better Afghan security forces , better police , better schooling and economic opportunities are all vital but not enough .
None of them are durable or possible without a political settlement .
"" Miliband , the former foreign secretary , said any peace settlement "" must include the vanquished as well as the victors "" and urged the government in Kabul to involve Afghans in "" defining a political endgame "" .
Elsewhere , experts analysed the damage inflicted on the war effort by the leak .
British military expert professor Michael Clarke , director of the Royal United Services Institute thinktank , said the leaked files were less damaging than the Abu Ghraib Iraqi prisoner abuse scandal but would prove awkward for politicians .
"" There is no doubt that the leaks are politically pretty damaging .
The papers give an impression of a lack of military discrimination in how operations were conducted .
They are also appearing at the worst possible time , particularly in the United States , because people are looking for an exit strategy .
This is old bad news at a new bad time . ""
In the US , the chairman of the Senate foreign relations committee and former Democrat presidential candidate , John Kerry , responded to the leak with a direct challenge to the administration . ""
However illegally these documents came to light , they raise serious questions about the reality of America 's policy toward Pakistan and Afghanistan , "" he said .
"" Those policies are at a critical stage and these documents may very well underscore the stakes and make the calibrations needed to get the policy right . """
2010-07-27,"Of all the questions raised by the Afghanistan war logs , perhaps the most intriguing is this :
why would an organisation as independent - minded and disdainful of the traditional media as WikiLeaks seek out those very media as partners rather than going it alone ?
My necessarily speculative answer is that WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange , who 's made a speciality of revealing embarrassing governmental secrets , learned something important earlier this year .
That 's when he briefly caused a sensation by releasing video of a US Apache helicopter firing on Iraqi civilians , killing ( among others ) a Reuters photographer and his driver .
The lesson : shocking material and a flair for public relations may be enough to get you noticed .
But if it 's credibility you want , then old - fashioned news organisations still have something to offer .
WikiLeaks made some 92,000 documents about the war in Afghanistan available to the Guardian , the New York Times and Der Spiegel a month ago , giving professional journalists time to sort , vet and craft narratives from jargon - laden field reports compiled by US officials .
The documents add sickening details to the broad outlines of what we already knew : that major elements of Pakistan 's intelligence forces are in bed with the Taliban ; that chaos and confusion in Afghanistan has led to civilian casualties ; and that among the burdens the Afghan people must bear is a corrupt and ineffective government .
The Obama administration has lambasted WikiLeaks for releasing the documents , arguing that the situation has improved since 2009 , when the most recent of the official reports were compiled .
But no one has questioned the authenticity of the documents themselves , even if the reliability of the information contained therein appears to be of variable quality .
In effect , Assange chose to act as Daniel Ellsberg , the insider who leaked the Pentagon Papers – the US government 's own secret history of the Vietnam war – to the Washington Post and the New York Times .
But it was just a few months ago that Assange tried out the role of Ben Bradlee , the Washington Post executive editor who published those papers .
In April , you may recall , WikiLeaks uploaded two versions of the Apache helicopter video .
One was an edited , 18-minute version that it titled Collateral Murder , which begins with a quote from George Orwell : "" Political language is designed to make lies sound truthful and murder respectable , and to give the appearance of solidity to pure wind . ""
The other , 39 minutes long , was raw footage with no commentary .
The American secretary of defence , Robert Gates , denounced the video as having been taken out of context .
No surprise there .
But as Raffi Khatchadourian notes in a profile of Assange published in the New Yorker , the media turned Gates 's way within days of the release .
And in fact , when you watch the video and listen to the Americans on board the helicopter , you can see that the crew members believed , rightly or wrongly , that they were firing on a legitimate target .
Even the comedian Stephen Colbert , in an interview with Assange , dropped his rightwing - blowhard persona momentarily to make a serious point , calling the edited version "" emotional manipulation "" and telling his guest : "" There are armed men in the group .
They did find a rocket - propelled grenade among the group .
The Reuters photographers who were regrettably killed were not identified as photographers .
And you have edited this tape , and you have given it a title called Collateral Murder .
That 's not leaking .
That 's a pure editorial . ""
( An aside for British readers not familiar with Colbert and thus puzzled at my quoting a comedian : it is a sad but undeniable reality that the two most incisive American media critics today may well be Colbert and his fellow fake anchorman Jon Stewart . )
Around the time that the video was released , hubris among the WikiLeakers was thick .
In the New Yorker piece , we hear from a friend and supporter of Assange 's , a Dutch hacker named Rop Gonggrijp , who smugly says that "" we are not the press "" and "" the source is no longer dependent on finding a journalist who may or may not do something good with his document "" .
Yet here we are , several months later , and Assange is acting very much like an old - fashioned source , seeking out journalists even as he uploads the raw source documents to the web .
In the felicitous phrase of New York University journalism professor Jay Rosen , WikiLeaks is "" a stateless news organisation "" .
But as the New Yorker piece makes clear , Assange and his fellow activists are less interested in news than in making a political impact .
And it is an organisation only in the loosest sense of the term .
Given those realities , it makes sense for them to work with journalists rather than to posit themselves in opposition to the media . ""
WikiLeaks was soaking , drowning in data , "" Rosen 's NYU colleague Clay Shirky tells David Carr of the New York Times .
"" What they needed was someone who could tell a story .
They needed someone who could bring accuracy and political context to what was being revealed .
"" What I am suggesting is not that old media have triumphed over the new .
Rather , I 'm simply pointing out that each has its place in the media ecosystem .
WikiLeaks , with its singleminded focus on casting about for whistleblowers and protecting their identity through encryption and secrecy , can obtain material that eludes established news organisations .
And professional journalists can vet , make sense of and impart credibility to that material in ways that not all new - media ventures ( at least not WikiLeaks ) can .
The result is a powerful indictment of the war in Afghanistan – and a major challenge to Barack Obama .
Back in character , Colbert asked Assange : "" What is the purpose of letting the public know ?
It 's like you 're saying it 's better to know than not to know .
Have you not heard ignorance is bliss ?
"" It 's way too late for that now ."
2010-07-27,"Julian Assange 's remarkable service to truth , transparency and democracy are appreciated on the ground in Afghanistan .
Yet there was little in the WikiLeaks revelations that came as a surprise to Afghans and the local media mostly refrained from commenting , limiting their effort to reporting news of the publication of secret files .
Only a few papers tried to take a clear stance in reaction to the story .
This silence could be interpreted in different ways .
Given that the WikiLeaks revelations primarily compromise Afghanistan 's key ally in Washington by showing that the US army has little regard for civilian casualties , the papers might have feared backlash by the Kabul administration and hence refrained from comment to avoid confrontation .
Alternatively , the silence might have a mundane explanation : nothing in the published secret files was news to Afghans .
If anything , the WikiLeaks files substantiated Afghan authorities ' much - repeated concern that the neighbouring states played a key role in systematically undermining Nato 's efforts in Afghanistan .
In the words of presidential spokesman Wahid Omer , "" the sheer number of the reports might be surprising , but not so their content "" .
The spokesman added : "" There are two issues that appear repeatedly in the secret files and that are a matter of concern to us : the issue of civilian casualties and the role of the Pakistani intelligence ISI in actively undermining stability in Afghanistan . ""
Echoing his words , the pro - government Hewad daily said the WikiLeaks revelations substantiated the Afghan authorities ' views that the root - causes of terrorism were not Afghan , but lay elsewhere , outside of the country .
The paper added that the reports prove President Hamid Karzai right that little has been done to protect Afghan civilians ' lives and property .
Among the few papers that commented was the independent daily Hasht - e Sobh .
In an editorial entitled "" The secrets that were not so secret after all "" , the paper said : "" Despite much international uproar , hype and fuss , there is hardly anything in the reports that we have not yet known about . ""
Islamabad 's active and determined support for the Taliban and other terrorist groups that create horrific violence in Afghanistan ; the fact that the Taliban have now gained access to advanced weaponry or that the ISI staff attend terrorists ' meetings and provide them with logistic , financial and moral support are issues that ordinary people and Afghan authorities have long suspected and known about it .
In the words of Hasht - e Sobh : "" If anything , Pakistani authorities have hardly tried to conceal all this . ""
For Afghans , the more pertinent question that arises from the WikiLeaks revelations is the degree in which Kabul 's international allies have been aware of Pakistan 's involvement in actively undermining Nato 's success in Afghanistan .
Hasht - e Sobh was sceptical about Washington 's innocence : "" To assume that by carrying out such secret activities Pakistan has been trying to fool Washington is naive if not downright silly . ""
But what about the rest of the Nato countries whose troops are currently based in Afghanistan ?
In the words of Hasht - e Sobh : "" Bearing in mind that throughout the many years of the jihad against the Soviets the international community has been working together and sharing intelligence , and the fact that they had chosen Pakistan to act on their behalf and fight the Soviets on the ground in Afghanistan , we find it hard to believe that the revelations have taken them fully by surprise . ""
Like Hasht - e Sobh , the Afghan daily , Khedmatgar , suspected that contrary to all appearances , the publishing of the secret files was in fact approved by Washington and represented an attempt to pressurise Islamabad , forcing it to cut ties to terrorist groups .
The paper said that prior to the WikiLeaks revelations , US secretary of state Hillary Clinton had publicly announced that the leaders of al - Qaida and the Haqqani network were hiding in Pakistan .
The paper insinuated that such announcements were a preparation for the subsequent WikiLeaks revelations .
In other words , Washington 's public denunciation of WikiLeaks was only a cover for a US publicity campaign to morally undermine Pakistan , forcing it to come clean about its game of double standards .
Given that of late the Afghan government and the Afghan people in general have been held singularly responsible for the failure of democracy in Afghanistan , the WikiLeaks reports are both a source of concern and relief for most Afghans .
Concern because the reports show that the outcome of the war is likely to be shaped largely by hostile regional powers with little interest in a stable Afghanistan supported by the international community .
Relief because the reports show evidently that the idea it is the Afghans ' warrior - like nature and their culture of extremism that is solely responsible for the violence does n't stand scrutiny .
Such cultural - relativism theories were increasingly gaining ground , particularly in leftwing and liberal press in the US and European countries .
But as WikiLeaks reports show , the truth is that though Afghan corruption is certainly undermining stability , the financial and logistical support that has led to the killing of foreign troops and disillusionment of the public in the west comes from states who have strategic reasons for turning Nato 's mission in Afghanistan into a failure .
In other words , even though Afghans play a role in their own misery , the active support for the war comes from elsewhere .
Perhaps the most important aspect of the WikiLeaks revelations is that they show the Afghan conflict is still international in character and the success or failure of Nato 's mission is likely to be determined by powers that operate outside of Kabul .
Afghanistan has always paid a high price for its strategic geo - political position , and this , too , is old news to Afghans ."
2010-07-30,"WikiLeaks and its editor - in - chief , Julian Assange , have come under attack from US officials and their allies for potentially endangering informants and troops in Afghanistan by posting the texts of thousands of leaked war logs .
The US defence secretary , Robert Gates , claimed in Washington : "" The battlefield consequences are potentially severe and dangerous for our troops , our allies and Afghan partners , and may well damage our relationships and reputation in that key part of the world . ""
Gates said sensitive intelligence which could endanger informants had been widely distributed down to junior level in the US army , in a loose policy which might now have to be reconsidered .
"" We endeavour to push access to sensitive battlefield information down to where it is most useful – on the front lines – where as a practical matter there are fewer restrictions and controls than at rear headquarters , "" he said .
"" In the wake of this incident , it will be a real challenge to strike the right balance between security and providing our frontline troops the information they need . ""
Admiral Mike Mullen , who chairs the joint chiefs of staff , said : "" Mr Assange can say whatever he likes about the greater good he thinks he and his source are doing , but the truth is they might already have on their hands the blood of some young soldier or that of an Afghan family . ""
The Afghan president , Hamid Karzai , called the disclosure of the names of Afghans who had co - operated with Nato and US forces "" irresponsible and shocking "" .
He said in Kabul : "" Whether those individuals acted legitimately or illegitimately in providing information to the Nato forces , their lives will be in danger . ""
WikiLeaks withheld some 15 , 000 intelligence reports to protect informants .
But some of the posted texts contain details of Afghans who have dealt with the coalition .
Assange said today that they had tried to comply with a private White House request to redact the names of informants before publication .
But the US authorities had refused to assist them .
He said in a statement : "" Secretary Gates speaks about hypothetical blood , but the grounds of Iraq and Afghanistan are covered with real blood .
"" Thousands of children and adults had been killed and the US could have announced a broad inquiry into these killings , "" but he decided to treat these issues with contempt '' .
He said : "" This behaviour is unacceptable .
We will continue to expose abuses by this administration and others . ""
Meanwhile , both US and UK authorities remained silent about the disclosures in the 92,000 war log files that hundreds of civilians have been killed or wounded by coalition forces in unreported or previously under - reported incidents .
The Ministry of Defence withdrew promises to make an official statement about US allegations that two units of British troops had caused exceptional loss of civilian life .
MoD sources said that at least 15 of the 21 alleged cases had now been confirmed , but they were unable to say what investigations had subsequently taken place , or when they would now make a statement .
A detachment of the Coldstream Guards was newly arrived in Kabul when innocent civilians were shot on four separate occasions in October - November 2007 .
Several different companies of Royal Marine commands are alleged to have shot civilians who came "" too close "" to convoys or patrols on eight occasions in Helmand province during the six - month period ending in March 2008 .
Sources said that the then Labour foreign secretary , David Miliband , was so concerned about civilian deaths that he helped push forward a UN resolution in 2008 , setting up an UN system to monitor such casualties .
But it does not function effectively , according to the independent Human Rights Watch .
The United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan reported 828 civilian deaths in 2008 , thanks to "" pro - government forces "" , saying force protection incidents , "" are of continuing concern "" , where innocent drivers , car passengers or motorcyclists , are shot by passing troops .
The US authorities are concentrating their firepower on leakers and their friends .
Gates said the FBI had been called in to widen the criminal investigation into Private Bradley Manning , who is in military custody charged with leaking a classified video showing Apache pilots gunning down two Reuters cameramen in Baghdad who they believed might be insurgents .
Manning is being moved from a military jail in Kuwait to Quantico , Virginia , and the FBI will now be able to investigate civilians such as Assange , for possible conspiracy offences .
Assange 's whereabouts were unknown today .

This article was amended on 2 August 2010 .
The original referred to Qauntico , Maryland .
This has been corrected ."
2010-07-31,"WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange has hit out at the US military , saying that it bears the ultimate responsibility for any deaths of Afghan informers in the wake of the publication by his organisation of 75,000 leaked files of American army secrets .
Assange and WikiLeaks , the whistleblowers ' website that publishes leaked documents from around the world , have come under increasing fire amid accusations that publishing the files put people 's lives at risk .
But in an interview with the Observer , Assange said the blame for any deaths lay squarely with US military authorities .
"" We are appalled that the US military was so lackadaisical with its Afghan sources .
Just appalled .
We are a source protection organisation that specialises in protecting sources and have a perfect record from our activities , "" he said .
WikiLeaks has been accused of disclosing the names of Afghan collaborators who may now be subject to reprisals .
Critics also say that the information it published is unchecked and some of it may be of dubious provenance .
But Assange responded to those claims by saying : "" This material was available to every soldier and contractor in Afghanistan …
It 's the US military that deserves the blame for not giving due diligence to its informers . ""
Assange insisted there was no evidence that anyone had been put at risk and that WikiLeaks had held sensitive information back and taken great care not to put people at risk . ""
Well , anything might happen , but nothing has happened .
And we are not about to leave the field of doing good simply because harm might happen …
In our four - year publishing history no one has ever come to physical harm that we are aware of or that anyone has alleged . ""
However , he did concede that , if it was proven someone had been killed or injured because of the leak , then WikiLeaks would consider changing the way it operates .
"" We will review our procedures , "" he said .
But that is unlikely to defuse the growing international row .
Last week the Afghan president , Hamid Karzai , branded Assange "" irresponsible "" .
The US defence secretary , Robert Gates , said he might have "" blood on his hands "" .
At the same time US authorities are broadening their investigation into how the leak happened .
The suspected leaker , Private Bradley Manning , is in custody .
He has already been charged with passing on a video shot in Iraq of a US helicopter attack and 150,000 classified diplomatic cables .
He is also the main suspect in the Afghan "" war logs "" leak .
Now , according to a report in the New York Times , investigators are probing whether Manning acted alone or with others .
The focus of the inquiry was on a group of people in Cambridge , near Boston in Massachusetts , who might prove to be the link between Manning and WikiLeaks .
Assange said he was undeterred by the attacks , and that traditional journalism had vacated a space into which WikiLeaks was stepping .
"" We are creating a space behind us that permits a form of journalism which lives up to the name that journalism has always tried to establish for itself , "" he said ."
2010-08-11,"According to Alfred Harmsworth , founder of both the Daily Mirror and Daily Mail , news is "" what somebody somewhere wants to suppress ; the rest is advertising "" .
By this yardstick , Harmsworth would have agreed that the WikiLeaks Afghan war diary is a remarkable news event .
But he would have had no truck with the argument mounted by WikiLeaks ' founder Julian Assange that the move represents a triumph of transparency over interpretation . ""
Hard news catches readers , "" Harmworth believed . ""
Features hold them . ""
He knew what he was talking about .
Without the analyses , comment and explanation provided by experienced journalists , the documents would have sat on the WikiLeaks website attracting the interest only of those with a fervid interest in the conflict .
The White House and the Pentagon would have barely stirred .
On an infinitesimally smaller scale , I have my own example of the limits of data journalism .
I 'm taking part in a project called Help Me Investigate , a collaborative venture that aims to pursue matters of public interest , and I recently visited the town hall in Brighton to inspect the spending records of parliamentary candidates in the Brighton Pavilion constituency during the general election .
The council staff were perfectly accommodating and pleasant .
In other areas of the country , it has been reported , there is some confusion over what we are allowed to see and to record .
I think this stems from the fact that , up to now , very little interest has been paid to this frankly less than incendiary topic .
A desk was found for me in a quiet corner , I was handed a ringbinder bulging with paperwork and I was left to get on with it .
Did I uncover evidence of cupidity among our would - be legislators ?
Sadly , no .
It will come as no surprise to learn that the main candidates spent their largest sums on flyers , leaflets , posters and other bumf destined for the landfill .
Unless you are the type to be shocked by the fact that Green candidate ( and election winner )
Caroline Lucas received a non - cash donation from the Political Animal Lobby or that Tory candidate Charlotte Vere forked out £ 41 for Google Ads , there is nothing in these documents to stir the blood .
That 's neither here nor there , say the proponents of data journalism .
The fact that the expenses forms start life as Excel documents means it should n't be beyond the wit of our electoral services offices to store the results electronically and upload them onto a site where anybody with sufficient curiosity can inspect them .
Well , yes .
But do n't imagine that this exercise in itself will be sufficient to hold our lawmakers to account .
The Apathetic Tendency is probably the largest single political group in the country and its members have every right to expect the more engaged among us to do their donkey work for them .
To take an example from the world of finance and business : for a small fee you can sign up to Companies House Direct and fill your days inspecting the accounts of businesses registered in the United Kingdom .
Will you do this ?
Of course not – you have a life .
Quite sensibly , you will leave it to financial journalists to sift a company 's data , compare results and call up the financial director to ask impertinent questions .
Data sites are proliferating and many of them are excellent – UN Data , data.gov , and the Guardian 's own Datablog among them .
But consider this : Julian Assange did not upload the classified documents and wait for the world to beat a path to his door .
He entered into a partnership with media outlets he knew would give prominence to the material .
Like Alfred Harmsworth before him , Assange understands that without the oxygen of publicity , data dies unread ."
2010-08-13,"A group that campaigns for press freedom has become the latest organisation to condemn WikiLeaks for publication of the leaked Afghanistan war logs .
In an open letter to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange , Reporters Without Borders accused him of "" incredible irresponsibility "" for publishing the tens of thousands of documents "" indiscriminately "" .
WikiLeaks initially withheld around 15,000 of more than 92,000 reports to protect informants but Assange revealed yesterday it is preparing to publish them , once the organisation has finished checking them all .
The letter from Reporters Without Borders ' secretary - general , Jean - François Julliard , and the organisation 's Washington representative , Clothilde Le Coz , acknowledged that WikiLeaks had played a "" useful role "" in the past , citing its publication of a video of the killing of two employees of the Reuters news agency and other civilians by US military personnel in Baghdad in July 2007 .
But it criticised Assange for putting the lives of people who had collaborated with US and Nato forces at risk and providing ammunition for governments to put the internet under surveillance .
"" Revealing the identity of hundreds of people who collaborated with the coalition in Afghanistan is highly dangerous , "" they wrote .
"" It would not be hard for the Taliban and other armed groups to use these documents to draw up a list of people for targeting in deadly revenge attacks . ""
They said that the publication of the documents "" reflects a real problem of methodology and , therefore , of credibility "" .
On Twitter , WikiLeaks responded by deriding Reporters Without Borders as "" Reporters San Fact "" , accusing the organisation of issuing "" some idiot statement , based on a bunch of quotes we never made "" .
Assange said yesterday WikiLeaks was about halfway through reviewing the remaining 15,000 documents but gave no timeframe for their publication .
The Pentagon , which has demanded that WikiLeaks delete the cache of secret US military files , reacted with anger to the prospect of further documents being published .
Pentagon press secretary Geoff Morrell said : "" It would compound a mistake that has already put far too many lives at risk , "" he said .
The Pentagon believes it has identified the documents in question and Morrell told the Washington Post they were "" potentially more explosive , more sensitive "" .
Reporters Without Borders ' criticism follows a letter sent to WikiLeaks by five human rights organisations , including Amnesty International and the Open Society Institute , expressing their concerns about the biggest leak in US military history .
Assange , replied to the letter by asking the groups concerned to help WikiLeaks redact the names .
He also threatened to expose Amnesty if it refused to provide staff to help with the task , according to the Wall Street Journal .
The initial documents were shown to the Guardian , the New York Times and the German weekly Der Spiegel and they published edited extracts with details of the individuals removed .

2010-08-22,"Julian Assange , the secretive founder of the whistle - blowing WikiLeaks website , has today denied allegations of rape and sexual molestation and insisted he has never had non - consensual sex .
The 39-year - old Australian â€ “ whose website was behind the biggest leak of US military documents in history
â€ “ was the subject of a Swedish arrest warrant on Friday after separate complaints made by two women .
But prosecutors withdrew the warrant to arrest him on suspicion of rape within 24 hours , saying the accusations against him lacked substance .
In a brief statement , the chief prosecutor , Eva Finne , said : "" I do n't think there is reason to suspect that he has committed rape "" .
Karin Rosander , from the Swedish Prosecution Authority , said Assange , believed to be in Sweden , remained suspected of molestation â€ “ a less serious charge that would not lead to an arrest warrant .
"" The prosecutor has n't made a decision [ on that count ] .
The investigation continues , "" she said .
Assange responded to news of the warrant through WikiLeaks ' Twitter page , saying : "" The charges are without basis and their issue at this moment is deeply disturbing . ""
The claims come as WikiLeaks prepares to release a new batch of 15,000 classified US documents related to the Afghanistan war .
The Pentagon has claimed the documents could endanger US soldiers and their Afghan helpers .
Assange has been in Sweden seeking international legal protection for his website under Swedish law after WikiLeaks previously published 90,000 leaked documents about US military activities in Afghanistan covering from 2004 - 2010 .
The Pentagon has demanded that WikiLeaks returns all the leaked documents and removes them from the internet .
Assange 's supporters claim he is the victim of a smear campaign .
The Swedish Aftonbladet newspaper quoted him as saying he had not had sex with anyone in a way that was n't consensual .
The allegations had damaged the site because "" WikiLeaks ' enemies will keep trumpeting things even after they have been denied "" , he was quoted as saying .
He said he did not know the reasons behind the allegations but added that he had "" been warned that , for example , the Pentagon plans to use dirty tricks to spoil things for [ WikiLeaks ] "" .
At the time of the warrant , police said Assange was wanted for raping a woman in Stockholm last weekend and sexually assaulting another woman in the town of Enkoping , 40 miles from the capital , three days later ."
2010-08-22,"The founder of WikiLeaks , Julian Assange , was himself the subject of a rapidly spreading online story when news cascaded across the internet for several hours at the weekend mistakenly saying he was being sought in Sweden on rape charges .
Before Stockholm 's chief prosecutor made clear on Saturday afternoon that Assange was in fact neither charged with rape nor due to be arrested , the story had spread , generating more than 1,200 articles , available through internet news search , that received more than 1 m hits .
"" It was 7 am when a friend who is Swedish and has been out on the net told me about the allegations , "" Assange told Stockholm daily newspaper Aftonbladet , which has hired him as a columnist : "" It was shocking .
I have been accused of various things in recent years , but nothing so serious as this . ""
He said none of his sexual relations had ever been built on anything other than totally consensual activity .
The preliminary allegation , made on Friday night , and not further investigated at that stage , was apparently leaked by police to a tabloid in Stockholm , which published dramatic claims on Saturday morning that Assange was to be arrested .
The Swedish Prosecution Authority todaysaid an "" on - call "" prosecutor issued an arrest warrant for Assange late on Friday , only to see it revoked the next day by a higher - ranked prosecutor who found no grounds to suspect him of rape . ""
The prosecutor who took over the case had more information , and that is why she made a different assessment than the on - call prosecutor , "" said Karin Rosander , a spokeswoman for the authority .
One of two women involved told Aftonbladet in an interview published today that she had never intended Assange to be charged with rape .
She was quoted as saying : "" It is quite wrong that we were afraid of him .
He is not violent and I do not feel threatened by him . ""
Speaking anonymously , she said each had had voluntary relations with Assange : "" The responsibility for what happened to me and the other girl lies with a man who had attitude problems with women . ""
Sources close to the woman said that issues arose during the relationships about Assange 's willingness to use condoms .
In her interview , she dismissed the idea , seized on by many conspiracy theorists that ' dirty tricks ' lay behind the rape allegations , because of WikiLeaks ' defiance of the US government .
She said : "" The charges against Assange are of course not orchestrated by the Pentagon . ""
Swedish prosecutors said today that a decision would be taken early this week whether to continue investigations into lesser possible charges against the nomadic Assange , which he also denies .
Some of WikiLeaks ' computer servers are currently based in Sweden , and he has sought to shelter under Sweden 's journalistic source protection laws for the organisation 's crusade to promote worldwide leaking of information .
Assange and his co - activists at WikiLeaks have refused US defense department demands that they cease publishing thousands of leaked military documents about the US war in Afghanistan , and making accusations of murder of civilians .
US generals have accused WikiLeaks of wholesale leaking that does too little to protect informants and the identities of Afghan villagers who co - operated with US and British forces .
Assange has riposted that it is US soldiers who have "" blood on their hands "" and he is seeking to edit sensitive files before posting them online .
A former US army intelligence analyst , Bradley Manning , is in military custody at Quantico , Virginia , accused of turning over to outsiders a huge quantity of classified material which subsequently appeared on WikiLeaks .
Bradley reportedly told fellow computer enthusiasts that he was horrified by what he found ."
2010-08-23,"Swedish prosecutors say they hope to announce today whether they will pursue two cases of alleged sexual assault involving Julian Assange , the founder of WikiLeaks .
Prosecutors say they are considering a complaint of sexual molestation from one woman , Ms A , who has previously been an active supporter of Assange .
They say they are also still considering whether any offence may have been committed against a woman known as Ms W , who met Assange at a seminar in Stockholm this month , and who originally alleged rape , a charge which was soon dropped .
Assange has emphatically denied committing any offence against either woman .
In a case mired in conflicting claims , only a few essential events are clear : •
On Friday last week , Ms A and Ms W together approached police in Stockholm and reported that they had been sexually assaulted by Assange .
•
Both women reported that they had been involved in consensual sexual relationships with Assange , but each reported a separate non - consensual incident of a similar character in which Assange allegedly had sex with them without using a condom .
•
Both alleged incidents were very recent .
The alleged molestation of Ms A was said to have occurred on the morning of Saturday 14 August .
The alleged rape of Ms W was said to have occurred on the morning of Tuesday 17 August .
•
The Swedish police passed a report to prosecutors , who issued a formal warrant for Assange 's arrest on suspicion of rape .
On the following day , the charge of rape was dropped and the warrant was rescinded .
It is understood that before going to the police , both women asked Assange to have a health check to reassure them , and that Assange declined to do so .
Ms W is said to have visited a hospital on Thursday before going to the police .
One source who is closely involved said neither of them had originally wanted the case prosecuted ; that Ms W had wanted to report the alleged rape to police without their pursuing it , and that Ms A had gone with her to give her moral support and then become embroiled with the police , who had insisted on passing a report to prosecutors .
Neither the police nor the prosecutor has spoken to Assange to record his version of events .
The fact that a warrant had been issued for his arrest was rapidly leaked to a Swedish newspaper .
It remains unclear why the prosecutor first issued and then withdrew the arrest warrant .
The prosecutor 's office has said that the original issuing of the warrant was not a mistake , and that it was cancelled when it received new information .
The chief prosecutor , Eva Finne , yesterdayyesterday told the Guardian : "" I will analyse this matter thoroughly and make all necessary legal judgements , to be able to decide on the progress of the investigation .
My estimation is that I can give information later this week , probably tomorrow . ""
Ms A spoke at the weekend to the Swedish newspaper Aftonbladet and said she was not frightened of Assange and that he was not violent .
She said she had only ever alleged sexual molestation , not rape , and added : "" In both cases , what started out as voluntary sex subsequently developed into an assault .
The other woman wanted to report rape .
I gave my story as testimony to her story and to support her .
We stand by the information . ""
In a weekend interview with the same paper , for which he is due to become a regular columnist , Assange said : "" I never , neither in Sweden nor in any other country , had sex with someone in a way that is not built on total consent from both sides . ""
He said nobody had asked him for his side of the story but that he needed to know more about the accusations before he could discuss them in any detail .
In subsequent tweets and interviews , Assange suggested that the timing of the allegations against him was "" deeply disturbing "" .
He told al - Jazeera on Sunday : "" It is clearly a smear campaign … The only question is who was involved .
We can have some suspicions about who would benefit , but without direct evidence , I would not be willing to make a direct allegation . ""
He said he had been warned that the US Pentagon was planning to use dirty tricks to spoil things for WikiLeaks .
In her interview with Aftonbladet , Ms A said : "" The charges against Assange are , of course , not orchestrated by the Pentagon .
The responsibility for what happened to me and the other girl lies with a man who has a twisted attitude to women and a problem with taking ' no ' for an answer . ""
Assange attracted global attention last month when he posted a database of US military records from Afghanistan on the WikiLeaks website .
The Guardian , the New York Times and Der Spiegel published stories which were based on the records .
US military authorities were highly critical of Assange 's actions ."

2010-10-04,"Where do you draw the line between free speech and national security ?
At what point do issues of justice trump potential threats to soldiers , translators and informants ?
Last Thursday , Julian Assange answered these questions and more in a debate pitting him against the Times columnist David Aaronovitch at London 's City University that was sold out within hours , with TV crews and photographers flying in from around the world .
Assange found himself having to defend WikiLeaks , in particular the leaking of documents detailing Nato 's actions in Afghanistan .
How would he feel if any Afghan citizens were killed as a result ?
Assange replied that the Pentagon had not identified a single person who had been harmed .
But he added , somewhat chillingly : "" I 'm not scared to make mistakes or be blamed , or even accidentally cause harm in the cause of justice . ""
The circumstances surrounding the debate were bizarre .
Assange had contacted Index on Censorship 's chief executive , John Kampfner , through an intermediary : he would be in London , would Index be interested in hosting a talk by him ?
Assange was told he would have to debate with one of his sternest critics .
He agreed but had his own stipulations
: no press photographers at the event ; it could only be filmed by a camerawoman sanctioned by Index and the university ; there would be no press calls , or live stream ( this caused considerable consternation on Twitter ) .
How could Index , the UK 's leading free expression organisation , keep out broadcast media ?
In the end we decided it was worth going ahead .
People in the lecture theatre would be free to tweet and liveblog .
The days leading up to the debate were tense : Assange went awol , and 36 hours before the event we were seriously considering cancelling .
After a day and a half of nervous phonecalls , however , he emerged and was led through the university 's back corridors , avoiding the waiting cameras .
As the debate ended , the photographers and film crews were allowed in .
A sensible compromise had been reached .
But the situation demonstrated the tightrope that free - speech campaigners walk every day .

2010-10-14,"The whistleblowing group WikiLeaks claims that it has had its funding blocked and that it is the victim of financial warfare by the US government .
Moneybookers , a British - registered internet payment company that collects WikiLeaks donations , emailed the organisation to say it had closed down its account because it had been put on an official US watchlist and on an Australian government blacklist .
The apparent blacklisting came a few days after the Pentagon publicly expressed its anger at WikiLeaks and its founder , Australian citizen Julian Assange , for obtaining thousands of classified military documents about the war in Afghanistan , in one of the US army 's biggest leaks of information .
The documents caused a sensation when they were made available to the Guardian , the New York Times and German magazine Der Spiegel , revealing hitherto unreported civilian casualties .
WikiLeaks defied Pentagon calls to return the war logs and destroy all copies .
Instead , it has been reported that it intends to release an even larger cache of military documents , disclosing other abuses in Iraq .
Moneybookers moved against WikiLeaks on 13 August , according to the correspondence , less than a week after the Pentagon made public threats of reprisals against the organisation .
Moneybookers wrote to Assange : "" Following an audit of your account by our security department , we must advise that your account has been closed … to comply with money laundering or other investigations conducted by government authorities . ""
When Assange emailed to ask what the problem was , he says he was told in response by Daniel Stromberg , the Moneybookers e - commerce manager for the Nordic region : "" When I did my regular overview of my customers , I noticed that something was wrong with your account and I emailed our risk and legal department to solve this issue .
"" Below I have copied the answer I received from them : ' Hi Daniel , you can inform him that initially his account was suspended due to being accessed from a blacklisted IP address .
However , following recent publicity and the subsequently addition of the WikiLeaks entity to blacklists in Australia and watchlists in the USA , we have terminated the business relationship . '
"" Assange said : "" This is likely to cause a huge backlash against Moneybookers .
Craven behaviour in relation to the US government is unlikely to be seen sympathetically . ""
Moneybookers , which is registered in the UK but controlled by the Bahrain - based group Investcorp , would not make anyone available to explain the decision .
Its public relations firm , 77PR , said : "" We have never had any request , inquiry or correspondence from any authority regarding this former customer . ""
Asked how this could be reconciled with the references in the correspondence to a blacklist , it said : "" We stick with our original statement . """
2010-10-19,"The founder of WikiLeaks , Julian Assange , has launched a verbal broadside against US technology magazine Wired , claiming the publication "" has [ an ] agenda , does n't check facts and is not to be trusted "" .
Assange , the editor - in - chief of the controversial whistleblowing website , also claimed the CondÃ © Nast title is a "" known opponent and spreader of all sorts of minsinformation about WikiLeaks "" , pointing to what he claimed were false reports in the magazine that the site was due to release as many as 500,000 classified US documents from the Iraq war online on Monday .
Kevin Poulsen , a senior editor at Wired , is "" responsible for a tremendous amount of other completely false information [ about ] WikiLeaks "" , Assange alleged on Twitter .
Hours after WikiLeaks ' combative dispatch , Poulsen hit back in a post on Wired 's website . ""
Assange is notoriously sensitive to critical press , "" he wrote .
"" He has a strong personality , and at times his reaction reflects that . ""
The dispute stems from a Wired article about the circumstances of the arrest of 22-year - old US private Bradley Manning , who was subsequently charged with passing classified material relating to the Iraq war to WikiLeaks .
Assange demanded an investigation into what role Wired played in the arrest , and now claims that the spread of "" misinformation "" has "" dramatically ramped up "" since then .
Assange went on to say that the claim made in a Wired blogpost published on Monday that WikiLeaks is preparing to release hundreds of thousands of classified documents on the Iraq war is "" another fabrication "" .
Poulsen defended Wired from Assange 's accusations , saying that the publication has charted both WikiLeaks ' "" successes , and its setbacks "" and that no "" substantive factual errors "" had been published without correction .
"" I wo n't claim that I was n't affected by Assange 's accusations last June â€ ” mostly channeled through proxies â€ ” that I played a role in the arrest of accused WikiLeaks ' source Bradley Manning , "" he said .
"" But Assange is wrong to think that those false claims have changed the tone of our WikiLeaks coverage ...
We 're pleased to be among a handful of news outlets that regularly break news about it , and we plan to go on , without favour or animosity . ""
The Pentagon yesterday urged news organisations not to publish classified documents due to be released by WikiLeaks , calling the site a "" disreputable organisation "" .
Colonel David Lapan urged Wikileaks to "" return the stolen documents to the United States government and [ ... ] not publish them "" .
He added : "" The concern is that WikiLeaks as an organisation should not be made more credible by having credible news organisations facilitate what they 're doing . ""

2010-10-22,"This weekend 's release of a second gigantic trove of leaked US military material raises the stakes for two people .
One is Bradley Manning , a 22-year - old dissident American soldier being held in a military prison outside Washington charged with leaking similar material .
The other is Julian Assange , 39 , the Australian founder of WikiLeaks .
He is currently "" in hiding "" in London , according to his friends .
He is planning to surface for a news conference tomorrow .
Manning , a junior intelligence analyst formerly based in Baghdad , was arrested in the spring .
He was shipped to solitary confinement in a military prison in Kuwait and then to the marine base at Quantico , Virginia .
He faces a court martial in the new year .
So far his charge sheet includes the claim that he leaked a notorious cockpit video of an Apache helicopter gunship killing Reuters employees and wounding children in the streets of Baghdad .
He is also charged with leaking another explosive archive of US diplomatic cables .
That material has not yet been published .
After the Apache helicopter video was handed to WikiLeaks , Assange and a team of supporters in Iceland edited it into a clip they posted on the web , provocatively captioned Collateral Murder .
The subsequent posting this summer by WikiLeaks of another 75,000 Afghan war logs infuriated the Pentagon .
This anger is unlikely to be reduced with the latest haemorrhage of Iraq material .
Manning faces a theoretical total of 52 years ' imprisonment if he is convicted .
Assange 's refusal to heed Pentagon demands that he and his fellow activists stop publishing the leaked documents has led him into choppy waters .
The payments firm Moneybookers has closed down its WikiLeaks donations account , citing WikiLeaks 's appearance on a "" US watchlist "" .
Assange says his airline baggage , including the encrypted computers he carries everywhere , disappeared en route from Stockholm to Berlin .
Unfounded smears that he is , for example , financed by the Chinese government have started to float around the blogosphere .
But claims by US military chiefs that he might have "" blood on his hands "" failed to gain traction : the Pentagon now concedes that no one has so far apparently suffered reprisals from the Afghan leaks , and the WikiLeaks team has gone to elaborate lengths to redact the new Iraq files in order to protect individuals .
But Assange has had two setbacks .
His hopes of being able to operate his whistleblowing site from media - friendly Sweden have been checked , with the refusal of a residence permit last week .
He found himself in further trouble in Sweden after two women with whom he had sexual encounters on successive nights in Stockholm sought to press charges of rape because he did not use a condom .
That criminal investigation has stalled because Assange failed to return from London for a formal interview .
Assange turned over his earlier batch of Afghan files for analysis to three major news organisations : the Guardian , the New York Times and the German magazine Der Spiegel .
On this occasion he released the data to other outlets including Channel 4 's Dispatches , Le Monde in Paris , al - Jazeera in Doha and Channel 4 News .
The move testifies to Assange 's determination to cause a splash .
But it also represents a further challenge to the US administration : how to close down WikiLeaks without turning its charismatic spokesman into a global free speech martyr ?"
2010-10-23,"Britain 's role in the alleged torture and unlawful killing of Iraqi civilians may be the subject of legal action following the publication of nearly 400,000 leaked military documents by the website WikiLeaks .
British lawyers said the classified US army field reports embroiled British as well as American forces in an alleged culture of abuse and extrajudicial killings in Iraq .
Solicitor Phil Shiner of Public Interest Lawyers , appearing alongside WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange at a press conference in London today , said some of the deaths documented in the reports may have involved British forces and could now go through the UK courts .
The Iraq logs , Shiner said , indicated that UK as well as US commanders were likely to have ignored evidence of torture by the Iraqi authorities , contrary to international law .
He said : "" Some of these deaths will be in circumstances where the UK have a very clear legal responsibility .
This may be because the Iraqis died while under the effective control of UK forces – under arrest , in vehicles , helicopters or detention facilities . ""
A number of the documents detail allegations of abuse by UK soldiers .
Two reports dated 23 June 2008 describe claims by two Iraqi men – both Shias – that they were punched and kicked by unidentified British soldiers .
Both men , according to the reports on the WikiLeaks website , suffered injuries that would have been consistent with their claims .
There is no apparent record of an investigation of the allegations .
The Ministry of Defence condemned the actions of WikiLeaks , adding that it investigated any allegations made against British troops .
It said : "" There is no place for mistreatment of detainees .
Any civilian casualty is a matter of deep regret and we take any incidents extremely seriously . ""
As Assange defended the decision to disclose the documents – saying it was of "" immense importance "" to reveal the truth about the conflict – the UN warned that if the logs pointed to clear violations of the UN convention against torture , Barack Obama 's administration had a clear obligation to investigate them .
Manfred Novak , the UN special rapporteur on torture , said : "" President Obama came to power with a moral agenda , saying we do n't want to be seen to be a nation responsible for major human rights violations . ""
A failure to investigate credible claims of complicity in torture , Novak suggested , would be a failure of the Obama government to recognise US obligations under international law .
He said that states were prohibited from transferring detainees to other countries that could pose a risk to their personal safety .
Experts who studied the documents said this principle appeared to have been breached .
Novak said it was not enough for Obama 's administration to suggest the alleged crimes took place before it came to power .
But the Pentagon dismissed Novak 's concerns .
It said : "" We have fulfilled our obligations to report it [ torture ] . ""
The US Defence Department condemned the WikiLeaks release , describing the documents as raw observations by tactical units , which were only snapshots of tragic , mundane events .
Assange said the snapshots of everyday events offered a glimpse at the "" human scale "" of the conflict .
He told the news conference his motive for the disclosure was "" about the truth "" .
Iraq Body Count , a private British - based group that has tracked the number of Iraqi civilians killed since the war began in 2003 , said its analysis of the logs had raised its total of civilian deaths from 107,369 to more than 122,000 .
IBC , which worked with WikiLeaks , said the war logs showed there were more than 109,000 violent deaths between 2004 and the end of 2009 .
They included 66,081 civilians , 23,984 people classed as "" enemy "" , 15,196 members of the Iraqi security forces , and 3,771 coalition troops .
John Sloboda of IBC said : "" They [ the documents ] show the relentless grind of daily killings in almost every town or village in every province . ""
While many Iraqi civilians welcome the release of the documents , the country 's prime minister accused WikiLeaks of an attempt to sabotage his re - election hopes .
Nouri al - Maliki , a Shiite , has been fighting for more than seven months to keep his job after national elections in March failed to produce a clear winner .
The release was also roundly condemned by the American authorities .
Hillary Clinton , the US secretary of state , attacked the disclosure of any classified information that threatened national security , or put at risk the lives of coalition forces or civilians .
Pentagon press secretary Geoff Morrell called the release "" shameful "" and said it "" could potentially undermine our nation 's security "" .
However , Assange said the Pentagon allegations were "" simply not true "" and that he was confident Iraqis were not named in the documents .
He said the documents , published in a heavily censored form , contained "" no information that could be harmful to any individual "" .
Undeterred by the Pentagon 's reaction , WikiLeaks promised today to publish 15,000 more documents about the war in Afghanistan .
Daniel Ellsberg , the former US military analyst who leaked documents in 1971 revealing how the American public was misled about the Vietnam war , made a surprise appearance at today 's news conference and accused President Obama of attempting to stem the flow of military information .
Ellsberg , 79 , also criticised Obama for playing a legal "" experiment "" with the arrest of US army whistleblower Bradley Manning , who is suspected of leaking a previous cache of war documents to WikiLeaks .
Manning is in US military custody and faces a court martial next year ."
2010-10-29,"Here 's an interesting assessment of the Wikileaks phenomenon and its prime mover , Julian Assange , that makes a lot of sense .
Alex Moore argues that Assange 's countercultural mission is having a hard time finding a home in a world without counterculture .
He points up the differences between the way in which Daniel Ellsberg 's leak of Vietnam war secrets , known as the Pentagon Papers , was greeted in 1971 and the response to Assange 's recent web postings of secret information on the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq .
In the 1970s - when hippies were alive and kicking - there was "" a generation that valued integrity and the principle of truth . ""
People were concerned about the substance of the leaks , the discovery that the US president had lied to the people .
By contrast , even though the Wikileaks revelations tell of killings and torture in Iraq that are more shocking than those exposed by the Pentagon Papers , "" all anyone seems to talk about is what a jerk the guy [ Assange ] is . ""
Ellsberg may have told the New York Times , "" I 've been waiting 40 years for someone to disclose information on a scale that might really make a difference "" , but , writes Moore , "" the world has changed . ""
In Ellsberg 's time , Assange 's revelations would have incited mass protests and indignant calls for accountability .
The government was the target .
Now , we seem to be unsurprised by the substance of the leaks and instead of protesting about that , we appear to accept that Assange is a fair target .
Moore writes : "" Assange 's leaks do not inspire marches on Washington or palpable protests of any kind .
President Barack Obama , for all his campaign rhetoric of transparency and integrity , has n't praised Assange as a champion of truth ... ""
Even foreign governments whose agendas are n't complicated by hiding military secrets are hesitant to take him in . ""
Assange may have been born at the wrong time .
It 's as if he 's force - feeding truth to a world that has no stomach for it . ""

2010-11-04,"The founder of whistleblowing website WikiLeaks has called on the US to investigate alleged abuses by its troops in Afghanistan and Iraq , saying it has a "" proud tradition "" of self - scrutiny .
Julian Assange says the US has not started any investigations into the alleged incidents detailed in thousands of documents published by WikiLeaks and has instead concentrated on tracking down those responsible for the leaks and on hounding his group .
Last month , WikiLeaks published 400,000 US field reports containing evidence that US soldiers handed over detainees to a notorious Iraqi torture squad .
This followed a the publication of 75,000 documents in the summer revealing how coalition forces killed hundreds of civilians in unreported incidents in Afghanistan .
Assange made his comments ahead of a big diplomatic set piece in Geneva tomorrow , when America 's human rights record comes under scrutiny before the UN human rights council for the first time .
Every UN member is subject to what is called a universal periodic review every four years .
The US is taking its moment under the spotlight seriously , sending a high - level delegation of some 30 officials to fend off expected attacks in a forum dominated by developing countries , many of them Muslim .
Iran has already begun sniping at the US .
Earlier this week an Iranian foreign ministry official said Tehran was concerned about violations of human rights in western countries , particularly in the US .
"" We are seriously concerned about the human rights situation in western countries and will bring up our points during the UN human rights council universal periodic review conference , "" said Ramin Mehmanparast , an Iranian foreign ministry spokesman .
In anticipation of criticism from countries such as Iran , the US said it was open to fair criticism of its record , while former senior American officials warned of political fireworks .
"" There should be no illusions : the council is a highly political environment , and there is bound to be strong criticism of the United States on specific matters , "" said a comment piece in the New York Times co - written by Thomas Pickering , the former US ambassador to the UN .
While the US may brush aside attacks from the likes of Iran and Bolivia as highly partial , it can not so lightly dismiss concerns from allies and friends .
Britain , Japan , Norway have all raised concerns about the death penalty in the US . ""
The UK remains concerned about the continuing use of the death penalty in the US , and particularly by evidence that the death penalty is administered in an arbitrary and discriminatory manner with an inevitable risk of miscarriages of justice , "" Britain said in a question submitted to the US . ""
Could you tell us what steps the administration is taking to address these concerns ? ""
Another pithy British question likely to make the Obama administration uncomfortable said : "" Could you please outline the next steps needed to ensure the final closure of the detention facility in Guantánamo ? ""
Human rights groups have also piled in with their submissions .
More than 300 activist groups , including Amnesty International and the American Civil Liberties Union , have issued a separate 400-page report claiming that protection of fundamental freedoms has eroded since 9/11 . ""
Human rights advocates across America have not only documented substandard human rights practices which have persisted in the US for years , but also those that reflect the precipitous erosion of human rights protections in the US since 9/11 , "" said Sarah Paoletti of the US human rights network .
"" Whether it is migrant labourers who are excluded from workplace protections , children denied education because of the school - to - prison pipeline , or women denied equal pay in the workplace , advocates feel compelled to bring their experiences before international human rights mechanisms because the US legal system has fallen short . ""
A state department submission in August , written after extensive public consultation , said American was a democracy guided by "" simple but powerful principles "" , but admits to discrimination against black people and Hispanics and a "" broken "" immigration system .
The US said it was at "" currently at war with al - Qaida and its associated forces "" but that it would comply with all applicable domestic and international law in armed conflicts and had ordered foreign detainees be treated humanely .
It pointed to a "" free , thriving and diverse independent press "" , said it upheld freedom from religious persecution and had worked to ensure fair treatment of Muslims , Arab - Americans and South Asian communities affected by discrimination and intolerance since 9/11 .
It acknowledged concerns about the US justice system including capital punishment , juvenile justice , racial profiling and racial disparities in sentencing .
The UN general assembly created the 47-member human rights council in 2006 after its predecessor , the UN human rights commission , was discredited as a politicised forum which gave a platform to regimes with dismal human rights records ."
2010-11-18,"Swedish prosecutors are to issue an international arrest warrant for the WikiLeaks founder , Julian Assange , for questioning in a rape case .
A Swedish court today approved a request by prosecutors to detain Assange for questioning on suspicion of rape , sexual molestation and unlawful coercion .
Assange , who has made a number of appearances in London recently , has repeatedly denied the accusations .
They stem from his encounters with two women during a visit to Sweden in August .
After the court approval Stockholm 's director of public prosecution , Marianne Ny , said she would seek Assange 's arrest through Interpol .
Ny said she made the request because investigators had not been able to bring Assange in for questioning , something he also denies . ""
So far , we have not been able to meet with him to accomplish the interrogation , "" she said in a statement to the court .
Assange was accused of raping a woman in Stockholm in August , a charge that was later dropped , and sexually assaulting another woman in the town of EnkÃ¶ping .
Assange , whose website was behind the biggest leak of US military documents in history , may now be forced to travel back to Sweden .
Mark Stephens , his London - based lawyer , said : "" The allegations against him are false and without basis . ""
He said the investigation against Assange was flawed and amounted to persecution as part of a smear campaign .
The timing of today 's move also raised question among the supporters of Wikileaks .
Assange has in recent media interviews been promising further Wikileaks disclosures , particularly about Russia .
Speaking before the judge approved the request , Stephens said : "" If a decision is made to issue a warrant , it would normally take four or five working days for that to go through Europol .
If it goes any quicker than that it will be being treated unusually .
""
Stephens said Assange has repeatedly offered to meet Swedish investigators either at the Swedish embassy in London or at a police station in the UK .
A warrant for his arrest was first issued in August , but it was dropped within 24 hours when prosecutors said the accusations against him lacked substance .
The case was then reopened .
Prosecutors have released no details about the allegations against Assange , but police reports leaked to the media showed that both women had met him in connection with a seminar he gave in Stockholm on 14 August .
The women filed their complaints together six days later .
Stephens said : "" Both women have declared that they had consensual sexual relations with our client and that they continued to instigate friendly contact well after the alleged incidents .
Only after the women became aware of each other 's relationships with Mr Assange did they make their allegations against him .
"" My client is now in the extraordinary position that , despite his innocence , and despite never having been charged , and despite never receiving a single piece of paper about the allegations against him , one in 10 internet references to the word ' rape ' also include his name . ""
WikiLeaks angered the Pentagon by releasing thousands of classified US war reports from Afghanistan and Iraq .
Assange travelled to Sweden in August to seek international legal protection for his website under Swedish law after WikiLeaks published 90,000 leaked documents about US military activities in Afghanistan from 2004 - 2010 .
Stephen said that before leaving Sweden Assange asked to be interviewed by prosecutors . ""
Eventually the prosecution told his Swedish lawyer , BjÃ¶rn Hurtig , that he was free to leave the country , without interview , which he did . ""

The move could mean that prosecutors were preparing an international arrest warrant for the Australian , whose whereabouts were not immediately clear .
"" I request the court detain Assange in his absence on suspicion of rape , sexual assault and coercion , "" the director of public prosecution , Marianne Ny , said in a statement .
She said the request , which will be considered by a judge later today , was made because investigators had not been able to bring Assange in for questioning .
He was accused of raping a woman in Stockholm in August , a charge that was later dropped , and sexually assaulting another woman in the town of Enk .
Assange , whose website was behind the biggest leak of US military documents in history , has repeatedly denied the allegations .
Ny 's statement said : "" The reason for my request is that we need to interrogate him .
So far , we have not been able to meet with him to accomplish the interrogation . ""
Assange 's lawyers said he had offered to meet Swedish investigators either at the Swedish embassy in London or at a police station in the UK .
A warrant for his arrest was first issued in August , but it was dropped within 24 hours when prosecutors said the accusations against him lacked substance .
After prosecutors reopened the case Assange was questioned by Swedish police at the end of August , for about an hour according to his lawyer .
Investigators have released few details about the allegations against Assange , though a police report showed that both women had met him in connection with a seminar he gave in Stockholm on 14 August .
The report shows the women filed their complaints together six days later .
At the time Assange issued a statement on Twitter saying : "" The charges are without basis and their issue at this moment is deeply disturbing "" .
His supporters claim he is the victim of a smear campaign .
WikiLeaks has angered the Pentagon by releasing thousands of classified US war reports from Afghanistan and Iraq .
Assange travelled to Sweden in August to seek international legal protection for his website under Swedish law after WikiLeaks published 90,000 leaked documents about US military activities in Afghanistan from 2004 - 2010 .
He was given permission to leave Sweden , his lawyers said ."
2010-11-29,"Anticipating Sunday 's release of classified US embassy cables , Harold Koh , the top lawyer to the US state department , fired off a letter to Julian Assange , the editor - in - chief of WikiLeaks , on Saturday morning accusing him of having "" endangered the lives of countless individuals "" .
Thus Koh pre - emptively made himself the figurehead for the US government 's reaction to the WikiLeaks release ; the White House 's subsequent statement has echoed his attack .
Koh , a former dean of Yale law school , is also the man who authored a legal opinion for the Obama administration this past March stating that the president had the right to authorise "" lethal operations "" to target and kill alleged terrorists anywhere in the world without judicial review .
This is in spite of the fact that other respected law professors and human rights organisations from Amnesty to Human Rights Watch have expressed grave worries that such actions also endanger the lives of countless individuals .
Koh – and another famous White House legal adviser named John Yoo – were both once fierce critics of what they believed were executive abuses by the president of US interests and standards of conduct overseas .
Yet , once they themselves ascended to become acolytes of the highest office in the land , they both came to believe that the president alone had the right to determine what was right and what was wrong .
Koh became a law professor at Yale university , one of the top five in the US .
He won great acclaim in 1992 when he led a group of his students to successfully sue the Clinton administration and force the president to free Haitian refugees being held at Guantánamo Bay , Cuba .
The tale was vividly told in a book titled Storming the Court : How a Band of Yale Law Students Sued the President – and Won .
The year that Koh won his case , Yoo , then 26 , joined the law faculty of the University of California at Berkeley , another top five US law school .
Like Koh , Yoo also felt that the Clinton administration was going too far , and he authored a stinging opinion in a book for the libertarian Cato Institute : "" President Clinton exercised the powers of the imperial presidency to the utmost in the area in which those powers are already at their height – in our dealings with foreign nations .
[ He ] has accelerated the disturbing trends in foreign policy that undermine notions of democratic accountability and respect for the rule of law . ""
These outspoken opinions – harshly critical of what they saw as a resurgent trend of "" the imperial presidency "" – would lead each of them , Koh and Yoo in turn , to the White House to rewrite the way the president wielded power overseas .
Koh was the first to get his chance .
Impressed by the Haitian lawsuit , Clinton invited Koh to become assistant secretary of state for democracy , human rights and labour in September 1998 , a post in which he served till 2001 .
At the same time , an angry Yoo penned an op - ed for the Wall Street Journal in 1999 titled "" War Powers : Where Have All the Liberals Gone ? ""
Yoo argued : "" When it comes to the use of the American military , no president has a quicker trigger finger than Mr Clinton . ""
Referencing the military action in Afghanistan , Bosnia , Kosovo , Macedonia , Rwanda , Somalia and Sudan , Yoo wrote : "" These operations have cost taxpayers billions of dollars , not to mention lost lives . ""
When Clinton left the White House in 2001 , the new administration of President George W Bush invited John Yoo to work at the department of justice 's office of legal counsel in 2001 .
And it was there that Yoo co - authored the notorious "" torture memo "" , written in 2003 , which stated : "" Federal criminal laws of general applicability do not apply to properly authorised interrogations of enemy combatants , undertaken by military personnel in the course of an armed conflict ( by the ) commander - in - chief . ""
The memo would be used by the Bush administration as legal justification to allow waterboarding of alleged terrorists .
Yoo also argued that the president was not bound by the War Crimes Act , and should be allowed to wiretap terrorist suspects without a federal warrant .
Yoo left the department of justice in 2003 , but continued to defend his new legal opinions that allowed his president to assume the same , if not more extravagant , imperial powers that he had protested in Clinton .
In a December 2005 debate , University of Notre Dame law professor Doug Cassel asked Yoo , "" If the president deems that he 's got to torture somebody , including by crushing the testicles of the person 's child , there is no law that can stop him ? ""
Yoo replied : "" No treaty . ""
While Yoo had become a loyal subject of the imperial president , Koh – after his spell working for the Clinton administration – had reverted to becoming an outspoken critic of the White House .
In testimony given in September 2008 before a Senate subcommittee , Koh stated that the Bush administration 's policies on detention , interrogations , surveillance and other issues , he said , had imposed "" unnecessary , self - inflicted wounds , which have gravely diminished our global standing and damaged our reputation for respecting the rule of law . ""
Two months later , Barack Obama swept to power .
In March 2009 , Koh was invited back to Washington , as a senior legal adviser to secretary of state Hillary Clinton .
One year on , Koh delivered a speech that horrified human rights activists when he said : "" [ I]t is the considered view of this administration … that targeting practices , including lethal operations conducted with the use of unmanned aerial vehicles ( UAVs ) , comply with all applicable law , including the laws of war . ""
The speech was greeted with immediate acclaim by the conservative editorial pages of the Wall Street Journal , which wrote : "" We 're glad the administration has found legal comfort in its justification for killing terrorists …
it 's good to know the Bush administration 's best weapons will be used to keep the enemy on the run . ""
In that moment , the two law professors were united in their defence of what has become know as the "" unitary executive theory "" – the idea that the US constitution gives the president power above all else , even the US Congress .
WikiLeaks chose to challenge this power on Sunday by releasing a historical record of what the Bush , Clinton and Obama administrations have done overseas – to allow the public to decide which , if any , of them has overstepped the boundaries of the law and , if so , how .
Julian Assange of WikiLeaks offered the White House and the Pentagon the opportunity to redact the material to protect innocent lives , yet was rebuffed at every stage – most recently by Harold Koh , who wrote on Saturday : "" Despite your stated desire to protect those lives , you have done the opposite and endangered the lives of countless individuals .
You have undermined your stated objective by disseminating this material widely , without redaction , and without regard to the security and sanctity of the lives your actions endanger . ""
Contrary to what Koh claimed , WikiLeaks has chosen to pursue its own redactions without the help of the White House .
In a pointed rejoinder , Assange wrote back to Koh : "" You have chosen to respond in a manner which leads me to believe that the supposed risks are entirely fanciful and you are instead concerned to suppress evidence of human rights abuse and other criminal behaviour . ""
The law professors of the most coveted law schools in the country have had the chance to act on their own advice to check the imperial presidency and follow the rule of international law .
Both have failed , choosing instead the opportunity to serve and aggrandise absolute power with self - serving interpretations of the law to justify their political aspirations .
The only check and balance to the imperial presidency , it seems , are WikiLeaks ' scruffy activists and their journalistic accomplices ."
2010-11-30,"The WikiLeaks founder , Julian Assange , is tonight facing growing legal problems around the world , with the US announcing that it was investigating whether he had violated its espionage laws .
Assange 's details were also added to Interpol 's worldwide wanted list .
Dated 30 November , the entry reads : "" sex crimes "" and says the warrant has been issued by the international public prosecution office in Gothenburg , Sweden . ""
If you have any information contact your national or local police .
"" It reads : "" Wanted : Assange , Julian Paul , "" and gives his birthplace as Townsville , Australia .
Friends said earlier that Assange was in a buoyant mood , however , despite the palpable fury emanating from Washington over the decision by WikiLeaks to start publishing more than a quarter of a million mainly classified US cables .
He was said to be at a secret location somewhere outside London , along with fellow hackers and WikiLeaks enthusiasts .
In contrast to previous WikiLeaks releases , Assange has , on this occasion , kept a relatively low profile .
His attempt to give an interview to Sky News via Skype was thwarted today by a faulty internet connection .
But he was able to give an interview to Time magazine in which he called for Hillary Clinton , the US secretary of state , to resign .
"" She should resign , if it can be shown that she was responsible for ordering US diplomatic figures to engage in espionage in the United Nations , in violation of the international covenants to which the US has signed up .
Yes , she should resign over that , "" he said .
Assange 's reluctance to emerge in public is understandable .
It comes amid a rapid narrowing of his options .
Several countries are currently either taking â€ “ or actively considering â€ “ aggressive legal moves against him .
This lengthening list includes Sweden , Australia and now the US â€ “ but so far as can be made out , not Britain .
The US attorney general , Eric Holder , announced yesterday that the justice department and Pentagon are conducting "" an active , ongoing criminal investigation "" into the latest Assange - facilitated leak under Washington 's Espionage Act .
It was not immediately clear whether Holder was referring to Bradley Manning , the dissident US private suspected of being the original source of the leak , or Assange .
The inquiry by US federal authorities is made tricky by Assange 's citizenship
â€ “ he is Australian â€ “ and the antediluvian nature of the law 's pre - internet - era 1917 statutes .
According to the Washington Post , no charges against anyone from WikiLeaks are imminent .
But asked how the US could prosecute Assange , a non - US citizen , Holder struck an ominous note .
"" Let me be clear .
This is not sabre - rattling , "" he said , vowing to swiftly "" close the gaps "" in current US legislation .
But Assange 's most pressing headache is Sweden .
Swedish prosecutors have issued an international and European arrest warrant ( EAW ) for him in connection with rape allegations , and the warrant has been upheld by a Swedish appeal court .
Assange strongly denies any wrongdoing but admits having unprotected but consensual encounters with two women during a visit to Sweden in August .
Mark Stephens , his London - based lawyer , has described the allegations as "" false and without basis "" , adding that they amount to persecution as part of a cynical smear campaign .
Nonetheless , the Swedes appear determined to force Assange back to Sweden for questioning .
Stockholm 's director of public prosecutions , Marianne Ny , said last month : "" So far , we have not been able to meet with him to accomplish the interrogation . ""
Assange contests this too .
But if he declines to return to Sweden voluntarily , and the UK decides to enforce Sweden 's arrest warrant , things may get tricky .
Some friends believe Assange 's best strategy is not to go to ground but to get on a plane to Sweden and face down his accusers .
Stephens , moreover , says that the Swedish attempts to extradite Assange have no legal force .
So far he has not been charged , Stephens says â€ “ an essential precondition for a valid European arrest warrant .
Under the EAW scheme , which allows for fast - tracked extradition between EU member states , a warrant must indicate a formal charge in order to be validated , and must be served on the person accused . ""
Julian Assange has never been charged by Swedish prosecutors .
He is formally wanted as a witness , "" Stephens told the Guardian today .
"" All we have is an English translation of what 's being reported in the media .
The Swedish authorities have not met their obligations under domestic and European law to communicate the nature of the allegations against him in a language that he understands , and the evidence against him . ""
Assange 's legal team are challenging the warrant in Sweden 's supreme court .
They are optimistic : a previous appeal was partially successful in limiting the grounds on which the warrant was issued .
Today a spokesman for Britain 's Serious Organised Crime Agency , which is responsible for validating extradition requests , would not confirm or deny receipt of a European arrest warrant for Assange 's extradition .
Assange has previously suggested he might find sanctuary in Switzerland .
More promising perhaps is Ecuador , whose leftist government unexpectedly offered him asylum on Monday .
"" We are ready to give him residence in Ecuador , with no problems and no conditions , "" Ecuador 's foreign minister , Kintto Lucas , said .
At the very least , Ecuador could offer Assange a new passport .
He might need one .
Yesterday Australia 's attorney general , Robert McClelland , said Australian police were also investigating whether any Australian laws had been broken by the latest WikiLeaks release .
In reality , Assange 's predicament may not be as hopeless as it seems .
The US would be hard pressed to make charges against him stick , experts suggest .
"" There have been so few cases under the Espionage Act , you can put them on one hand , "" said David Banisar , senior legal counsel for the campaigning group Article 19 and an expert on free speech in the US .
"" There is the practical problem that most of the information published by WikiLeaks was n't secret .
Then there is the debate about whether the documents were properly classified â€ “ there are detailed rules in the US about what can and can not be classified . """
2010-12-01,"British police are continuing to look for the WikiLeaks founder , Julian Assange , over rape allegations made against him in Sweden .
The Serious Organised Crime Agency , which is handling the case , confirmed yesterday it had flagged up an Interpol "" red notice "" to all UK police forces that the whereabouts of Assange were being sought .
Police sources said Assange would be arrested if they discovered his precise location .
The 39-year - old is believed to be in the UK .
A Soca source said : "" If there is intelligence or information to say he is in a said location , then that will be acted upon .
With a red notice issue it means he 's on the radar , on police force systems .
Law enforcement Plc is looking for him . ""
A source close to Assange told the Guardian that his lawyer had been assured by police that he would be approached first if there was any attempt to detain the WikiLeaks founder .
Although the red notice does not amount to an arrest warrant , an Interpol spokesman said that often they were interpreted as a "" valid request for provisional arrest "" especially if the two countries , such as Sweden and the UK , have extradition treaties .
A Soca source described it as an "" initial locate and trace "" request by Interpol for Assange , with the red notice asking people to contact police if they have any information about his whereabouts .
Assange , who is from Australia and is thought to have been in London recently , moves regularly from country to country and is known to have spent periods in Britain and Sweden .
The source added that police had not received any information relating to the whereabouts of Assange or any indication that he might currently be in the UK .
The red notice concerning Assange was sent from Interpol on 20 November to all its 188 member countries after being contacted by the Swedish authorities who want to interview him over sex offence allegations .
Assange is wanted by Swedish prosecutors on suspicion of rape , sexual molestation and unlawful coercion .
He denies the allegations .
Initially details of the notice were marked "" restricted "" and only came to light yesterday after Sweden said its request could be publicised .
Today , Assange 's lawyer issued a vigorous condemnation of the Interpol move .
Comparing the Swedish prosecutor to Lavrentiy Pavlovich Beria , Stalin 's notorious security chief , Mark Stephens said "" neither Mr Assange nor his lawyers have been provided any further information beyond that reported in the press . ""
He continued : "" This appears to be a persecution and a prosecution .
It is highly irregular and unusual for the Swedish authorities to issue a red notice in the teeth of the undisputed fact that Mr Assange has agreed to meet voluntarily to answer the prosecutor 's questions .
Mr Assange has repeatedly sought meetings with the prosecutrix â€ “ both in Sweden and subsequently â€ “ in order to answer her questions and clear his name .
It is relevant that Mr Assange sought permission from the prosecutrix to leave Sweden and she gave him her permission .
Since leaving Sweden Mr Assange has continued to seek meetings with the prosecutrix , but his requests have either been ignored or met with a refusal . ""
He added : "" At this point in time , we have no evidence pointing to a link between these allegations from August and the issue of the Interpol alert just two days after the WikiLeaks first release of US diplomatic cables .
However , it is highly unusual for a red notice warrant to be issued in relation to the allegations reported as having been made , since Swedish law does not require custodial orders in relation to the allegation â€ “ indeed to our knowledge this is a unique action by the Swedish prosecuting authorities in applying for a red notice on the basis of these allegations .
"" We are also investigating whether the prosecutor 's application to have Mr Assange held incommunicado without access to lawyers , visitors or other prisoners â€ “ again a unique request â€ “ is in any way linked to this matter and the recent , rather bellicose US statements of an intention to prosecute Mr Assange .
"" If Assange is arrested in the UK , police will notify Swedish authorities immediately before he faces proceedings to extradite him to Sweden at City of Westminster magistrates ' court in central London . ""
Once he has been located , the Swedish authorities would be contacted and then they would send an arrest warrant and that gets processed by us , to make sure it ticks all the boxes within the legislation , and then it gets actioned , "" said the Soca source .
He said the process could be delayed if Assange chose to appeal against attempts to extradite him .
An Interpol spokesman said : "" In cases where arrests are made based on a red notice , these are made by national police officials in Interpol member countries . ""
The WikiLeaks founder is facing growing legal problems around the world after US Republicans revealed yesterday they were pushing for his criminal prosecution under the Espionage Act .
Scotland Yard refused to divulge any discussions that may have taken place concerning Assange .
A Metropolitan police spokesman said : "" We do n't discuss purported communications regarding extradition cases unless someone is being called before the City of Westminster magistrates court , where we deal with our cases . ""
Meanwhile , Assange 's mother , Christine , who runs a puppet theatre in Queensland , Australia , said she was worried about her son 's wellbeing . ""
He is my son and I love him , and obviously I do n't want him hunted down and jailed .
I 'm reacting as any mother would .
I 'm distressed , "" she told Australian radio . """
2010-12-01,"The Republican presidential hopeful Mike Huckabee has called for whoever leaked the 250,000 US diplomatic cables to be executed .
Huckabee , who ran unsuccessfully for the Republican nomination at the last election but is one of the favourites for 2012 , joined a growing number of people demanding the severest punishment possible for those behind the leak , which has prompted a global diplomatic crisis .
His fellow potential Republican nominee Sarah Palin had already called for WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange to be "" hunted down "" , and an adviser to the Canadian prime minister has echoed her comments .
Huckabee said : "" Whoever in our government leaked that information is guilty of treason , and I think anything less than execution is too kind a penalty . ""
He added , according to Politico : "" They 've put American lives at risk .
They put relationships that will take decades to rebuild at risk .
They knew full well that they were handling sensitive documents they were entrusted . ""
And anyone who had access to that level of information was not only a person who understood what their rules were , but they also signed , under oath , a commitment that they would not violate .
They did …
Any lives they endangered , they 're personally responsible for and the blood is on their hands . ""
Bradley Manning , a US army intelligence analyst suspected of leaking the diplomatic cables , is currently being held at a military base .
He has been charged with transferring classified data and delivering national defence information to an unauthorised source .
He faces a court martial and up to 52 years in prison .
The 23-year - old was arrested after boasting in instant messages and emails to a high - profile former hacker , Adrian Lamo , that he had passed the material to WikiLeaks along with a highly classified video of US forces killing unarmed civilians in Baghdad .
Kathleen McFarland , who served in the Pentagon under the Nixon , Ford and Reagan administrations , concurred with Huckabee .
"" It 's time to up the charges , "" said McFarland , now a Fox News national security analyst .
"" Let 's charge him and try him for treason .
If he is found guilty , he should be executed .
"" It is not just the Americans who are demanding blood .
Tom Flanagan , a senior adviser to the Canadian prime minister , Stephen Harper , issued what has been described as a fatwa against Assange , on the Canadian TV station CBC .
"" I think Assange should be assassinated , actually , "" he said .
"" I think Obama should put out a contract and maybe use a drone or something . ""
Flanagan chuckled as he made the comment but did not retract it when questioned , adding : "" I would n't feel unhappy if Assange does disappear . ""
Revelations directly relating to Canada have been few and far between so far , although there was some embarrassment for Harper in the leak of a US embassy note from one of the French president 's key foreign advisers .
It explained that Harper was invited to last year 's D - day commemorations in Normandy only because his government was in trouble .
Assange is facing growing legal problems around the world .
The US has announced it is investigating whether he has violated its espionage laws , and his details have been added to Interpol 's worldwide wanted list , based on an arrest warrant issued by Swedish prosecutors in connection with rape allegations .
On Monday , Sarah Palin wrote on Facebook : "" He is an anti - American operative with blood on his hands .
His past posting of classified documents revealed the identity of more than 100 Afghan sources to the Taliban .
Why was he not pursued with the same urgency we pursue al - Qaida and Taliban leaders ? """
2010-12-02,"The Swedish authorities today issued a new arrest warrant for Julian Assange , the founder of WikiLeaks , following a request by the UK 's Serious and Organised Crime Agency .
Assange is wanted in Sweden to face allegations of sexual crimes committed in there in August , which he denies .
The original papers , issued in connection with suspicion of "" rape , sexual molestation and unlawful coercion "" , were reportedly incomplete because they had listed only the maximum penalty for the most serious crime alleged , rather than for all of the crimes .
There were unconfirmed reports yesterday that Assange had escaped arrest on Wednesday only because of the error and that British police are aware of his location .
But his London lawyer , Mark Stephens , said that no warrant valid under Swedish , European or international law had been issued .
"" There is no arrest warrant against him , "" he told Reuters .
"" There was an Interpol red notice , which is not a warrant , alerting authorities to monitor his movements . ""
Interpol put Assange on its wanted list after a Stockholm district court issued a warrant for his arrest on 18 November at the request of prosecutor Marianne Ny , who said she had been unable to question him .
Police sources said there was no manhunt for Assange , although forces will share intelligence about his whereabouts if it becomes available .
"" We will have to see what comes of the belief in some quarters that he is somewhere outside London , "" a source said .
Assange is due to give an online interview to Guardian readers today .
He came under renewed fire in the United States for his role in the publication of more than 250,000 American diplomatic cables .
US undersecretary of state William Burns said in Washington that the release of the classified papers by WikiLeaks had "" substantially hurt "" US diplomatic efforts ."
2010-12-02,"There was confusion surrounding the legal status of Julian Assange last night after a dispute between his lawyer and Swedish authorities over the validity of an arrest warrant .
The WikiLeaks founder was accused of rape during a trip to Sweden but he has vehemently denied allegations made by two women .
Mark Stephens , his London - based lawyer , has called the allegations "" false and without basis "" , and has said they amounted to a smear campaign following recent high - profile political leaks by Assange 's organisation .
Assange is currently believed to be in the UK .
While the Serious Organised Crime Agency , which is handling the case , said on Tuesday that it had flagged up an Interpol ' red notice ' to all UK police forces about the whereabouts of Assange and would arrest him if they discovered his precise location , other reports have suggested that police and security services know where Assange is based as he supplied contact details on arrival in Britain in October and have not arrested him or initiated extradition proceedings because Swedish authorities issued an incorrect European arrest warrant . ""
The arrest warrant has been issued in circumstances where Assange has an outstanding appeal in Sweden , "" Stephens said in the Times , while a police source was quoted as saying Assange 's warrant was "" not a properly certified warrant so we ca n't act on it . ""
Stephens argued that although Assange was originally wanted on a charge of rape , this had been thrown out after a partially successful appeal and which meant that Swedish law did not allow for another arrest warrant for current allegations .
He said British police had probably not taken any action against Assange because the warrant was issued incorrectly rather than because they did n't know where he was . ""
The sole ground for the warrant is the prosecutor 's blatantly false allegation that he is on the run from justice : he left Sweden lawfully and has offered himself for questioning .
An appeal against this decision was filed on Monday and is pending , "" Stephens said .
There was earlier confusion in August when Swedish authorities withdrew an arrest warrant for Assange stating that the accusation of rape against him was unfounded , before reopening the case ."
2010-12-02,"WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange wanted to expose China 's and Russia 's secrets as much as those of the US , and believes Hillary Clinton should resign if she ordered diplomats to engage in espionage . ""
[ Clinton ] should resign if it could be shown that she was responsible for ordering US diplomatic figures to engage in espionage of UN activities , in violation of the international covenants to which the US signed up , "" he said in an interview with Time magazine , published yesterday following the leak of secret US diplomatic cables that have caused huge embarrassment for the country .
Assange gave the interview via Skype from an undisclosed location after a warrant was issued by Interpol following rape allegations in Sweden , which his lawyer said amounted to persecution and a smear campaign .
While Assange has been accused by former members of the WikiLeaks project of obsessively focusing on the US , he said countries with less transparency , such as China and Russia , had the most potential to be reformed by whistleblowers .
"" We believe it is the most closed societies that have the most reform potential , "" he said .
Assange said that while parts of the Chinese government and security services "" appear terrified of free speech "" he believed it was "" an optimistic sign because it means speech can still cause reform . ""
He added : "" Journalism and writing is capable of achieving change which is why Chinese authorities are so scared of it . ""
Assange argued that countries like China could be easier to reform than countries like the US and the UK , which "" have been so heavily fiscalised through contractual obligations that political change does n't seem to result in economic change , which in other words means that political change does n't result in change . ""
While secrecy was important , Assange said , in keeping the identity of sources hidden , secrecy "" should n't be used to cover up abuses . ""
He said that revealing abuses could lead to positive changes in countries and organisations .
"" They have one of two choices … to reform in such a way that they can be proud of their endeavours , and proud to display them to the public "" or "" to lock down internally and to balkanise , and as a result , of course , cease to be as efficient as they were .
To me , that is a very good outcome , because organizations can either be efficient , open and honest , or they can be closed , conspiratorial and inefficient . ""
Turning back to the US , Assange said he believed American society was "" becoming more closed "" and its "" relative degree of openness … probably peaked in about 1978 , and has been on the way down , unfortunately , since . ""
Speaking about accusations that he had singled out the US as a force for harm in the world , Assange said the view lacked "" the necessary subtlety "" .
"" I do n't think the US is , by world standards , an exception ; rather it is a very interesting case both for its abuses and for some of its founding principles . ""
Assange said the media interest in the WikiLeaks cables had been tremendous . ""
The media scrutiny and the reaction are so tremendous that it actually eclipses our ability to understand it , "" he said , with "" a tremendous rearrangement of viewings about many different countries "" .
Assange also gave a glimpse into why WikiLeaks had chosen to partner with traditional media organisations to release the files , rather than , as might have been expected , amateur bloggers .
In 2006 , "" we thought we would have the analytical work done by bloggers and people who wrote Wikipedia articles and so on , "" he said .
But "" when people write political commentary on blogs or other social media , it is my experience that it is not , with some exceptions , their goal to expose the truth . ""
Rather , it is their goal to position themselves amongst their peers on whatever the issue of the day is .
The most effective , the most economical way to do that , is simply to take the story that 's going around , [ which ] has already created a marketable audience for itself , and say whether they 're in favour of that interpretation or not . ""
Now , he said , the analytical work was "" done by professional journalists we work with and by professional human rights activists .
It is not done by the broader community . ""
Social networks acted as amplifiers , he added – and , as WikiLeaks gained more publicity , an important supplier of source material ."
2010-12-02,"In a hard - hitting piece in defence of WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange - now officially named as a fugitive - Alexander Cockburn contends that American newspapers have colluded with the US government to conceal some of the leaked embassy cables .
He cites research by Gareth Porter , who identified a cable released by WikiLeaks that provides a detailed account of how Russian specialists countered official US claims that Iran had missiles capable of reaching Europe , or that Iran intended to develop such a capability .
Porter wrote : "" Readers of the two leading US newspapers never learned those key facts about the document .
The New York Times and the Washington Post reported only that the United States believed Iran had acquired such missiles ... from North Korea .
Neither newspaper reported the detailed Russian refutation of the US view on the issue or the lack of hard evidence ...
The Times , which had obtained the diplomatic cables not from WikiLeaks but from The Guardian ... did not publish the text of the cable .
The Times story said the newspaper had made the decision not to publish ' at the request of the Obama administration ' .
That meant that its readers could not compare the highly distorted account of the document in the Times story against the original document without searching the WikiLeaks website . ""
Aside from this self - censorship , Cockburn also remarks on the distaste among the "" official "" US press for WikiLeaks after its previous releases of documents about the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan .
He writes : "" The New York Times managed the ungainly feat of publishing some of the leaks while simultaneously affecting to hold its nose , and while publishing a mean - spirited hatchet job on Assange by its reporter John F Burns , a man with a well burnished record in touting the various agendas of the US government . ""
As for TV coverage , he cites Glenn Greenwald , writing on the Salon.com : "" On CNN , Wolf Blitzer was beside himself with rage over the fact that the US government had failed to keep all these things secret from him ...
Then - like the Good Journalist he is - Blitzer demanded assurances that the government has taken the necessary steps to prevent him , the media generally and the citizenry from finding out any more secrets ...
The central concern of Blitzer - one of our nation 's most honoured ' journalists ' - is making sure that nobody learns what the US government is up to . ""
Some of that Blitzer rant ( no longer available on the CNN site ) deserves quoting .
Here 's a sample : "" Are they doing anything at all to make sure if some 23-year - old guy , allegedly , starts downloading hundreds of thousands of cables , hundreds of thousands of copies of sensitive information , that no one pays attention to that , no one in the security system of the United States government bothers to see someone is downloading all these millions - literally millions of documents ? ...
It 's amazing to me that the US government security system is so lax that someone could allegedly do this kind of damage just by simply pretending to be listening to a Lady Gaga CD and at the same time downloading all these kinds of documents ...
Do we know yet if they 've [ done ] that fix ?
In other words , somebody right now who has top secret or secret security clearance can no longer download information onto a CD or a thumb drive ?
Has that been fixed already ?
""
Journalists who oppose WikiLeaks are opposed to journalism .
Here 's Jack Shafer offering some sense : "" Information conduits like Julian Assange shock us out of that complacency .
Oh , sure , he 's a pompous egomaniac sporting a series of bad haircuts and grandiose tendencies .
And he often acts without completely thinking through every repercussion of his actions .
But if you want to dismiss him just because he 's a seething jerk , there are about 2,000 journalists I 'd like you to meet . ""
Quite so .
Too many "" seething jerks "" who also deny the point of their own trade - disclosure !

2010-12-03,"The WikiLeaks founder , Julian Assange , today hailed the person responsible for leaking the diplomatic cables as "" an unparalleled hero "" and suggested that his organisation had deliberately used servers in certain jurisdictions , such as Amazon 's in the US , to test their commitment to freedom of speech .
In a live Q&amp;A on theguardian.com , the Australian journalist highlighted the role alleged to have been played in the leaks by the soldier Bradley Manning . ""
For the past four years one of our goals has been to lionise the source who take the real risks in nearly every journalistic disclosure and without whose efforts , journalists would be nothing , "" said Assange .
"" If indeed it is the case , as alleged by the Pentagon , that the young soldier â€ “ Bradley Manning â€ “ is behind some of our recent disclosures , then he is without doubt an unparalleled hero . ""
Assange was answering questions online as it was claimed that he faced imminent arrest .
AFP reported that the Swedish authorities had issued a new international arrest warrant containing information requested by British police .
During the live Q&amp;A , Assange responded to Amazon.com 's decision earlier this week to pull the plug on hosting WikiLeaks .
On Wednesday , the company announced it was cutting off WikiLeaks after being contacted by the staff of Joe Lieberman , chairman of the Senate 's committee on homeland security .
He said : "" Since 2007 we have been deliberately placing some of our servers in jurisdictions that we suspected suffered a free speech deficit in order to separate rhetoric from reality .
Amazon was one of these cases . ""
His comments on the matter came after WikiLeaks tweeted that if Amazon was "" so uncomfortable with the first amendment , they should get out of the business of selling books . ""
Despite facing arrest warrants over allegations of sexual crimes in Sweden , Assange found time to answer a reader 's question about extraterrestrial life .
Asked whether WikiLeaks had ever received documents relating to UFOs , he said : "" Many weirdos email us about UFOs or how they discovered that they were the antichrist whilst talking with their ex - wife at a garden party over a pot - plant . ""
However , he said , none had yet satisfied the twin publishing criteria : "" that the documents not be self - authored ; that they be original . ""
But he added : "" It is worth noting that in yet - to - be - published parts of the cablegate archive there are indeed references to UFOs . ""
Meanwhile , Assange 's lawyer , Mark Stephens , told the Guardian that neither he nor his colleagues had heard from police about the arrest warrants .
"" We had an understanding with Scotland Yard of long standing that in the event they wanted to contact Julian Assange they would come to us and we would facilitate a congenial and convenient meeting , "" he said .
"" I hope the police remember their undertaking .
I 've had no indication that anyone wants to talk to Julian at this moment in time ; no member of his legal team has had a call from any law enforcement agency . """
2010-12-03,"Update :
Thank you for all your questions .
We have now closed comments on this article .
Read Julian Assange 's answers here .
WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange is at the centre of intense media speculation and a hate campaign against him in America , following the leak of 250,000 US diplomatic cables .
He will be live online to answer Guardian readers ' questions at 1 pm today , subject to his access to an internet connection - which is very much a live issue .
His online interview comes at the end of a week of shocking revelations from the cables and on a day when WikiLeaks has been fighting US attempts to take its website down .
Assange will answer your questions in the comments section below .
From 1 pm you will need to navigate to the latest comments for his replies .

2010-12-03,"The net was closing on Julian Assange tonight after Swedish prosecutors issued a fresh request to British police to extradite the WikiLeaks founder .
Swedish authorities , who want to question Assange over sex offence allegations , issued a new warrant for his arrest .
Mistakes in the original European arrest warrant sent by Swedish prosecutors to the Serious Organised Crime Agency ( Soca ) last month had prevented any move to apprehend the Australian .
Although British police know Assange 's whereabouts , understood to be in the south - east of England , his lawyer said that by this afternoon there had been no attempt to contact him .
Mark Stephens said : "" The police have given us an undertaking that they will contact us if they want to get in touch with Julian .
At this point in time nobody has . ""
Assange is wanted in Sweden over allegations including sexual molestation , suspicion of rape and unlawful coercion , although no charges have been laid .
The former computer hacker denies the allegations and has vowed to fight them in court , saying they are part of a smear campaign against him .
Stephens said his client was trapped in a bizarre situation where he had attempted to arrange a meeting with the Swedish prosecutor , but had been rebuffed .
Assange appeared in defiant mood today , answering Guardian readers ' questions in an online Q&amp;A session .
He said he was aware that death threats had been made against him following the publication of 250,000 US diplomatic cables on his website .
"" We are taking the appropriate precautions to the degree that we are able when dealing with a superpower , "" he said .
He added that the leaked cables , along with "" significant material from the US and other countries "" , had been copied to more than 100,000 people in encrypted form .
"" If something happens to us , the key parts will be released automatically , "" he said .
On yesterday , Sweden 's highest court refused Assange permission to appeal against the European arrest order .
According to Swedish police , Soca requested a new warrant because the original listed only the maximum penalty for the most serious crime alleged , rather than for all of the crimes .
The warrant will be checked by Soca officials and passed to local police , who will serve it on Assange .
Scotland Yard refused to discuss whether officers from its extradition unit were preparing to arrest the Wiki- Leaks founder .
The warrant , which is valid in all EU member states , requires the receiving member state to arrest and extradite the suspect within 90 days of arrest , or within 10 days if the arrested person consents to surrender .
The warrant can only be issued for offences carrying a maximum penalty of 12 months or more .
The allegations surfaced in August after two women in Sweden made complaints to police .
WikiLeaks was forced to switch to a Swiss web address yesterday after the American company providing its domain name cut off service because cyber attacks were threatening the rest of its network ."
2010-12-03,"Apologies for the late Bundle , readers , we 've had a few technical difficulties .
As our Guardian colleagues are kept busy with revelations from the leaked US embassy cables , we 've turned our attention to the legal threats facing Julian Assange , as Sweden issues a fresh arrest warrant and the US investigates Wikileaks ' possible violation of its espionage laws .
But as Afua Hirsch explains , Assange 's liability under the Act is very much a moot point .
Assange 's lawyer Mark Stephens insists he has made every effort to answer the Swedish charges against him , although Stephens accuses the US state department of behaving "" inappropriately "" by failing to respect attorney - client protocol .
In last week 's legal hero slot on Guardian law , legal aid minister Jonathan Djanogly MP writes about Philip Goldenberg , who used to draw two red circles on Djanogly 's work to indicate that it was "" balls "" .
We 've also been looking at what Wednesday 's supreme court judgment on defamation means for libel law , as Gill Phillips writes that fair comment is dead - "" long live honest comment "" .

2010-12-05,"Lawyers representing the WikiLeaks founder , Julian Assange , say that they have been surveilled by members of the security services and have accused the US state department of behaving "" inappropriately "" by failing to respect attorney - client protocol .
Jennifer Robinson and Mark Stephens of the law firm Finers Stephens Innocent told the Guardian they had been watched by people parked outside their houses for the past week .
"" I 've noticed people consistently sitting outside my house in the same cars with newspapers , "" said Robinson .
"" I probably noticed certain things a week ago , but mostly it 's been the last three or four days . ""
Stephens said he , too , had had his home watched .
Asked who he thought was monitoring him , he said : "" The security services . ""
Robinson said the legal team was also experiencing "" other forms of pressure "" from Washington .
She pointed to a letter from a state department legal adviser – addressed to both Assange and her – which appeared to bracket together client and lawyer as if to suggest that WikiLeaks and its lawyers were one and the same .
The letter , which was released to the press , begins : "" Dear Ms Robinson and Mr Assange .
I am writing in response to your 26 November 2010 letter to US Ambassador Louis B Susman regarding your intention to again publish on your WikiLeaks site what you claim to be classified US government documents . ""
Robinson said : "" By eliding client and lawyer , that was a very inappropriate attempt to implicate me .
That is really inappropriate to come from the state department of all places ; they understand very well the rules on attorney - client protocol . ""
She said that although they had requested a public retraction from the state department , no answer had been received .
"" It 's quite a serious situation , "" she said , adding that , according to the UN 's Basic Principles on the Role of Lawyers , governments should ensure that lawyers "" are able to perform all of their professional functions without intimidation , hindrance , harassment or improper interference "" and that "" lawyers shall not be identified with their clients or their clients ' causes as a result of discharging their functions "" .
A spokeswoman for the Home Office declined to comment on the lawyers ' surveillance claims .
Assange , who is staying in Britain , has come under growing pressure from politicians in the US and around the world after his site started publishing excerpts from a cache of 250,000 secret American diplomatic cables last week .
It emerged on Saturday that Australian police are investigating whether Assange , an Australian citizen , has broken any of the country 's laws and is liable to prosecution there .
The foreign minister , Kevin Rudd , said : "" The Australian government unequivocally condemns the action by any of those responsible for the unauthorised release of classified and confidential information and diplomatic communications between states . ""
Swedish prosecutors have sent an international arrest warrant to the Metropolitan police , seeking the extradition of Assange for questioning on allegations – which he strongly denies – of rape , sexual molestation and unlawful coercion .
Stephens today denounced the extradition warrant as a "" political stunt "" and said Assange would fight deportation to Sweden on the grounds that it could lead to him being handed over to the US , where senior politicians have called for him to be executed .
The former vice - presidential candidate Sarah Palin has described him as "" an anti - American operative with blood on his hands "" and called for him to be hunted down like a Taliban leader , while another senior Republican , Mike Huckabee , has said that "" anything less than execution is too kind a penalty "" for his actions .
Stephens said that Sweden 's chief prosecutor had told Assange in September that there was no case for him to answer , following complaints against him by two women , but the investigation was revived following the intervention of a Swedish politician .
He said that Swedish prosecutors knew where Assange was and urged them to call him to discuss the case .
Stephens told BBC1 's Andrew Marr Show : "" It is quite bizarre , because the chief prosecutor in Sweden dropped the entire case against him , saying there was absolutely nothing for him to find back in September , and then a few weeks later on – after the intervention of a Swedish politician – a new prosecutor , not in Stockholm where Julian and these women had been , but in Gothenburg , began a new case which has resulted in these warrants and the Interpol Red Notice being put out . ""
He added : "" It does seem to be a political stunt . """
2010-12-06,"9.39pm :
Julian Assange , the founder of WikiLeaks , is expected to appear in a UK court tomorrow after his lawyers said he would meet police to discuss a European extradition warrant from Sweden relating to alleged sexual assaults , Owen Bowcott reports .
Assange is seeking supporters to put up surety and bail for him .
He said he expected to have to post bail of between Â£100,000 and Â£200,000 and would require up to six people offering surety , or risked being held on remand .
Once he turns himself into the police he will have to appear before a magistrates court within 24 hours , where he will seek release on bail .
A full hearing of his extradition case would have to be heard within 28 days .

9.23pm :
The net appears to be closing on Julian Assange .
The US attorney general tonight compounded a week of intense diplomatic pressure on Assange and WikiLeaks when he warned : "" We are looking at all the things we can do to try to stem the flow of this information . ""
The Guardian 's Ewen MacAskill and Sam Jones report :
The US attorney general , speaking at a press conference in Washington , said : "" The lives of people who work for the American people have been put at risk .
The American people themselves have been put at risk by these actions that I believe are arrogant , misguided and ultimately not helpful in any way .
We are doing everything that we can . ""
9.14pm :
Mark Stephens , Assange 's London - based lawyer , yesterday denounced the Swedish extradition warrant as a "" political stunt "" .
Tonight Stephens said : "" We are in the process of making arrangements to meet with the police by consent in order to facilitate the taking of that question and answer that is needed . ""
9.01pm :
Scotland Yard received a fresh European arrest warrant earlier today , issued by authorities in Sweden where Assange is wanted for questioning on allegations of rape , sexual molestation and unlawful coercion .
The Swedish prosecution authority at first opened , then dropped and then re - opened the investigation of allegations by two Swedish women .
Assange denies the allegations .
Assange 's Swedish lawyer has said his client believed foreign powers were influencing Sweden .
8.49pm :
In a live question and answer session with Guardian readers on Friday , Assange said : "" The Cable Gate archive has been spread , along with significant material from the US and other countries to over 100,000 people in encrypted form .
If something happens to us , the key parts will be released automatically . ""
Further , the Cable Gate archives is in the hands of multiple news organisations .
History will win .
The world will be elevated to a better place .
Will we survive ?
That depends on you .
""
8.24pm :
This just in from Ewen MacAskill , the Guardian 's correspondent in Washington : International pressure on Julian Assange intensified tonight as the US attorney general , Eric Holder , disclosed that he had authorised "" significant "" actions aimed at prosecuting the WikiLeaks founder over the release of thousands of diplomatic cables .
The US attorney general , speaking at a press conference in Washington , said : "" The lives of people who work for the American people have been put at risk .
The American people themselves have been put at risk by these actions that I believe are arrogant , misguided and ultimately not helpful in any way .
We are doing everything that we can . ""
Asked if he might mount a prosecution under the Espionage Act , Holder said : "" That is certainly something that might play a role , but there are other statutes , other tools at our disposal . ""
8.22pm :
Assange is also under investigation by Australian authorities , following the WikiLeaks release of 250,000 diplomatic cables .
The country 's foreign minister , Kevin Rudd , said on Saturday : "" The federal police was asked by the Australian attorney general some days ago to investigate whether or not Assange has breached any element of the Australian criminal law . ""
8.15pm :
Mark Stephens , the London - based lawyer who respresents 39-year - old Assange , says he will fight any move to extradite the WikiLeaks founder .
Stephens told BBC News today : "" Late this afternoon after close of business I got a call from the police who said that they had received an extradition request from Sweden . ""
Their request is to interview Julian Assange .
He 's not been charged with anything .
"" We are in the process of making arrangements to meet with the police by consent in order to facilitate the taking of that question and answer that is needed . ""
The interview will happen in the "" foreseeable future "" , Stephens said .
8.09pm :
Julian Assange tonight agreed to meet police in the UK , according to WikiLeaks lawyers .
Jennifer Robinson , a solicitor with Finers Stephens Innocent which represents Assange , said this evening : "" We have a received an arrest warrant [ related to allegations in Sweden ] .
The police have been in touch .
They have contacted us .
We are negotiating with them .
We are negotiating a meeting with police . ""
Swedish prosecutors have sent an international arrest warrant to the Met , seeking the extradition of Assange for questioning on allegations â€ “ which he strongly denies â€ “ of rape , sexual molestation and unlawful coercion .
Assange , who is staying in Britain , has come under criticism from politicians in the US and around the world after his site started publishing excerpts from a cache of more than 250,000 secret US diplomatic cables last week .
The Swiss bank account of the Australian former computer hacker was today closed by the PostFinance bank . ""
The Australian citizen provided false information regarding his place of residence during the account opening process , "" the bank said in a statement ."
2010-12-06,"International pressure on Julian Assange intensified tonight , as the US attorney general disclosed that he had authorised "" significant "" actions aimed at prosecuting the WikiLeaks founder over the release of thousands of diplomatic cables .
Eric Holder , who did not specify what these actions might be , also said his justice department was examining ways to stem the flow of leaked cables .
His comments came as a Swiss bank announced it had closed Assange 's account because he had given "" false information "" .
Earlier the US - based commerce business PayPal also froze the WikiLeaks account .
Assange has $ 61,000 ( Â£38,000 ) in PayPal and $ 37,000 in the Swiss account , sources said .
The US attorney general , speaking at a press conference in Washington , said : "" The lives of people who work for the American people have been put at risk .
The American people themselves have been put at risk by these actions that I believe are arrogant , misguided and ultimately not helpful in any way .
We are doing everything that we can . ""
Asked if he might mount a prosecution under the Espionage Act , Holder said : "" That is certainly something that might play a role , but there are other statutes , other tools at our disposal . ""
Holder added that he had given the go - ahead for a number of unspecified actions as part of a criminal investigation into WikiLeaks .
"" I personally authorised a number of things last week and that 's an indication of the seriousness with which we take this matter and the highest level of involvement at the department of justice , "" he said .
He refused to say whether the Obama administration would try to shut down WikiLeaks .
"" I do n't want to get into what our capabilities are , "" Holder said .
"" We are looking at all the things we can do to try to stem the flow of this information . ""
The Obama administration is facing criticism , mainly from conservatives , over what they claim is an inadequate response to WikiLeaks .
The Swiss bank that closed Assange 's account today , Swiss PostFinance , the banking arm of the Swiss post office , said : "" The decision comes after it was revealed that Assange provided false information regarding his place of residence when opening the account . ""
WikiLeaks had advertised the PostFinance account details online to "" donate directly to the Julian Assange and other WikiLeaks Staff Defence Fund , "" giving an account name of "" Assange Julian Paul , Geneve "" .
The bank said there was no proof of residence .
The leaks have created major disruption and embarrassment at the US state department , throwing into question whether some of the more critical and candid diplomats can remain in post .
The Daily Beast website quoted an unnamed Obama administration source saying the state department is planning to recall some of them and that , in some cases , it would be dangerous for them to remain in their posts .
"" We 're going to have to pull out some of our best people
â€ ¦ because they dared to report back the truth about the nations in which they serve , "" a senior US national security official said , according to the Daily Beast .
A state department official did not confirm such moves were planned , only that staff would be transferred if necessary .
John Kerry , the Democratic chairman of the Senate foreign affairs committee , in a weekend interview , suggested he thought a reshuffle is necessary and that he would be advocating that behind the scenes .
The former US ambassador to Afghanistan , Zalmay Khalilzad , was more specific , saying comments made about corruption by the present incumbent , Karl Eikenberry , made him redundant as an interlocutor .
A German political party has called for the US ambassador there to be brought home because of remarks he made about it .
John H Coatsworth , dean of Columbia university 's school of international and public affairs ( Sipa ) , today sent a note to students affirming that freedom of information and expression was at the core of the school 's beliefs .
The school 's office had sent out a warning from a state department official that their future job prospects could be jeopardised if they look at the leaked cables , which remain officially classified .
Coatsworth said : "" Sipa 's position is that students have a right to discuss and debate any information in the public arena that they deem relevant to their studies or to their roles as global citizens , and to do so without fear of adverse consequences .
The WikiLeaks documents are accessible to Sipa students ( and everyone else ) from a wide variety of respected sources , as are multiple means of discussion and debate both in and outside of the classroom . ""
In a Time magazine poll , Assange is the leading contender to be named Person of the Year ."
2010-12-06,"The international pressure on Julian Assange increased today after the banking arm of the Swiss post office announced that it had closed the WikiLeaks founder 's account because he had given "" false information "" . ""
PostFinance has ended its business relationship with … Julian Paul Assange , "" the bank said in a statement . ""
The Australian citizen provided false information regarding his place of residence during the account opening process .
"" It said that although Assange had given his residence as an undisclosed address in Geneva , he could offer no proof of being a Swiss resident .
WikiLeaks had advertised the PostFinance account details online to "" donate directly to the Julian Assange and other WikiLeaks Staff Defence Fund , "" giving an account name of "" Assange Julian Paul , Geneve "" .
A spokesman for the bank told the Associated Press the account was closed this afternoon , but added that there would be "" no criminal consequences "" for misleading authorities .
"" That 's his money , he will get his money back , "" he said .
"" We just close the account and that 's it . ""
PostFinance is the latest institution to sever its ties with Assange and WikiLeaks .
Last week , Amazon.com withdrew its hosting of WikiLeaks ' cables site and the WikiLeaks.org domain was taken offline by Everydns.net .
On Saturday , PayPal , which is owned by the auction website eBay , froze WikiLeaks ' account , saying it was being used for "" illegal "" activity .
It was also reported this afternoon that Scotland Yard had received the paperwork required to arrest Assange over allegations of sexual assault in Sweden .
But the Metropolitan police declined to comment on the claim , attributed by Press Association to unnamed sources .
Swedish prosecutors have sent an international arrest warrant to the Met , seeking the extradition of Assange for questioning on allegations – which he strongly denies – of rape , sexual molestation and unlawful coercion .
Jennifer Robinson , one of his lawyers , said his legal team had heard nothing from the police to suggest that their client 's arrest was imminent .
Assange , who is staying in Britain , has come under criticism from politicians in the US and around the world after his site started publishing excerpts from a cache of more than 250,000 secret US diplomatic cables last week .
Another of Assange 's lawyers , Mark Stephens , yesterday denounced the extradition warrant as a "" political stunt "" and said his client would fight deportation to Sweden on the grounds that it could lead to him being handed over to the US , where senior politicians have called for him to be executed ."
2010-12-06,"What do Julian Assange and some climate activists have in common ?
Answer :
Neither seem to understand that effective diplomacy requires some secrecy .
Here 's what I mean : Assange , the man behind WikiLeaks , seems to think that indiscriminately publishing hundreds of thousands of diplomatic cables will somehow improve the world .
I 'm as opposed to counterproductive secrecy as much as the next guy , but by making private diplomacy much more difficult , WikiLeaks is undercutting efforts aimed at peaceful conflict resolution .
As my former FAS colleague Steve Aftergood , a leading anti - secrecy crusader , wrote last week , "" If [ WikiLeaks ] were anti - war , it would safeguard , not disrupt , the conduct of diplomatic communications . ""
Meanwhile , at the Cancún climate talks , we 're once again hearing complaints about secret discussions and backroom deals from people who seem ideologically opposed to the idea .
Andy Revkin has a good rundown of the phenomenon over at Dot Earth : "" At almost every negotiation in recent years aimed at building a new international climate agreement , a batch of delegates and United Nations officials huddle at the end of the first week to start framing some kind of text …
That process , which is vital considering there are nearly 200 countries involved , has always led to charges of secret deals and powerful nations shouldering out the smallest or poorest …
On Friday afternoon , three non - governmental organisations charged that a ' secret Mexican text ' was being drafted … "" Andy seems conflicted about whether this is wise .
On the one hand , he writes that the process is "" vital "" .
On the other , here 's what he says further down : "" Later in the day , Christiana Figueres , the UN official running things , categorically denied any such move at a news conference … .
I do n't doubt her , given how foolish it would be , after what happened in Copenhagen , to try an end run around any group of countries in these deliberations .
"" I ca n't say I agree .
Negotiated deals do n't result from public tweaking of complex documents .
They require the sort of leadership that a good "" Mexican Text "" – basically a draft accord that attempts to find a compromise – would provide .
And the Mexican hosts of the conference ca n't produce something useful unless they can have private conversations with the various negotiating parties about their bottom lines .
( Do you think that arms control treaties would even happen if every proposal and counterproposal had to be made in the open ?
Or that the Kyoto Protocol , which so many climate purists revere , was created without backroom deals ? )
To me , this is just another symptom of the utopianism that , while admirable in some ways , too often prevents the UN climate talks from getting serious work done .
My former CFR colleague Walter Mead has been vicious in savaging the UN process for this , and while I think that he 's often been over the top , there 's an important core of truth in much of what he 's written .
Do climate activists and diplomats want to create a new model of maximally inclusive and open diplomacy ?
Then they 're going to have to give up on doing much about climate change .
Do they want to do something serious about climate change ?
Then they 're going to have to start getting serious about how diplomacy really works .

2010-12-07,"WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange was today refused bail and remanded in custody until 14 December over claims he committed sex offences in Sweden .
Assange told City of Westminster magistrates court today that he intended to fight his extradition , setting up what could be a long legal battle .
The 39-year - old Australian turned himself in to Scotland Yard this morning to face a European arrest warrant .
He was asked by the court whether he understood that he could consent to be extradited to Sweden , where he faces allegations of rape , molestation and unlawful coercion , involving two women .
Assange said : "" I understand that and I do not consent . ""
Assange denies the allegations , which stem from a visit to Sweden in August .
He and his lawyers claim the accusations stem from a "" dispute over consensual but unprotected sex "" , and have said the case has taken on political overtones .
Swedish prosecutor Marianne Ny has rejected those claims .
Journalist John Pilger , filmmaker Ken Loach , and socialite Jemima Khan were among six people in court willing to offer surety .
They all offered at least Â£20,000 each .
An anonymous individual offered Â£60,000 .
But District Judge Howard Riddle refused the WikiLeaks founder bail on the grounds that he had access to financial means and might fail to surrender .
The judge said these were "" serious allegations against someone who has comparatively weak community ties in this country and the means and ability to abscond "" .
But he rejected the prosecution claim that bail should be rejected on the grounds of Assange 's safety .
Assange appeared in court in blue suit with a white shirt .
Asked to give an address he replied : "" PO Box 4080 .
"" When the question was asked again , he said : "" Do you want it for correspondence or for some other reason ? ""
Later , the WikiLeaks founder , who was accompanied by officials from the Australian high commission , gave an address in his native Australia .
Gemma Lindfield , for the Swedish authorities , told the court Assange was wanted in connection with four allegations .
She said the first complainant , Miss A , said she was victim of "" unlawful coercion "" on the night of 14 August in Stockholm .
The court heard Assange is accused of using his body weight to hold her down in a sexual manner .
The second charge alleged Assange "" sexually molested "" Miss A by having sex with her without a condom when it was her "" express wish "" one should be used .
The third charge claimed Assange "" deliberately molested "" Miss A on 18 August "" in a way designed to violate her sexual integrity "" .
The fourth charge accused Assange of having sex with a second woman , Miss W , on 17 August without a condom while she was asleep at her Stockholm home .
A European arrest warrant issued by the Swedish authorities was received by officers at the Metropolitan police extradition unit last night .
An earlier warrant , issued last month , was not valid as officials had failed to fill in the form properly .
Assange has been at the centre of an international row since WikiLeaks released a huge tranche of US embassy cables , in conjunction with five news organisations including the Guardian , at the beginning of last week .
The sex offence allegations are a separate case .
"" This case is not about WikiLeaks , "" Riddle told the court .
WikiLeaks faces increasing problems continuing to operate .
Today , Visa said it had suspended all payments to the organisation "" pending further investigation "" , while MasterCard said it was "" taking action to ensure that WikiLeaks can no longer accept MasterCard - branded products "" .
Earlier today , Robert Gates , the US defence secretary , welcomed Assange 's arrest .
Speaking to reporters on a visit to US troops in Afghanistan , Gates said : "" I had n't heard that , but that sounds like good news to me . ""
Assange defended the leak of the embassy cables in an article in the Australian today , saying : "" The swirling storm around WikiLeaks today reinforces the need to defend the right of all media to reveal the truth . """
2010-12-07,"8.47am :
The WikiLeaks story continues to focus on the fate of Julian Assange as much as the contents of the leaked cables .
Assange was meeting his lawyers Mark Stephens and Jennifer Robinson this morning and is expected to meet police within hours .
He will release a video statement later today .
Last night Robinson said : "" We have a received an arrest warrant [ related to claims in Sweden ] .
We are negotiating a meeting with police .
"" Our legal affairs correspondent Afua Hirsch explains how Assange 's legal team will fight extradition .
Robert Booth reports on how the net has tightened around Assange since WikiLeaks began publishing thousands of classified cables .
Meanwhile , the US attorney general Eric Holder said his justice department was examining ways to stem the flow of leaked cables , as PayPal and a Swiss bank took action against WikiLeaks .
Here are the headlines on the latest leaked cables .
â€¢ Secret Nato plans to defend Baltics from Russia â€¢ Burma general considered Manchester United buyout â€¢ Poland wants missile shield to protect against Russia â€¢ Sudan warned to block Iranian arms bound for Gaza â€¢ US pressured UN climate chief to bar Iranian from job â€¢ Algeria goes from security joke to US ally in Maghreb

9.19am :
The Daily Mail 's Richard Pendlebury travelled to Enkoping in Sweden to examine the alleged sexual assault case against Julian Assange .
The Mail has been portraying Assange as a international Bond villain in recent days , and there are plenty of sordid details in Pendlebury 's article .
But it also examines "" several puzzling flaws in the prosecution case "" .
He says Assange 's supporters suspect US dirty tricks : They argue that the whole squalid affair is a sexfalla , which translates loosely from the Swedish as a ' honeytrap ' .
One thing is clear , though : Sweden 's complex rape laws are central to the story .
Using a number of sources including leaked police interviews , we can begin to piece together the sequence of events which led to Assange 's liberty being threatened by Stockholm police rather than Washington , where already one U.S. politician has called on him to executed for "" spying "" .
9.28am :
Assange 's lawyers have pointed out that he will not be appearing in court today , but is expected to meet police later .
My colleague Sam Jones has been talking to Assange 's lawyer Mark Stephens .
Sam emailed this note :
Seems the pre - hearing meeting with police has yet to go ahead and there will be "" scheduling "" discussions around the magistrates court appearance that could take days to hammer out .
If and when it happens , Stephens says , they 'll give it out - or the police will leak it .
Last night Stephens told Newsnight that the arrest warrant against Assange was a "" political stunt "" and that his client had repeatedly offered to talk to the Swedish authorities .
It 's about time we got to the end of the day
and we got some truth , justice and rule of law .
Julian Assange has been the one in hot pursuit to vindicate himself to clear his good name .
He has been trying to meet with her [ the Swedish prosecutor ] to find out what the allegations are he has to face and also the evidence against him , which he still has n't seen .
9.40am : We are hanging on every word of Mark Stephens at the moment .
This is what he told PA on his way to work : I have n't even seen the warrant yet .
We have got 10 days to do this and a lot of complex schedules to organise .
I am sure it will be announced when it happens .
I have not yet spoken to the police .
Stephens declined to say where Assange is and where he expected to be arrested and interviewed .
9.55am : The cyber war over WikiLeaks appears to be escalating , with supporters of the site reportedly taking revenge against the Swiss bank that froze Assange 's assets .
Operation Payback is now threatening to go after PayPal after claiming credit for shutting down the website of the Swiss bank PostFinance , Raw Story claims .
The site of the bank is currently unavailable .
On its Twitter account the group said : "" PAYPAL.COM IS DOWN !
AND YES WE ARE FIRING NOW ! ! !
KEEP FIRING ! ""
10.18am :
Sky News is reporting that Assange was arrested at 9.30am .
It says he is expected to appear before City of Westminster magistrates court later today .
10.26am :
Police say Julian Assange ( left ) has been arrested on Swedish warrant , AP confirms .
10.30am
: Here 's a statement from Metropolitan police : Officers from the Metropolitan police extradition unit have this morning arrested Julian Assange on behalf of the Swedish authorities on suspicion of rape .
Julian Assange , 39 , was arrested on a European arrest warrant by appointment at a London police station at 9.30am .
He is accused by the Swedish authorities of one count of unlawful coercion , two counts of sexual molestation and one count of rape , all alleged to have been committed in August 2010 .
Assange is due to appear at City of Westminster magistrates court today .
Sam Jones is on his way to the court .
10.33am :
Assange has written a comment piece for the Australian , which is due to be published in about 90 minutes ' time .
The paper 's Caroline Overington tweets :
10.41am
: As of last night Assange had still not been told of the full allegations against him , his lawyer Jennifer Robinson explained in a video to be published on our site soon .
10.45am :
A spokesman for City of Westminster magistrates court said Assange must appear before 12.30pm , unless a judge gives special permission for a later hearing .
We do not know what is happening at the moment .
We have not been told .
12.30pm is the cut - off time .
If they can not produce him before then , we will have to wait for a decision from the judge , whether he or she gives permission .
10.53am :
Here 's that video with comments from Assange 's lawyers .
11.02am :
More details are emerging about Assange 's meeting with the police .
He was accompanied by both his British lawyers , Mark Stephens and Jennifer Robinson .
The plans for the meeting continued to "" chop and change "" to prevent the event becoming a media circus , according to sources .
Assange will release a video statement later today .
WikiLeaks had threatened to issue an encryption code that would release all of the remaining cables , if Assange was arrested .
But our sources say there are no current plans to do that .
11.06am :
The Australian has issued a sneak preview of Assange 's op - ed piece due later today :
Mr Assange begins by saying : "" In 1958 , a young Rupert Murdoch , then owner and editor of Adelaide 's the News , wrote : ' In the race between secrecy and truth , it seems inevitable that truth will always win . '
"" It goes on to say a few more things about freedom of speech ; the "" dark days "" of corrupt government in Queensland ( where Assange was raised ) ; the Fitzgerald inquiry ; and it says much about his upbringing in a country town , "" where people spoke their minds bluntly "" .
It says that Australian politicians are chanting a "" provably false chorus "" with the US State Department of "" You 'll risk lives !
You 'll endanger troops ! "" by releasing information , and "" then they say there is nothing of importance in what Wikileaks publishes .
It ca n't be both . ""
11.19am :
The BBC tweets : Assange 's article in the Australian will be published in full at 1 pm our time , an hour later than we said earlier .
11.28am :
WikiLeaks spokesman Kristinn Hrafnsson said the arrest would not derail the release of the cables .
"" This will not change our operation , "" he told the Associated Press news agency .
ITV 's Kier Simmons tweets that Assange will appear at 2 pm , citing a court source .
The Guardian has two reporters at the court .
Caroline Davies is inside and Sam Jones is waiting outside in the cold .
Court staff confirmed to Sam that Assange probably wo n't appear before 2 pm .
Caroline texted me this on the scene outside :
Scrum of up to 30 photographers outside Horseferry Road magistrates court .
A van arrived with blacked - out windows about 10 minutes ago , but no one could see if it was Assange .
11.40am :
Internet guru Clay Shirky has an interesting post on WikiLeaks and how America 's pursuit of the site opens it up to the charge of hypocrisy : The leaders of Myanmar and Belarus , or Thailand and Russia , can now rightly say to us : "" You went after WikiLeaks ' domain name , their hosting provider , and even denied your citizens the ability to register protest through donations , all without a warrant and all targeting overseas entities , simply because you decided you do n't like the site .
If that 's the way governments get to behave , we can live with that . ""
In this context comments by Hillary Clinton ( below ) in a Foreign Policy article earlier this year are coming back to haunt her : On their own , new technologies do not take sides in the struggle for freedom and progress .
But the United States does .
We stand for a single internet where all of humanity has equal access to knowledge and ideas .
And we recognise that the world 's information infrastructure will become what we and others make of it .
This challenge may be new , but our responsibility to help ensure the free exchange of ideas goes back to the birth of our republic .
The words of the first amendment to the constitution [ guaranteeing freedom of speech ] are carved in 50 tons of Tennessee marble on the front of this building .
And every generation of Americans has worked to protect the values etched in that stone .
11.54am :
WikiLeaks claims the arrest is an attack on media freedom , but it is worth pointing out that one of the claimants making the sexual assault allegations has strongly denied that the charges are trumped up , saying : "" The charges against Assange are of course not orchestrated by the Pentagon .
"" It should also be pointed out of course that Assange strenuously denies the sex assault charges .
The New York Times reports on how the US have been going after Assange over the separate issue of the leaked cables .
Justice department prosecutors have been struggling to find a way to indict Assange since July , when WikiLeaks made public documents on the war in Afghanistan .
But while it is clearly illegal for a government official with a security clearance to give a classified document to WikiLeaks , it is far from clear that it is illegal for the organisation to make it public .
The Justice department has considered trying to indict Assange under the Espionage Act , which has never been successfully used to prosecute a third - party recipient of a leak .
Some lawmakers have suggested accusing WikiLeaks of receiving stolen government property , but experts said Monday that would also pose difficulties .
12.07pm :
WikiLeaks just tweeted this :
12.19pm :
Here 's a lunchtime summary : â€¢ WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange was arrested at a London police station at 9.30am .
He is accused by the Swedish authorities of one count of unlawful coercion , two counts of sexual molestation and one count of rape .
He denies the charges .
He is due to appear at City of Westminster magistrates at around 2 pm .
â€¢ WikiLeaks have condemned the arrest as an attack on media freedom .
Sources claim that the group currently has no plans to publish an insurance encryption code that will release the remaining , unpublished classified cables .
In his online chat with the Guardian last Friday , Assange suggested the code would be released if "" something happens to us "" .
â€¢ The release of the cables will continue .
The latest disclosures reveal US plans to defend the Baltic states and Poland against Russia .
â€¢ Assange has criticised America 's handling of the leaks in a comment piece for the Australian , written before his arrest .
His supporters also plan to release a prerecorded video message .
In his Australian article , Assange says the US is trying to have it both ways by claiming that the contents of cables are not significant and that the release will endanger lives .
â€¢ A cyber - war over WikiLeaks appears to be escalating .
Supporters of the site are reportedly taking revenge against the Swiss bank that froze Assange 's assets , and are now targetting PayPal .
12.24pm :
All the news networks in the US are leading with the Assange story , my colleague Richard Adams rang in to tell me .
NBC Today show anchorman Matt Lauer began today 's broadcast with this gravelly - voiced announcement : "" The international manhunt for Julian Assange is over . ""
12.30pm :
My colleague Robert Booth has more on plans by WikiLeaks to carry on publishing , plus that new video message and the 256 digit encryption code for the rest of the documents .
A group calling itself Justice for Assange is planning a protest outside City of Wesminster magistrates court at 1.30pm .
12.47pm :
Assange has entered the court .
He went in the back entrance and was accompanied by his lawyers Mark Stephens and Jennifer Robinson .
They are due to to examine the charges against him .
I was on the phone to my colleague Sam Jones when it happened .
This is what it sounded like : Meanwhile , the Swedish chief prosecutor , Marianne Ny , is planning to release a statement this afternoon on the arrest of Assange , according to Foresight News .
12.54pm :
Assange 's op - ed piece in the Australian has been published .
The paper says these are the main points : â€¢ WikiLeaks is fearlessly publishing facts that need to be made public .
â€¢
The dark days of corruption in the Queensland government before the Fitzgerald inquiry are testimony to what happens when the politicians gag the media from reporting the truth .
â€¢ ( My idea is ) to use internet technologies in new ways to report the truth .
â€¢ People have said I am anti - war : for the record , I am not .
Sometimes nations need to go to war , and there are just wars .
â€¢ The Gillard government ( Australia ) is trying to shoot the messenger because it does n't want the truth revealed .
It is worth quoting Assange 's final remarks in full : The US diplomatic cables reveal some startling facts : the US asked its diplomats to steal personal human material and information from UN officials and human rights groups , including DNA , fingerprints , iris scans , credit card numbers , internet passwords and ID photos , in violation of international treaties .
Presumably Australian UN diplomats may be targeted , too .
King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia asked the US officials in Jordan and Bahrain want [ sic ] Iran 's nuclear program stopped by any means available .
Britain 's Iraq inquiry was fixed to protect "" US interests "" .
Sweden is a covert member of Nato and US intelligence - sharing is kept from parliament .
The US is playing hardball to get other countries to take freed detainees from GuantÃ¡namo Bay .
Barack Obama agreed to meet the Slovenian president only if Slovenia took a prisoner .
Our Pacific neighbour Kiribati was offered millions of dollars to accept detainees .
In its landmark ruling in the Pentagon Papers case , the US supreme court said "" only a free and unrestrained press can effectively expose deception in government "" .
The swirling storm around WikiLeaks today reinforces the need to defend the right of all media to reveal the truth .
1.02pm :
Another key paragraph from Assange 's Australian article : Democratic societies need a strong media and WikiLeaks is part of that media .
The media helps keep government honest .
WikiLeaks has revealed some hard truths about the Iraq and Afghan wars , and broken stories about corporate corruption .
1.09pm
: Back on the other side of the world , the Press Association news agency has this on Assange 's entering the magistrates court in Horseferry Road , London : Julian Assange was mobbed by photographers as he arrived at court with Mark Stephens and the rest of his legal team .
He is due to appear before District Judge Caroline Tubbs in court one at 2 pm , court staff said .
Speaking outside court , Stephens said his client is "" fine "" .
Asked about the meeting with police , he replied : "" It was very cordial .
They have verified his identity .
They are satisfied he is the real Julian Assange and we are ready to go into court . ""
1.15pm :
Afua Hirsch , our legal affairs editor , explains the extradition process and what is likely to happen in the court : Assange 's arrest by police this morning will kickstart the fast - tracked extradition process , using the European arrest warrant system to attempt to return him to Sweden , where he is wanted for questioning regarding a rape charge .
Swedish criminal law experts said this morning that little was known about the actual rape allegations Assange is facing in the country , in line with legal requirements to protect anonymity and preserve confidentiality for sex crimes .
However the activation of an EAW by UK police suggests Assange has now been formally charged by Swedish prosecutors , and could face a period of detention in Sweden upon his return .
But Assange 's legal team remains determined to fight his extradition on grounds ranging from the failure of authorities to provide him with details of the warrant issued by Sweden , and human rights grounds â€ “ including that the WikiLeaks founder may be unfairly deprived of his liberty in Sweden , and that he risks not facing a fair trial .
The media attention surrounding Assange 's case is likely to complicate any future criminal proceedings , although the lack of a jury system in Sweden is likely to fuel arguments that he will be protected from public and media interest in the case .
Assange 's first appearance at Westminster magistrates court today will be primarily concerned with formalities , including establishing his identity and determining whether he consents to the extradition .
The court will then adjourn for a full extradition hearing , which has to be within 21 days .
A key issue will be whether Assange is released on bail during that period .
His lawyers are reported to be putting together a generous bail package , including a security of at least Â£100,000 and a surety â€ “ where third parties guarantee to pay the court if he absconds .
Experts say a large bail amount is likely to secure bail , although the crime for which Assange is wanted by Sweden is rape , a serious offence for which bail is often harder to secure .
If extradited to Sweden under the EAW â€ “ a process which could be concluded quickly under the fast - track procedure â€ “ Assange will be vulnerable to other extradition requests from countries including the US .
1.48pm : Assange 's lawyers are likely to argue that the extradition hearing in the UK ca n't be fair , because of the unprecedented media attention , the Guardian 's Afua Hirsch just told Sky News ( left ) .
1.54pm :
Dianne Feinstein , the Democratic chair of the US Senate 's intelligence committee , said Assange "" should be vigorously prosecuted for espionage "" .
Writing in the Wall Street Journal , she says : The law Mr Assange continues to violate is the Espionage Act of 1917 .
That law makes it a felony for an unauthorised person to possess or transmit "" information relating to the national defence which information the possessor has reason to believe could be used to the injury of the United States or to the advantage of any foreign nation "" .
The Espionage Act also makes it a felony to fail to return such materials to the US government .
Importantly , the courts have held that "" information relating to the national defence "" applies to both classified and unclassified material .
Each violation is punishable by up to 10 years in prison .
1.58pm : Assange is due to appear in court in the next few minutes , according to a tweet from Channel 4 News .
The freedom on information campaigner Heather Brooke , who worked with the Guardian on the cables , is also there .
She just tweeted this :
2.03pm :
Hamid Karzai has been teasing the Americans and David Cameron about WikiLeaks , according to my colleague Polly Curtis , who accompanied Cameron to Kabul .
Making light of what has clearly been a tricky diplomatic period after the WikiLeaks revelations , Karzai said : "" You should wait for the British WikiLeaks . ""
Cameron responded : "" We were always nice about you , "" to which Karzai answered : "" Most of the time . ""
2.07pm
: More financial problems for WikiLeaks : Visa says it has suspended all payments to WikiLeaks "" pending further investigation "" .
Earlier MasterCard said : "" MasterCard is taking action to ensure that WikiLeaks can no longer accept MasterCard - branded products .
"" 2.08pm : US defence secretary Robert Gates has welcomed the arrest of Assange .
Speaking to reporters on a visit to US troops in Afghanistan , Gates smirked on hearing the news .
"" I had n't heard that , but that sounds like good news to me , "" he said .
2.10pm :
The socialite Jemima Khan has appeared in the court with Julian Assange , according to Sky News .
2.28pm : Assange said he would fight extradition to Sweden , according to the Associated Press news agency .
2.33pm :
WikiLeaks has put out another appeal for funding . ""
KEEP US STRONG - DONATE "" , it tweeted .
With what ?
The Press Association news agency has more on Visa 's decision to cut off payments : The card payment operator said an inquiry is under way into how the organisation operates .
The whistle - blowing website has suffered repeated denial of service attacks , moved server , lost its PayPal service and had a key Swiss bank account closed .
WikiLeaks relies on online donations from a worldwide network of supporters to fund its work .
A spokesman said : "" Visa Europe has taken action to suspend Visa payment acceptance on WikiLeaks ' website pending further investigation into the nature of its business and whether it contravenes Visa operating rules . ""
2.35pm : Assange sought consular assistance from the Australian high commission , according to Channel 4 News .
Sky claims that members of the commission are inside the court with Assange .
2.51pm :
The two women concerned in the case regarded the used of a condom as a prerequiste for sex , the court heard , according to the legal affairs commentator Joshua Rozenberg , who was in the court .
Rozenberg told Sky News that charges were read out to Assange .
In one of the cases Assange was alleged to have had sex with a woman who was asleep , the court heard , according to Rozenberg .
The other case allegedly involved coercion , he said .
Assange 's lawyers made clear that the case would not finish today , Rozenberg said .
The prosecution , representing the Swedish authorities , objected to bail on two grounds : that Assange failed to surrender and that he should stay in custody for his own protection , Rozenberg reported .
2.58pm : The journalist John Pilger and the film director Ken Loach have also been seen in court , according to various sources .
They together with Jemima Khan are apparently all there to provide surety if bail is granted to Assange .
3.03pm :
AP has this filed its first take on court proceedings : WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange told a London court on Tuesday he intends to fight his extradition to Sweden on sex crime allegations , setting up what could be a drawn - out legal battle .
The 39-year - old Australian appeared before City of Westminster magistrates court after turning himself in to Scotland Yard earlier Tuesday to face a Swedish arrest warrant .
He was asked whether he understood that he could consent to be extradited to Sweden , where he faces allegations of rape , molestation and unlawful coercion .
Clearing his throat , Assange said : "" I understand that and I do not consent . ""
Assange denies the allegations , which stem from a visit to Sweden in August .
Assange and his lawyers claim the accusations stem from a "" dispute over consensual but unprotected sex , "" and have said the case has taken on political overtones .
Swedish prosecutor Marianne Ny has rejected those claims .
Lawyers for Assange and the British government were still arguing on Tuesday over whether Assange should be granted bail .
3.04pm : Assange was refused bail , and will be remanded in custody till 14 December .
3.22pm :
My colleagues Paul Owen and Caroline Davies have filed this story on Assange being refused bail .
3.32pm :
"" This case is not about WikiLeaks , "" district judge Howard Riddle told the court , according to my colleague Sam Jones , who was there .
Riddle refused bail on the grounds there was a risk he would fail to surrender .
He rejected the prosecution claim that bail should be rejected on the grounds of Assange 's safety .
John Pilger , Ken Loach , and Jemima Khan were among six people in court willing to offer surety .
They all offered at least Â£20,000 .
An anonymous individual offered surety of Â£60,000 .
Assange appeared in court in a blue suit , white shirt and no tie .
Asked to give an address he replied "" PO Box 4080 "" .
When the question was asked again , he said : "" Do you want it for correspondence or for some other reason ? ""
Later he gave an address in Australia .
3.33pm :
Speaking outside the court John Pilger described the judge 's failure to offer bail as "" unjust "" .
Every journalist should be supporting Assange 100 % he said .
3.34pm :
My Washington - based colleague Richard Adams has been watching CNN 's coverage .
He spotted this gem : When Ken Loach appeared leaving the courtroom just now , to much excitement , it was shown live on cable news here and CNN were utterly stumped .
"" Who was that gentleman ?
It may be Julian Assange 's attorney ; we 're trying to find out . ""
3.37pm :
My colleague Caroline Davies , who was also in court , has more detail on why the judge turned down Assange 's request for bail .
He said these were "" serious allegations against someone who has comparatively weak community ties in this country and the means and ability to abscond "" .
3.38pm :
Speaking to the media scrum Jemima Khan ( left ) said she did not know Julian Assange .
She said she was offering support for him because of her backing for freedom on speech .
3.42pm :
"" We are in the rather exotic position of not seeing any of the evidence against him [ Assange ] , "" the WikiLeaks founder 's lawyer , Mark Stephens , has said .
"" This is going to go viral , "" he added .
Many people believe these charges are politically motivated , he said .
Assange could have been safely released today , Stephens told reporters .
These allegations are very thin indeed , he said .
He confirmed that further bail applications will be made .
Stephens claimed that Assange will be vindicated .
He added that the release of the US embassy cables would continue .
3.45pm :
More details on the charges , from the Press Association news agency : Gemma Lindfield , for the Swedish authorities , told the court Assange was wanted in connection with four allegations .
She said the first complainant , Miss A , said she was victim of "" unlawful coercion "" on the night of 14 August in Stockholm .
The court heard Assange is accused of using his body weight to hold her down in a sexual manner .
The second charge alleged Assange "" sexually molested "" Miss A by having sex with her without a condom when it was her "" express wish "" one should be used .
The third charge claimed Assange "" deliberately molested "" Miss A on 18 August "" in a way designed to violate her sexual integrity "" .
The fourth charge accused Assange of having sex with a second woman , Miss W , on 17 August without a condom while she was asleep at her Stockholm home .
3.54pm :
Here 's more of the comments Stephens made outside the court , which I missed the first time : WikiLeaks will continue .
WikiLeaks is many thousands of journalists around the world .
A renewed bail application will be made .
We have heard the judge today say that he wishes to see the evidence himself .
He was impressed by the fact that a number of people were prepared to stand up on behalf of Mr Assange .
In those circumstances I think we will see another bail application .
They [ those offering surety ] were but the tip of the iceberg .
This is going to go viral .
Many people believe Mr Assange to be innocent , myself included .
Many people believe that this prosecution is politically motivated .
I 'm sure that the British judicial system is robust enough not to be interfered with by politicians and that are judges are impartial and fair .
I hope I can say the same about Swedish prosecutors in the future .
4.06pm :
Sam Jones watched the moment Assange was driven away .
At 3.41pm Assange was driven away from court to shouts from protesters of "" Julian we love you . ""
Sam also caught more of John Pilger 's comments .
Speaking outside the court the veteran journalist and filmaker said : "" I was prepared to do it [ offer Â£20,000 as surety ] because there was a possibility of an injustice being perpetrated against Julian Assange personally .
He has been a doing the job of a journalist and he deserves the support of people who believe that the free flow of information is the bedrock of a democracy . ""
4.07pm :
Our legal affairs correspondent Afua Hirsch says it is very rare for bail to be offered in a rape case : The decision to deny Assange bail is less surprising than many might think .
Rape is a notoriously difficult offence for which to get bail in criminal proceedings .
In many cases this is because of the risk of reoffending or danger to the victim .
But in Assange 's case â€ “ as is often an issue with extradition proceedings
â€ “
the problem is the lack of a permanent address in the UK , the difficulty of setting clear bail conditions that would persuade prosecutors that his whereabouts could be guaranteed , and the risk of his absconding .
In many cases those risks are regarded as sufficiently high that large amounts of security - a deposit paid into court and forfeited in the event of the suspect absconding â€ “ do not persuade magistrates that a person should be released on bail .
Although Assange will now be detained in prison , he will be kept in more relaxed conditions than those for prisoners who have been sentenced , including not having to wear prison uniform and having frequent access to visits and phone calls .
But his lawyers will be keen to speed up the coming extradition proceedings in light of his detention .
In most cases where a suspect is kept in custody , a full extradition hearing is held within the legal time limit of 21 days .
4.14pm :
Charles Arthur , the Guardian 's technology editor , points out that while MasterCard and Visa have cut WikiLeaks off you can still use those cards to donate to overtly racist organisations such as the Knights Party , which is supported by the Ku Klux Klan .
The Ku Klux Klan website directs users to a site called Christian Concepts .
It takes Visa and MasterCard donations for users willing to state that they are "" white and not of racially mixed descent .
I am not married to a non - white .
I do not date non - whites nor do I have non - white dependents .
I believe in the ideals of western Christian civilisation and profess my belief in Jesus Christ as the son of God . ""
4.20pm :
Mark Stephens was asked about Visa and MasterCard 's withdrawal of support for WikiLeaks .
He replied : I am advised that WikiLeaks can continue to exist .
They have many thousands of journalists in a virtual journalistic community around the world , and they will continue .
We are at only cable 301 today .
We will see the rest of those 250,000 cables coming out so that full information is available .
4.33pm :
The WikiLeaks crisis is holding back talks on Jewish settlements in the West Bank , according to the Israeli defence minister , Ehud Barak .
Haaretz quoted him saying that contacts with the United States over a renewed moratorium on West Bank construction had been frozen in the wake of the WikiLeaks crisis and the tensions between North and South Korea .
"" We have not reached understanding with the United States on how to resume the construction freeze , "" Barak told the Knesset foreign affairs and defence committee . ""
The negotiations with the Palestinians are of utmost priority for Israel and we must aspire to make them happen .
"" 4.49pm :
Swedish prosecutor Marianne Ny says the rape case against Assange has nothing to do WikiLeaks , Reuters reports : The sexual misconduct case against WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange is a personal matter and not connected with his work releasing secret US diplomatic cables , a Swedish prosecutor said on Tuesday .
"" We have nothing which indicates that this is a plot , "" prosecutor Marianne Ny was quoted by newspaper Aftonbladet as saying at a news conference in the western city of Gothenburg .
4.55pm :
This is Richard Adams in the Guardian 's Washington bureau , taking over from Matthew Weaver .
The arrest of Julian Assange is of course huge news here in the US , dominating the cable news coverage and a subject of debate pretty much everywhere else .
4.56pm :
My colleagues Caroline Davies and Sam Jones have just filed this news story on the Assange case .
5.05pm :
My colleague Josh Halliday sends over news of a warm welcome for Julian Assange being offered by the Swiss Pirate Party : The Swiss Pirate party has just sent an open letter to the country 's federal council urging it to allow Julian Assange asylum .
"" What has happened in the US â€ “ political pressure leading to the suppression of free speech by private companies like PayPal , Amazon , EveryDNS and Tableau â€ “ should not be allowed to happen in Switzerland , "" the letter warns , adding : "" For all these reasons a consistent and uncompromising digital policy is needed .
"" WikiLeaks.ch , currently the primary domain name for the whistleblowers ' site , was registered by the Swiss Pirate party in June , before becoming WikiLeaks ' main access point last week after being dropped by its DNS host .
The party referred 4,000 people a second to WikiLeaks through WikiLeaks.ch on Sunday , it has told the Guardian .
"" We urge you to counter the interventions by the US and their ambassador in Switzerland .
On the grounds of digital politics , the question of asylum for Julian Assange should be examined , "" the letter goes on .
5.14pm :
The daily state department briefing has taken place in Foggy Bottom and WikiLeaks and Assange came up â€ “ here are some details .
Philip Crowley , the state department press spokesman , says : "" What WikiLeaks has done is a crime under US law . ""
Note that Crowley does n't say which law WikiLeaks has broken , and that 's the tricky part .
Senator Joe Lieberman is on Fox News , saying that the department of justice should indict Assange under the 1917 Espionage Act and try to extradict him from the UK .
Asked why this has n't happened , Lieberman admits that there is probably an argument going on over how to charge Assange .
5.15pm : Ramping up his rhetoric on Fox News just now , Senator Joe Lieberman , the head of the Senate 's homeland security committee , suggests that the New York Times and other news organisations using the WikiLeaks cables may also be investigated for breaking the US 's espionage laws .
Lieberman told Fox News : To me the New York Times has committed at least an act of bad citizenship , but whether they have committed a crime is a matter of discussion for the justice department .
5.25pm :
The Drudge Report â€ “ which began life as a website for leaked material â€
“ is currently running a tenditious headline : SOURCES : EDITORS OF TIME MAGAZINE WILL NAME WIKILEAKS FOUNDER ' PERSON OF THE YEAR ' ...
DEVELOPING ...
In fact the truth is that Julian Assange is currently leading Time 's online readers poll â€ “ and Time itself has put out a response to Drudge 's claim , saying : We never confirm or deny rumors until we reveal Time 's choice .
Time also says the readers poll is only indicative and that its editors make their own decision .
5.27pm :
Here 's an evening summary : â€¢ Julian Assange was refused bail today and will be remanded in custody till 14 December .
He was charged at City of Westminister magistrates on behalf of the Swedish authorities with of one count of unlawful coercion , two counts of sexual molestation and one count of rape .
He denies the charges .
â€¢ Assange told the court today that he intended to fight his extradition .
His lawyers said they would appeal against the refusal to grant him bail .
They also claimed that the prosecution was politically motivated , a point rejected by the Swedish authorities .
â€¢ Six people , including the journalist John Pilger , filmmaker Ken Loach , and socialite Jemima Khan , were among six people in court willing to offer surety of at Â£20,000 .
Members of the Australian high commission were also in court after Assange sought consular assistance from them .
â€¢ MasterCard and Visa have cut off support for WikiLeaks .
They claimed WikiLeaks breaches its rules , but you can still use those cards to support overtly racist orgainsations supported by the Ku Klux Klan .
â€¢ WikiLeaks has vowed to carry on publishing the classified cables .
Its lawyer Mark Stephens said it was "" virtual journalistic community around the world , and they will continue "" .
It has stopped short of release an encryption code that will automatically publish the remain documents .
â€¢
The US has welcomed the arrest of Assange . ""
That sounds like good news to me , "" said Robert Gates US defence secretary .
"" The international manhunt for Julian Assange is over , "" NBC television declared .
â€¢
The WikiLeaks crisis is holding back talks on Jewish settlements in the West Bank , according to the Israeli defence minister , Ehud Barak .
5.30pm :
With perfect timing an email arrives from Philip Crowley at the state department : The United States is pleased to announce that it will host Unesco 's World Press Freedom Day event in 2011 , from 1 - 3 May in Washington , DC .
Ironic ?
Read the next paragraph from the press release : The theme for next year 's commemoration will be 21st Century Media : New Frontiers , New Barriers .
The United States places technology and innovation at the forefront of its diplomatic and development efforts .
New media has empowered citizens around the world to report on their circumstances , express opinions on world events , and exchange information in environments sometimes hostile to such exercises of individuals ' right to freedom of expression .
At the same time , we are concerned about the determination of some governments to censor and silence individuals , and to restrict the free flow of information .
We mark events such as World Press Freedom Day in the context of our enduring commitment to support and expand press freedom and the free flow of information in this digital age .
Shameless .
You really could not make it up .
5.43pm :
A quick "" hats off "" to our fellow WikiLeaks live bloggers over at the Nation , where Greg Mitchell has been doing a fine job every day since the first US embassy cables were published .
5.58pm :
The White House has just announced that Barack Obama is holding a press briefing at 2.20pm ET
( 7.20pm GMT ) â€ “ and if he takes questions ( and it sounds like he will ) then WikiLeaks and the embassy cables might come up , although the topic of the day is the tax deal he announced last night .
Still , the White House press corps may just ask him about the weather ; it 's hard to tell .
Meanwhile , the Pentagon has changed its tune on the impact of the US embassy cables .
Last week the US defence secretary Robert Gates declared there would be no long - term impact from the WikiLeaks revelations .
Today , though , Pentagon spokesman Colonel Dave Lapan says there are indications of foreign governments "" pulling back "" from ealings with the US since the cables began to be published .
Lapan would n't give specific examples , though .
The Associated Press news agency reports Lapan as saying that "" believing the US is not good at keeping secrets ... certainly changes things , "" and that "" generally , there has been a retrenchment "" in cooperation .
And here 's more from Josh Halliday on cyber - trouble over WikiLeaks :
The website of the Swedish prosecution authority appears to be under attack by the group on online activists understood to be targetting all anti - WikiLeaks companies or departments .
Each of the six companies , including Amazon and eBay , that have severed ties with Assange and WikiLeaks in past weeks following political pressure have quickly become the subject of sustained online assaults from the group known only as Anonymous .
It took just hours for the Swiss bank , Post Finance , to be brought offline after announcing that it was closing Assange 's account on Monday .
The distributed denial of service attacks ( DDoS ) overload a website 's servers with requests to load .
Depending on how much demand the servers can withstand â€ “ a beneficial facet of larger companies such as Amazon â€ “ the site will either take longer than usual to load or be brought completely offline for a period .
Anonymous has gained notoriety for attacks on copyright - enforcement agencies and some of the world 's largest record labels .
6.08pm :
Regarding the impious thought that US state department is bashing WikiLeaks with one hand and celebrating World Press Freedom Day with the other ( see 5.30pm ) , my colleague Graeme Wearden tweets :
Now suddenly it all makes sense .
6.12pm :
My colleague Afua Hirsch explains why it is so difficult to get bail in cases involving allegations of rape , the shocked reaction of Assange 's legal team notwithstanding :
Lawyers representing people suspected of rape â€ “ either for domestic or extraditable offences
â€ “ try to secure a suspect 's freedom by offering conditions that would make prison custody unnecessary .
In Assange 's case , a surety of Â£180,000 â€ “ money placed in court that would be forfeited if Assagne absconded â€ “ was offered .
The defence also said they were willing to consider further conditions , such as the requirement to remain at home during certain hours , or even to wear an electronic tag .
But the fact that Assange does not have a permanent address in the UK
â€ “ he is currently staying with friends
â€ “ made bail far more unlikely .
In court District Judge Howard Riddle said that those conditions , and claims that Assange 's safety was at risk if he were placed in prison , were not sufficient to overcome the obstacles to granting bail , mainly Assange 's lack of "" community ties "" in the UK .
As in many extradition cases where a suspect is not based permanently in the UK , Riddle said there was a risk that Assange would fail to surrender were he released on bail .
The fact that Assange 's surety was also offered by people with whom Assange does not have close relationships â€ “ including journalist John Pilger and Jemima Khan â€ “ could also have persuaded the court that his ties were not sufficient to prevent him leaving the country .
However there is a presumption of bail under UK law , and Assange 's lawyers have vowed to make a renewed bail application , possibly strengthening the conditions attached to any release on bail .
While Assange remains in custody , future extradition proceedings are likely to be speeded up , with lawyers keen to ensure the full hearing takes place within the 21 days allotted .
6.24pm :
This just in : sources are telling the Guardian that Julian Assange is now being held in the remand wing of Wandsworth Prison in London .
( This is unconfirmed , so pinch of salt there . )
As you can see , HMP Wandsworth is one of the more delightful examples of British prison architecture .
Wandsworth is also the largest prison in the UK , with 1,600 inmates .
Any readers who have been detained at Her Majesty 's pleasure in Wandsworth are encouraged to let us know what life is going to be like in there for Assange .
6.39pm :
BoingBoing and others are flagging up the remarks by Senator Joe Lieberman that the New York Times may be the subject of investigation by the Department of Justice with a view to prosecution under the espionage laws .
It 's worth remembering that since the US government ca n't find a way to use the current espionage laws against Julian Assange , the chances of it prosecuting the New York Times probably approaches zero .
But Lieberman 's words will have a chilling effect on news organisations everywhere .
6.42pm :
Speaking of Senator Joe Lieberman 's one - man war against WikiLeaks â€ “ which mainly consists of Joe going on TV â€
“
here 's a clip of the Fox News interview referred to earlier .
6.45pm :
My colleagues Sam Jones tells me Julian Assange 's lawyers have confirmed their client is behind bars in Wandsworth Prison .
As mentioned before , it is a typically delightful example of Victorian prison architecture .
Update : a reader emails - ""
After seeing Wandsworth I bet Swedish prisons have suddenly got a lot more attractive to Mr Assange . ""
Yes , although compared to the ADX Florence super - max Federal prison in Colorado , HM Wandsworth would feel like a Club Med .
6.48pm :
Remember how a minor branch of Columbia University told its students not to access the US embassy cables released by WikiLeaks ?
Well Philip Crowley â€ “
Mr World Press Freedom Day â€ “ of the State Department says it got carried away .
The AP reports : Spokesman PJ Crowley said Tuesday the department had not issued any guidelines to private citizens on how to deal with the documents , which are still considered classified .
He said department employees have been told not to download the material to their classified computer systems .
He said that would create security concerns .
"" We have given instructions to our employees here because we are treating these documents as still classified , which means if you download these documents from an outside website to our unclassified system , it creates a security concern , "" Crowley told reporters .
"" Our instructions are to protect our unclassified network , not mix classified and unclassified information on that network , "" he said .
"" We do not control private Internet access .
We do not control private networks .
We have issued no authoritative instructions to people who are not employees of the Department of State . ""
Update :
The students involved at Columbia 's School of International and Public Affairs are themselves having a robust debate on the matter .
7 pm : The best joke of the week â€ “ so far â€ “ comes from Ben Yarrow 's Twitter account ( with a hat tip to @janinegibson ) :
Freedom of Speech - priceless .
For everything else , there 's MasterCard 7.09pm : Obama is holding a press conference in the White House briefing room in 10 minutes
â€ “ and surely even the self - absorbed White House press corps will have something to ask about the US embassy cables and WikiLeaks ?
On the other hand , a tweet from the briefing room suggests otherwise : the chatter in here awaiting Obama 's presser is about the WH Xmas party .
Hot topic : can you pub your party pics on facebook ?
7.25pm :
President Obama speaking now
â€ “
it 's all about the tax deal announced last night so far
but there may be questions regarding WikiLeaks since this is the first time journalists have had an opportunity to ask Obama directly .
7.41pm :
So far all the Obama press conference questions have been on yesterday 's tax cut deal with the Republicans .
7.51pm :
Last question being taken at Obama 's press conference â€ “ and not a single journalist raised WikiLeaks or the US embassy cables .
But why ask about the biggest story of the year when you can instead talk inside baseball about Republicans versus Democrats ?
7.55pm :
My colleague Ewen MacAskill points us towards these quotes from State Department flack PJ Crowley , suggesting that foreign governments are getting cold feet about talking to their US counterparts in the light of the WikiLeaks cables : Crowley told journalists today : "" We have already seen some indications of meetings that used to involve several diplomats and now involve fewer diplomats ...
We 're conscious of at least one meeting where it was requested that notebooks be left outside the room . ""
The Associated Press reports Crowley 's remarks that the extent of the damage remains to be seen but that it will complicate the US 's diplomatic efforts "" for a period of time "" .
"" Obviously , it will be something that we will be watching to see if particular diplomats are frozen out in countries depending on their pique over what has been revealed , "" AP quoted Crowley as saying .
8.09pm :
Hold the front page :
Sarah Palin reacts via Twitter to an article by Julian Assange in Rupert Murdoch 's newspaper
The Australian ( I think that sentence may win a prize in online news buzzword bingo ) .
President Palin just Tweeted :
Someone making things up again ?
Keep seeing this quote attributed to me .
Huh ?
Wikileaks Assange on Sarah Palin 's Criticism
http://bit.ly/dXP9za
We 'll try and translate that into English but Palin links to a National Review Online piece that quotes Assange 's comment piece : "" Sarah Palin says I should be ' hunted down like Osama bin Laden ' .
"" As the NRO writer Jim Geraghty points out , Assange has misquoted Palin there .
What she actually said was : "" Why was he not pursued with the same urgency we pursue al Qaeda and Taliban leaders ? ""
And I think we still count OBL as an al - Qaida leader .
To be fair , Palin did say that Assange should be "" pursued with the same urgency "" as OBL .
So if she meant Assange should be "" fruitlessly hunted for nine years without success , "" then yes , Assange did misquote her .
8.23pm :
So where was Julian Assange staying while in London ?
Vaughan Smith of the Frontline Club reveals all : I can confirm that Mr Assange has spent much of the last several months working from our facilities at the Frontline Club .
Earlier today I offered him an address for bail .
The Frontline Club is near Paddington station in west London , founded in 2003 as a home for foreign correspondents and other journalists by Vaughn Smith , and has a fine restaurant as well as hosting regular debates and media events .
Much of the recent footage of Assange was shot during his press conferences at the club , especially the briefing he held earlier this year when WikiLeaks released its cache of classified material from Iraq and Afghanistan .
Smith says he attended today 's court appearance to show his support for Assange and WikiLeaks on a point of principle : "" In the face of a concerted attempt to shut him down and after a decade since 9/11 that has been characterised by manipulation of the media by the authorities , the information released by Wikileaks is a refreshing glimpse into an increasingly opaque world . ""
8.38pm :
Here 's a statement by the Guardian 's Alan Rusbridger on our plans to keep publishing the US embassy cables : "" The charges [ against Julian Assange ] relate to alleged sex offences in Sweden and appear to have no bearing on the original leak of the US embassy cables , or on the Guardian 's publication of the material .
We have been told by WikiLeaks that Mr Assange 's arrest will not affect plans for the publication of further cables . ""
8.56pm :
So what legal action can the US department of justice actually take against WikiLeaks and Julian Assange ?
NBC 's Pete Williams has thoughts : What did Attorney General Eric Holder mean when he said Monday that "" there are other statutes , other tools that we have at our disposal , "" beyond the laws against espionage , that could be used to prosecute Julian Assange ?
9.02pm :
With the US government championing World Press Freedom Day while also trying to squash WikiLeaks â€ “ Jeroen Kraan gets in touch : "" Check out the World Press Freedom Day Facebook page .
Commenters are having a ball , as you 'd expect .
"" And indeed , so they are : "" Will you be inviting Jullian Assange ?
He 's done some fantastic work in this area , "" wonders one .
"" This reminds me of the time Iran tried to join the UN 's womens ' rights groups , "" writes another .
Jeroen himself comments : "" Stephen Colbert , you can admit you 're behind this event now . ""
Meanwhile , BoingBoing offers its version of the State Department 's seal ( above ) .
9.33pm :
Back to the US embassy cables themselves â€ “
the Guardian 's David Leigh has the cables revealing that the Lockerbie bomber was released after the British government became concerned by Libya 's "" thuggish "" threats : The British government 's deep fears that Libya would take "" harsh and immediate "" action against UK interests if the convicted Lockerbie bomber died in a Scottish prison are revealed in secret US embassy cables which show London 's full support for the early release of Abdelbaset al - Megrahi .
Muammar Gaddafi , the Libyan leader , made explicit and "" thuggish "" threats to halt all trade deals with Britain and harass embassy staff if Megrahi remained in jail , the cables show .
At the same time "" a parade of treats "" was offered by Libya to the Scottish devolved administration if it agreed to let him go , though the cable says they were turned down .
9.38pm :
The Guardian 's latest WikiLeaks coverage looks at what US diplomats think about Muammar Gaddafi , describing the Libyan leader as a "" mercurial and eccentric "" figure who suffers from severe phobias , enjoys flamenco dancing , acts on his whims and irritates his friends and enemies .
9.43pm :
The Guardian 's Ewen MacAskill has this bombshell revelation from the cables : Saudi Arabia proposed creating an Arab force backed by US and Nato air and sea power to intervene in Lebanon two years ago and destroy Iranian - backed Hezbollah , according to a US diplomatic cable released by WikiLeaks .
How 's that "" these cables are all old news "" argument working out ?
9.51pm :
Professor Emily Bell , formerly of the Guardian , has this analysis of the dramatic impact of the WikiLeaks deluge on the media : If you follow the latest cache of diplomatic cables leaked by Wikileaks and reported by the Guardian , The New York Times and others it is impossible not to conclude that this is a pivotal moment for journalism , its teaching and its practice .
In her piece Bell asks some of the most difficult questions raised for the media , in both old and new iterations : How many news organisations now feel differently about how to host and serve content across the web in the wake of Amazon using its commercial prerogative to kick Wikileaks off its servers ?
How many correspondents and editors would balk at ruining long term relationships with the State Department to publish classified material of the leaked cables - type ?
10.12pm :
The Guardian 's Esther Addley writes a clear and comprehensive article on the sex charges that Julian Assange now faces , a must - read for those wanting to know more about the allegations and what they mean : If the WikiLeaks controversy has seemed ferocious in its intensity to date , the fact that Assange is tonight in custody as an accused rapist means that the political , technological and moral culture wars that have been skirmishing for months around the website have reached a new pitch of vitriol , in which conspiracy theories , slander and misogyny have become every bit as central to the debate as high - minded principles of justice or freedom of information .
10.37pm :
Exploding the idea that the US embassy cables do n't show duplicity by US diplomats â€ “
the Politco 's Josh Gerstein reveals how the WikiLeaks cables catch State Department spokesman PJ Crowley being economical with the truth .
Gerstein points out this transcript of a public news briefing by Crowley on 15 December last year : Q : Is the US involved in any military operations in Yemen ?
Crowley :
No .
Q :
No ?
Crowley :
But we â€ “ those kinds of reports keep cropping up .
We do not have a military role in this conflict .
That 's clear , is n't it ?
Except that the US embassy cables show the opposite .
Here 's the Guardian 's coverage of the Yemen cables :
While Saleh 's government publicly insists its own forces are responsible for counter - terrorism operations , the cables detail how the president struck a secret deal to allow the US to carry out cruise missile attacks on [ al - Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula ] targets .
The first strike in December last year , which killed dozens of civilians along with wanted jihadis , was presented by Saleh as Yemen 's own work , supported by US intelligence .
Justin Elliott at Salon 's War Room blog also has a good take on the revelations .
10.55pm : Spiegel Online has published a brilliant interview with Esfandiar Rahim Mashai , an advisor to the president of Iran who is amusingly sceptical about the origins of the WikiLeaks documents : Spiegel Online :
But the diplomatic reports were published against Washington 's will and are damaging to the United States .
The WikiLeaks disclosures are not a State Department PR campaign .
Esfandiar Rahim Mashai : Are you sure about that ?
How , then , did WikiLeaks gain access to the documents ?
Spiegel :
Presumably through a US Army private who had access to a central government database and has since been arrested .
Mashai :
Do you believe that ?
Then you must be very naÃ¯ve indeed .
No , the United States is behind this deliberate leak .
The Americans are trying to paint the world in black and white .
They underscore the differences among nations and want to show everyone that peace is only possible in cooperation with them .
Spiegel :
Do you question the authenticity of the more than 250,000 documents ?
Mashai :
I do n't want to get into individual documents and their authenticity .
But I have no doubt that a US government plan is behind this disclosure .
When someone wants to suggest something , they include fake information with real information so as to create a certain impression .
That 's why each country has to analyze the documents that relate to it , which is what our experts in Tehran are doing now .
Spiegel :
In other words , you do take the embassy reports very seriously .
Mashai :
We are only examining them to figure out the Americans ' tricks .
Fabulous .
11 pm :
The latest Guardian coverage suggests that US cultural imperialism in the form of Desperate Housewives is doing a better job at winning over hearts and minds in Saudi Arabia than all its investments in friendly media : Diplomats said they believed the allure of actors such as Eva Longoria , Jennifer Aniston and David Schwimmer meant commercial TV had a far greater impact than [ US - funded TV news channel ] al - Hurra which , according to one report , has cost US taxpayers up to $ 500 m .
Another unusual fact : the Rotana channel , part - owned by Rupert Murdoch 's News Corporation , is proving to be remarkably popular in Saudi Arabia despite ( or perhaps because of ? )
screening Fox News â€
“ not noted for its subtle coverage of Islam or the Middle East .
11.15pm :
The New York Times has responded to Senator Joe Lieberman , from Robert Mackey 's top - notch WikiLeaks live blog : A spokeswoman for The New York Times has responded to a suggestion by Sen. Joe Lieberman on Tuesday that the news organization , and others that published American diplomatic cables obtained and distributed by WikiLeaks , might be subject to criminal investigation .
"" We believe that our decision to publish was responsible journalism , legal , and important to a democratic society , "" Danielle Rhoades Ha , the communications director of The Times Company , said .
Bill Keller , the executive editor of The New York Times , explained this in detail in "" A Note to Readers : The Decision to Publish Diplomatic Documents , "" which was published on Nov. 29 , with the first articles on the cables .
11.31pm :
Mike Mukasey , George Bush 's last attorney general , appeared on the BBC tonight to join the chorus threatening action against Julian Assange and WikiLeaks .
The Guardian 's Owen Bowcott reports :
The former US Attorney General Michael Mukasey last night said that US lawyers should try and extradite Assange to the United States for betraying government secrets .
"" If I was still in charge there would have been an investigation , "" he told BBC Newsnight , "" it would have been done promptly . ""
This is a crime of a very high order .
Julian Assange has been leaking this information .
He came into possession of it knowing that it was harmful . ""
Mukasey also implied that the Swedish sex accusations may only be holding charge .
"" When one is accused of a very serious crime it 's common to hold him in respect of a lesser crime ... while you assemble evidence of a second crime . ""
Once again , Mukasey does n't say exactly what US law either WikiLeaks or Assange has broken .
But if he 's right then we will find out soon enough .
11.46pm :
The latest revelations about the release of the Lockerbie bomber Abdel Baset al - Megrahi over fears of retribution by Libya draws a swift response from Scotland 's first minister ( and SNP leader )
Alec Salmond : ""
The cables confirm what we always said â€ “ that our only interest was taking a justice decision based on Scots law without fear or favour , which was exactly what was done , and that our public position was identical to our private one .
"" They also show that the former UK government were playing false on the issue , with a different public position from their private one - which must be deeply embarrassing for the Labour Party in Scotland - and that the US government was fully aware of the pressure being applied to the UK government . ""
The Guardian 's coverage of the cables notes : American diplomats were worried "" Salmond and the SNP will look for opportunities to exploit the Megrahi case for their own advantage "" .
But when the Scottish justice minister finally announced a "" compassionate release "" to a storm of protest the following August , the US ambassador said the Scots had got out of their depth . ""
The Scottish government severely underestimated both US government and UK public reaction to its decision â€ ¦
Alex Salmond has privately indicated that he was ' shocked ' . ""
12 midnight : Time to wrap things up for the evening â€ “ here 's some last links to chew on .
â€¢ Reuters has this analysis of the charges against Julian Assange in Sweden :
The two Swedish women who accuse WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange of sexual misconduct were at first not seeking to bring charges against him .
They just wanted to track him down and persuade him to be tested for sexually transmitted diseases , according to several people in contact with his entourage at the time .
â€¢
The Associated Press has this eye - opener from the cables regarding Nicaragua : US diplomats accuse Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega 's government of taking bribes from drug traffickers and receiving "" suitcases full of cash "" from Venezuelan officials , according to confidential documents released this week by WikiLeaks .
The leaked documents from the US Embassy in Managua , Nicaragua , allege that Ortega has used drug money to finance campaigns for the Sandinista National Liberation Front .
The money from international drug traffickers is "" usually in return for ordering Sandinista judges to allow traffickers caught by the police and military to go free , "" reads a May 5 , 2006 , cable from an embassy official .
â€¢
And finally : the author Naomi Wolf has drawn considerable hostile reaction for her piece in the Huffington Post today ."
2010-12-07,"Julian Assange , the founder of WikiLeaks , is expected to appear in a UK court today after his lawyers said he would meet police to discuss a European arrest warrant from Sweden relating to alleged sexual assaults .
As the legal net continued to close around the whistleblowers ' website and the US attorney general , Eric Holder , said he had authorised "" a number of things to be done "" to combat the organisation , Assange appeared to be reconciling himself to a lengthy personal court battle to avoid extradition to Sweden .
Jennifer Robinson , a solicitor with Finers Stephens Innocent , which represents the Australian freedom of information campaigner , told the Guardian : "" We have a received an arrest warrant [ related to claims in Sweden ] .
We are negotiating a meeting with police . ""
Another lawyer representing Assange , Mark Stephens , added : "" He has not been charged with anything .
We are in the process of making arrangements to meet the police by consent , in order to facilitate the taking of that question and answer that is needed .
It 's about time we got to the end of the day
and we got some truth , justice and rule of law . ""
Stephens explained that the interview would happen in the "" foreseeable future "" but he could not give a precise time .
According to other sources , it is thought that Assange would appear before a court to negotiate bail .
Assange is seeking supporters to put up surety and bail for him .
He said he expected to have to post bail of between Â£100,000 and Â£200,000 and would require up to six people offering surety , or risked being held on remand .
In recent days , Assange , 39 , has told friends he is increasingly convinced the US is behind Swedish prosecutors ' attempts to extradite him for questioning on the assault allegations .
He has said the original allegations against him were motivated by "" personal issues "" but that Sweden had subsequently behaved as "" a cipher "" for the US .
Assange has also said that he declined to return to Sweden to face prosecutors because he feared he would not receive a fair trial , and prosecutors had requested that he be held in solitary confinement and incommunicado .
This weekend Assange said he was exhausted by the effort of running his defence against the allegations in Sweden and the release of the US embassy cables at the same time , as well as running WikiLeaks itself , which has split since some supporters became disaffected over Assange 's handling of the Afghanistan war logs .
Once he turns himself in to the police , he will have to appear before a magistrates ' court within 24 hours , where he will seek release on bail .
A full hearing of his extradition case would have to be heard within 28 days .
In the past , Assange has dismissed the allegations , stating on Twitter : "" The charges are without basis and their issue at this moment is deeply disturbing . ""
Last week Stephens added : "" This appears to be a persecution and a prosecution .
It is highly irregular and unusual for the Swedish authorities to issue [ an Interpol ] red notice in the teeth of the undisputed fact that Mr Assange has agreed to meet voluntarily to answer the prosecutor 's questions . ""
Stephens has said that the claims stem from a "" dispute over consensual but unprotected sex "" .
While the latest US diplomatic cables released on WikiLeaks have been stirring international political alarm and recriminations , Assange is understood to have been staying out of public sight in south - east England .
Prosecutors in Sweden issued a warrant for his arrest last month but it could not be enforced because of a technical blunder .
The Australian 's details were also added to Interpol 's most wanted website after a red notice was issued , alerting police worldwide to his status .
Detectives in Sweden want to question Assange after two women claimed they were sexually assaulted by him when he visited the country in August .
The country 's supreme court upheld an order to detain him for questioning after he appealed against two lower court rulings .
The sex assault claims may be Assange 's most pressing legal issue , but it may not be the only legal complication he faces as several countries consider the impact of his diplomatic cable disclosures .
He has come under growing pressure after WikiLeaks started publishing excerpts from a cache of 250,000 secret messages .
In the US , the level of political vituperation has become more vengeful .
The former vice - presidential candidate Sarah Palin has described Assange as "" an anti - American operative with blood on his hands "" .
The senior Republican Mike Huckabee said that "" anything less than execution is too kind a penalty "" .
Meanwhile WikiLeaks has been forced to move to a Swiss host after being dumped by US internet companies as it comes under siege from cyber attacks .
PostFinance , the financial arm of the Swiss post office , said it had closed Assange 's account after he provided "" false information "" .
"" PostFinance has ended its business relationship with WikiLeaks founder Julian Paul Assange , "" the bank said in a statement .
"" The Australian citizen provided false information regarding his place of residence during the account opening process . ""
Last night hackers claimed they had targeted the firm 's websites in support of WikiLeaks .
MasterCard also said it would block payments to WikiLeaks , according to the CNET News website , a move that will dry up another source of funds for the website .
"" MasterCard is taking action to ensure that WikiLeaks can no longer accept MasterCard - branded products , "" a spokesman for MasterCard Worldwide said yesterday .
The credit card firm said it was cutting off payments because WikiLeaks was engaging in "" illegal activity "" . ""
MasterCard rules prohibit customers from directly or indirectly engaging in or facilitating any action that is illegal , "" its spokesman , Chris Monteiro said .
The online credit firm PayPal has already refused to allow payments through for WikiLeaks .
In Sweden , a WikiLeaks spokesman called for action against those who have attacked Assange .
"" There have been death threats to his life and incitement to murder , "" he added .
Canadian newspapers reported that police are investigating whether there is evidence to proceed against a former adviser to the prime minister after he called for Assange to be killed .
Tom Flanagan , now a professor at the University of Calgary , suggested on television last week that Assange "" should be assassinated , actually "" , adding : "" I think Obama should put out a contract and maybe use a drone or something . ""
Flanagan later retracted his statement saying it was not meant seriously .
In Assange 's homeland , however , Australian police are investigating whether he has broken any laws ."
2010-12-07,"The whistleblowing website WikiLeaks said last night it would not to be gagged by the imprisonment of its founder , Julian Assange , after a judge refused him bail at a dramatic extradition hearing in London .
Assange , 39 , who is wanted in Sweden over claims he sexually assaulted two women , was in Wandsworth prison last night after district judge Howard Riddle ruled there was a risk he would fail to surrender if granted bail .
Assange denies the allegations .
Despite Jemima Khan , former wife of Pakistan cricket captain Imran Khan , the campaigning journalist John Pilger , the film director Ken Loach and others offering to stand surety totalling Â£180,000 , the judge said the Australian Assange 's "" weak community ties "" in the UK , and his "" means and ability "" to abscond , represented "" substantial grounds "" for refusing bail .
He was remanded until 14 December , when the case can be reviewed at the same court .
His legal team said he would again apply for bail at that hearing .
Last night Kristinn Hrafnsson , a spokesman for WikiLeaks , confirmed it would continue publishing US diplomatic cables .
In a statement he said : "" This will not stifle WikiLeaks .
The release of the US embassy cables â€ “ the biggest leak in history â€ “ will still continue .
We will not be gagged , either by judicial action or corporate censorship . ""
WikiLeaks volunteers met in London last night to finalise plans for how the organisation would operate without Assange .
The majority of staff would continue to work on the publication of the US embassy cables while a small group concentrates on campaigning for his release .
WikiLeaks staff will today move into a London office , having spent weeks commuting between the capital and the home counties bolthole from which Assange has been co - ordinating the release of the leaked cables .
Staff had been required to take elaborate measures to ensure they were not followed to Assange 's location and use of mobile phones was banned to avoid detection .
A WikiLeaks source said last night that Assange had been unprepared for being taken into custody , expecting that he would be granted bail .
"" We thought he 'd be out .
All he 's got is the suit he was sitting in the box in , "" the source said .
The source added that although Assange was exhausted , he remained "" together , positive and strong "" after he was refused bail .
It is understood his lawyers have requested that he be held alone .
The refusal to grant Assange bail came on a day when increasing pressure was brought to bear in the US on companies and organisations with ties to WikiLeaks .
As Joe Lieberman , chairman of the Senate 's homeland security committee , urged businesses to sever their ties with the website , Visa suspended the payment of donations to the website through its credit card .
Asked about the New York Times 's role in publishing the leaked cables , Lieberman told Fox news the newspaper "" has committed at least an act of bad citizenship .
Whether they have committed a crime I think bears very intensive inquiry "" .
Michael Mukasey , a former US attorney general , said last night that American lawyers should try to extradite Assange to the US for betraying government secrets .
"" If I was still in charge there would have been an investigation , "" he told the BBC 's Newsnight .
"" This is a crime of a very high order .
Julian Assange has been leaking this information .
He came into possession of it knowing that it was harmful . ""
Mukasey , who stepped down from the post of attorney general last year , implied that the Swedish sexual accusations may only be a holding charge . ""
When one is accused of a very serious crime , "" he said , "" it 's common to hold him in respect of a lesser crime â€ ¦ while you assemble evidence of a second crime . ""
Assange , wearing a black suit and open - necked white shirt , stood in the glass - panelled dock at Westminster magistrates yesterday as more than 50 journalists from around the world packed into the well and more than 20 supporters and friends crammed into the public gallery .
Outside , the pavement was swallowed up as more photographers and camera crew jostled with protesters gathered at the building 's main entrance .
After the ruling â€ “ with supporters waving A4 printouts reading "" Character Assassination "" and "" Protect Free Speech "" â€ “ his solicitor , Mark Stephens , emerged from court to claim the prosecution was "" politically motivated "" and pledged WikiLeaks would not be cowed .
Assange was entitled to a high court appeal , he said , adding the judge was "" impressed "" with the number of people prepared to "" stand up "" on his client 's behalf . ""
[ Those supporters ] were but the tip of the iceberg , "" he said .
"" This is going to go viral .
Many people believe Mr Assange to be innocent , myself included .
Many people believe that this prosecution is politically motivated . ""
Pilger , who told the judge he knew Assange and had "" very high regard for him "" , said outside court : "" Sweden should be ashamed .
This is not justice
â€ “
this is outrageous . ""
Assange was arrested by appointment at a London police station at 9.20am after a European arrest warrant was received by the Metropolitan police extradition unit yesterday .
He appeared in court at 2 pm , where he spoke to confirm his name and date of birth and to tell the court : "" I do not consent to my extradition . ""
There was confusion when he initially refused to give an address except a Post Office box number .
When told this was unacceptable , his lawyer , John Jones , read out an address at 177 Grantham Street , Parkville , Victoria , Australia .
Assange is wanted in connection with four allegations including of rape and molestation .
Gemma Lindfield , for the Swedish prosecutors , said the first involved complainant A , who said she was the victim of "" unlawful coercion "" on the night of 14 August in Stockholm .
The court heard Assange is accused of using his body weight to hold her down in a sexual manner .
The second charge alleged Assange "" sexually molested "" Miss A by having sex with her without a condom when it was her "" express wish "" one should be used .
The third charge claimed Assange "" deliberately molested "" Miss A on 18 August "" in a way designed to violate her sexual integrity "" .
The fourth charge accused Assange of having sex with a second woman , Miss W , on 17 August without a condom while she was asleep at her Stockholm home .
Lindfield argued there was a "" high risk of flight "" because of Assange 's "" lifestyle , connections and potential assets "" .
He had access to funds , through PayPal donations to the WikiLeaks website , had a "" network of international contacts "" , lived a "" nomadic "" lifestyle , and spent his time in "" hiding "" , she said .
The court later heard that for the past three weeks he had been staying at a UK address , and before then had spent two months living at the Frontline media club in Paddington .
There was no record of him entering the UK in the first place .
He had displayed an unwillingness to co - operate , refusing to be photographed , fingerprinted or give a DNA sample on arrest , she added .
No details were given about the strength of evidence , with Lindfield saying it "" is not a factor in relation to bail "" .
She also opposed bail for reasons of his personal safety , saying if granted "" any number of unstable persons could take it upon themselves to cause him serious harm "" .
"" This is someone , simply put , to whom no conditions , even the most stringent conditions , could be imposed that would ensure he surrendered to the jurisdiction of this court , "" she said .
John Jones , lawyer for Assange , said the case must be "" shorn of all political and media hysteria "" associated with WikiLeaks .
Assange was of previous good character , and had voluntarily handed himself in to Kentish Town police station in London .
His refusal to be photographed , fingerprinted or give a DNA sample was on legal advice .
He had stayed in Sweden for 40 days after the allegations were made to answer the charges and only left the country after being given "" express permission "" by the Swedish prosecutor .
Since he arrived in the UK he had "" consistently agreed to talk to the Swedish authorities "" .
His defence fund had been frozen , and he would be "" instantly recognised "" if he tried to leave the country , said Jones . ""
He resists extradition as it is disproportionate to extradite someone under these circumstances .
There has been every indication that the point of this warrant is to get him back for questioning . ""
The judge said the warrant did state it was for prosecution .
Others offering surety were Professor Patricia David , and the lawyer Geoffrey Sheen , president of Union Solidarity International , who both said although they did not know Assange they were concerned about human rights .
An unnamed relative of Assange offered Â£80,000 .
But Judge Riddle said : "" The nature and strength of the evidence is not there , this is normal at this stage in proceedings .
What we have here is the serious possible allegations against someone with comparatively weak community ties in this country .
He has the means and ability to abscond if he wants to and I am satisfied that there are substantial grounds to believe if I granted him bail he would fail to surrender . ""
Downing Street said Assange 's arrest was "" a matter for the police "" and there had been no ministerial involvement .
Unlike the UK , Swedish rape law is not based on consent but on the aforementioned concept of sexual integrity .
There are a number of possible offences against this integrity .
Those that involve both penetration and either physical force or a threat of some illegal act , such as violence , are classified as rape .
So are assaults on people who are helpless at the time , either as a result of intoxication or severe mental disturbance .
The degree of physical force involved need only be very small .
It can be enough merely to move the victim 's legs apart , according to Gunilla Berglund , at the Swedish ministry of justice .
Rape carries a sentence of between two and six years ; aggravated rape a sentence of four to 10 years .
An issue concerning Assange 's lawyers is the lack of bail in Swedish criminal procedure .
Suspects are remanded in custody when legal grounds can be made out for their detention â€ “ particularly when they are foreigners who are deemed at risk of absconding .
But there are strict limits on the timescale for bringing a suspect to trial , with a formal charge required within two weeks of being remanded into custody , and trial one week after that .
The Swedish director of public prosecutions , Marianne Ny , dismissed suggestions of a political motive for the rape allegations ."
2010-12-07,"Julian Assange 's arrest by police this morning will kickstart the fast - tracked extradition process , using the European Arrest Warrant system , to attempt to return him to Sweden , where he is wanted for questioning regarding a rape charge .
Swedish criminal law experts said this morning that little was known about the allegations Assange is facing in the country , in line with legal requirements to protect anonymity and preserve confidentiality for sex crimes .
The activation of a European Arrest Warrant ( EAW ) by UK police suggests Assange has been formally charged by Swedish prosecutors and could face a period of detention upon his return .
Assange 's legal team is determined to fight his extradition on grounds including the failure of authorities to provide details of the warrant issued by Sweden .
They will also claim human rights reasons , including the arguments that the WikiLeaks founder may be unfairly deprived of his liberty in Sweden and that he risks not facing a fair trial .
The media attention surrounding Assange 's case is likely to complicate any future criminal proceedings , although the lack of a jury system in Sweden is likely to fuel arguments that he will be protected from public and media interest in the case .
Assange 's first appearance at Westminster magistrates ' court today will be primarily concerned with formalities , including establishing his identity and determining whether he consents to the extradition .
The court will then adjourn for a full extradition hearing , which has to be within 21 days .
A key issue will be whether Assange is released on bail during that period .
His lawyers are reported to be putting together a generous bail package , including a security of at least Â£100,000 and a surety , where third parties guarantee to pay the court if he absconds .
Experts say a large sum is likely to secure bail , although the crime for which Assange is wanted by Sweden is rape , an offence for which bail is harder to secure .
If extradited to Sweden under the EAW â€ “ a process that could be concluded quickly under the fast - track procedure â€ “ Assange will be vulnerable to other extradition requests from countries including the US .
The US has an extradition treaty with Sweden since the 1960s , when the nations agreed to "" make more effective the co - operation of the two countries in the repression of crime "" .
Extradition under the treaty is likely to face a number of obstacles , not least the fact that the likely charges facing Assange in the US â€ “ under the Espionage Act or other legislation protecting national security â€ “ are not included in the exhaustive list of offences set out in the law .
There may also be issues of jurisdiction , since the offences Assange is alleged by the US to have conducted did not take place within the country .
However , with other cases involving alleged cybercrimes , such as the case pending against computer hacker Gary McKinnon , the US has claimed that entering its computer systems remotely constitutes an offence it has jurisdiction to prosecute .
Even if Assange 's case falls outside the remit of Sweden 's treaty with the US , there is scope for the country to agree to his extradition to the US .
Swedish law permits extradition more generally to countries outside Europe , although the process is subject to safeguards , including a ban on extradition for "" political offences "" or where the suspect has reason to fear persecution on account of their membership of a social group or political beliefs .
Under similar arrangements , Assange could also be vulnerable to extradition requests from other countries , including his native Australia , where the authorities are investigating a potential case against him .
Any extradition from Sweden to other countries could take place only after the current rape proceedings have been concluded .
With Assange 's lawyers confirming their intention to dispute those proceedings on all grounds , it seems the prospect of any extradition to the US remains some way away ."
2010-12-07,"Uncertainty surrounded Julian Assange 's legal future last night as the WikiLeaks founder agreed to meet British police to discuss allegations of sexual assault against him in Sweden .
Assange was not arrested last night , but that remains a possibility after the Serious Organised Crime Agency ( Soca ) received a European arrest warrant ( EAW ) from Sweden .
Assange 's lawyers said he had not been formally charged in Sweden , where he faces the sex allegations .
But under the EAW system , a warrant can only be issued once a charge has been made .
Assange is wanted for questioning by Swedish officials , and could consent to return there to co - operate with their investigation .
While the EAW 's legal status is uncertain , once validated by British authorities Assange 's arrest would be inevitable and he would have to brought before a magistrate "" as soon as practicable "" , or in most cases within 24 hours .
If arrested Assange will appear before Westminster magistrates .
A key issue will be whether Assange is released on bail during that period .
His lawyers are reported to be putting together a generous package , including a security of at least £ 100,000 and a surety – where third parties guarantee to pay the court if he absconds .
However , the allegations facing Assange are serious in Swedish law and it is often more difficult to secure bail for these .
Assange 's lawyers are disputing the credibility of the allegations and the motive behind Sweden 's decision to investigate the matter further , after prosecutors dropped it earlier this year , and are likely to challenge the grounds for extradition .
But if extradited to Sweden under the EAW , Assange will be vulnerable to other extradition requests from countries including the US .
The US has an extradition treaty with Sweden dating back to 1960s , when the two countries agreed to "" make more effective the cooperation of the two countries in the repression of crime . ""
Extradition under the treaty is likely to face a number of obstacles , not least the fact that the likely charges facing Assange in the US – under the Espionage Act or other legislation protecting national security – are not included in the exhaustive list of offences set out in the law .
There may also be issues of jurisdiction , since the offences which Assange is accused of did not take place in the US.Even if Assange 's case falls outside the scope of Sweden 's treaty with the US , there would still be scope for the country to agree to his extradition to the US .
Swedish law permits extradition more generally to countries outside Europe , although the process is subject to safeguards , including a ban on extradition for "" political offences "" or where the suspect has reason to fear persecution on account of their membership of a social group or political beliefs .
Any extradition from Sweden to the US could only take place after the current proceedings were concluded .
With Assange 's lawyers intending to dispute those proceedings on all grounds , it seems the prospect of any extradition to the US remains some way away ."
2010-12-07,"In the eight days since WikiLeaks began publishing thousands of classified US diplomatic cables online , the website 's founder and public face , Julian Assange , has heard calls for his imprisonment and even execution .
Authorities from America to Australia have investigated whether the unprecedented leak breached their laws , while leading American politicians denounced him as no better than a terrorist .
The website 's technical and financial infrastructure has been assailed by hosting companies such as Amazon pressured successfully to take down its pages and bank accounts closed .
In short , WikiLeaks and Assange , holed up somewhere in southern England , have been in the fight of their lives .
But the biggest threat to WikiLeaks 's ongoing freedom of information activism comes from none of this but an apparently unrelated subplot concerning the events of an August weekend when Assange was in Sweden attending a seminar .
What happened around 13 August this year appears about to catch up with the 39-year - old Australian who is expected to hand himself to the British authorities over allegations made by two women which have seen him charged by Swedish prosecutors of rape , sexual molestation and unlawful coercion .
The claims related to two women who said they had met Assange in connection with a seminar he gave in the Swedish capital on 14 August .
The women filed their complaints together six days later , on Friday 20 August .
The allegations stem from claims that Assange had sex with the two women on separate occasions and reportedly centre on his willingness or otherwise to use condoms .
His lawyer , Mark Stephens , last night summed up the issue as a "" dispute over consensual but unprotected sex "" .
The Swedish on - call prosecutor who fielded the case when it first emerged issued an arrest warrant for Assange , who had been in Stockholm where some of WikiLeaks 's international network of servers were based and where he had sought shelter for his organisation under Sweden 's journalistic source protection laws .
The arrest warrant was revoked the next day by a higher - ranked prosecutor who found no grounds to suspect Assange of rape , thereby forming a pattern of confusion among authorities and press alike about what Assange was being pursued for .
Speaking anonymously , one of the two women involved told the Swedish daily newspaper , Aftonbladet , she had never intended Assange to be charged with rape and that both women had had voluntary relations with him . ""
He is not violent and I do not feel threatened by him , "" she reportedly said .
"" The responsibility for what happened to me and the other girl lies with a man who had attitude problems with women . ""
Assange himself responded immediately telling the same newspaper : "" It was shocking .
I have been accused of various things in recent years , but nothing so serious as this . ""
By 25 August , the allegations appeared to be receding .
Sweden 's chief prosecutor , Eva Finne , had formally closed one case of alleged rape against Assange deciding that it did n't even warrant consideration as another type of sex crime , while the second case was to be investigated as an alleged molestation , which is not a sex crime under Swedish law .
But within a week , the closed rape case was back on again when Sweden 's director of public prosecution Marianne Ny , decided to reopen it saying unspecified new information had come to light and she also changed the status of the molestation investigation to "" sexual coercion and sexual molestation "" .
Assange continued to deny any wrongdoing .
The Swedish authorities seemed intent for him to be interviewed in Sweden and in October , Ny complained : "" So far , we have not been able to meet with him to accomplish the interrogation . ""
It was not until 18 November that Stockholm 's district court approved a request to issue an international and European arrest warrant which in itself was disputed .
Stephens said the arrest warrant had no legal force because Assange has not been charged and was only wanted as a witness .
In addition , last weekend he said the Swedish investigation had turned into a "" political stunt "" .
The cases have become a totemic part of the WikiLeaks story in part because of the allegations by Assange 's lawyers they are "" false and without basis "" .
There has also been conjecture among conspiracy theorists that the allegations are being pursued as a kind of trojan horse – an expedient means to bring Assange to justice after the WikiLeaks cables disclosures .
The idea that the claims are in any way trumped up is strongly denied by one of the claimants , who said : "" The charges against Assange are of course not orchestrated by the Pentagon . ""
Nevertheless , the authorities ' pursuit of the allegations , complete with Interpol 's dramatic looking "" wanted "" arrest warrant , have become the clearest emblem of the growing pressure mounting against Assange and WikiLeaks which appears to have reached boiling point in the midst of publication of the US embassy cables .
By last Tuesday Assange 's mother , Christine , who runs a puppet theatre in Queensland , Australia , could see that her son was being "" hunted down "" . ""
He is my son and I love him , and obviously I do n't want him hunted down and jailed , "" she told Australian radio .
"" I 'm reacting as any mother would .
I 'm distressed . ""
Today Swiss Post 's financial arm , Postfinance , shut down a fundraising bank account set up by Assange after it determined he "" provided false information regarding his place of residence during the account opening process "" while PayPal , according to Stephens , had "" frozen "" $ 79,700 of WikiLeaks ' money .
American web companies
Amazon.com , PayPal and EveryDNS also pulled the plug on their relationships with WikiLeaks one after the other .
France promised a crackdown on WikiLeaks 's web presence there , while China moved to block the website altogether .
The decision by Amazon to remove the site from its servers over alleged violations of its terms of service forced WikiLeaks to fall back on a Swedish host .
Yesterday even those servers came under attack .
Mikael Viborg , owner of the Swedish Internet service provider PRQ which was helping WikiLeaks , said his servers had become unresponsive .
He said it was probably due to a "" distributed denial of service "" attack in which remote computers jam a website with massive amounts of data .
It was not clear who was organizing the attacks , but WikiLeaks has blamed previous computer attacks on intelligence forces in the United States and elsewhere .
The question now facing WikiLeaks and its army of supporters is whether it can still survive when trying to fight on two fronts and whether , ultimately , it will be the criminal justice system 's pursuit of the sex crime allegations against Assange rather than anything related to his audacious leaking of US government documents that will ultimately threaten the organisation 's future ."
2010-12-07,"Since Julian Assange was first accused of sex crimes against two Swedish women in August , his defenders have asserted his innocence and dismissed the allegations as malicious , or trumped up , or part of a politically driven conspiracy .
To his powerful critics , however , the rape charges have become elided with what they consider his other crimes , including accusations of espionage , for which a number of US political figures have already called for his execution .
But if the WikiLeaks controversy has seemed ferocious in its intensity to date , the fact that Assange is tonight in custody as an accused rapist means that the political , technological and moral culture wars that have been skirmishing for months around the website have reached a new pitch of vitriol , in which conspiracy theories , slander and misogyny have become every bit as central to the debate as high - minded principles of justice or freedom of information .
Certainly there are some , not only in the Australian 's legal team , who argue that a rape accusation based on the details of the allegations in the public domain –
some of them placed there by the women themselves – would be highly unlikely to come to court in this country .
Others counter , however , that even those who support Assange or the principle of free speech must let the law decide on serious criminal accusations .
Two women who say they are victims of serious sex crimes find themselves key players in a very ugly reputational slanging match .
Named in court only as Miss A and Miss W , their identities have nonetheless been circulating widely online since very soon after the attacks .
And with Assange 's arrest , parts of the internet have declared open season on the two women , vowing to enlist an army of tech - savvy research assistants skilled in squirrelling out information that others might wish to keep hidden — described with ill - disguised glee today by one blogger as "" the First World Infowar "" .
Rarely can there have been a rape case where the personal details of the alleged victims have been so eagerly sought out by so many .
"" Is [ Miss A ] a lesbian ? "" asks one blog , accompanying its text with photographs of Miss A alongside another woman .
"" If [ she ] is gay , and she sleeps with Assange , that 's a contradiction .
So , I 'm inviting the blogosphere to look for the evidence .
Be a WikiSleuth !
There must be a lot of people who know about [ Miss A ] and her behavior .
Speak up ! ""
Partisan bloggers have obliged , digging up and publishing previously deleted tweets sent by one of the women while at a party with Assange , details of texts sent by the other , Miss W , following her sexual encounter with Assange , blog entries by Miss A in which she talks about her political outlook and opinions , even a document written by the same alleged victim entitled "" 7 steps to legal revenge "" , in which she writes : "" Go to it and keep your goal in sight .
Make sure your victim suffers just as you did . ""
These are now part of a distasteful and unsettling story , many details of which , thanks to a Swedish police leak and an interview given by Miss A to a Swedish paper , are in the public domain .
The story appears to proceed as follows :
Miss A , having invited Assange to speak to a leftwing campaign group in the town of Enkoping , suggested he stay in her flat , although the two had not met .
Both agree that they slept together on the night before the event , during which the condom split .
The following day , the woman attended and helped facilitate the event , at which Miss W was also present .
According to her police interview , Miss W accompanied the Australian and some male guests to lunch at which he flirted with her ; afterwards the pair went to the cinema , where she told police she had performed oral sex on him .
They slept together that night , using a condom , and again the following morning , when both parties appear to agree that a condom was not used , after which Assange left .
What happened next will be the subject of any legal process , but according to her testimony Miss W , for some reason , got in touch with Miss A ( they did not previously know each other ) ; some days later the two went to a Stockholm police station where they said they were "" seeking advice "" on making a complaint against Assange .
Miss A is understood to have told police that he had ripped the condom on purpose , while Miss W said the unprotected sex act had been without her consent .
They were reportedly advised by the police officer that these allegations amounted to rape against Miss W and sexual molestation against Miss A.
The accusations leaked to the press two days later , shortly after which Miss A gave an interview to the Swedish newspaper Aftonbladet .
She said : "" The responsibility for what happened to me and the other girl lies with a man who had attitude problems with women . ""
A Swedish court may yet be called upon to adjudicate on the facts of the case in due course ; that has not stopped an unedifying and arguably unprecedented assault on the reputations of the two women .
Described as "" a seasoned feminist warrior "" in the Daily Mail – not a publication that regards that term as a compliment – details of Miss A 's CV , from her feminist campaigning at university , where she was the campus equalities officer , to her role in the Swedish political party that in August invited Assange to speak , are widely available .
Another website that reasserts the voice of men in the mainstream media calls her a "" psychotic feminist "" .
What has most engaged the conspiracy theorists and Assange 's more excitable defenders , however , are a few key incidents in Miss A career , in particular that she is said to have worked in the Swedish embassy in the US , and wrote her university thesis in 2007 on a vision of Cuba after the death of Castro .
This has led to widespread allegations that the woman is a CIA agent , planted as a honeytrap to bring down Assange .
One blogger notes : "" [ Assange ] just happens to meet a Swedish woman who just happens to have been publishing her work in a well - funded anti - Castro group that just happens to have links with a group led by a man at least one journalist describes as an agent of the CIA : the violent secret arm of America 's foreign policy . ""
Cuba … just happens to be the global symbol of successful defiance of American foreign policy … [ while Assange ] just happens to be the man America 's political class – the people who run America 's foreign policy – have been trying to silence . ""
Video footage of the other woman attending the event addressed by Assange is also available , meanwhile ; her details and the name of her partner , an American artist , are also circulating .
Assange 's defenders will argue that he , too , has been the subject of a vigorous online and media assault , that has intensified with the rape arrest .
The NBC journalist Matt Lauer greeted news of Assange 's arrest by declaring "" the international manhunt for Julian Assange is over "" , although no warrant was issued until Monday night , after which the Australian , whose whereabouts were not unknown , immediately presented himself at a police station .
With Assange due to reappear in court on 14 December , his immediate future is clear , even if what will happen after that date , to the man and his website , is anyone 's guess .
The lives of his two accusers , however , whether he is guilty or not , are likely to be depressingly predictable . ""
Spread the word , "" reads another site , "" Julian Assange 's lying rape accusers are [ Miss A and Miss W ] .
These women need to be exposed for what they have done .
I 'm adding some more pictures that my readers have found .
Here 's one … , "" says one website ."
2010-12-07,"As Julian Assange entered Wandsworth prison tonight , WikiLeaks faced the greatest challenge in its four - year history .
Already stretched as it wrestles with the release of the US embassy cables – the biggest leak of government documents in recent history – the organisation must now find a way to operate without its founder .
WikiLeaks is so reliant on his leadership that there is no natural replacement .
Tonightplans were even being drawn up to allow him to manage the organisation from a prison cell if his incarceration proves prolonged .
Critics say Assange 's imprisonment has highlighted a key weakness of WikiLeaks – its over - reliance on one person .
"" I am the heart and soul of this organisation , its founder , philosopher , spokesperson , original coder , organiser , financier and all the rest , "" Assange reportedly told a colleague who questioned his judgment in September .
"" If you have a problem with me , piss off .
"" There was a damaging schism in the organisation in September and now WikiLeaks faces a rival start - up group .
In the shorter term the threats to the organisation are coming into clear focus .
With about 250,000 US embassy cables still to release , WikiLeaks 's network of volunteers , interns , activists and paid staff face intensifying assault from financial institutions .
The embassy cables are due to be published well into the new year and WikiLeaks is sitting on several document caches , including files about the Bank of America , which it has to clear before accepting any new information .
Meanwhile WikiLeaks is facing a widening shutdown by internet service providers .
Its inability to accept new material is already drawing criticism from others in the wider global transparency movement who believe that represents an abdication of the original aims .
At least the material it has published on the US embassy cables looks safe .
Under the slogan "" Keep us strong – help WikiLeaks keep governments open "" , the site 's homepage said its contents were mirrored around the world on 748 servers registered in the Netherlands , Lithuania , New Zealand , Germany , America , Switzerland , Czech Republic , France and beyond .
The bullish implication was that to attack WikiLeaks was futile .
A spokesman last week said WikiLeaks had € 1 m in the bank though sources said accessing cash was getting difficult .
About € 100,000 was said to be in a Swiss account and in PayPal following sanctions against WikiLeaks .
In the longer term , WikiLeaks 's pre - eminence is set to be challenged .
After an internal row in September over the handling of the publication of the war logs , one of Assange 's key lieutenants , Daniel Domscheit - Berg , quit to set up a rival group taking key staff with him .
Domscheit - Berg 's rival , yet to be launched , aims to tackle what he sees as some of the weaknesses of WikiLeaks decision to focus on publishing only big parcels of headline - grabbing information .
He said there had been "" a lack of transparency about how decisions had been reached "" , "" a lot of resentment "" in the organisation , and that not all of the work was "" being done correctly "" .
John Young , 74 , an architect , who helped found WikiLeaks and has run his own leaks website , Krytome , for 14 years , said : "" WikiLeaks is going to be brought down by its competitors , not by governments …
Hundreds , if not thousands , of people are providing the same service but most people have n't heard of them .
Some do it for money , some do it for more principled reasons . ""
He published a list of more than 100 groups releasing sensitive data .
Young suggested that WikiLeaks was effectively a commercial organisation competing in an open market , alongside others who sell sensitive information , such as former spies and the media .
He claimed it glamourised the significance of the information it had to generate cash from donations . ""
The transparency market has been monetised , "" he said .
"" And it has caught on . ""
WikiLeaks 's financial ambitions have been strong .
On an internal mailing list in January 2007 for the founders of WikiLeaks.org , the group stated : "" It is our goal to raise pledges of $ 5 m by July . ""
However , WikiLeaks appears publicly confident it can ride out the storm over Assange .
James Ball , a journalist working with WikiLeaks , said : "" There has been a lot of effort by the US government and others to target Julian Assange .
But the technical assaults on us have only resulted in more than 500 mirrors [ of WikiLeaks ] being made around the world .
It shows that if you take WikiLeaks down there will be 10 more similar sites the next day .
Putting genies back in bottles rarely works . """
2010-12-07,"WikiLeaks will continue releasing the leaked US embassy cables in spite of the arrest this morning of its founder , Julian Assange , over allegations in Sweden of sexual offences .
The whistleblowers ' website has made arrangements to continue publishing the classified documents , the airing of which has embarrassed the US government .
The leaked cables have provided a daily flow of revelations about the superpower 's involvement in the most sensitive issues around the world , including those affecting Iran , Afghanistan and China .
The decision to press on will help allay fears among Assange 's supporters that his arrest would hobble the organisation 's work .
Assange has also pre - recorded a video message , which WikiLeaks is due to release today .
But the Guardian understands the organisation has no plans to release the insurance file of the remaining cables , which number more than 200,000 .
It has sent copies of the encrypted file to supporters around the world .
These can be accessed only by using a 256-digit code .
Assange and his lawyers , Mark Stephens and Jennifer Robinson , attended a London police station at 9.30am today , by appointment .
The 39-year old Australian was arrested under a European arrest warrant .
He is wanted by Swedish authorities to face one charge of unlawful coercion , two charges of sexual molestation and one charge of rape , all alleged to have been committed in August 2010 .
Assange and his legal team kept changing the location of the planned arrest up until last night in a successful bid to avoid a media scrum .
He is expected to appear at City of Westminster magistrates court later today , probably before 12.30pm .
"" Officers from the Metropolitan Police Extradition Unit have this morning arrested Julian Assange on behalf of the Swedish authorities on suspicion of rape , "" said a spokesman for Scotland Yard . ""
Julian Assange , 39 , was arrested on a European arrest warrant by appointment at a London police station at 9.30am . ""
In the last 24 hours , coverage of the content of the cables has been overtaken by interest in Assange 's apparently unrelated legal tussle with Swedish prosecutors .
Assange strongly denies any wrongdoing .
Stephens yesterday said the issue could be summed up as a "" dispute over consensual but unprotected sex "" .
The charges have changed several times since they were first levelled by two women on 20 August in relation to events over the weekend of 13 August .
Swedish prosecutors initially dismissed the allegations of one of the women but the country 's director of public prosecution , Marianne Ny , reopened the case .
On 18 November , Stockholm 's district court approved a request to issue an international and European arrest warrant , which itself was disputed by Assange 's legal team ."

Conservative communities secretary Eric Pickles and former Labour deputy PM John Prescott have a history of antagonism , running back to a joke the former made two years ago about the latter 's bulimia .
Recently , the Tory heavyweight had a fresh dig at Prezza over his department 's spending - particularly on pot plants .
Now it appears the battle is heading for Twitter .
Apparently Pickles reckons he will soon overtake Prescott in terms of followers - he currently has 11,600 against Prezza 's 38,700 .
The Daily Telegraph reports that Pickles 's followers include Charlie Whelan and Evan Davis - and despite his role in the frontline of government cost - cutting , his bashing of council - run freesheets could win him a few fans among newspaper publishers too .

2010-12-07,"WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange was remanded in custody today after appearing in court on an extradition warrant .
The 39-year - old Australian , who is wanted in Sweden over allegations he sexually assaulted two women , was refused bail on the grounds there was a risk he would fail to surrender .
Before a packed court
No 1 at Westminster magistrates court , District Judge Howard Riddle said Assange was to be remanded in custody until a further hearing on December 14 .
The ruling came despite Jemima Khan , film director Ken Loach and veteran journalist John Pilger standing up in court to offer to act at surety for Assange .
But the judge concluded that because of the "" serious "" nature of the allegations against Assange , his "" comparatively weak community ties "" in the UK , and that it was believed he had the financial means and the ability to abscond , there was a substantial risk he would fail to surrender .
"" This case is not , on the face of it , about WikiLeaks .
It is an allegation in another European country of serious sexual offences alleged to have occurred on three separate occasions and involving two separate victims , "" he said .
Assange appeared in the glass - panelled dock in a courtroom crammed with up to 50 British and international journalists .
There was standing room only in the public gallery as he spoke to confirm his name and date of birth .
But there was confusion when he initially refused to give an address , stating only a post office box number , which was unacceptable to the court .
Eventually , after discussions with his lawyer , he gave an address in Parkfield , Victoria , Australia .
Gemma Lindfield , representing the Swedish authorities , told the court he was wanted in connection with four allegations .
The first complainant , a Miss A , said she was the victim of "" unlawful coercion "" on the night of 14 August in Stockholm .
The court heard Assange was alleged to have "" forcefully "" held her arms and used his bodyweight to hold her down .
The second charge alleged he "" sexually molested "" her by having sex without using a condom , when it was her "" express wish "" that one should be used .
A third charge claimed Assange "" deliberately molested "" Miss A on 18 August .
A fourth charge , relating to a Miss W , alleged that on 17 August , he "" improperly exploited "" the fact she was asleep to have sex with her without a condom .
Lindfield argued Assange should be refused bail because of his "" nomadic lifestyle "" , citing reports in the media he intended to seek asylum in Switzerland , he had access to money from donors and a network of international contacts , and because as an Australian he was only entitled to stay in the UK for a limited time .
He had also refused to have his fingerprints taken or give a DNA sample on arrest .
She also argued it was for his own protection as "" any number of unstable persons could take it upon themselves to cause him serious harm "" .
"" This is someone for whom , simply put , no conditions , even the most stringent conditions that could be imposed , would ensure he would surrender to the jurisdiction of this court . ""
Well - known figures attended court to stake their reputation by offering sureties totalling at least £ 180,000 .
Khan , former wife of the Pakistan cricketer Imran Khan and sister of the Tory MP Zac Goldsmith , told the court that although she did not personally know Assange she was prepared to offer £ 20,000 , or more if needed .
Pilger said that he did know Assange and had "" a very high regard for him "" .
He was prepared to offer £ 20,000 , he said , describing the proceedings in Sweden as "" absurd "" and saying it would be "" a travesty "" if Assange had to "" go within that Swedish system "" .
Loach , who also offered £ 20,000 , said he did not know Assange , but added : "" I think the work he has done has been a public service , I think we are entitled to know the dealings of those that govern us . ""
Assange 's solicitor , John Jones , said the case was not about WikiLeaks but was a simple accusation case with the right to bail .
Assange was of good character , he had voluntarily surrendered to police , and he had a UK address where he was able to stay , he added .
Assange , who had stayed at London 's Frontline Club for two months , had been staying at this new address for the past three weeks , Jones said .
He had refused to have his fingerprints taken or volunteer a DNA sample on legal advice , said Jones .
He said Assange did not have access to vast sums of money .
He also said Assange had left Sweden after seeking permission , had made offers to be interviewed either at the Swedish embassy in London , at a police station or via video conferencing .
The case had been dropped by one Swedish prosecutor , only to be reopened by another , he told the court ."
2010-12-07,"A leading US senator suggested tonight that the New York Times and other news organisations publishing the US embassy cables being released by WikiLeaks could be investigated for breaking US espionage laws .
Joe Lieberman , the chair of the Senate homeland security committee , told Fox News : "" To me the New York Times has committed at least an act of , at best , bad citizenship , but whether they have committed a crime is a matter of discussion for the justice department . ""
Lieberman also said that the department of justice should indict Julian Assange , the founder of WikiLeaks , under the 1917 Espionage Act and try to extradite him from the UK .
Asked why this had not happened , Lieberman admitted there was probably an argument going on over how to charge Assange .
"" I think this is the most serious violation of the Espionage Act in our history , "" Lieberman said , adding : "" It sure looks to me that Assange and WikiLeaks have violated the Espionage Act . ""
At the daily state department briefing in Washington , DC , Philip Crowley , the department 's press spokesman , said : "" What WikiLeaks has done is a crime under US law . ""
Assange has been at the centre of an international row since WikiLeaks released a huge tranche of US embassy cables , in conjunction with five news organisations including the Guardian and New York Times , at the beginning of last week .
WikiLeaks gave the entire collection of cables to Der Spiegel , El País , Le Monde and the Guardian , and the Guardian shared its documents with the New York Times . ""
The New York Times has not been contacted by anyone in law enforcement "" said a spokeswoman from the paper .
Today , Assange was remanded in custody in a separate case , relating to rape charges against him in Sweden .
Earlier today , Robert Gates , the US defence secretary , welcomed Assange 's arrest in the sex case .
Speaking to reporters on a visit to US troops in Afghanistan , Gates said : "" I had n't heard that , but that sounds like good news to me . ""
WikiLeaks faces increasing problems in continuing to operate .
Today , Visa said it had suspended all payments to the organisation "" pending further investigation "" , while MasterCard said it was "" taking action to ensure that WikiLeaks can no longer accept MasterCard - branded products "" .
Assange defended the leak of the embassy cables in an article in the Australian today , saying : "" The swirling storm around WikiLeaks today reinforces the need to defend the right of all media to reveal the truth . ""
Meanwhile , Colonel Dave Lapan , a spokesman for the US department of defence , said there were indications of foreign powers "" pulling back "" from their dealings with the US since the leaking of the cables .
Lapan declined to cite any specific examples , the Associated Press news agency reported , including whether foreign officials had said they would no longer trust the US with their secrets , but told reporters that "" believing the US is not good at keeping secrets ... certainly changes things , "" and that "" generally , there has been a retrenchment "" in co - operation ."
2010-12-07,""" What will we do , "" asked Bill Thompson recently , "" when the next WikiLeaks hoard is every Twitter DM [ direct message ] or Facebook chat transcript ?
"" That 's unlikely to happen , of course .
Julian Assange 's team are more concerned with international affairs than bothering the millions of casual Twitterers .
If you 're not on the public stage , the chances are that you 're just not notable enough for Wikileaks .
Of course , there are still plenty of folks that would cause chaos in suburbia if they could , just for the laughs .
I 'm a little closer to this subject than most – because I can read your private Twitter messages .
Well , maybe not yours , specifically .
But the odds are good that – if I wanted to –
I could look through the direct messages of several of the people who 'll read this .
A few months ago , after Twitter had implemented its OAuth authorisation system , I was hired to put together a Twitter toy application – one of those little web pages that offers some sort - of - interesting statistic about your tweets , as long as you log in with your Twitter account .
Of course , it then invites you to tweet that statistic out to your friends – along with a link and a small advertising message .
The trouble is that Twitter 's authorisation process makes no distinction between small toys like that and big applications like TweetDeck that handle your entire account .
Toys only need to read public messages and perhaps tweet once , but usually request , and are being given "" read and write "" permission , which means they can do every action Twitter can provide an authorised user : the power to change profile pictures , follow and block users , and – crucially – read direct messages .
Changing your password does n't lock them out either ; you need to explicitly revoke their access .
So if I wanted to , I could use the authorisations given to the toy application to download the direct messages of all of its thousands of users .
I 'm not going to , of course –
it 's illegal and unethical – but curiosity is a powerful thing .
Imagine a web page that simply asks "" Whose inbox would you like to read ? "" .
Would you trust everyone you know not to use it ?
How about everyone they know ?
What if the attack had already been performed by someone else , and they 'd actively leaked those messages to the world – would you still be able to resist seeing what was in your friends ' inboxes if the damage was already done ?
Using existing applications ' permissions is n't the only potential attack .
Toy applications with poor security could provide a back door into people 's Twitter accounts without their creators ' knowledge .
And those with espionage on their minds could create an application that works as advertised until it sees a particular user ; the world 's millions of inboxes might not be of interest , but specific ones might be .
Bill Thompson 's WikiLeaks scenario , where every Twitter DM is somehow released , is unlikely .
But without wanting to scaremonger , I 'd say that unless Twitter starts using granular , Facebook - like authorisation , it 's a matter of when – not if – an application goes rogue .
Mischief is n't a strong motivator for releasing personal data ( the risks are too high ) but it only takes one script - kiddie cracker with a desire for notoriety , and suddenly The Pirate Bay is serving "" two - million - twitter - DMs.rar "" to anyone who 's interested .
The bottom line is this : almost every Twitter application you authorise , no matter how trivial , has near - complete control over your account .
This is not a new revelation , but it still takes a lot of people by surprise .
If you have n't recently checked the Connections page of your Twitter account to see which applications you 've authorised , you should .
And revoke them unless you 're certain you want to take the risk of them going rogue at some point .

2010-12-08,"The process of taking a rape allegation to court is notoriously hard for the victim .
When the accused assailant is a high - profile campaigner with thousands of active and vocal supporters , it becomes acutely fraught .
Claes BorgstrÃ¶m , the lawyer for the two women whose complaints of sexual assault triggered Julian Assange 's arrest , said his clients had been assaulted twice : first physically , before being "" sacrificed "" to a malevolent online attack .
The women were having "" a very tough time "" , he said .
A wealth of hostile material attacking the two women has appeared on the internet since August , when they took their complaints to the police .
Their right to anonymity has been abandoned online , where enraged bloggers have uploaded dossiers of personal photographs , raked through their CVs and tweets , and accused them of orchestrating a CIA - inspired honeytrap operation .
These online rumours were a convenient way for Assange to divert suspicion from the actual allegations , the women 's lawyer said .
Keen to set some of the more outlandish rumours to rest , BorgstrÃ¶m , a highly respected Swedish lawyer with 30 years of experience , today rebutted the claims and counter - claims that Assange 's arrest has unleashed .
He said his clients were "" the victims of a crime , but they are looked upon as the perpetrators and that is very unfortunate "" .
In an interview at his fifth - floor office in central Stockholm , he continued : "" What is going on now is very , very unfair to them because they are being pointed at as if they have started a conspiracy against Assange and WikiLeaks , and that is not true .
There is nothing wrong with their reputation and they have done nothing wrong in going to the police .
What they are going through is unfair and absurd . ""
He questioned whether the women would have pressed charges had they known in advance how their reputations would be attacked .
"" If they had known what was going to happen , maybe they would not have gone to the police at all â€ ¦ I would not have done it , "" he said .
His own involvement in the case has not been without complications .
On Monday night his firm 's website was hacked and shut down .
"" We have never experienced anything like this before , "" he said .
In today 's London Evening Standard , Assange 's UK lawyer , Mark Stephens , repeated his conviction that the affair was politically motivated . ""
The honeytrap has been sprung .
Dark forces are at work .
After what we 've seen so far you can reasonably conclude this is part of a greater plan , "" he said .
But BorgstrÃ¶m rejected the notion that the rape case and the extradition demand form part of a conspiracy to damage the reputation of the WikiLeaks founder .
"" It has nothing whatsoever to do with WikiLeaks or the CIA
and I regret very much that Julian Assange does not publicly say that himself .
That would be a way of leaving all these rumours , "" he said .
"" There are no political ingredients in this at all , but I quite understand that there are rumours . ""
WikiLeaks is headline news all over the world at this time and Assange is suspected of a sexual crime in Sweden , so of course people think there is connection .
There is nothing , zero . ""
The women were "" very credible "" witnesses , he said .
"" They have given very detailed stories about what they have been through . ""
Assange 's reputation is less the focus of scrutiny online , but an acquaintance who met him and both women in Stockholm around the time of the alleged assaults told the Guardian he had warned Assange that his behaviour towards women was going to get him into trouble . ""
I do n't think it was a conspiracy , but this provided a golden opportunity for the enemies of WikiLeaks to use the situation to neutralise him , "" said the man , who wanted to remain anonymous . ""
A personality like Assange , who is known throughout the world , in the media every day , has a huge attraction to women .
A lot of women invited him to their beds and he took that opportunity too much â€ ¦ all the time .
"" I spoke to him about this .
I warned him that it was not a good way to behave ethically and also in terms of his security .
His weakness was â€ “ is â€ “ women .
I warned him it would cause him trouble . ""
He said women responded to him in the way they might respond to meeting Mick Jagger . ""
When you attract that many women you have to think about how you behave , "" he said .
The unusual circumstances surrounding the initial handling of the alleged assault have been used by Assange 's online supporters to fan suspicions about the case .
Why was an investigation launched by the Swedish prosecutors before being dropped and then revived ?
Why did the women , who had not previously known each other , go together to the police to report the assaults ?
Why was an extradition required when Assange had earlier been allowed to leave Sweden ?
BorgstrÃ¶m attempted to refute this speculation point by point today .
He would not say where the women were , only that he was in daily contact with them .
He had advised them not to read what was being said about them on the internet , he said .
"" But they do â€ ¦ "" There was nothing unusual about different prosecutors , of varying seniority , coming to different conclusions about whether a crime had occurred , he said .
Rape was rarely a clear - cut case of an unknown man pouncing on a woman , he said , and this case , like most , was nuanced and complicated .
He refused to reveal sensitive details of the evidence provided to him by the women .
"" It is important for the future investigation that the suspect himself does not know more than necessary before he is interrogated by the Swedish police , "" he said .
But he gave a concise summary of the key allegations .
"" These two women were molested by Mr Julian Assange at two different times , independently of each other , "" he said .
One of the two women , who met Assange at a lecture he gave in Stockholm in August , wanted to contact him after the alleged assault because she wanted him to take a test for sexually transmitted infections .
She contacted the second woman , who had helped organise the lecture , to see if she could help her to find him . ""
When they spoke to each other they realised they had been through something very similar so they went to the police .
That 's not odd , "" he said .
"" They decided to go to the police , to inform the police of what happened , to ask for advice ; also they were interested in whether there was a risk that they could have got HIV .
They were not sure whether they should make a police complaint , they wanted to have some advice .
But when they told the police officer , she realised that what they were telling her was a crime
and she reported that to the public prosecutor , who decided to arrest Assange .
"" Two days later a second prosecutor , who conducted a preliminary investigation , came to a different conclusion , judging that the evidence did not meet the criterion of a rape or sexual molestation charge . ""
She made another judgment , saying : ' No it 's not .
It 's very close , but not quite , ' "" he claimed .
"" So she cancelled the arrest order and he was still suspected of molestation without sexual motives .
"" When I read that decision , my own conclusion was and still is that it was a rape , so I asked for a reopening of the case , and then the investigation was reopened .
"" There was nothing suspicious about this closing and reopening of the case , he said .
"" The law is not an exact science .
You can always make different judgments .
Different courts and different prosecutors make different decisions .
I think that the prosecutor who cancelled the arrest warrant did not study the case well enough . ""
Assange was at that time free to leave the country , BorgstrÃ¶m said .
"" He did n't have to ask anyone if he could . ""
It was only later when it appeared that Assange was unwilling to return voluntarily for questioning that the extradition process was launched , he said .
"" It turned out it was impossible to get him here for an interrogation , he wanted to be interrogated in the embassy , or wherever .
Then the prosecutor decided to arrest him , "" he said .
Privately , Assange has suggested that he is being victimised because Sweden has a tougher approach to prosecuting rape than other countries .
There are differences , not least the division of the charge of rape into three different subsections : severe , standard , and less severe .
Assange is charged with the lesser charge , but still faces a maximum sentence of four years ' imprisonment .
Lawyers are said to joke here that men in Sweden need written permission to have sex , but BorgstrÃ¶m , who was for seven years the country 's equal opportunities ombudsman , dismissed this today as an inaccurate , chauvinistic interpretation of the country 's law . ""
Men like to repeat that joke â€ ¦ no woman would say that .
I think it is very unfair .
There is not an equal situation for men and women in society as a whole , but especially not in this field . ""
Whether Assange will be prosecuted in Sweden on the four charges of rape , sexual molestation , and coercion against him depends on whether or not the Swedish director of prosecutions , Marianne Ny , finds enough evidence to be confident that the case will stand up in court .
Before she does that , she needs to question Assange further , and may also need to question the women again .
The probability of the prosecution going ahead is around 50 - 50 , or perhaps a little more than that , BorgstrÃ¶m said .
"" In Sweden , like in other countries , the burden of proof lies upon the prosecutor .
The prosecutor must prove beyond reasonable doubt that a client is guilty of the crimes .
Beyond reasonable doubt is very high â€ “
I do n't know whether she can reach that level .
And history tells you that you can reach different judgments on the same material depending on how you interpret that material . ""
The way the case has been handled in Sweden attracted criticism in the UK earlier this week , amid confusion over the opening and closing of the case .
But Assange would get a fair trial , BorgstrÃ¶m asserted : "" The Swedish court system is one of the best and strongest in the world .
The WikiLeaks affair will have no influence on the case if it goes to court . """
2010-12-08,"The list of targets is expanding daily as Washington , smarting over the damage caused by the release of secret diplomatic cables , mounts a revenge operation against WikiLeaks , its founder Julian Assange , and anyone associated with them .
The New York Times and Visa joined the hit list yesterday , while anonymous cyber - attacks continued against sites hosting the whistleblower site .
The US , which takes pride in being a bastion for freedom of speech and champions internet freedom , has been accused of hypocrisy in its reprisals against WikiLeaks , said to be being co - ordinated by the Obama administration .
Analysts said yesterday there were parallels to recent cyber - attacks on Estonia and Google in China
â€ “ both condemned by the US â€ “ and the American response to WikiLeaks , both publicly and covertly .
The public face of the reprisals is Joe Lieberman , chairman of the Senate homeland security committee , who has put pressure on companies to end their association , called for Assange to be prosecuted in the US , and yesterday added the New York Times to the list of those who should be facing investigation .
The public response of the White House , Barack Obama has not yet said a word about WikiLeaks , the state department and the Pentagon is to shrug it off as damaging but containable .
But Larry Johnson , a former CIA analyst who also worked with special operations in the state department 's counter - terrorism section , believes the campaign against WikiLeaks is being run from the top .
"" It is being directed by the White House , "" he said .
"" This is not just each individual department doing its own thing .
I would hope it is being co - ordinated by the White House rather than letting people run off on their own .
"" The campaign began quietly last Tuesday with a call by staff at the Senate homeland security committee to Amazon , then hosting the WikiLeaks site .
24 hours later it booted WikiLeaks out .
Another US software company also ended ties with WikiLeaks , the French government issued a warning to web servers in its own country , and the bank accounts of WikiLeaks and Assange were frozen .
Lieberman , asked by Fox News about the legal position of news organisations such as the New York Times distributing the leaked cables , said WikiLeaks had violated the Espionage Act . ""
Then what about the news organisations , including the Times , that distributed it â€ ¦ the New York Times has committed at least an act of bad citizenship .
Whether they have committed a crime I think bears a very intensive inquiry by the justice department , "" said Lieberman , a former Democrat , now an independent with close relations with the Republicans .
Leslie Phillips , a spokesman for Lieberman , said the senator is "" encouraged that businesses around the world â€ “ most recently Visa and PayPal â€ “ have followed the lead of Amazon and dropped WikiLeaks as a customer of their services "" .
She added that he encourages other firms that have a business relationship with WikiLeaks to sever their ties .
Asked if he was working on his own or in co - ordination with the state department and Pentagon , she said : "" Senator Lieberman has made no demands on any business regarding WikiLeaks . ""
His belief is that once it became known that WikiLeaks was disseminating stolen classified information these businesses understood that in order to adhere to their own terms of use , and to be good corporate citizens , they would have to sever their relationships with WikiLeaks . ""
Visa got the message .
It said it had suspended all payments to WikiLeaks pending an investigation of the organisation 's business .
The state department and especially the Treasury have had enormous experience over the last few years on how to put the squeeze on banks and other financial institutions that have , or had , dealings with Iran .
The Pentagon has said publicly it has the capability to mount cyber - attacks but denied it intended targeting WikiLeaks .
Adam Segal , a national security specialist at the Council on Foreign Relations , said it was unlikely the Pentagon would do this , given there would be enormous collateral damage , with all sorts of organisations that had nothing to do with WikiLeaks potentially being hit as servers went down . ""
Given the information that comes from the state department about internet freedom , it would be hard to justify , "" Segal said .
A parallel could be drawn with the 2007 attack on Estonia , he added .
It had not been conducted by the Russian government , but "" patriotic hackers "" .
Crucially , the attacks aimed at bringing WikiLeaks and its cache of diplomatic cables offline are being countered by a mass effort of technological support for the whistleblowers ' site .
Around 800 websites are currently "" mirroring "" WikiLeaks by adding a subdomain to their site , which points users to WikiLeaks even if its domain name is removed .
The list of mirror sites has risen from 74 on Sunday afternoon .
Counterattacks have been mounted against companies that have dropped WikiLeaks .
Each of the six companies , including Amazon and eBay , that have severed ties with Assange and WikiLeaks following political pressure have quickly become the subject of sustained online assaults .
It took just hours for the Swiss bank , PostFinance , to be brought offline after announcing it was closing Assange 's account .
The ephemeral Anonymous group has claimed responsibility for the attacks as part of what it calls "" Operation Payback "" .
Anonymous has gained notoriety for attacks on copyright - enforcement agencies and large record labels .
The US justice department has declined to specify what actions attorney general Eric Holder was referring to in relation to Assange on Monday .
He said : "" I personally authorised a number of things last week and that 's an indication of the seriousness with which we take this matter and the highest level of involvement at the department of justice . ""
It may in the end have to settle for watching proceedings in London and Sweden , although its lawyers are still investigating whether he could be prosecuted in the US under the Espionage Act ."
2010-12-08,
2010-12-08,"Julian Assange 's extradition to Sweden has nothing to do with WikiLeaks , it 's all about rape –
or so we are told .
And as I 've frequently written before , rape is an allegation to be taken seriously .
The outright dismissal of claims by a woman that she has been the victim of sexual assault , the crowdsourcing approach to dissecting a rape case – the latest viral response to Assange 's arrest – leave a bad , bad taste in the mouth .
Having said that , even Swedish rape experts – whose primary concern is with the treatment of female victims of rape – have told me that when it comes to the question of political interference in Sweden 's criminal justice system , "" it 's impossible to rule it out "" .
There are various questions to be asked about the timing of Assange 's possible extradition to Sweden , and – for those who see rape allegations as something of a distraction from the main story here – what happens next ?
America has made no secret of its interest in Assange .
So much so that a group of respected figures – including Noam Chomsky – have just written an open letter decrying the bloodthirsty rhetoric emerging from the American right : "" kill him "" , "" snatch him "" , "" neutralise him "" … you get the picture .
But it 's members of the Democratic government , and not rightwing commentators , who are really of interest .
The attorney general , Eric Holder , is still insisting that criminal charges against Assange in the US are a real possibility .
They have been investigating how to indict Assange since way before the current wave of cable leaks , and their primary weapon so far has been the espionage act .
But , as I have written before , this is problematic for various reasons .
The espionage act makes it a crime to disclose information "" relating to the national defence "" to "" any person not entitled to receive it "" .
But this is an offence designed to prosecute insiders who commit acts of espionage or leaking –
it has never been used successfully against a media organisation .
When the current act was passed in 1917 , there was a debate about whether to make the law broad enough to specifically restrict the press , and instead the emphasis was placed on espionage .
Not such good news for Bradley Manning , the former military intelligence official now in detention for disclosing secrets to WikiLeaks .
But good news for Assange .
Even during the second world war – when the national security argument was perhaps easier to make – and the Chicago Tribune published information that really could have jeopardised military strategy , the case was ultimately abandoned .
The difference between then and now , of course , is the capacity of leaks to go viral .
One of the reasons that the second world war prosecution was dropped was the classic problem that also arises in libel cases – bringing legal proceedings in respect of confidential information often has the exact opposite effect , bringing it to the attention of anyone who missed it the first time round .
It 's unlikely that many people have missed the information coming out of WikiLeaks – even shutting the site down has failed to stem the spread of mirror sites .
Even as Assange was warming up for his first night in prison yesterday , WikiLeaks vowed to plough on with the remainder of the 250,000 leaks in its possession .
And since the initial espionage cases in the first half of the last century , America 's supreme court has strengthened protection for freedom of speech , which has constitutional status in the US under the first amendment .
Holder has obviously cottoned on to this weakness .
"" I do n't want to get into specifics here , but people would have a misimpression if the only statute you think that we are looking at is the espionage act , "" Holder said at a news conference .
"" That is certainly something that might play a role , but there are other statutes , other tools that we have at our disposal .
"" What are those other tools ?
Conspiracy to commit espionage is one option – for example if investigators can show that Assange directed or assisted Manning or others in his violations of the espionage act .
Trafficking in stolen government property is another .
But I 'm probably as guilty of that as Assange is – as are any of you who read the Guardian stories and tweet them , forward them or link to them on Facebook .
As the leaked documents are already copies , these offences go back to the same problem as those under the espionage act – Assange was not the one dealing in the data in the first instance .
If the US does get it together to indict Assange , then an indictment would be handed down by a grand jury , proceedings that are kept secret in the US .
This has led to speculation that any such indictment would be kept under wraps until the time came for a viable extradition to the country .
That is unlikely to happen any time soon though .
First there is the small matter of the current rape proceedings in Sweden .
Assange is facing extradition there from the UK under the terms of the European arrest warrant fast - track proceedings , which facilitate transfers between European countries .
If Assange is sent to Sweden – and that remains an "" if "" at the moment as his lawyers have plenty of arguments with which they plan to contest the extradition request – then the question of an extradition to the US will become relevant .
There is a Sweden - US extradition treaty , signed in 1961 , which provides a legal foundation for extraditions between the countries .
But there is still discretion for Sweden to refuse extraditions for "" political offences "" or where the suspect has reason to fear persecution on account of their membership of a social group or political beliefs .
The treaty also specifies the offences which qualify for extradition , and espionage is not one of them .
If the treaty does n't apply , there would still be scope for the country to agree to his extradition to the US – Swedish law permits extradition more generally to countries outside Europe , but this could only take place after the current rape proceedings were concluded .
Under similar arrangements , Assange could also be vulnerable to extradition requests from other countries , including his native Australia , where the authorities are still investigating a potential case against him .
In short , for every politician itching to put Assange on trial , there is a legal obstacle to be overcome , which makes one thing and one thing only certain – for the question of Assange 's future under the law , there is no end in sight ."

So many imponderables in life , but after his arrest Julian Assange can have no doubt about the kind of reception he will get if ever he is forced to take a trip to America .
Hang '
i m high , says Republican presidential wannabee Mike Huckabee .
He 's "" an anti - American operative with blood on his hands "" , says Sarah Palin .
And then there is the widely publicised salvo from Congressman Peter King , incoming chairman of the House homeland security committee . ""
WikiLeaks appears to meet the legal criteria "" of a US - designated terrorist organisation , King wrote to secretary of state Hillary Clinton .
"" I urge you to work with the Swedish government to determine the means by which Mr Julian Assange can be brought to justice for his actions while recognising and respecting Swedish sovereign law . ""
But it 's OK because this is the same Peter King who in 2008 joined the campaign to achieve bail for Pol Brennan , who escaped from the Maze in 1983 , along with 37 other republican prisoners .
Britain initially sought Brennan 's extradition , a request withdrawn in 2000 as part of the Good Friday Agreement , although technically Brennan remained a fugitive .
King , who faced much criticism for his alleged association with the IRA – links broken post-9/11 – weighed in on Brennan 's behalf in 2008 when the escapee was arrested at a border checkpoint in Texas .
The authorities , noting Brennan 's US work permit had expired , moved to deport him .
King then seemed particularly determined to ensure that Brennan received a fair shake from the authorities .
That is to his credit .
Amid the bloodlust , does n't Assange deserve the same ?

2010-12-08,"Australia 's foreign minister said the US government and whoever originally leaked 250,000 diplomatic cables should bear the responsibility for any security breaches – not the Australian WikiLeaks founder , Julian Assange .
Kevin Rudd said legal liability rested with the initial leakers and Assange should be protected from threats to his safety as the US stepped up pressure on companies and organisations with ties to WikiLeaks .
His comments came after the Sydney Morning Herald published leaked cables in which US diplomats described Rudd , then Australia 's prime minister , as a mistake - prone control freak with a tendency towards making "" snap announcements without consulting other countries or within the Australian government "" .
Rudd dismissed the criticism , saying that it was "" like water off a duck 's back "" .
Assange , who was arrested in London yesterday , faces extradition to Sweden for alleged sexual assaults , but Rudd took the offensive against the US over the leaks . ""
Mr Assange is not himself responsible for the unauthorised release of 250,000 documents from the US diplomatic communications network , "" Rudd told Reuters . ""
The Americans are responsible for that .
I think there are real questions to be asked about the adequacy of their security systems and the level of access that people have had to that material over a long period of time . "" . ""
The core responsibility , and therefore legal liability , goes to those individuals responsible for that initial unauthorised release , "" he said .
"" There is a separate and secondary legal question … which is the legal liabilities of those responsible for the dissemination of that information , whether it 's WikiLeaks , whether it 's Reuters , or whether it is anybody else . "" .
His robust remarks in interviews with the Reuters news agency and Seven network coincided with the publication of an opinion piece by Assange in the Australian in which the WikiLeaks founder accused Australian authorities of "" pandering "" to the US and being prepared to harass WikiLeaks supporters and "" frame "" an Australian citizen .
Rudd said today that Australia would provide Assange with consular assistance after a request by him to the country 's high commission in London .
"" That is the proper thing to do for any Australian citizen , "" he said .
Julia Gillard , who toppled Rudd in June , yesterday called WikiLeaks actions "" grossly irresponsible "" but said publication would not have been possible "" if there had not been an illegal act undertaken "" in the US .
However , she made clear Australian authorities were still investigating whether Assange had broken any Australian laws .
Assange says he has faced calls for his assassination , among other threats .
Rudd said : "" We 'd be concerned about the safety and security of all Australians .
People should be free from any such threats . ""
Asked what governments should do in response to the leaked cables , Rudd said : "" Rule No 1 for our friends in the United States is – how do you tighten things up a bit ? ""
I think that 's a fair old question .
Maybe 2 million or so people having access to this stuff is a bit of a problem . ''
According to the Sydney Morning Herald , the leaked cables show how US diplomats initially saw Rudd as a "" safe pair of hands "" , but the favourable impression was soon replaced by criticism of his apparent focus on media opportunities and a string of "" foreign policy mistakes "" .
Rudd dismissed the criticism of his own "" micro - management "" in leaked cables , saying : "" I do n't , frankly , give a damn about this sort of thing .
You just get on with it . ""
Gillard defended Rudd , telling reporters today : "" Kevin Rudd is a man who throughout his adult life has devoted himself to expertise in foreign policy .
He 's bringing that expertise to bear for the Australian nation and doing an absolutely first - class job . """

2010-12-08,"Many women in both Sweden and Britain will wonder at the unusual zeal with which Julian Assange is being pursued for rape allegations ( Report , 8 December ) .
Women in Sweden do n't fare better than we do in Britain when it comes to rape .
Though Sweden has the highest per capita number of reported rapes in Europe and these have quadrupled in the last 20 years , conviction rates have decreased .
On 23 April 2010 Carina Hägg and Nalin Pekgul ( respectively MP and chairwoman of Social Democratic Women in Sweden ) wrote in the Göteborgs - Posten that "" up to 90 % of all reported rapes never get to court .
In 2006 six people were convicted of rape though almost 4,000 people were reported "" .
They endorsed Amnesty International 's call for an independent inquiry to examine the rape cases that had been closed and the quality of the original investigations .
Assange , who it seems has no criminal convictions , was refused bail in England despite sureties of more than £ 120,000 .
Yet bail following rape allegations is routine .
For two years we have been supporting a woman who suffered rape and domestic violence from a man previously convicted after attempting to murder an ex - partner and her children – he was granted bail while police investigated .
There is a long tradition of the use of rape and sexual assault for political agendas that have nothing to do with women 's safety .
In the south of the US , the lynching of black men was often justified on grounds that they had raped or even looked at a white woman .
Women do n't take kindly to our demand for safety being misused , while rape continues to be neglected at best or protected at worst .

The heading of John Naughton 's article ( Live with the WikiLeakable world or shut down the net .
It 's your choice , 7 December ) does more than introduce a rather unpleasant new adjective .
In criticising governments and agencies that are trying to limit or close down the WikiLeaks operation , he seems to give the internet itself a moral superiority that it does not possess .
All the internet does is allow information to be copied , disseminated and accessed at an unprecedented rate ; it can offer no value judgment about the outcome .
For example , the internet can allow a prospective employer to have in front of them an embarrassing photograph posted on a social network by an applicant 10 years ago .
Do we say , jolly good , the more openness the better –
no , we routinely advise young people to use the privacy settings and to be careful about whom they trust with personal data .
Clearly this is advice some governments need to take about their own internal data .
It 's too early to tell whether the present torrent of releases will have good or bad effects .
But surely the question of whether we should live with WikiLeaks or close down the internet is a false dichotomy .
The need for some things to be secret some of the time has not changed ; the rise of the internet just makes it harder to hang on to them .
Hugh Davies Sandhurst , Berkshire • Congratulations on publishing Naughton 's outstanding article about WikiLeaks .
It refreshingly acknowledges the corruption of governments that continue unjust wars merely to save face , even after they themselves acknowledge that they can never achieve their goals .
It also exposes whose side such powerful ( and popular ) internet sites as Amazon , Facebook , PayPal etc are on when it comes to a choice between the power elites and the people .

The drip , drip of the WikiLeaks revelations exposes the so - called special relationship between the US and the UK as being totally one - sided ( Report , 4 December ) .
The UK supports the US 's wars with the lives of its troops and billions of pounds of treasure , and allows the US to use its Nato airbases for missions outside those for which they were originally intended .
Furthermore , the UK promises to protect the US from its investigation of the Iraq war , and allows its citizens ( Gary McKinnon , for example ) to face being expedited to a justice system that , after conviction , will impose a much harsher sentence than what they would receive for a similar offence in the UK .
Ted Heath was right in refusing to accept the concept of a special relationship between the US and the UK .
A special relationship must offer advantages to both parties .
This one does n't .

The latest WikiLeaks revelations on the al - Megrahi case , if factually accurate , raise some disturbing questions ( Report , 8 December ) .
What , for instance , led the Libyan regime to think that it might achieve its objective of securing al - Megrahi 's release by issuing threats against Britain ?
Could it have been because they had witnessed Saudi Arabia 's successful bid to end the Serious Fraud Office 's investigation of allegations of corruption by BAE Systems in negotiating the al - Yamamah arms deal , by issuing threats against Britain just three years before ?
Professor Philip Stenning Keele University • Idiots , liars , racists , gangsters and torturers
have human rights too ; so it 's deplorable that WickedLeaks should have so comprehensively abrogated these .
Nonetheless , we owe Julian Assange and his source(s ) an immense debt of gratitude for finally , incontrovertibly , rubbishing the purveyors of ID and DNA databases who tried to pretend that data would be secure and only accessible to those authorised and needing access , and regularly trotted out the mantra : "" If you 've done nothing wrong , you 've nothing to fear . ""
Well , those who 've been WikiLeaked may not exactly confirm the latter ... but it 's rather delicious to see it come back and bite them !

2010-12-08,"Wikileaks founder Julian Assange , this week denied bail over sexual assault allegations , with Amazon banning his site from its servers and finances squeezed from all sides , now faces yet another blow as a disaffected former colleague prepares to tell the inside story of the whistleblowing website .
One - time Wikileaks spokesman Daniel Domscheit - Berg , who was Assange 's second - in - command for three years at Wikileaks , is to write a tell - all book , Inside Wikileaks :
My Time at the World 's Most Dangerous Website .
German publisher Econ Verlag has announced that it will publish the book on 27 January , with English language versions sure to follow promptly .
Computer scientist Domscheit - Berg , born in 1978 , was a public face for the website as its press spokesperson under the assumed name of Daniel Schmitt .
But he left Wikileaks in September of this year after falling out with Assange , telling the press that too much power had become concentrated in the founder 's hands , with "" a lack of transparency "" over how decisions were made and "" a lot of resentment "" in the organisation .
Domscheit - Berg has also vowed to set up a rival site to Wikileaks .
Econ Verlag promised that Inside Wikileaks will take the reader "" into the heart "" of the whistleblowing website , and "" tell the story of WikiLeaks as it has not yet been heard "" ."
2010-12-08,"The MasterCard website was forced offline for several hours today , following an online assault led by a shadowy group of hackers protesting against the card issuer 's decision to block payments made to the WikiLeaks website .
The "" distributed denial of service "" attack was apparently orchestrated by a "" hacktivist "" group calling itself Anonymous , which has in recent days temporarily paralysed the websites of Post Finance , the Swiss bank which closed WikiLeaks frontman Julian Assange 's account , and the website of the Swedish prosecution office .
Twitter is next in its sights , following allegations that the social networking site is "" censoring "" visibility of the breadth of discussion of WikiLeaks by preventing it from appearing in Twitter 's "" trends "" .
Twitter has denied that it is doing this , saying its systems identify topics that are "" being talked about more right now than they were previously "" – which does n't include WikiLeaks .
But who , or what , is – or are – Anonymous ?
A 22-year - old spokesman , who wished to be known only as "" Coldblood "" , told the Guardian that the group – which is about a thousand strong – is "" quite a loose band of people who share the same kind of ideals "" and wish to be a force for "" chaotic good "" .
There is no real command structure in the group , the London - based spokesman said , while most of its members are teenagers who are "" trying to make an impact on what happens with the limited knowledge they have "" .
But others are parents , IT professionals and people who happen to have time – and resources – on their hands .
The group has gained notoriety for its attacks on copyright - enforcement agencies and organisations such as the Church of Scientology .
Anonymous was born out of the influential internet messageboard 4chan , a forum popular with hackers and gamers , in 2003 .
The group 's name is a tribute to 4chan 's early days , when any posting to its forums where no name was given was ascribed to "" Anonymous "" .
But the ephemeral group , which picks up causes "" whenever it feels like it "" , has now "" gone beyond 4Chan into something bigger "" , its spokesman said .
The membership of Anonymous is impossible to pin down ; it has been described as being like a flock of birds – the only way you can identify members is by what they 're doing together .
Essentially , once enough people on the 4chan message boards decide that an issue is worth pursuing in large enough numbers , it becomes an "" Anonymous "" cause .
The group counts the current campaign in support of WikiLeaks as "" probably one of [ its ] most high profile yet "" .
The group gained notoriety more recently for a number of sustained assaults against the sites of US music industry body RIAA , Kiss musician Gene Simmons , and solicitors ' firms involved in lawsuits against people suspected of illegal filesharing .
In early 2008 , Anonymous launched a campaign against the Church of Scientology , bringing down related websites and promising to "" expel "" the religion from the internet .
"" We 're against corporations and government interfering on the internet , "" Coldblood added .
"" We believe it should be open and free for everyone .
Governments should n't try to censor because they do n't agree with it . ""
Anonymous is supporting WikiLeaks not because we agree or disagree with the data that is being sent out , but we disagree with any from of censorship on the internet .
If we let WikiLeaks fall without a fight then governments will think they can just take down any sites they wish or disagree with . ""
The spokesman said Anonymous plans to "" move away "" from DDoS attacks and instead focus on "" methods to support "" WikiLeaks , such as mirroring the site .
"" There 's no doubt in [ Anonymous members ' ] mind that they are breaking [ the ] law , "" he said of the latest attacks .
"" But they feel that there 's safety in numbers . ""
Anonymous refused to say whether it would target government - owned websites next , but warned : "" anything goes . """

Co - ordinated attacks by online activists who support the site and its founder Julian Assange – who is in UK custody accused of raping two Swedish women – have seen the websites of the alleged victims ' Swedish lawyer disabled , while commercial and political targets have also been subject to attack by a loose coalition of global hackers .
The Swedish prosecution authority has confirmed its website was attacked last night and this morning .
MasterCard was partially paralysed today in revenge for the payment network 's decision to cease taking donations to WikiLeaks .
In an attack referred to as Operation Payback , a group of online activists calling themselves Anonymous appear to have orchestrated a DDoS ( distributed denial of service ) attack on the financial site , bringing its service to a halt .
Attempts to access www.mastercard.com have been unsuccessful since shortly after 9.30am .
The site would say only that it was "" experiencing heavy traffic on its external corporate website "" but insisted this would not interfere with its ability to process transactions .
But one payment service company told the BBC its customers were experiencing "" a complete loss of service "" on MasterCard SecureCode .
The credit card company later confirmed that loss .
MasterCard tonight said in a statement it was "" working to restore normal service levels "" after "" a concentrated effort to flood our corporate web site with traffic and slow access . ""
The company added : "" It is important to note that our systems have not been compromised and there is no impact on our cardholders ' ability to use their cards for secure transactions globally . ""
MasterCard announced on Monday that it would no longer process donations to WikiLeaks , which it claimed was engaged in illegal activity .
Visa , Amazon , Swiss bank PostFinance and others have also announced in recent days that they will cease trading with the whistleblowing site .
The moves have led to concerted attempts by hackers to target companies they deem guilty of "" censoring "" WikiLeaks .
Operation Payback , which has been targeting commercial sites that have cut their ties with WikiLeaks for some days , has also made threats to other organisations including Twitter , which it says is suppressing the site .
"" We will fire at anything or anyone that tries to censor WikiLeaks , including multibillion - dollar companies such as PayPal , "" a statement circulating online , apparently from Operation Payback , said .
"" Twitter , you 're next for censoring # WikiLeaks discussion .
The major shitstorm has begun , "" it added .
Twitter has issued a statement denying it has censored the hashtag , and saying confusion had arisen over its "" trending "" facility .
Meanwhile it has also emerged that Visa has today ordered DataCell , an IT firm that helps WikiLeaks collect payments , to suspend all of its transactions – even those involving other payees – a day after it cut off all the firm 's donations being made to WikiLeaks .
DataCell , a small Icelandic company that facilitates transfers made by credit cards including Visa and MasterCard , says it will take up "" immediate legal actions "" and warned that the powerful "" duopoly "" of Visa and MasterCard could spell "" the end of the credit card business worldwide "" .
Andreas Fink , chief executive of DataCell , said in a statement : "" Putting all payments on hold for seven days or more is one thing but rejecting all further attempts to donate is making the donations impossible . ""
This does clearly create massive financial losses to WikiLeaks , which seems to be the only purpose of this suspension .
"" This is not about the brand of Visa ; this is about politics , and Visa should not be involved in this . ""
Visa customers are contacting us in masses to confirm that they really donate and they are not happy about Visa rejecting them .
It is obvious that Visa is under political pressure to close us down . ""
Earlier , PayPal , which has also been the subject of technological attack since it suspended payments to WikiLeaks last week , appeared to admit that it had taken the step after an intervention from the US state department .
PayPal 's vice - president of platform , Osama Bedier , told an internet conference the site had decided to freeze WikiLeaks ' account on 4 December after government representatives said it was engaged in illegal activity . ""
On November 27th , the state department , the US government basically , wrote a letter saying that the WikiLeaks ' activities were deemed illegal in the United States and as a result our policy group had to make the decision of suspending the account , "" Bedier said .
He added : "" We ... comply with regulations around the world , making sure that we protect our brand . ""
His remarks will undoubtedly intensify criticism from supporters of WikiLeaks that the site is being targeted for political reasons .
Operation Payback , which refers to itself as "" an anonymous , decentralised movement that fights against censorship and copywrong "" , and has been linked to the influential internet messageboard 4Chan , argues that such steps "" are long strides closer to a world where we can not say what we think and are unable to express our opinions and ideas "" .
It added : "" We can not let this happen .
This is why our intention is to find out who is responsible for this failed attempt at censorship . ""
This is why we intend to utilise our resources to raise awareness , attack those against and support those who are helping lead our world to freedom and democracy . ""
The MasterCard action was confirmed on Twitter at 9.39am by user @Anon_Operation , who later tweeted : "" We are glad to tell you that http://www.mastercard.com/ is down and it 's confirmed !
# ddos # WikiLeaks Operation : Payback ( is a bitch ! )
# PAYBACK "" PostFinance was successfully hacked on Monday after it shut down one of WikiLeaks ' key bank accounts , accusing Assange of lying .
Its service since has been seriously disrupted .
PayPal has also been targeted a number of times , but while its internal blog was paralysed for more than two hours , the payment processing facility has so far been able to withstand the attacks .
Other cyber attacks were mounted yesterday on EveryDNS.net , which suspended dealings on 3 December , while Amazon , which removed WikiLeaks content from its EC2 cloud on 1 December , may also be a possible target .
According to bloggers monitoring the cyber attacks , those involved in the protests have also been targeting the websites of US senator Joe Lieberman , who is an outspoken critic of WikiLeaks , and Sarah Palin , who said Assange should be treated like a terrorist .
Claes Bergstrom , the lawyer of the two women who claim Assange raped or assaulted them , confirmed his website was shut down overnight , as was the site of a lawyer representing Assange in Sweden .
This was the first time such an attack had occurred , he said .
DDoS attacks , which often involve flooding the target site with requests so that it can not cope with legitimate communication , are illegal ."
2010-12-09,"Why is Julian Assange so reluctant to return to Sweden , where the number of rape accusations is so much higher than most other European countries , but rape convictions are among the lowest ?
Awful as it is to doubt a woman 's claims of sexual assault , any prosecution would seem to be on questionable ground .
According to reports , one woman claims that a crime was committed against her because the consensual condom was broken , she says deliberately by Assange .
Just weird , especially when she remained "" thrilled "" to be hosting a party for him the next day .
The other reportedly says Assange had sex with her consensually at night , but non - consensually â€ “ and without a condom â€ “ when she had n't achieved consciousness in the morning .
( It certainly puts a new slant on the unfortunate NHS advertising slogan : "" Wake up to rape . "" )
The second woman did n't get upset until she had met and exchanged notes with the first one .
Neither did the first , for that matter .
Assange hardly comes over as Prince Charming , but Lord knows that 's not a crime .
Meanwhile , Sweden offers some of the most powerful source protection legislation in the world .
Assange should high - tail it off to Scandinavia , clear his name ( since he professes innocence ) , and in the transparent and open way he promotes so passionately .
Then he should claim political asylum .
He 's safer in Sweden than in Britain , I fear ."
2010-12-09,"Russia has suggested that Julian Assange should be awarded the Nobel peace prize , in an unexpected show of support from Moscow for the jailed WikiLeaks founder .
In what appears to be a calculated dig at the US , the Kremlin urged non - governmental organisations to think seriously about "" nominating Assange as a Nobel Prize laureate "" . ""
Public and non - governmental organisations should think of how to help him , "" the source from inside president Dmitry Medvedev 's office told Russian news agencies .
Speaking in Brussels , where Medvedev was attending a Russia - EU summit yesterday , the source went on : "" Maybe , nominate him as a Nobel Prize laureate .
"" Russia 's reflexively suspicious leadership appears to have come round to WikiLeaks , having decided that the ongoing torrent of disclosures are ultimately far more damaging and disastrous to America 's long - term geopolitical interests than they are to Russia 's .
The Kremlin 's initial reaction to stories dubbing Russia a corrupt "" mafia state "" and kleptocracy was , predictably , negative .
Last week Medvedev 's spokesman dubbed the revelations "" not worthy of comment "" while Putin raged that a US diplomatic cable comparing him to Batman and Medvedev to Robin was "" arrogant "" and "" unethical "" .
State TV ignored the claims .
Subsequent disclosures , however , that Nato had secretly prepared a plan in case
Russia invaded its Baltic neighbours have left the Kremlin smarting .
Today Russia 's foreign minister Sergei Lavrov said Nato had to explain why it privately considered Russia an enemy while publicly describing it warmly as a "" strategic partner "" and ally .
Nato should make clear its position on WikiLeaks cables published by the Guardian alleging that the alliance had devised plans to defend Poland , Latvia , Lithuania and Estonia against Russia , Lavrov said .
"" With one hand , Nato seeks agreement with us on joint partnership , and with the other , it makes a decision that it needs to defend .
So when is Nato more sincere ? ""
Lavrov asked today .
"" We have asked these questions and are expecting answers to them .
We think we are entitled to that . ""
Lavrov said his attitude towards the leaked US state department cables was "" philosophical "" .
"" It is interesting to read , including what ambassadors write to provide a stream of information to their capitals , "" he admitted .
Dmitry Rogozin , Russia 's hardline ultra - nationalist ambassador to Nato , also today voiced his support for the embattled Assange .
He tweeted that Assange 's arrest and incarceration on Monday at the City of Westminster magistrates ' court demonstrated that there was "" no media freedom "" in the west .
Assange 's "" fate "" amounted to "" political persecution "" and a lack of human rights , the ambassador said .
In London , meanwhile , Russia 's chargÃ © d'affaires and acting ambassador in the UK , Alexander Sternik , said relations with Britain had improved since the coalition came to power .
He complained , however , about the hostile reaction in the British media after Fifa 's executive committee voted that Russia â€ “ and not England â€
“ should host the 2018 World Cup .
In a briefing to journalists this morning , Sternik said : "" While the English bid was technically a strong one , the Russian bid was in line with the well - known Fifa philosophy of opening new frontiers for world football .
The vote result was therefore quite logical , and while the disappointment of many in England is understandable , the media outrage was a step too far .
It 's not cricket , as the English say . """
2010-12-09,"Julian Assange , the editor - in - chief of WikiLeaks , has been transferred to the segregation unit of Wandsworth prison where the authorities are planning to give him limited access to the internet , it emerged tonight .
Assange , the most famous inmate in the Victorian jail , met his legal team after being sent there on remand when he was refused bail on Tuesday .
Sweden is seeking his extradition over allegations of sexual assault .
Assange is thought to have asked to be housed away from other prisoners , who had shown a high degree of interest in him after he arrived .
A source said other inmates had been supportive of Assange , whom the US has accused of jeopardising its national security by releasing a flood of confidential diplomatic documents .
Assange 's legal team will attempt to secure bail for him from Westminster magistrates next Tuesday .
His solicitor , Mark Stephens , said Assange was "" quite chipper
– he seemed to be bearing up "" .
Assange was wearing a grey prison tracksuit because he did not have any of his own clothes .
The decision by the judge to remand him in custody had taken the WikiLeaks founder and his lawyers by surprise , and he went to prison in the clothes he was wearing .
Assange complained about the daytime TV , Stephens said , adding that "" he does n't have access to a computer , even without an internet connection , or to writing material .
He 's got some files but does n't have any paper to write on and put them in . ""
In the wake of online attacks on corporations by pro - WikiLeaks hackers , Stephens said Assange was concerned that "" people have unjustly accused WikiLeaks of inspiring cyber attacks "" .
Assange , 39 , was seen by a doctor when he arrived at Wandsworth – all prisoners are assessed to see if they pose a suicide risk .
He was kept for a night in the prison 's Onslow centre , which contains sex offenders and others assessed to be vulnerable .
As part of a scheme called "" access to justice "" , prison authorities are arranging for Assange to be given a computer so he can work on his case .
The computer will have limited internet access .
Assange asked for one of his legal team to be allowed to bring him a laptop , but was refused – prisoners are not commonly allowed their own computers .
Assange , who was born in Australia , also saw officials from the Australian high commission .
He has his own cell and because of the consular and legal visits did not exercise , but will normally get one hour a day .
Because he is in the segregation unit , his association with other prisoners will be limited .
Swedish prosecutors want to interview Assange about allegations of sexual assault against two women .
His lawyers say they fear the US will attempt to extradite him to face charges over the release of hundreds of thousands of secret cables , although Washington has not so far launched any legal action against him .
In a letter to the Guardian appearing tomorrow , prominent supporters including John Pilger , Terry Jones , Miriam Margolyes and AL Kennedy call for Assange 's immediate release .
"" We protest at the attacks on WikiLeaks and , in particular , on Julian Assange , "" they write , adding that the leaks have "" assisted democracy in revealing the real views of our governments over a range of issues "" ."
2010-12-09,"Swedish media and politicians have rejected speculation that political pressure from abroad was exerted on the country 's justice system to secure Julian Assange 's arrest and extradition .
Martin Valfridsson , a spokesman for the Swedish minister of justice ,
Beatrice Ask , said yesterday the suggestion was "" completely wrong "" . ""
As far as I know no such pressure has been put on Sweden , "" he said .
Jonas Björk , a correspondent with the TV4 channel , said the idea that the original rape allegations were a part of a conspiracy to attack the WikiLeaks founder stretched credibility . ""
For it to have been a honey - trap operation would have been so complicated that I ca n't see how it could have been pulled off ; if it was , then I tip my hat to the CIA , "" he said .
The second question of whether international pressure was applied to Sweden to demand an arrest was a less nonsensical hypothesis , he said , but , "" I believe the politicians when they say they have n't had any pressure from abroad . ""
John Pilger 's claim that Sweden "" should be ashamed "" , in comments he made outside the extradition hearing in London on Tuesday , has triggered some annoyance .
Oisin Cantwell , a columnist writing in Aftonbladet , a big circulation tabloid , was contemptuous of Assange 's celebrity backers .
"" How can John Pilger be so sure about the lack of fairness of the Swedish justice system without having any insights into the ongoing investigation ? ""
The celebrity support for Assange was similar to the support offered by Hollywood stars to Roman Polanski when he was arrested last year , accused of raping a 13-year - old , he argued , and equally misplaced .
Britta Svensson writing in the liberal tabloid Expressen , dismissed the idea , circulating on the internet , that the Swedish law on rape was excessively strict .
"" There is no parliamentary Swedish party who thinks that the Swedish sex laws are too harsh , "" she wrote .
Groups supporting Wikileaks in Stockholm also rejected speculation that the case was politically motivated .
Rick Falkvinge , leader of Sweden 's Pirate party , a fringe pro - freedom of speech and anti - copyright party , said : "" In theory , if you wanted to strike back at WikiLeaks to discredit the organisation , this would be blueprint 1A , but I have not seen anything to indicate that this was politically motivated . ""
His organisation has been co - operating with WikiLeaks since August and has lent two of its 20 servers , which are located in a former nuclear bunker in Stockholm , to WikiLeaks , he said .
These came under attack on Monday , also bringing down his organisation 's computer network .
Meanwhile Swedish experts in rape legislation denied international suggestions that the country 's law was weighted against men .
Monica Burgman , professor in criminal law , said it was a myth . ""
Statistics show that Sweden has one of the worst prosecution rates on rape in Europe .
Only around 10 % of cases reported to the police go to trial ; 90 % are closed , "" she said .
Despite this , Sweden had the highest number of rapes reported to the police , per capita , in Europe .
One way of interpreting this disparity was to look at Sweden 's advanced sense of gender equality , she said .
"" Swedish women will not accept being sexually mistreated by men , and they will report these men to the police , even though they know very well that there is a risk that they will be badly treated by the criminal justice system , and that the possibility that the case will go to trial is very , very low , "" she said .
The poor quality of initial police investigation often meant prosecutors had insufficient information and evidence to go ahead with a prosecution , obliging them to abandon the case , she said .
Even though number of reports of rape made to the police have increased by 100 % over the past 15 years , the number going to trial had stayed the same , she said .
"" The proportion of cases going to trial has decreased a lot in the past 15 years , "" she said ."
2010-12-09,"The arrest of Julian Assange has escalated to a new pitch of intensity a controversy already beyond precedent .
The arrest of the WikiLeaks founder over sexual offences allegedly committed in Sweden this summer was already fiercely contested .
But in the 48 hours since he was remanded in custody in London pending extradition proceedings , those denouncing his prosecution as malicious and politically motivated have grown angrier and ever more profuse .
An unlikely coalition has formed around Assange and , whether explicitly or implicitly , against his two accusers .
The veteran journalist John Pilger , who – along with filmmaker Ken Loach and charity fundraiser Jemima Khan – offered bail sureties to the court , dismissed the charges as a "" political stunt "" .
The author and activist Naomi Wolf condemned the women for "" using feminist - inspired rhetoric and law to assuage what appear to be personal injured feelings "" .
Human rights champion Bianca Jagger tweeted about one of the complainant 's supposed links with the CIA .
In a letter to the Guardian , the British campaigning organisation Women Against Rape queried "" the unusual zeal with which Julian Assange is being pursued "" .
These models of leftwing and liberal opinion find themselves , intentionally or otherwise , shoulder to shoulder with a motley assemblage of conspiracy theorists and internet attack dogs that has been mauling the characters of Assange 's accusers since their complaints were first lodged in August .
Barely established online niceties regarding the discussion of sexual assault cases were overturned : the women 's personal photographs , CVs and blogposts have been dredged for evidence of sexual deviance , mental instability and vengeful intent .
Claes Borgström , the women 's lawyer , told the Guardian yesterday that his clients were "" the victims of a crime , but they are looked upon as the perpetrators "" .
In circumstances as volatile and globally significant as this , it is practically impossible not to see these charges in conjuction with the broader political accusations levelled at Assange and his website .
The alacrity with which the British justice system has pursued this warrant when it is so notoriously slow to respond to similar complaints made by its own citizens does n't deserve to pass without comment and , as Women Against Rape noted in their letter , there is an ignoble tradition dating back to the racist lynch mobs of the American Deep South of using sex crime allegations to furnish political agendas that have nothing to do with women 's safety .
But Assange 's status as embattled warrior for free speech is taken as giving permission – by those on the left as well as right – to indulge in the basest slut - shaming and misogyny .
It 's terrifying to witness how swiftly rape orthodoxies reassert themselves : that impugning a man 's sexual propriety is a political act , that sexual assault complainants are prone to a level of mendacity others are not ( and , in this case , deserving of the same crowd - sourced scrutiny afforded leaked diplomatic cables ) , that not all forms of non - consensual sex count as "" rape - rape "" .
The latter phrasing comes courtesy of Whoopi Goldberg , who coined the term last autumn in a defence of film director Roman Polanski , then facing extradition to the US after his arrest in Switzerland over a 32-year - old statutory rape charge .
It feeds the narrative that consent is so difficult to prove in cases where the victim knew her attacker , or was drugged or drunk , and the violation so much lesser , that the only crimes worth prosecuting involve violent strangers in dark alleys .
It also underlies the assumption that a man 's good behaviour in public life somehow neutralises bad behaviour in private , thus recasting the domestic assaults of footballers like George Best and Paul Gascoigne as indecorous , rather than violently criminal .
By this measure , rape allegations against a maverick internet provocateur are diminished in the context of his crusade for truth instead of , albeit unpalatably , being capable of existing alongside it .
In defence of Assange , the Wikiblokesphere has fixed on the details of the cases available in the public domain , in particular consent to intercourse only with a condom , as proof of a spurious "" non - rape - rape "" charge .
In fact what is significant about the Swedish system is not that it employs a broader definition of rape than in other countries –
it does n't –
but that prosecutions are based not on consent but whether a complainant 's "" sexual integrity "" has been violated .
In addition , alleged victims can instruct their own lawyers , who often seek second opinions after an initial dismissal , which may offer a rather more pedestrian explanation for why the cases have been re - opened now .
The speed with which this latest episode in the WikiLeaks saga has been reduced to weary tropes about honeytraps , castrating feminists and undeserving victims is depressing .
In an apparent plea to haul the debate back from the soup of smear and counter - smear , Naomi Klein argued that "" defending WikiLeaks is not the same as defending rape "" .
But the fact that the defence of Assange has spawned such naked and vitriolic misogyny should be of concern to all women and men who find it as distasteful and counter to the pursuit of truth as the attacks on WikiLeaks itself ."
2010-12-09,"The outcry against Julian Assange , the founder of WikiLeaks , is intensifying in the US , drawing a rare degree of consensus from politicians and pundits who have collectively cast him in the role of a common enemy .
In the past few days the calls for action against Assange have grown steadily louder and more shrill , with leading Republicans labelling him a terrorist , and top liberal Democratic politicians , albeit in more moderate language , also calling for his prosecution .
The highly unusual bipartisan hounding of Assange has led some free speech campaigning groups to warn of a "" chilling effect , "" in which the threats of legal action are already having an impact on the open spirit of the internet .
The most extreme attacks have come from prominent Republicans including Sarah Palin , who has likened Assange to an al - Qaida operative ; Mitch McConnell , the Republican leader in the Senate , who called him a "" hi - tech terrorist "" ; and Newt Gingrich , who called him an information terrorist and said he should be arrested as an "" enemy combatant "" .
Assange was also attacked by leading Democrats such as Dianne Feinstein , who said he should be charged under the US espionage act , and John Kerry , who has called for the law to be changed to allow a prosecution of the WikiLeaks website .
Gabriel Schoenfeld , a senior fellow at the Hudson Institute in Washington and author of Necessary Secrets , said the cross - party baying put the Obama administration in a difficult place .
"" There is a huge amount of pressure on them to do something about WikiLeaks . ""
This week Joe Lieberman , the independent senator who has long been an opponent of WikiLeaks , widened the net when he accused the New York Times of an "" act of bad citizenship "" by publishing versions of the US embassy cables and called on the justice department to hold a "" very intensive inquiry "" into whether the paper had committed a crime .
Schoenfeld and other experts on the US first amendment think it highly unlikely that a prosecution will be brought against the New York Times –
no news outlet has ever been charged under the espionage act and the supreme court ruled out such an action against the same newspaper over the leak of the Pentagon Papers in 1971 .
The Times is keeping its head down for the moment , saying only that "" We believe that our decision to publish was responsible journalism , legal , and important to a democratic society "" .
It has also published a long explanation of why it went ahead with the embassy leaks .
So far key Obama administration figures have adopted a more temperate tone than much of the swirling debate around them .
Robert Gates , the defence secretary , has called the embassy cables "" moderate "" in their seriousness and said arguments that they had damaged national security were "" fairly significantly overwrought "" .
The secretary of state , Hillary Clinton , has played a double game , threatening to take "" aggressive steps "" against disseminators of the cables while emphasising the positive worth of an open internet .
Eric Holder , the US attorney general , who will have the final decision on whether to prosecute , has said he will do everything he can to hold WikiLeaks accountable , but has not specified what that would mean .
"" Whether or not new laws are passed to further curb freedom of speech , there is already a chilling effect , "" said Steve Rendall of the media watchdog Fair .
There is already evidence that some people who were willing to donate to WikiLeaks in support of the site 's freedom of information work have now stopped doing so for fear of being arrested as terrorist funders .
Bloggers pointed out that if Feinstein 's desire to wield the espionage act against WikiLeaks were followed through , it would have a powerful deadening effect on mainstream media outlets ' efforts to report on national security matters .
However , some at the coal face of internet publishing say that they are unfazed by the current furore .
John Young , whose website cryptome.org has published about 60,000 classified and non - classified documents over the past 14 years , believes the storm will pass .
"" This is just typical arm - waving and yelling .
If anything , this will just further wind people up to oppose authority and send in more documents . """

The US justice department is reportedly looking at laws other than the Espionage Act to pursue wikileaks founder Julian Assange ."
2010-12-10,"Lawyers acting for Julian Assange , the editor - in - chief of WikiLeaks , said today they are preparing for a possible indictment by the US authorities .
Jennifer Robinson said her team had heard from "" several different US lawyers rumours that an indictment was on its way or had happened already , but we do n't know "" .
According to some reports , Washington is seeking to prosecute Assange under the 1917 act , which was used unsuccessfully to try to gag the New York Times when it published the Pentagon Papers in the 1970s .
However , despite escalating rhetoric over the last fortnight , no charges have yet been lodged , and government sources say they are unaware any such move is being prepared .
Robinson said Assange 's team did not believe the US had grounds to prosecute him but understood that Washington was "" looking closely at other charges , such as computer charges , so we have one eye on it "" .
Assange is in Wandsworth prison in south London after being refused bail on Tuesday .
Sweden is seeking his extradition over allegations of sexual assault .
Speaking to ABC News , Robinson said she did not believe the Espionage Act applied to Assange , adding : "" In any event he 's entitled to first amendment protection as publisher of WikiLeaks and any prosecution under the Espionage Act would in my view be unconstitutional and puts at risk all media organisations in the US . ""
Robinson said Assange was being held in solitary confinement in London with restricted access to a phone and his lawyers .
"" This means he is under significant surveillance but also means he has more restrictive conditions than other prisoners .
Considering the circumstances he was incredibly positive and upbeat . ""
Earlier this week , the US attorney general , Eric Holder , said the United States had been put at risk by the flood of confidential diplomatic documents released by WikiLeaks and he authorised a criminal investigation .
Holder said : "" The lives of people who work for the American people has been put at risk ; the American people themselves have been put at risk by these actions that are , I believe , arrogant , misguided and ultimately not helpful in any way .
We are doing everything that we can .
"" We have a very serious , active , ongoing investigation that is criminal in nature .
I authorised just last week a number of things to be done so that we can hopefully get to the bottom of this and hold people accountable , as they should be . ""
In a letter to the Guardian today , prominent supporters including John Pilger , Terry Jones , Miriam Margolyes and AL Kennedy called for Assange 's release .
"" We protest at the attacks on WikiLeaks and , in particular , on Julian Assange , "" they wrote , adding that the leaks have "" assisted democracy in revealing the real views of our governments over a range of issues "" ."
2010-12-10,"It was the week WikiLeaks boiled over .
The revelations kept coming : Oil company Shell embedded employees in every ministry of the Nigerian government ; Burma 's military junta considered a $ 1bn bid for Manchester United ; Nato drew up secret military plans to repel a Russian attack on the Baltic states .
But there was no avoiding the sound of a prison door slamming shut on Julian Assange as America and its allies turned their embarrassment into a many - fronted attack on the Australian 's whistleblowing website .
Assange , lionised as "" the Ned Kelly of the digital age "" by the press in his home country for his burgeoning folk hero reputation as an icon of resistance , was finally arrested in London and this weekend remains in Wandsworth prison on remand relating to rape charges in Sweden .
The howls of protest that the move was a politically motivated acquiescence to American pressure were matched by satisfaction in the US hierarchy that the man Senator Joe Lieberman accused of perpetrating the "" most serious violation of the Espionage Act in our history "" was finally behind bars , albeit on unrelated charges .
"" Sounds like good news to me , "" said a smiling Robert Gates , the US defence secretary , standing in front of a row of tanks .
PayPal suspended the WikiLeaks donations account under pressure from the state department , MasterCard and Visa refused to process transactions and a Swiss bank froze Assange 's fighting fund .
In tit - for - tat reprisals , WikiLeaks supporters co - ordinated cyber attacks against companies who took sanctions .
War had broken out on the internet , where the leaks began 13 days ago .
Assange 's British lawyers Mark Stephens and Jennifer Robinson even complained their homes were under surveillence by the security services , with Robinson saying there were "" people sitting outside my house in the same cars with newspapers "" .
The focus of the story had swung round so much to the backlash against WikiLeaks that Russia , only days earlier accused of being "" a virtual mafia state "" in the cables , appeared to be so much enjoying America 's discomfort that a source in President Medvedev 's office called for Assange to be considered for the Nobel peace prize .
On the streets of the Pakistani city of Multan , demonstrators burned US flags in front of banners declaring "" Arrest of Julian Assange is a big slap on the face of UK champion of democracy . ""
Revelations that Pakistan was considered so unstable that American and British diplomats feared its nuclear material would fall into the hands of terrorists were brushed aside , as were admissions by Pakistan 's army 's top brass that hundreds of millions of dollars in US military aid had been diverted into the Islamabad coffers . ""
Do n't trust WikiLeaks , "" declared the Pakistani prime minister Yousuf Raza Gilani , after revelations that he supported CIA drone strikes .
But still the disclosures kept coming from the apparently fathomless database of more than 250,000 classified cables .

2010-12-10,"We protest at the attacks on WikiLeaks and , in particular , on Julian Assange ( Report , 9 December )
The leaks have assisted democracy in revealing the real views of our governments over a range of issues which have been kept secret and are now irreversibly in the public domain .
All we knew about the mass killing , torture and corruption in Iraq and Afghanistan has been confirmed .
The world 's leaders can no longer hide the truth by simply lying to the public .
The lies have been exposed .
The actions of major corporations such as Amazon , the Swiss banks and the credit card companies in hindering WikiLeaks are shameful , bowing to US government pressure .
The US government and its allies , and their friends in the media , have built up a campaign against Assange which now sees him in prison facing extradition on dubious charges , with the presumed eventual aim of ensuring his extradition to the US .
We demand his immediate release , the dropping of all charges , and an end to the censorship of WikiLeaks .

2010-12-10,"The reader response has been huge .
Millions of page views .
It 's divided between those focused on the phenomenon ( WikiLeaks , our decision to report secret cables , the pursuit of Julian Assange ) and those interested in the contents of the documents .
The first camp outnumbers the second , and it is in turn divided between those who are nervous or indignant about the impact of the disclosures on America 's ability to conduct foreign policy in a frightening time , and those who welcome the blaze of sunlight .
The official reaction , with a few exceptions in Congress , has been remarkably unhysterical – calm and professional .
The Obama administration is furious at WikiLeaks and pained by the breach of secrecy , but the people at the White House , state and defence have resisted the temptation to indulge in an orgy of press - bashing ; they have engaged us in an effort to minimise the damage by excising information that could get people killed ; and they have not exaggerated the impact .
The defence secretary called the fears for diplomacy "" overwrought "" , noting that other countries deal with the US not because they necessarily love us , or because they trust us to keep secrets , but because "" they need us "" ."
2010-12-11,"Protests will be held around the world today against the detention of Julian Assange , the founder of WikiLeaks .
Demonstrations are planned in the capitals of Spain , the Netherlands , Colombia , Argentina , Mexico and Peru to demand Assange 's release , the re - establishment of the WikiLeaks domain name and the restoration of Visa and Mastercard credit services to allow supporters to donate money to the whistleblowing site .
A statement on the Spanish - language website Free WikiLeaks said : "" We seek the liberation of Julian Assange in United Kingdom territory . ""
The website called on protesters to gather at 6 pm ( 17.00 GMT ) in Madrid , Barcelona , Valencia and Seville and three other Spanish cities .
It also calls for "" the re - establishment of the WikiLeaks ( wikileaks.org ) internet domain , "" and the restoration of Visa and MasterCard credit card services to enable the "" freedom to move money "" because no one has "" proved Assange 's guilt "" , nor charged WikiLeaks with any crime .
Assange is in Wandsworth prison in south London after being refused bail on Tuesday .
Sweden is seeking his extradition over allegations of sexual assault .
His lawyers said yesterday they were preparing for a possible indictment by the US authorities .
Jennifer Robinson said her team had heard from "" several different US lawyers rumours that an indictment was on its way or had happened already , but we do n't know "" .
According to some reports , Washington is seeking to prosecute Assange under the 1917 act , which was used unsuccessfully to try to gag the New York Times when it published the Pentagon Papers in the 1970s .
However , despite escalating rhetoric over the past fortnight , no charges have yet been lodged , and government sources say they are unaware any such move is being prepared .
Robinson said Assange 's team did not believe the US had grounds to prosecute him but understood that Washington was "" looking closely at other charges , such as computer charges , so we have one eye on it "" .
Earlier this week , the US attorney general , Eric Holder , said the US had been put at risk by the flood of confidential diplomatic documents released by WikiLeaks and he authorised a criminal investigation ."
2010-12-12,"Why did I offer to provide surety for an alleged rapist , a man I have never met ?
That 's the question even my mother asked me after I appeared in court for Julian Assange .
That morning I had sent a spur - of - the - moment message of support by email to Assange 's lawyer , Mark Stephens , when I read of his arrest .
He immediately responded and asked if I would be prepared to come to court in the next hour to act as a surety for Assange .
I was nervous about the inevitable media circus , but felt that it was the right thing to do after being convinced by Stephens that it could help .
Assange has not even been charged , let alone convicted .
Swedish prosecutors do not have to produce any evidence that he committed the alleged sexual offences to justify the warrant .
On the basis of the allegations that I heard read out in court , the evidence seems feeble , but I concede that I do n't know the full facts .
Neither does Assange .
Stockholm 's chief prosecutor , Eva Finne , who heard the evidence against Assange in August , threw the case out of court , saying : "" I do n't think there is reason to suspect that he has committed rape . ""
That is not the reason I was there .
I was there because I believe that this is about censorship and intimidation .
The timing of these rehashed allegations is highly suspicious , coinciding with the recent WikiLeaks revelations and reinvigorated by a rightwing Swedish politician .
There are credible rumours that this is a holding charge while an indictment is being sought in secret for his arrest and extradition to the US .
An accusation of rape is the ultimate gag .
Until proved otherwise , Assange has done nothing illegal , yet he is behind bars .
There is a fundamental injustice here .
There are calls for the punishment ( execution even ) of the man who has reported war crimes , but not for those that perpetrated or sanctioned them .
On the one hand , the US is proud of its First Amendment and its long - standing commitment to the freedom of speech .
It was announced last week that the US is to host next year 's Unesco World Press Freedom Day event , which champions in particular "" the free flow of information in this digital age "" .
On the other hand , it is examining ways to take legal action against Assange , who is in effect editor of the world 's first stateless ( non - profit ) media organisation .
It has blocked access to the WikiLeaks website and denied its citizens the ability to register protest through donations , all without a warrant .
It has also successfully pressured Amazon , Visa , Mastercard and PayPal to withdraw their services from WikiLeaks , as well as the Swiss bank PostFinance , to close Assange 's account .
WikiLeaks offers a new type of investigative journalism .
I have my doubts about whether some cables should have been leaked – for example , the list of infrastructure sites vital to national security – and I share the concern that diplomacy could suffer as a result of others .
But I feel passionately that democracy needs a strong and free media .
It is the only way to ensure governments are honest and remain accountable .
WikiLeaks has revealed that we have been told a great many lies about the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and that there has been little accountability .
How are the recent revelations regarding America 's secret war in Yemen not in the public interest ?
Do n't American citizens have the right to know that , contrary to official denials , they have paid for cruise missile attacks on Yemen , which have accidentally killed 200 civilians ?
I have a personal interest in the revelations about Pakistan , which highlight what many of us have long feared : that contrary to assurances from Pakistan 's leaders , the US is fully ensconced , with bases and special forces , that there have been unreported civilian deaths and that the unwinnable war in Afghanistan is spilling over the border into its weak , corrupt and nuclear neighbour .
The best justification governments can find to shut down information is that lives are at risk .
In fact , lives have been at risk as a result of the silences and lies revealed in these leaks .
Exposés have always been initiated by leaks .
As Assange himself has said : "" If journalism is good , it 's controversial . "" Without illicit information President Nixon would not have been forced to resign , we would never have known about the abuse of detainees by US personnel at Abu Ghraib , nor that US intelligence was phone - tapping and looking at emails without warrants .
Daniel Ellsberg has said that when he released the Pentagon papers during the Vietnam war he suffered similar attacks .
He was put on trial for theft and conspiracy and stolen medical files were used to discredit him .
Now he 's viewed as a journalistic hero .
If WikiLeaks is a terrorist organisation , as New York congressman Pete King stated , and if its founder , Julian Assange , is prosecuted for espionage , the future of investigative journalism everywhere is in jeopardy , as is our right as citizens to be told the truth ."
2010-12-13,"The WikiLeaks founder , Julian Assange , will try to win his release from prison tomorrow , a week after being held on remand after Sweden requested his arrest over allegations that he sexually assaulted two women .
Even if the judge at Westminster magistrates court in London grants Assange bail , he could still be held .
The Crown Prosecution Service , which will represent the Swedish authorities in the UK court , has the right to appeal against any bail decision .
Usually the suspect would be held in custody until an appeal hearing anyway .
Raj Joshi , a former head of the European and international division at the CPS , and an expert on extradition , said : "" If they feel they have grounds for opposing bail , they would be duty bound to appeal that .
He 'll be held pending the appeal , and until it is decided .
That hearing is usually held within 48 hours .
"" The chances of Assange going underground , given that his face was "" plastered all around the world "" , were low , he added .
"" With a number of conditions , such as , maybe , a tag , it would be difficult to see why bail would not be granted . ""
The decision on whether to oppose bail will be made by the Swedish authorities , with Britain 's CPS merely representing their interests at tomorrow 's hearing .
Speculation that the US could lodge an extradition request continued over the weekend , but it is regarded as highly unlikely that any such request would be lodged tomorrow .
Lady Kennedy , who has extensive experience in human rights , has joined Assange 's defence team .
His case has stirred fresh controversy about European arrest warrants , which the Swedish authorities would use for his extradition .
Lady Ludford MEP , the Liberal Democrat European justice and human rights spokeswoman , claimed the arrest warrant system , which she said she supported , was being used by Sweden to carry out a fishing expedition .
Sweden had yet to formally charge Assange with any offence .
In a letter to the Guardian , Ludford wrote that past cases showed that it was "" not a legitimate purpose for an EAW to be used to conduct an investigation to see whether that person should be prosecuted "" .
She added : "" Normal cross - border cooperation on collection of evidence or interrogation of suspects called ' mutual legal assistance ' , using for example video - conferencing or a summons for temporary transfer of a suspect , should be used when more appropriate .
"" I urge the UK courts to refuse to allow the Assange EAW to be a fishing expedition without a pending actual prosecution .
EU rules should be properly respected so that the integrity of the European arrest warrant process is protected .
"" Ahead of the case , lawyers today visited Assange in Wandsworth prison , south London , where the 39-year - old is being held in the segregation unit .
Assange 's mother Christine is understood to have flown from Queensland , Australia to London to attend his bail hearing afternoon .
It also emerged last night that the film - maker , Michael Moore , has offered to post security for the WikiLeaks founder .
Assange 's lawyer Mark Stephens visited him in Wandsworth prison yesterday afternoon and said his client was being held under harsher conditions than last week .
He claimed Assange was being confined to his cell for all but half an hour a day , and denied association with others prisoners , access to the library or TV . ""
He 's subject to the most ridiculous censorship , "" Stephens said .
"" Time magazine sent him a copy of the magazine with him on the cover and they censored it not just by ripping off the cover but by destroying the whole magazine .
"" Stephens also claimed a number of letters to Assange from media organisations have not reached him .
He said Assange was under 24-hour video surveillance and had complained that a tooth which broke off while he was eating had later been stolen from his cell .
Stephens said Assange 's UK legal team had still not seen the prosecution evidence against him . ""
His Swedish lawyers have some of the material but not all and it 's in Swedish
so we ca n't take proper instructions .
"" The decision by the district judge Howard Riddle to remand Assange into custody was made despite the film director Ken Loach , the journalist John Pilger , and the socialite Jemima Khan , offering sureties for him totalling Â£180,000 .
The judge had concluded that because of the "" serious "" nature of the allegations against Assange , his "" comparatively weak community ties "" in the UK , and the fact it was believed he had the financial means and the ability to abscond , there was a substantial risk he would fail to surrender to the courts .
The allegations about Assange were made by two women .
The first complainant , known as Miss A , said she was the victim of "" unlawful coercion "" on the night of 14 August in 2009 in Stockholm .
The court heard Assange was alleged to have "" forcefully "" held her arms and used his body weight to hold her down .
The second charge alleged he had "" sexually molested "" her by having sex without using a condom .
A third charge claimed Assange "" deliberately molested "" Miss A on 18 August .
A fourth charge , relating to a woman called Miss W , alleges that on 17 August , Assange "" improperly exploited "" a situation where she was asleep , to have sex with her without using a condom .
A poll by Comres for CNN revealed today that 44 % of Britons believe the charges against Assange are an excuse to place him in custody so the US can prosecute him over the US embassy cable leaks .
But the same number say he should be sent to Sweden for questioning .
Meanwhile a dating site profile from 2007 , supposedly created by Assange , had prompted by yesterday some lively online debate .
The profile on the OKCupid site featured pictures of Assange , though gave the name Harry Harrison â€ “ who described himself as a "" passionate and often pig- headed activist intellectual "" who sought to change the world .
He concluded : "" Write to me if you are brave . """

It is the responsibility of the courts to award costs against a particular party , in a particular situation .
If retailers do not want to rely on the police to bring a case , they should bring a private prosecution , and therefore establish before a court , beyond reasonable doubt , that the individual concerned committed the act in question .
At that point , the judge could then make a decisions as to whether to award costs .

2010-12-14,"A posed photograph makes for an easy manifesto .
The sight of Julian Assange wearing a leather coat and an expression that would n't look out of place in a spy thriller may have summed up , for many people , what they think of him â€ “ someone who is dedicated to uncovering the evil that people do , who has a clear and unwavering moral code , and who has worked out all the answers .
Not exactly , say those who know and have worked with Assange . ""
His philosophy keeps evolving , "" one person who has met him a number of times says .
"" I do n't think he 's quite sure himself . ""
Another says there is something of the "" naive libertarian "" in Assange 's approach . ""
He makes that connection between government and conspiracy .
He really does think that WikiLeaks is going to change the world
â€
¦ he constantly expects that it will achieve change through telling the truth . ""
But to others , Assange is just a zealot with a messiah complex .
"" You behave like some kind of emperor or slave trader , "" Daniel Domscheit - Berg , a former WikiLeaks spokesman , said in an online chat this summer .
Assange â€ “ who had been using the conversation to try to find the source of leaks from inside the organisation â€ “ suspended him on the spot , and Domscheit - Berg left the group in September .
WikiLeaks is a loose online organisation whose members work on computers all over the world , using Skype and encrypted online chatrooms to work out what they 'll do next and co - ordinate their protection from angry authorities of all stripes .
And Assange , nominally its leader , will pitch into the software development of the server architecture or security .
But what does he want it to achieve ?
Search the web
and you 'll quickly find a manifesto he published in December 2006 , the month WikiLeaks began distributing documents , starting with the leak of a Somali sheikh 's order to assassinate government officials .
Western media did n't notice , but it was a statement of intent
â€ “
this was a site that would root out the truth .
"" Every time we witness an act that we feel to be unjust and do not act we become a party to injustice , "" the manifesto said .
"" Those who are repeatedly passive in the face of injustice soon find their character corroded into servility .
Most witnessed acts of injustice are associated with bad governance , since when governance is good , unanswered injustice is rare . ""
Modern communications states , through their scale , homogeneity and excesses , provide their populace with an unprecedented deluge of witnessed , but seemingly unanswerable injustices .
"" Read on , and it gets hazier , filled with looping rhetoric , "" collaborative secrecy , working to the detriment of a population , is enough to define their behaviour as conspiratorial "" , it asserts , before asking : "" What does a conspiracy compute ? "" .
But its clear message is that governments with secrets should be seen as conspiracies , in themselves , against populations
â€ “ if you remove the ability of conspiracies to exist then you can get rid of governments ' ability to oppress people .
In many ways it sounds like an idealistic computer hacker 's manifesto â€ “ "" information wants to be free "" .
That 's not surprising , because Assange was one from his teens .
Born in July 1971 , he led a peripatetic life ( his mother , who campaigned on a number of causes , was in a touring theatre group ) and , in the 1980s , went by the "" handle "" â€ “
a hacker 's online monicker â€ “ of Mendax .
In a co - authored ebook about the Australian hacker underground , he describes faking office noises on a tape and pretending to be much older than his 16 years to get passwords out of people , a process hackers call "" social engineering "" .
He graduated to hacking into US military systems , where he found documents suggesting that US military hackers had targeted their own systems to see how weak they really were .
If they could do that , what about targeting other countries ?
The idea horrified him .
The police raided him in 1992 , and in 1995 and 1996 he pleaded guilty to a total of 19 hacking charges and was released on bond .
Perhaps significantly , during the case one of his two fellow hackers â€ “ the Internet Subversives
â€ “ turned crown witness against him .
A lengthy battle with his former wife over custody of their child prompted an early desire for civic transparency by getting access to otherwise secret Australian legal records about custody .
Other reports suggested he and two others had formed a civil rights organisation to "" fight corruption and lack of accountability "" in the Victorian state government in the 1990s .
It 's fairly easy to join the dots to the modern day .
Assange registered a domain called leaks.org in 1997 but said he "" did n't do anything with it "" and co - developed a piece of cryptographic software called Rubberhose , which would to hide multiple sets of data on a single piece of storage such as a thumb drive .
Its intended users were human rights workers who could credibly deny that the other data existed , even under torture .
As Assange noted drily : "" It 's nicer , particularly given the frequency of equatorial despotism , to be tortured in the computer room . ""
( Why "" nicer "" ?
Because there would be air conditioning . )
Then there was a spell of programming , some time at university in Australia , and then WikiLeaks .
Reading his self - penned history , you glimpse the hacker 's willingness to spend hours trying to break into systems , and also get used to the hacker 's thrill of getting "" root "" â€ “ top - level access so you can see and change anything you want â€ “ on remote computers .
In a sense , WikiLeaks is trying to "" root "" governments .
But the hacker 's pleasure is lonely : sharing the knowledge of your achievement is dangerous , because it will attract the police .
In its early days WikiLeaks was faceless even as it shared the pleasure of its finds , but Assange has said he realised it needed a public face .
And , once more , he finds himself being pursued .
The erosion of trust he suffered through his co - hacker in the 1990s may explain what seems like paranoid behaviour today
â€ “ constantly changing phone , insisting that people travel to secret locations , always attempting to throw off any pursuit .
Even when arrested by the police , he refused to give a photo , DNA or fingerprints . ""
A rebel always , "" said Heather Brooke , the campaigning journalist , who covered his hearing .
But then , he has made powerful enemies .
His laptop bag with three ( encrypted ) computers went missing on one flight .
He is convinced it was done intentionally . ""
Hackers , in general , treat people rather like machines
â€ “
they just want to test their boundaries , "" says one person who knows him .
Assange 's new - found notoriety has presented new and dangerous challenges there .
The notion of radical transparency â€ “ turning governments inside out â€ “ is a popular meme among hackers .
Often , it 's government machines that they break into ( because they 're less well protected than commercial ones , and have more interesting stuff than home ones ) .
WikiLeaks is an extension of that idea , with added ethics : not all of the fruits of hackers ' work necessarily appear on the site , so that it performs both collection and filtering .
It is starting to catch on .
The US , UK and Canadian governments have raced to embrace the idea of open and free data , though their commitment noticeably stops short where the release of names is involved .
Accountability stops at the front door of the respective ministries , and does n't tunnel into the individual offices .
WikiLeaks , and a new generation of "" leaks "" sites , want to go further .
"" It 's like the Guardian 's open data or freedom of information campaigns turned up to 11 , "" another person who knows Assange says .
The next to join Assange in tunnelling into government may , strangely , be Domscheit - Berg : on Friday , he announced the creation of OpenLeaks , which he says will act only as the receptacle for leaked documents â€ “ the leaker will be able to designate which media organisations can publish the details .
"" We wo n't publish any documents ourselves .
The whole field is diversified , "" he told Forbes . ""
No single organisation carries all of the responsibility or all of the workload .
"" If the designated organisation does n't want it , the leak will just go out .
It does n't sound quite as safe as WikiLeaks , where editors have removed details that might identify people at risk from war logs and diplomatic cables .
That is because Assange 's creation is such a different beast from what has gone before .
"" It 's the first news organisation that relies on brown paper envelopes turning up in the post , "" says a person who has worked with the team .
"" And then they run with it . """
2010-12-14,"The crippling web attacks on multinational companies threaten to escalate after WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange urged supporters to protect the whisteblowers ' site from "" instruments of US foreign policy "" .
Whitehall is preparing for an online backlash from the Anonymous cyber activists that brought down sites belonging to Visa , Mastercard and PayPal last week in response to the companies cutting ties with WikiLeaks .
Downing Street said sites that deal with tax returns or benefits for millions of Britons are on red alert for a possible cyber attack .
Speaking though a written statement from his Wandsworth prison cell , Assange last night said he was "" calling for the world to protect my work and my people "" from renewed pressure to restrict the site from publishing more leaked documents .
A number of companies hosting WikiLeaks ' online operations , including Amazon and PayPal , have terminated their relationship with the whistleblowers ' site after pressure from Joe Lieberman , chair of the US homeland security committee .
Assange is today appearing at Westminster magistrates court to appeal against the decision to refuse him bail , pending extradition to Sweden over allegations of sexual assault .
He said last night that his convictions were "" unfaltering "" despite the extradition attempt , according to a written statement sent to Australian broadcaster the Seven Network by his mother , Christine Assange .
"" We now know that Visa , Mastercard , PayPal and others are instruments of US foreign policy .
It 's not something we knew before , "" Assange said in a statement likely to add new impetus to the spate of cyber attacks being perpetrated by Anonymous in support of WikiLeaks .
In a separate development , an attack which exposed the email addresses and passwords of 1.3 million Gawker users was also today linked with the thousand - strong Anonymous group .
A subgroup of the amorphous "" hacktivists "" is preparing to hack and deface US government websites with pro - WikiLeaks propaganda , according to a Sky News journalist .
Anonymous has previously made explicit its ambition to bring down the websites belonging to the US Senate and Swedish government .
The website of the Royal Bank of Scotland was today experiencing problems loading after leaked US diplomatic documents showed that the bank 's new chairman , Sir Philip Hampton , had said its former directors had failed to live up to their duties .
However , RBS said it was not coming under the attacks that have brought down other financial institutions ' websites in recent days .
"" We are aware of an issue affecting some online banking customers and we are working to resolve this as soon as possible , "" RBS said in a statement .
"" We apologise to affected customers for any inconvenience this has caused . """

Dressed in a white shirt and blue suit , he watched the proceedings impassively .

For much of the past five months , until his arrest last week , Assange has been living at Smith 's Frontline Club in Paddington , west London .
Standing to address district judge Howard Riddle , Geoffrey Robertson QC announced that "" Captain Smith "" was now ready to put Assange up at his rambling country home in Norfolk , Ellingham Hall , which sits near the town of Bungay in Suffolk â€
“ that is , should he be granted bail .
The WikiLeaks saga has so far been short of jokes .
But Robertson had one ready - made .
It would not be so much "" house arrest as manor arrest "" , he quipped .
Not only that , but it was inconceivable Assange would attempt to escape "" since darkness descends rather early in that part of Britain "" .
Additionally , Assange was willing to give up his Australian passport and wear an electronic tag .
Finally , he was n't likely to get very far given that "" media exposure "" had made him "" well - known around the world "" , Robertson said with understatement .
Last week Assange was refused bail after he unwisely gave an Australian postal address as his place of residence .
This time his legal team would allow no such mistake .
Robertson , Assange 's new barrister , asked Smith to give his own assessment of WikiLeaks ' controversial founder , in the light of Sweden 's attempts to have him extradited on sex allegations . ""
He is a very honourable person , hugely clever , self - deprecatory and warm .
Not the kind of things you read about , "" Smith said loyally .
But the clincher came when Robertson asked Smith to explain what precisely Assange 's new rustic home would look like .
After establishing that Smith was a former Guards officer and one - time captain of the British army 's shooting team , the QC asked for details of Smith 's family home and organic farm .
"" It has 10 bedrooms and 600 acres , "" Smith replied .
Better still , there was even a police station .
"" It 's a short distance on a bicycle .
I can cycle it in about 15 minutes , "" Smith explained .
"" It 's about a mile .
Perhaps a little bit more . ""
Smith added helpfully : "" It 's an environment where he would be surrounded .
We have members of staff .
My parents live in proximity as well .
My father was a Queen 's Messenger and a colonel in the Grenadier Guards .
"" On the second floor of the court several celebrity supporters had gathered outside next to the coffee machine and green metal benches
â€ “ John Pilger , Jemima Khan , Ken Loach , Bianca Jagger , and others .
But it turned out they were n't really needed â€ “ though their money was .
Outside on the pavement , a polyglot scrum of journalists waited impatiently for news .
Judging from his appearance , Assange appeared to be surviving his ordeal in Wandsworth prison pretty well .
From inside a glass box for the defendant , he confirmed his identity and address .
He also gave a cheery thumbs - up to his team .
Robertson , however , made clear that Assange was having a miserable time of it .
His conditions inside Wandsworth were nothing short of living hell , he suggested .
"" He ca n't read any newspapers other than the Daily Express .
This is the kind of Victorian situation he finds himself in , "" Robertson lamented .
He went on : "" Time magazine sent him a magazine with his picture on the cover but all the person would allow him to have was the envelope ! ""
To no one 's great surprise , the judge announced that "" bail was going to be granted under certain conditions "" .
These turned out to be not overly onerous : an electronic tag , an afternoon and night curfew and a requirement to report to Bungay police station between 6 - 8pm every evening .
Oh , and Â£200,000 in cash .
Assange 's lawyers asked if it might be possible to hand cheques into the court instead ?
The magistrate was unimpressed , insisting in these financially troubled times it had to be money up front .
Outside , the tweeted news of Assange 's bail brought a loud cheer from the 150 or so people who had gathered opposite the court to cheer on their hero and share their banners and placards with the world .
One read : "" Sex crimes !
My arse ! ""
Another , "" That 's just what we need â€ “ another innocent man in jail "" , and a third : "" Sweden : muppets of the US . ""
Despite the indignant slogans , the judge 's verdict plainly delighted the protesters .
Three young activists were so thrilled , in fact , that they broke into an impromptu chorus of We Wish You a Merry Christmas .
Soon afterwards , however , there was confusion as news filtered through that the Swedish prosecutor was to appeal against the bail decision , meaning that Assange has to remain for the time being in jail .
But his lawyers appear confident he will be out in time for Christmas .
Pheasant dinners , port and brisk walks around the estate may be only a matter of days away .
Ellingham Hall
If he wins his next bail hearing in the high court , Julian Assange 's new home will be a historic rural estate on the borders of Norfolk and Suffolk .
For more than three centuries Ellingham Hall , a sprawling and elegant Georgian manor house near the town of Bungay , has belonged to the Smith family .
Its owner today is Vaughan Smith , a friend of Assange , and a strong supporter .
Smith has previously given the WikiLeaks founder a home at his Frontline club in Paddington , west London , which includes several flats .
Surrounded by 600 acres of woods and fields , the estate is the perfect retreat .
It has 10 bedrooms , a large dining room with a convivial circular table , and portraits of Smith 's ancestors hanging on the walls .
There is a housekeeper who cooks meals .
There is also a well - stocked cellar with wine and port â€ “ the decent Quinta Do Infantado .
The estate is usually home to Smith 's wife and their two children .
Speaking to the Guardian before today 's bail hearing , Smith made clear that Assange and his team will be expected to pay for food and accommodation .
Other paying guests have included games sports enthusiasts
â€ “ the hall boasts a pheasant shoot , with pheasants wandering freely over the grounds .
The local Norfolk hunt sometimes clatters through the gardens .
"" It 's a Georgian house from the 18th century .
It 's been in my family as Smith for the past 225 years , but before that it belonged to the Johnsons , whom the Smiths married into .
"" Some of the buildings are even older .
On the walls are paintings of the people who bred me , "" Smith said .
"" My grandfather liked shooting and I 'm partial to it myself . ""
The nearest train station is at Beccles .
It takes roughly half an hour by car from the hall into Norwich , the nearest city .
The location is likely to afford Assange some privacy , since it is impossible to reach the manor house without trespassing on Smith 's land .
According to friends , Assange shows little interest in food , and is invariably late for meals .
But Ellingham Hall is also home to a large ecologically conscious organic farm .
Smith looks after it himself together with two employees ; the organic produce is served at his restaurant at the Frontline Club .

This article was amended on 15 and 16 December 2010 :
The original referred to Bungay as a village , described the estate as exceptionally isolated , and said the nearest rail station was at Diss .
Ellingham Hall was also sited in Suffolk .
This has been corrected ."
2010-12-14,"Why is n't Julian Assange free ?
Although Westminster magistrates court overturned its decision of last week and granted Assange bail , he is still in custody after the Swedish government said it would appeal .
The appeal process could take 48 hours .
Sweden will have 48 hours to appeal , and is thought to be preparing to argue that releasing Assange on bail poses an unacceptable risk that he will abscond .
In the meantime , Assange will remain in custody in what his lawyer has described as "" Dickensian conditions "" .
Why did the court change its previous decision to deny Assange bail ?
Everyone in the UK is entitled to a "" presumption of bail "" , which means they have the right to remain at liberty unless or until they have been convicted by a court .
But prosecutors can deny that presumption if they show a defendant is at risk of absconding .
Assange 's lawyers and supporters were able to offer the judge sufficient conditions to overcome those fears .
If he is freed after the appeal , his supporters will have had to have provided a security of Â£200,000 â€ “ which would be forfeited if he absconds â€ “ and two sureties , each of Â£20,000 .
Assange 's passport has been confiscated and he would have to abide by a curfew and be subject to an electronic tag .
He would have to report to a police station every evening .
Are these bail conditions common ?
It is not uncommon for defendants who do not permanently reside in the UK to have to offer conditions to ensure they are allowed out on bail .
Curfews and tags are often required to grant bail in serious cases , but the amounts of money involved in Assange 's case are unusual .
The requirement that Assange 's supporters find Â£200,000 before he can be released is unusually onerous , indicating that the court perceives a high risk of flight .
So why has he been treated this way ?
Some critics say Assange 's lawyers should have been better prepared to anticipate the court 's concerns at the hearing last week .
Although his legal team were visibly shocked that Assange was remanded into custody last week , experienced criminal lawyers said that possibility should have been foreseen .
Many lawyers have raised eyebrows that Assange is being represented by Mark Stephens and Geoffrey Robertson , whose expertise is in media law and human rights , rather than the specific proceedings surrounding extradition and European arrest warrants .
What happens next ?
Assange will be back in court for Sweden 's appeal within 48 hours .
A further hearing is scheduled for 11 January , when the detail of Sweden 's extradition request will be heard .
The full hearing is likely to include detailed arguments that the warrant issued by Sweden is invalid .
Although there has been speculation that the extradition request is politically motivated , and could facilitate Assange 's onward extradition to the US on charges of espionage , the next hearing will focus on the European arrest warrant and the issues raised by Sweden 's allegations of rape .
â€¢ There has been a complaint from Geoffrey Robertson about the above article .
This has now been resolved ."
2010-12-14,"The WikiLeaks founder , Julian Assange , is to remain in jail after the Swedish authorities decided to challenge a decision by a British court to grant him bail on allegations of rape in Stockholm .
A judge in London granted Assange Â£240,000 bail with strict conditions , including a curfew and the surrendering of his passport .
But when counsel for the prosecution indicated it would appeal , the judge told Assange he would remain in jail until a hearing at a higher court within 48 hours .
Assange 's lawyer , Geoffrey Robertson , had asked the City of Westminster magistrates court in London for bail on five conditions : Â£200,000 in security , surety of Â£40,000 from two people , a curfew , daily reporting to police , and surrender of his passport .
The judge agreed , to much rejoicing among Assange 's supporters .
But elation turned to anger as lawyers representing Sweden challenged the decision .
Speaking outside the court , Mark Stephens , one of Assange 's lawyers , said : "" The prosecution is doing no more than taking instructions from Sweden .
"" They are continuing to persecute Mr Assange ...
An innocent man is in custody . ""
The decision followed two hours of confusion as Stephens first said he understood that the prosecution would decline to challenge the court 's decision .
Sweden 's decision means that the next legal arguments will be heard at the court of appeal .
No time has yet been fixed .
Assange entered Westminster court one at 2.12pm looking paler than at a previous hearing last week , and wearing a dark jacket and open - necked white shirt .
With so much press interest , people were given permission to stand ; in a break with tradition , journalists were allowed to tweet the proceedings .
Amid chaotic scenes , Robertson , who cut short a holiday in Australia to be in court , had to bang on the door to get in .
Some of Assange 's celebrity supporters attended the hearing , including socialite Jemima Khan , Bianca Jagger and Fatima Bhutto , niece of the assassinated Benazir Bhutto of Pakistan .
Outside , one protester held up a placard that read "" Sex crimes , my arse ! ""
But media outnumbered the protesters , who were about 30 strong .
Arguing that Assange should be granted bail , Robertson challenged the legal basis on which the WikiLeaks founder had been arrested .
He said : "" We doubt whether this actual category of rape would be rape under English law , "" he told the court .
Appearing for the Swedish authorities , Gemma Lindfield argued that Assange should be declined bail as the charges were serious and there was a real possibility he would leave the country .
"" This is not a case about WikiLeaks , rather a case about alleged serious offences against two women , "" she said .
She said the allegations were serious and Assange had only weak ties to Britain and "" the means and ability to abscond "" .
The judge rejected her arguments and agreed that Assange would stay at Ellingham Hall in Suffolk , an estate owned by Vaughan Smith , founder of the Frontline club in London , who is one of the people offering security .
Assange will have to report daily to a nearby police station at Bungay .
The initial decision was greeted by cheers outside the courtroom , and Assange 's supporters welcomed the move .
"" I 'm very pleased that he is out , "" said the writer and political activist Tariq Ali .
"" I think the extradition charges should now be dealt with in the same way .
His barrister made the same point , that this is not rape under English law and there is absolutely no reason for extradition .
We are delighted he is out and he should never have been locked up in the first place . ""
Even if the Swedish challenge fails , it could be a week before Assange is released .
Mark Stephens , another of Assange 's lawyers , said it would take some time to raise the bail money .
Accusing the Swedish authorities of mounting a "" persecution not a prosecution "" , Stephens said Assange would have to stay behind bars until the Â£200,000 is raised in cash and delivered to the court , as it did not accept cheques .
Speaking to reporters after the court hearings , Stephens said : "" There is enormous relief tinged with enormous sadness .
Assange will spend another night in solitary confinement .
It 's a pretty unpleasant situation he 's going through . ""
Before the hearing , Assange remained defiant , telling his mother , Christine , from his cell he was committed to publishing more secret US cables .
"" My convictions are unfaltering .
I remain true to the ideals I have expressed .
This circumstance shall not shake them , "" Assange said , according to a written statement of his comments supplied to Australia 's Network Seven by his mother .
"" We now know that Visa , Mastercard , PayPal and others are instruments of US foreign policy .
I am calling for the world to protect my work and my people from these illegal and immoral attacks , "" he said in the statement .
The 39-year - old Australian turned himself in to Scotland Yard detectives last week after being accused of sexually assaulting two women in Sweden .
Sweden has yet to formally charge Assange with any offence .
Assange has vowed to fight attempts to extradite him .
He was denied bail by district judge Howard Riddle at City of Westminster magistrates court last Tuesday , on the grounds that there was a risk he would fail to surrender .
The decision to remand him in custody came despite the film director Ken Loach , the journalist John Pilger , Khan and other suporters offering sureties for him totalling Â£180,000 .
His legal team has claimed Swedish prosecutors were put under political pressure to restart their inquiry to help silence and discredit Assange , whose website has provoked US anger by publishing some of a cache of 250,000 classified US diplomatic papers .
Stephens , visited him in Wandsworth prison yesterday afternoon , and said his client was being held under harsher conditions than last week .
He claimed Assange was being confined to his cell for all but half an hour a day , and denied association with others prisoners , access to the library or TV .
Stephens also claimed a number of letters to Assange from media organisations had not reached the WikiLeaks founder .
He said Assange was under 24-hour video surveillance and had complained that a tooth that broke off while he was eating had later been stolen from his cell ."

2010-12-14,"David Cameron 's national security adviser has put Whitehall on alert for the possibility of a cyber - attack on government websites after WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange makes a court appearance today .
Sir Peter Ricketts has spoken to permanent secretaries about the security of government websites amid fears that the government may be targeted by supporters of Assange , who will try to win his release today after being held on remand after Sweden requested his arrest over allegations that he sexually assaulted two women .
A Downing Street spokesman said yesterday that the security priority would be "" websites where we are dealing with information that belongs to members of the public "" , amid fears that supporters could target sites such as Revenue and Customs or the Department of Work and Pensions , which hold the personal details of millions of people .
Last week , the Swedish government 's website was forced offline as was the office of the Swedish prosecutor .
The Times reported today that supporters of Assange have threatened to turn their sights on the UK government if the WikiLeaks founder is extradited to Sweden .
A series of cyber - attacks have been conducted over the past week by networks of hackers in support of WikiLeaks under the codename Anonymous .
Hacktivists have targeted several corporations as part of Operation Payback , including MasterCard , Visa , PayPal and Amazon over their failure to support WikiLeaks ."
2010-12-14,"The judge hearing Julian Assange 's application broke new ground today by letting reporters use Twitter and other electronic means to update the outside world on developments in court .
Usually courts in England and Wales frown upon journalists using electronic devices in hearings .
But senior district judge Howard Riddle decided to relax the rules , officials at City of Westminster magistrates court confirmed , just before the hearing began .
Some journalists tweeted , others texted and emailed developments .
Without permission , such communications could amount to contempt of court .
For instance , the use of phones is banned , though some reporters have developed a tactic of concealing a phone under a notebook while texting developments in court back to their newsrooms .
The rules governing courts in England and Wales are very rigid , and vary from court to court .
Visual sketches of court proceedings require the artist to leave the room , and rely on their memory , before they can put pen to paper .
Media interest in today 's proceedings was far in excess of what court officials were expecting .
They not only allowed people to stand , but two reporters were allowed to sit in the witness box , though they were asked to move when people gave evidence in support of Assange ."

2010-12-15,"The decision to have Julian Assange sent to a London jail and kept there was taken by the British authorities and not by prosecutors in Sweden , as previously thought , the Guardian has learned .
The Crown Prosecution Service will go to the high court tomorrow to seek the reversal of a decision to free the WikiLeaks founder on bail , made yesterday by a judge at City of Westminster magistrates court .
It had been widely thought Sweden had made the decision to oppose bail , with the CPS acting merely as its representative .
But today the Swedish prosecutor 's office told the Guardian it had "" not got a view at all on bail "" and that Britain had made the decision to oppose bail .
Lawyers for Assange reacted to the news with shock and said CPS officials had told them this week it was Sweden which had asked them to ensure he was kept in prison .
Karin Rosander , director of communications for Sweden 's prosecutor 's office , told the Guardian : "" The decision was made by the British prosecutor .
I got it confirmed by the CPS this morning that the decision to appeal the granting of bail was entirely a matter for the CPS .
The Swedish prosecutors are not entitled to make decisions within Britain .
It is entirely up to the British authorities to handle it . ""
As a result , she said , Sweden will not be submitting any new evidence or arguments to the high court hearing tomorrow morning . ""
The Swedish authorities are not involved in these proceedings .
We have not got a view at all on bail . ""
After the Swedish statement was put to the CPS , it confirmed that all decisions concerning the opposing of bail being granted to Assange had been taken by its lawyers .
It said : "" In all extradition cases , decisions on bail issues are always taken by the domestic prosecuting authority .
It would not be practical for prosecutors in a foreign jurisdiction
â€ ¦ to make such decisions . ""
Last week Sweden issued a warrant for Assange 's arrest and extradition over sexual assault allegations .
On 7 December the British prosecutor , Gemma Lindfield , convinced the senior district court judge Howard Riddle that Assange must be kept in custody because he was a flight risk .
Yesterday the judge accepted that Assange could be released on bail , but he was kept in Wandsworth prison after the CPS said it wanted to appeal against the decision to grant bail to a higher court .
The CPS 's formal grounds of appeal for the hearing tomorrow morning , seen by the Guardian , will say that Assange must be kept in prison until a decision is made whether to extradite him , which could take months ."
2010-12-15,"The high court will hold a hearing tomorrow on a Swedish appeal against bail for Julian Assange , the founder of WikiLeaks .
The 39-year - old Australian , who is wanted for questioning in Sweden over alleged sex crimes , was granted Â£200,000 bail yesterday but the Swedish authorities challenged the decision .
Assange 's supporters fear that should he be extradited to Sweden , he could eventually be sent to the US .
Last night the Swedish prosecutor , Marianne Ny , issued a statement that Sweden would be unable to extradite Assange to the US without the consent of the UK â€ “ "" the surrendering country "" .
WikiLeaks 's decision to publish thousands of secret US diplomatic cables has been described as a blow against US national interests .
Many Americans believe Assange should be tried for orchestrating the release .
Ahead of tomorrow 's hearing , a lawyer for Assange said his backers had raised around half of the Â£200,000 cash he needs to secure bail .
Mark Stephens said members of the public had asked to contribute to the fund .
"" We have to come up with Â£200,000 in pound notes and that is difficult to come by , "" Stephens told BBC News .
"" We 've got about half of that right now , but of course people will understand that even wealthy people do n't keep that kind of money knocking around . ""
Prominent public figures including the American film director Michael Moore , the campaigning Australian journalist John Pilger and the author Hanif Kureishi have pledged their support .
"" I 'm getting offers from the general public who are coming in and saying we really would like to contribute to this â€ “ Julian Assange should n't be in jail , "" said Stephens , who again accused the Swedish authorities of callousness .
"" Why is it that Swedish authorities are so dead set that Julian Assange spends Christmas in jail .
Do they have the genes of Scrooge ? "" he asked .
The conditions of Assange 's bail say he must stay at a supporter 's country house in Suffolk , report to police daily and wear an electronic tag .
The court has asked for a further Â£40,000 in guarantees that would have to be paid if he disappeared .
However , the Swedish authorities fear he could flee . ""
He remains a significant flight risk and no conditions that the court can impose could prevent his flight , "" prosecution lawyer Gemma Lindfield , representing the Swedish authorities , told the City of Westminster magistrates court yesterday .
Assange 's barrister , Geoffrey Robertson QC , yesterday dismissed claims his client was a flight risk , saying that as a result of the past fortnight 's WikiLeaks stories his face was known worldwide .
Robertson gave a taste of what Assange 's argument could be when the extradition case begins in earnest .
He said there was no allegation that Assange had used violence or injured the two women making allegations against him .
One allegation , that he had sex with a woman while she slept , may not be an offence under English law , he said .
Assange could be named Time magazine 's person of the year later today after easily topping a reader poll .
But Time readers do not reflect mainstream opinion in the US , according to the Washington Post .
Its own poll found that almost six out 10 Americans believe Assange should face criminal charges for releasing the cables ."
2010-12-15,"Sweden has decided to fight a British judge 's decision to grant bail to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange , who has spent more than a week in prison over sexual assault allegations involving two Swedish women .
A dramatic day in and around City of Westminster magistrates court saw Assange win bail , but then be forced to return to what his lawyer Mark Stephens described as "" Dickensian conditions "" at Wandsworth prison while the international legal battle played out .
Sweden has decided to contest the granting of bail to Assange , who is being held pending an extradition hearing , on the grounds that no conditions imposed by a judge could guarantee that he would not flee , a legal source told the Guardian .
The appeal will be heard by the high court this week .
If he wins , Assange will still have to raise Â£200,000 in security to meet his bail conditions before being freed .
Howard Riddle , the same senior district judge who last week ordered Assange be held on remand , granted bail with strict conditions , including a curfew and the wearing of a tag .
Today 's developments represent a small but significant victory for Assange , who is being forced to fight the Swedish sex crime allegations in the midst of a tsunami of controversy after the publication by WikiLeaks of thousands of classified US government cables .
The court drama came as a further tranche of cables was released detailing often futile efforts by the US and UK â€ “ involving substantial amounts of British taxpayers ' money â€ “ to block the thriving drug route from west Africa to Europe .
The cables reveal countries struggling to cope with the booming trade while government officials sabotage anti - smuggling measures , officials tip off traffickers and vast shipments from South America pass through under the noses of customs .
In one cable the president of Ghana is even forced to ask UK officials for help in screening his own entourage , who he fears could be carrying drugs through airports .

He said there was no allegation that Assange had used violence or injured the two women making allegations against him , and said one allegation that he had sex with a woman while she slept might not be an offence under English law .
Robertson said that even if Assange was convicted in Sweden , sentencing practice there meant he might not be jailed .
Assange had been interviewed by Swedish police over the allegations on 30 August and vehemently denied any wrongdoing , Robertson said .
Assange sat behind a plastic screen during the hearing , dressed in a dark jacket and open - neck white shirt .
Asked by the judge if he understood that breach of his bail would lead to his arrest , he replied : "" I understand that , your honour . ""
The bail conditions are that security of Â£200,000 is deposited with the court before Assange is freed , as well as two sureties of Â£20,000 each from two named people .
Assange 's passport must remain with the police and he must not apply for any international travel documents .
He must stay at a country mansion owned by a friend , Vaughan Smith , and observe curfews from 10 pm to 2 am , and then from 10 am to 2 pm .
During those periods the judge said he would be electronically monitored via a tag .
Assange will also have to report to a nearby police station every evening .
Smith was one of two people to pledge Â£20,000 in surety , money that could be lost if Assange were to breach his bail conditions or attempt to abscond .
His estate , Ellingham Hall , on the Norfolk - Suffolk borders , is set in 600 acres .
Restaurant designer Sarah Saunders also pledged Â£20,000 in surety .
Asked why , she told the court : "" Because I believe he would not let me down â€
“
he is a good friend
â€
¦
He will always do what he says he will do . ""
The court heard that internationally renowned figures including a Nobel prize - winning scientist , Sir John Sulston , and the film - maker Michael Moore were also backing Assange .
But a starkly different portrait of Assange was painted in court by Gemma Lindfield , representing the Swedish authorities , who said that "" complaints have been made by two women of a serious sexual nature "" .
Opposing bail , she said : "" The court has already found Mr Assange is a flight risk and nothing has changed since last week . ""
The judge disagreed , however , and said that since last week police had "" verified "" the address Assange would stay at if granted bail .
He also said that last week he had been under the impression the prosecution was claiming there was no record of Assange entering the UK .
The UK Border Agency had now told him it was not uncommon for there to be no such record even if someone had arrived perfectly legally .
Outside court , Stephens said : "" It is impossible to say how long it will take before Julian Assange is out .
The problem is Â£200,000 can not be put in by cheque as that takes seven days to clear .
So I have to go around to find cash and have it delivered to court , and until the court has it an innocent man stays in jail . ""
He condemned Sweden 's decision to appeal against the bail ruling : "" They are continuing to persecute Mr Assange â€ ¦
An innocent man is in custody . ""
Assange 's mother , Christine , who flew over from Australia , said : "" I am very happy with the judge 's decision
and I thank you all so much for supporting Julian .
"" Earlier she released a statement from her son in which he said : "" My convictions are unfaltering .

2010-12-15,"The US conservative commentator Rush Limbaugh has criticised film - maker Michael Moore and others for their decision to put up £ 20,000 each to help secure the release of WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange on bail .
The radio talkshow host , whose syndicated show is the most listened - to talk - radio programme in the US , said Moore and others who provided surety for Assange 's return to court on sex charges filed by Swedish prosecutors were "" fans of serial rapists "" .
Film - makers Ken Loach and John Pilger are amongst those who have joined Moore to put up money to help Assange meet the £ 200,000 bail demanded by senior district judge Howard Riddle at the City of Westminster magistrates court .
"" It 's so heartwarming to see a bunch of high - minded people out there on the left ... coming out of the woodwork and paying the bail of the serial rapist Julian Assange , "" Limbaugh said on yesterday 's edition of his show .
"" Who knew that they were such fans of serial rapists ?
Of course they would help a thousand rapists if it would mean that one America - hater might go free . ""
Limbaugh also attacked British authorities for planning to release Assange .
"" How can he be a flight risk ? "" he asked .
"" I mean he 's only got a bunch of fake identities and passports .
What 's the concern here ? ""
Meanwhile Moore , director of documentaries such as Fahrenheit 9/11 , Bowling For Columbine and Sicko , defended his decision to support Assange on his website yesterday .
In a lengthy article , Moore said that if WikiLeaks had been in existence for the past 50 years it might have prevented the Vietnam and Iraq wars , as well as the 9/11 terrorist attacks , among other events .
"" We were taken to war in Iraq on a lie , "" he said .
"" Hundreds of thousands are now dead .
Just imagine if the men who planned this war crime back in 2002 had had a WikiLeaks to deal with .
They might not have been able to pull it off . ""
The only reason they thought they could get away with it was because they had a guaranteed cloak of secrecy .
That guarantee has now been ripped from them , and I hope they are never able to operate in secret again . ""
Moore added : "" For those of you who think it 's wrong to support Julian Assange because of the sexual assault allegations he 's being held for , all I ask is that you not be naive about how the government works when it decides to go after its prey .
Please – never , ever believe the ' official story ' .
And regardless of Assange 's guilt or innocence , this man has the right to have bail posted and to defend himself .
""
Last night the Swedish authorities said they would fight the British decision to grant Assange bail .
The WikiLeaks founder remains in prison for the time being .
He was arrested more than a week ago following allegations of sexual assault involving two Swedish women .
He denies the allegations ."
2010-12-15,"If , as seems likely , Julian Assange walks free from the high court tomorrow , his triumph will be a brief one .
As well as a looming extradition battle with Sweden , he faces a familiar headache known to defendants everywhere : how to pay his lawyers ?
Since his dramatic arrest last week , and incarceration in Wandsworth jail , Assange 's legal bill has been growing .
In theory , the founder of WikiLeaks is sitting on a pile of cash .
But currently all his bank accounts are frozen .
And his legal costs are separate from donations to WikiLeaks , which since October 2009 have reached € 900,000 ( £ 770,000 ) .
Today Assange 's lawyers said they were trying to organise a legal defence fund to pay for his bills , including ones he is likely to incur in his extradition hearing in February .
Asked whether Assange has any cash at all , his solicitor Jennifer Robinson said today : "" No .
We have a huge amount of supporters [ willing to donate money ] but have nowhere to pay it . ""
Once Assange 's legal bills are met , any additional contributions will be used to pay WikiLeaks ' running costs , she said .
Assange 's legal team now includes Robinson , the media expert Mark Stephens , and the human rights lawyer Geoffrey Robertson , who successfully argued that Assange should be granted bail .
A week ago their costs had already topped £ 60,000 , sources suggest .
Assange 's legal team are also scrambling to raise £ 240,000 from his friends and supporters .
They include Jemima Khan , Ken Loach and John Pilger , as well as Vaughan Smith and Sarah Saunders , and the US film director Michael Moore .
By yesterday afternoon not all of their cash pledges had been paid into court .
WikiLeaks ' finances remain healthy , despite the decision by Visa , MasterCard and PayPal to stop accepting donations .
The US credit card companies severed their ties with Assange last week , arguing his whistleblowing website had been acting illegally .
Their decision , apparently following strong US pressure , prompted a furious backlash online .
But it is still possible to give money to WikiLeaks .
The main conduit for donations is Germany 's Wau Holland foundation , a charitable Berlin - registered trust established by a group of now respectable German ex - hackers .
The foundation is named after a legendary German computer specialist who founded the ComputerChaos Club and died in 2001 .
It has a bank account with the Commerzbank , based in Kassel .
In an interview with Der Spiegel , Hendrick Fulda , a foundation board member , said donations to WikiLeaks had boomed since the publication of more than 250,000 US state department cables .
The decision by the eBay subsidiary PayPal to dump WikiLeaks had not halted this flow , he said ."
2010-12-15,"Watching the TV news and reading newspaper accounts of Julian Assange 's bail hearing I 'm struck by the need some people have to embrace heroes , an impulse which is mirrored by an equally urgent need for villains , preferably American ones .
Personally , I do n't find Assange quite satisfactory in that role , for reasons I 'll explain .
But cheer up .
In today 's Guardian I can find two weightier candidates and the good news is that one is an improbable Russian , the other an American .
Being only human , heroes often have feet of clay , and if not feet , other organs .
They do great things or symbolise noble causes , but are personally vain or vindictive ; they chase women or become autocratic .
Life is messy like that , as the ancient Greeks explained long ago .
I 'm pleased to read this morning that former Grenadier Guards officer Captain Vaughan Smith has offered his family 's ancient Norfolk estate ( where hunting facilities are available ) as a bail address for the WikiLeaks founder as he fights Swedish demands for his extradition over sexual assault allegations .
Good for him , and it carries a ironical bonus : scourge of establishment rescued by establishment maverick , as Luke Harding and Sam Jones put it in today 's witty Guardian account of the court hearing .
There 's not been a lot of humour – warmth even – in the WikiLeaks saga so far .
I suspect it 's not an Assange family trait any more than it 's an Angry John Pilger trait .
Since surfacing to face his accusers , Assange has attracted all sorts of familiar celeb support – exemplified by Bianca Jagger –
so it 's a further bonus that I 've never previously heard of Captain Smith ( 47 ) , restaurateur , farmer , war reporter .
He seems to have had an interesting life so far without feeling the need to draw undue attention to himself .
As for Assange , the Guardian 's technology editor , Charles Arthur , tries to make sense of his career and attitudes in today 's paper and has a bit of a struggle .
Daniel Domscheit - Berg , the ex - colleague who accused him of behaving "" like an emperor or slave trader "" was promptly suspended and is now setting up a rival outfit .
Hmm .
That figures .
No humour , too much zeal , messianic qualities ...
Gosh , Assange is starting to sound like Nick Clegg – whom I did hear speak on the circuit last night .
At a Christmas party given by Policy Exchange , the fashionable Tory thinktank ( they all have their moment ) , the deputy PM certainly did not understate the coalition 's ambitions .
I came in late , just where he 'd got to explaining that the coalition took office after 20 years of indisciplined public and private debt - building when the country was "" close to the collapse of the economic order "" .
But do n't panic .
The coalition is engaged in a "" series of transformations "" that will decentralise the state , rebalance the economy away from the financial sector and debt , spread power of all kinds more fairly across the country and across social classes , all this despite inheriting "" a culture which is very resistant to pluralism in politics , "" Clegg said .
Well , good luck .
If he manages 10 % of that he will have done well and deserve our thanks .
Contrast such talk with a junior minister with whom I chatted earlier in the day .
How are things going ?
"" We 're already behaving like the Labour government .
We 're all working in our silos , we 're not talking to each other , we all hate the Treasury , where the civil servants are running the show .
No 10 is in chaos .
"" As summaries go that sounds more realistic in a world full of outraged naivety and misplaced indignation which can become exhausting after a while .
Thus on today 's Guardian comment pages Peter Wilby , a veteran hack of great charm , berates the Lib Dems for all sorts of betrayals – on tuition fees , nuclear power , cuts – and warns Clegg he wo n't get his AV referendum "" yes "" ( Wilby is pro - PR ) after such conduct .
Indeed not ( ho ho ) .
Wilby goes on to argue that the coalition has no mandate and should have sought one as Lloyd George did in 1918 and Ramsay MacDonald in 1931 – such wholesome analogies – because voters only have one chance in five years to influence policy .
This is nonsense on stilts but it is widely shared , despite this being a time when politicians are arguably too cowed by the relentless grind of public opinion , markets , media etc to take the wise , long view instead of plumping for the softer , safer option .
But let 's stay cheerful .
Today 's paper does pay tribute to two improbable characters with proper claims to heroic status .
To mark today 's verdict in the latest rigged trial of the Russian ex - oil - oligarch Mikhail Khodorkovsky , the Guardian carries a wonderful commentary by Boris Akunin , one of Russia 's most popular crime writers .
No Kremlin party invites for Akunin this Christmas because he places Khodorkovsky in a long line of what he calls Russian "" aristocrats "" – high - minded idealists who struggle for human freedom and dignity against what he calls the "" arrest - ocracy ""
( I 'm sure it sounds better in Russian ) , whose response is always to lock people up or murder them : the Tsar 's "" third section "" becomes the Cheka , then the NKVD , the KGB and now the FSB of Vladimir Putin 's "" mafia state "" ( copyright WikiLeaks ) .
Akunin realises how unlikely a hero Khodorkovsky is , a man who made a great fortune out of the looting of the old USSR when the 1990s privatisation of the economy was botched in the best Russian tradition – like quirky heroes Alexander Solzhenitsyn , Andrei Sakharov , all the way back to the eccentric Tolstoy and the doomed aristo - plotters known as the Decembrists .
Khodorkovsky was charged with economic crimes – including avoiding tax on laundered cash , if you can follow that one .
Once Russia 's richest man as head of Yukos , his real crime , Miriam Elder reports in an adjoining article , was funding political parties that tried to oppose Putin .
In his closing statement to the court , Khodorkovsky warned that much more than his own life and liberty are at stake today . ""
A state that destroys its best companies , which are ready to become global champions , a country that holds its own citizens in contempt ... is a sick state .
"" You can read the full statement here .
And today 's heroic American ?
I never much warmed to Richard "" Raging Bull ""
Holbrooke as a public figure ; too much the arrogant bully for my taste .
Yet when you read the obits of the 69-year - old diplomat , one of the last products of the great cold war - era of reality - based public officials , you can not be but impressed by his range , his energy and ( sometimes ) effectiveness .
At least I ca n't .
He died in Washington on Monday after a ruptured aorta during prolonged surgery that failed to save him .
From Vietnam ( tainted by it ) to his Dayton Accords , which stopped the Bosnian slaughter , and the rescue of Kosovo ( still causing trouble ) and the Af - Pak border today , the Holbrookes of this world do more good than harm .
They could have spent their lives making money ( which is what Holbrooke did during Republican years ) or having more fun than shouting matches with local tyrants .
That 's what the WikiLeaks saga is actually telling us , though many people will find it difficult to accept , Julian Assange among them .
Today it 's cocaine corruption in west Africa that worries western diplomats .
Who else will try to stem it ?
I 'm not sure Silvio Berlusconi wants the responsibility ."

2010-12-15,"The decision by a district judge to allow tweeting from the court in the Julian Assange extradition hearing raises interesting legal questions .
First , has the district judge , Howard Riddle , set a precedent which other courts will follow ?
Not exactly : it is a magistrates court , lowest in the pecking order of courts , so decisions do not bind other courts .
However , his decision may be persuasive of other courts , especially other magistrates .
The sky did not fall in as a result of yesterday 's tweeting , so why not allow it again ?
For the decision to gain wider acceptance we really need a crown court judge or high court judge to follow suit .
The question is already getting attention at the highest level .
In a Judicial Studies Board lecture in Belfast last month , the lord chief justice , Lord Judge , said : "" How is the principle of open justice compatible with preventing an ongoing , live and text - based dialogue to the outside world from a courtroom ?
If a reporter or member of the public is permitted to write notes to himself or herself in court , and then ' file them ' from a telephone outside the court , what is the qualitative difference if they are permitted to do so when sitting in court , say , by sending a email ?
If it is possible to file a story via email from a laptop in court , then why is Twitter any different ?
On the other hand , tape recordings are prohibited by statute .
Why is Twitter in the form of text - based transmission of material from court any different ? ""
The second issue is the challenge posed by the brevity of tweets .
Court reporters have defences against charges of contempt of court and an action for libel so long as their reports are fair and accurate .
Can they fairly sum up what might be complex legal points in 140 characters ?
The use of links , or Tweetlonger , might address this .
But there is a danger of cherrypicking the juiciest moments when tweeting court and possibly producing a report which is not a fair account of proceedings .
It might also be solved by the use of liveblogs , such as the one published by the Guardian yesterday , which publish tweets and other material , thus giving adequate context .
The issue then is if reporters are to tweet from court , they need guidelines to work to , to make sure they retain their defences against libel and contempt .
Another question is whether a tweeting reporter can also be expected to produce a longer court report as well .
This might prove too much of a challenge and , while national newspapers can afford to send multiple staff to hearings such as the Assange extradition , regionals that have already cut back court coverage drastically do not have such resources .
Journalists in court have no greater privileges than other members of the public and there is also the risk that the tweeting citizen journalist , unaware of court reporting laws , may include material which should be excluded .
The other danger to consider is that tweets will often be sent from a smartphone which has a very good camera .
Will the temptation to tweet a picture of someone be too much ?
While the courts appear to be considering opening up to reporting via use of such technology , there has been no indication that that includes sending pictures or video .
Anything that opens up the courts to greater scrutiny and reporting has got to be a good thing .
The challenge now is for those utilising such technology to make it work .

2010-12-15,"The Metropolitan police is to investigate recent online attacks on companies – including Visa , MasterCard and PayPal – that have cut ties with the whistleblowing site WikiLeaks .
Scotland Yard today said that for several months it has been examining a number of alleged criminal offences by Anonymous , the loose - knit group committed to bringing down sites perceived to be acting against WikiLeaks .
Downing Street was this week preparing to face a major attack on its sites from the group after Swedish prosecutors challenged the decision to grant bail to the WikiLeaks founder , Julian Assange , over charges of alleged sex crimes in Sweden .
The Swedish prosecution office 's website , aklagare.se , was attacked for 11 hours overnight on Tuesday after it maintained it would press for Assange to be extradited .
The so - called "" distributed denial of service "" ( DDoS ) attacks , which bring down sites by overpowering them with repeated requests to load , are illegal in the UK .
The Met said today : "" Earlier this year the Metropolitan police received a number of allegations of denial of service cyber attacks against several companies by a group calling themselves Anonymous .
We are investigating these criminal allegations and our investigation is ongoing . ""
The Metropolitan police service is monitoring the situation relating to recent and ongoing denial of service attacks , and will investigate where appropriate . ""
Anonymous leapt to the support of WikiLeaks after Amazon and other companies terminated business links with the site .
The1,000-strong group of activists launched what they called Operation Payback , vowing to give perceived anti - WikiLeaks firms a "" black eye "" .
Visa , MasterCard , PayPal and the company that hosted WikiLeaks were all brought offline after cutting ties with the whistleblowing website .
Although WikiLeaks has been careful not to support or admonish the cyber - war being waged on its behalf , Assange this week called for all supporters to defend WikiLeaks from "" instruments of foreign policy "" , among which he specifically named the credit card companies .
At least three people , including two Dutch teenagers , have been arrested in the past week on suspicion of participating in the attacks .
Most of those involved in the group are believed to be teenagers , based around the world including in the UK .
Experts estimate that about 90 % of the group launch their attacks using an application called Low Orbit Ion Cannon ( LOIC ) , downloads of which grew substantially last week .
Although the group affects to have no hierarchy , operating in what it calls "" organised chaos "" , documents have come to light that suggest a nucleus of decision - makers decides which sites to target .
An attack that exposed the email addresses and passwords of 1.3 million Gawker users has been linked to an Anonymous splinter group .
The FBI is to investigate the incident .

2010-12-15,"Much excitement followed senior district judge Howard Riddle 's decision to let journalists give live updates on Twitter from court at the bail application of Julian Assange .
But as usual the Americans beat us to it .
In March 2009 , reporting on Twitter was said to be "" the fastest - growing trend in the coverage of the US justice system "" .
In Assange 's case the decision on whether to grant bail was for a judge .
There was no jury .
But some American judges have allowed reporters to tweet from criminal trials , even though jurors could be biased by reading tweets .
And although juries are warned to deliver their verdict solely on the evidence , one juror in the US was caught asking followers on Twitter for advice .
In the past , judges have frowned on mobile phones in court : journalist Jon Ronson told his followers , "" Jealous people are allowed to tweet in the assange hearing .
When my phone rang at Jonathan King at the Old Bailey
I was almost imprisoned . ""
And broadcasting from court is banned by law .
Does this cover Twitter ?
The Lord Chief Justice , Lord Judge , considered this question in a lecture last month .
His answer ? ""
Arguably , no . ""
He pointed out that tweets stay on the internet , increasing the potential for jurors to access prejudicial material .
Even if the court - based tweet is fair and accurate , responses to it may not be .
The publication of a defendant 's previous convictions when the judge has ruled them inadmissible is a classic example .
In such cases , "" the risks to the fairness of the trial will be very serious "" ."
2010-12-15,"The Swedish prosecutor 's website crashed late yesterday , moments after the authority announced its intention to fight the decision to grant WikiLeaks editor - in - chief Julian Assange bail in the UK .
The website of the Swedish Prosecution Authority , Aklagare.se , was brought offline for almost 11 hours on Tuesday in the latest online attack by Anonymous , the loose - knit group committed to crippling the websites of companies and governments perceived to be acting against WikiLeaks .
The site was back online at the time of publication .
At least three hackers linked to the Anonymous attacks , including two Dutch teenagers , have been arrested this week as authorities crack down on the illegal online assaults that have brought down the sites of Visa , Mastercard and PayPal in the past fortnight .
Assange this week issued a rallying call to his supporters , urging them to protect the whistleblowers ' site from what he called "" instruments of US foreign policy "" – citing Visa , Mastercard and PayPal .
Downing Street also put its websites on red alert in anticipation of being targeted by the group , though no substantial attack materialised .
WikiLeaks ' primary site , WikiLeaks.org , reappeared on Friday , one week after being taken offline by its California - based hosting provider , Everydns .
But the internet security firm Spamhaus yesterday warned that the site 's new incarnation could be riddled with malware run by "" Russian cybercriminals "" .
WikiLeaks.org redirects users to a mirror site – mirror.wikileaks.info – which sits within an IP range hosted by the Russian firm Webalta .
"" Our concern is that any WikiLeaks archive posted on a site that is hosted in Webalta space might be infected with malware , "" says Quentin Jenkins , a security researcher at Spamhaus .
""
Since the main wikileaks.org website now transparently redirects visitors to mirror.wikileaks.info , and thus directly into Webalta 's controlled IP address space , there is substantial risk that any malware infection would spread widely .
"" Wikileaks.info was offline earlier today .
Its Russian - run DNS provider , Heihachi , is also "" highly involved in botnet command and control and the hosting of Russian cybercrime "" , according to experts from Spamhaus and computer security firm Trend Micro .
The domain owners have responded to the allegations , but the statement is inaccessible due to the site outage .
Around 2,000 sites are operating as a mirror to WikiLeaks , pointing a portion of their server space to WikiLeaks content so that it is technically almost impossible to entirely remove from the internet .
Anonymous has vowed to avenge the site in any way it can .
Late last week the group admitted that its actions , known as distributed denial of service attacks ( DDoS ) , were becoming ineffective , and said they would move to finding the "" best , least exposed [ US diplomatic cables ] leaks "" and spread around the web ."
2010-12-15,"Mark Zuckerberg , the billionaire co - founder of Facebook , was today named Time magazine 's 2010 person of the year .
Zuckerberg , 26 , beat a string of notable personalities to the accolade – including WikiLeaks editor - in - chief Julian Assange and the president of Afghanistan , Hamid Karzai .
The 33 rescued Chilean miners and the rightwing US Tea Party movement were also named as runners - up .
Time magazine 's annual accolade is given to the person or thing judged to have most influenced the culture and the news during the past year for good or for ill .
Zuckerberg was honoured "" for connecting more than half a billion people and mapping the social relations among them ; for creating a new system of exchanging information ; and for changing how we all live our lives "" , Time journalist Lev Grossman said .
The Time editor , Richard Stengel , announced the winner on NBC Television 's Today show .
Ben Bernanke , the cerebral American economist , took the prize last year , following US president Barack Obama in 2008 and Russian prime minister Vladimir Putin in 2007 .
The most notable runner - up is Assange , who is currently in prison pending an appeal against a decision yesterday to grant him bail over sexual allegations in Sweden .
Assange comfortably won the readers ' choice award for Time 's 2010 person of the year , announced earlier this week .
He beat Recep Tayyip Erdogan , the prime minister of Turkey , by more than 230,000 votes to scoop the prize .
Time 's decision has not gone down well among Assange 's supporters .
Many commenters on Time 's official announcement are critical of the magazine 's choice .
Matthias , for example , says : "" Why do you let people vote if you just pick your own candidate ?
Assange was first !
Shameless cowards . ""
Nello Margiotta commented : "" Mark Zuckerberg who ?
it 's only a political choice of the director of Time Magazine ; obviously for people in the net the person of the year is Julian Assange . ""
But Zuckerberg , a Harvard dropout , is marked out as one of the world 's youngest billionaires – and now one of the youngest recipients of Time 's prestigious accolade .
"" In less than seven years , Zuckerberg [ has ] wired together a twelfth of humanity into a single network , thereby creating a social entity almost twice as large as the US , "" said Grossman .
"" We have entered the Facebook age , and Mark Zuckerberg is the man who brought us here .
"" Zuckerberg is also an unlikely philanthropist .
Earlier this month , he pledged to give away at least half of his fortune to charitable causes as part of a campaign led by Microsoft founder Bill Gates and businessman Warren Buffett .
In September , Zuckerberg pledged to donate $ 100 m ( £ 63 m ) over five years to the Newark and New Jersey school system .
"" People wait until late in their career to give back .
But why wait when there is so much to be done ? "" said Zuckerberg last week .
Zuckerberg 's dormroom creation registered its 500 millionth user earlier this year .
Now thought to have about 600 million registered Facebook users worldwide , the cocksure computer scientist says it is "" almost guaranteed "" to reach 1 billion users eventually .
Asked whether the outcome of the readers ' poll is taken into account during the decision - making process , a Time spokeswoman said : "" "" Time 's editors gather ideas and feedback from a number of sources , including Time correspondents around the world , former people of the year , and our readers via our online poll . ""
More than 1.5 million people voted in our Time.com poll this year ; ultimately though , Time 's person of the year is an editorial choice . """

2010-12-16,"With a smile and a short statement of quiet defiance , Julian Assange tonightwalked free from custody and into the kind of media scrum more commonly seen after a decades - long prison sentence , rather than nine days on remand .
This was the third hearing in as many weeks relating to the WikiLeaks founder 's bail application over sex assault charges against two Swedish women , which he denies but for which his extradition is being sought , and it is unlikely to be the last before the allegations are resolved .
But with the global storm over the website 's leaks and a gathering campaign of online protest against what is seen by some of his supporters as a politically motivated process , this was never going to be a mere procedural hearing .
Journalists from around the world â€ “ the US , Sweden , Spain , the Netherlands â€ “ queued from before dawn to secure a seat in court , while a pyramid of photographers and TV crews teetered precariously at the entrance to the Royal Courts of Justice in central London , in anticipation of the Australian , at some point , walking out of its imposing front doors on to the Strand .
At 6 pm , more than five hours after being told that , with conditions , he was indeed free to leave , he walked out into a battery of flashing lights .
In court he had seemed weary , leaning his head against the mahogany wall of the dock as the appeal was heard .
But Assange had found new energy when he was finally let out of the cells , thanking "" all the people around the world who have had faith in me "" , those members of the press "" who are not all taken in "" , and "" the British justice system itself , where , if justice is not always an outcome , at least it is not dead yet "" .
He had had plentiful opportunity , "" during my time in solitary confinement in the bottom of a Victorian prison "" , to reflect on the conditions of those around the world who are also held in solitary confinement , he said , and would continue "" to protest my innocence in this matter and to reveal , as we get it , as we have not yet , the evidence from these allegations "" .
Sweden is seeking Assange 's extradition over allegations of rape , molestation and unlawful coercion , made by two women over 10 days in August .
One of the women says she was victim of "" unlawful coercion "" and "" sexual molestation "" , alleging that Assange had sex with her without a condom when it was her "" express wish "" one should be used .
The second woman accuses him of having sex with her on 17 August without a condom while she was asleep at her Stockholm home .
Assange admits having consensual sex with both women , but denies any criminal wrongdoing .
On 7 December he voluntarily attended a police station in London where he was arrested and remanded to Wandsworth prison in south London .
A senior district judge at Westminster magistrates court last week granted conditional bail , a decision which against which he immediately appealed , meaning he remained in custody until yesterday .
However , having overcome the efforts of Swedish and British prosecutors to keep him in prison until his extradition hearings , expected early next year , the Australian was nearly undone by logistics .
Having attracted an army of high - profile backers , including celebrity campaigner Jemima Khan and the Oscar - winning film - maker Michael Moore , Assange 's team submitted a list of possible backers willing to offer surety that the Australian would not attempt to flee .
But Mr Justice Ouseley , head of the administrative court , expressed his concerns that "" many of those who are offering themselves as sureties are doing so because they are supporters of [ Assange 's ] activities with WikiLeaks "" , rather than being in any position to attest to his character and the likelihood of his absconding .
Having heard submissions from the crown that Assange , as a "" nomadic "" person , was unsuitable for bail , he dismissed the campaigning journalist John Pilger as "" another peripatetic Australian "" .
Unfortunately , not all those he deemed acceptable to stand surety â€ “ the Australian journalist Phillip Knightley , the publisher Felix Dennis , the Nobel prize - winning biologist Sir John Sulston , the former Labour minister Lord Evans and Professor Patricia David , a retired professor of education
â€ “ appear to have expected to get the nod .
There was , accordingly , a tense few hours while the five were tracked down across the country and persuaded to present themselves in court or at a designated police station to complete the paperwork .
An additional pressure was the requirement that Assange reach his bail address by 10 pm , his curfew time , otherwise he would be in breach of his bail conditions .
That address , after his Victorian cell , may come as a pleasant shock .
The WikiLeaks founder will now endure the hardship of a Georgian country house on the Norfolk - Suffolk borders , Ellingham Hall , a property so grand that its sheer scale was raised as an objection in court by the crown , who argued that electronic equipment would be unable to monitor Assange across the "" vast "" extent of the estate .
( It was suggested by his lawyer that the Australian would willingly restrict himself to "" the manor house "" ) .
He will be the guest of Vaughan Smith , a former army captain and the founder of the Frontline Club , a club for journalists in London , where Assange had stayed .
Last night Smith told the Guardian his friend would be treated to a celebratory dinner of "" stew and dumplings "" and joked that there was no prospect Assange could escape . ""
He 's not very good at reading maps .
He 's topographically awful .
If he runs off into the woods I will find him , "" he said .
Assange , Smith stressed , was in no sense a fugitive and was merely staying at his country estate as a regular guest .
"" We are not harbouring him .
That much is very clear . ""
Others , however , were not in joking mood : Pilger said the biggest threat to Assange 's liberty was the US government , which he called "" the great unspoken in this case .
It is a spectre of which we are all aware that he might end up in a high - security prison in the US . ""
Assange 's WikiLeaks colleague Kristinn Hrafnsson said the website would continue its activities , with Assange once again at the helm , from Ellingham Hall .
"" We have a fairly decent internet connection there .
We will keep on operating as we have done before . """
2010-12-16,"Britain 's high court today granted bail to Julian Assange , the WikiLeaks founder who is wanted in Sweden for questioning over allegations of rape .
Mr Justice Duncan Ouseley agreed with a decision by City of Westminister magistrates court earlier in the week to release Assange on strict conditions : Â£200,000 cash deposit , with a further Â£40,000 guaranteed in two sureties of Â£20,000 , and strict conditions on his movement .
Assange stood in a dark grey suit in the dock as Ouseley began hearing an appeal by British prosecutors acting on behalf of Sweden .
There was an early sign that the day would go in Assange 's favour when Ouseley said : "" The history of the way it [ the case ] has been dealt with by the Swedish prosecutors would give Mr Assange some basis that he might be acquitted following a trial . ""
Mark Stephens , one of Assange 's lawyers , said he expected Assange to be released later today , or tomorrow in a worst case scenario .
"" We are hopeful that he will be released from here [ the court ] but if the formalities are not completed before the bus goes back to Wandsworth , he will be released from Wandsworth later , "" Stephens said .
"" We have n't addressed the question of American legal action or the potential for it .
Our main focus is delight and joy , and delight and joy of Julian 's family , that he is going to be released in the very foreseeable future .
He will not be going back to that Victorian prison .
He will not be going back to that cell once occupied by Oscar Wilde . ""
The Crown Prosecution Service suggested that Assange 's wealthy supporters were offering surety for a cause , not because they could vouch for him .
The 39-year - old Australian arrived at the high court in a white prison van .
Photographers swarmed around the vehicle in an attempt to get a picture .
Amid intense media interest , a queue of journalists had formed as early as 6 am .
Stephens said before the proceedings that the bail money had been raised from Assange 's supporters and "" appears to be in the banking system "" . .
Assange has been held in solitary confinement , released from his cell for only one hour a day , and his mail has been heavily censored , according to his supporters .
Assange is fighting attempts to extradite him to Sweden for questioning over allegations of sexual misconduct including rape made by two female WikiLeaks volunteers , which he denies .
"" It 's an ongoing investigation in Sweden and the prosecutor needs to interrogate him to make a decision on the matter , "" said Karin Rosander , a spokeswoman for the Swedish prosecution agency .
Bail conditions stipulate that Assange must stay at a country house in Suffolk owned by Vaughan Smith , the founder of the Frontline club in west London , report to police daily and wear an electronic tag .
Meanwhile , it emerged that the decision to seek a remand in custody for Assange was taken by the British authorities and not by prosecutors in Sweden .
It had been widely supposed that Sweden had taken the decision to oppose bail , with the Crown Prosecution Service acting merely as its representative .
But the Swedish prosecutor 's office told the Guardian it had "" not got a view at all on bail "" and that Britain had made the decision to oppose bail .
Karin Rosander , the director of communications for Sweden 's prosecutor 's office , said : "" The decision was made by the British prosecutor .
I got it confirmed by the CPS this morning that the decision to appeal the granting of bail was entirely a matter for the CPS .
The Swedish prosecutors are not entitled to make decisions within Britain .
It is entirely up to the British authorities to handle it . ""
As a result , she said , Sweden would not submit any new evidence or arguments to the high court hearing .
"" The Swedish authorities are not involved in these proceedings .
We have not got a view at all on bail . ""
The CPS confirmed that decisions to oppose bail for Assange had been taken by its lawyers . ""
In all extradition cases , decisions on bail issues are always taken by the domestic prosecuting authority , "" it said .
"" It would not be practical for prosecutors in a foreign jurisdiction
â€ ¦ to make such decisions . ""
Assange and his lawyers have expressed fears of a legal battle in the US , where prosecutors may be preparing to indict him for espionage over WikiLeaks ' publication of the documents .
The New York Times reported that federal prosecutors were looking for evidence that Assange had conspired with a former US army intelligence analyst suspected of leaking classified documents .
Among the material prosecutors are studying is an online chat log in which Private Bradley Manning is said to claim that while he was downloading government files he was directly communicating with Assange using an encrypted internet conferencing service , according to the Times .
Manning is also said to have claimed that Assange gave him access to a dedicated server for uploading some of them to WikiLeaks ."
2010-12-16,
2010-12-16,"A US congressional committee took evidence from a variety of lawyers about the possibility of bringing a prosecution against Julian Assange under the Espionage Act , as well as the legal and constitutional issues raised by the Wiki - Leaks revelations .
The hearing was in front of the house judiciary committee .
There is a consensus growing among US constitutional lawyers and others , while rehearsing all the problems attached to bringing a prosecution , that Assange will be indicted .
But they doubt the chances of obtaining his extradition from Britain , and they think it will be harder still should he be sent to Sweden .
Floyd Abrams , the lawyer who defended the New York Times in the supreme court over the Pentagon papers leak in the 1970s , said today that the chances of a US indictment against Assange were better than even .
And Paul Rosenzweig , a former deputy assistant secretary for policy in the department of homeland security , put the chances at 80 % .
One of Assange 's lawyers , Jennifer Robinson , told ABC News last week that an indictment could be imminent .
But when asked if the US had approached the British government about extradition , a British embassy spokesman in Washington said today : "" We do not comment on extradition . ""
Privately , British diplomats indicated that there had been no substantive discussions with the Americans on any impending extradition request .
US lawyers are sceptical as to whether Assange could be prosecuted under the Espionage Act , and suggested the justice department must look at alternatives .
Another of Assange 's lawyers , Mark Stephens , told al - Jazeera television that a secretly - empanelled grand jury was already meeting in Alexandria , Virginia , with a view to his prosecution .
A spokeswoman for the justice department refused to comment .
Abrams said that the Bush administration brought hard cases to Alexandria rather than DC , and it would be interesting if the Obama administration were to do the same . ""
DC is the most natural place , but is likely to be more pro - defendant ; Virginia courts are more amenable to the prosecution , "" Abrams said .
He added : "" There would certainly be an indictment if Assange had encouraged [ Bradley Manning , the US army private suspected of being behind the leak ] to provide the information and a mechanism to do so .
That would make it easier for the justice department to bring a conspiracy charge .
I would not have given the chances as 80 % .
I do think it is better than even they will proceed . ""
One argument that Assange and WikiLeaks could make is that it is a news organisation , as it describes itself on its website , and therefore should be protected from prosecution under the freedom of the press .
It could be argued that if Assange were to be prosecuted , why not the New York Times or the Guardian ?
"" There has to be an element of bad faith that is clearly absent with the [ New York ] Times
and , I presume , the Guardian .
That is a debatable issue with Assange , "" Abrams said .
Rosenzweig , a visiting fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation , agreed : "" Newspapers like the Guardian add analysis and value to the enterprise .
WikiLeaks is just a compiler or a means of distribution .
As for Assange 's character , he seems likely not to be well received by an American jury if he ever goes in front of one . ""
Scott Silliman , a professor at the Duke University , also thought the justice department might be considering charging Assange with conspiracy in his dealings with Manning .
"" That would be a very ' fact dependent ' case , however , because it would require the government to prove beyond a reasonable doubt Assange solicited the files from Manning . ""
"" Interestingly , though , if those facts are proven , that would be no different than what many US newspaper reporters do in dealing with their sources .
All this is to say that whether the government charges a violation of the Espionage Act or solicitation , the case would still be highly problematic and would be a very controversial precedent with relation to the media in this country . ""
The TV channel MSNBC this week interviewed a panel of lawyers , including Rosenzweig .
The consensus was that a legal challenge was likely .
One of the panel , Abbe Lowell , said : "" The WikiLeaks disclosures are getting bolder and causing more controversy .
The US will find some way to bring charges , because not doing so will be deemed bad legal precedent , bad foreign relations , and bad national politics . ""
The third member , Stephen Vladeck , a law professor at American University , said that if there was no conviction in Sweden , "" I think it is extremely likely that the US government will pursue an indictment ( or unseal an indictment it has already obtained ) , and seek Assange 's extradition "" ."
2010-12-16,"President Obama has decided to pursue a dangerous strategy that could cause irreparable harm to freedom of the press as we know it .
According to Charlie Savage of the New York Times , Attorney General Eric Holder is investigating the possibility of prosecuting WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange in connection with the 250,000 diplomatic cables stolen – according to the government – by army private Bradley Manning .
By longstanding first amendment tradition , third parties such as news organisations — even an unconventional one like WikiLeaks — are not prosecuted for publishing leaked material , even if the person who gave it to them broke the law .
So , Holder is working on the theory that WikiLeaks "" colluded "" with Manning , acting not as a passive recipient , but as an active participant in persuading Manning to give up the goods .
The problem is that there is no meaningful distinction to be made .
How did the Guardian , equally , not "" collude "" with WikiLeaks in obtaining the cables ?
How did the New York Times not "" collude "" with the Guardian when the Guardian gave the Times a copy following Assange 's decision to cut the Times out of the latest document dump ?
For that matter , I do n't see how any news organisation can be said not to have colluded with a source when it receives leaked documents .
Did n't the Times collude with Daniel Ellsberg when it received the Pentagon Papers from him ?
Yes , there are differences .
Ellsberg had finished making copies long before he began working with the Times , whereas Assange may have goaded Manning .
But does that really matter ?
What matters is whether publishing leaked documents poses such a grave danger to national security that it warrants prosecution .
The supreme court , in the 1931 case of Near v Minnesota , ruled that the standard for stopping publication – that is , for censorship – is whether the information is so sensitive that it would be akin to revealing the movement of troops during wartime .
That standard was affirmed in the 1971 Pentagon Papers case , New York Times Company v United States , in which the Court ruled the Nixon administration could not censor the Times and the Washington Post .
What 's less clear is whether news organisations can be prosecuted after publication under something easier to prove than the troops - in - time - of - war standard .
As my friend and occasional collaborator Harvey Silverglate has pointed out , the Nixon White House took some steps to bring criminal charges against the Times and the Post after the Pentagon Papers were published , but dropped the matter after the then president became overwhelmed by the Watergate scandal .
More recently , Silverglate notes , there were calls on the right to prosecute the Times and the Post under the Espionage Act of 1917 after their 2005 exposure of the Bush administration 's secret wiretapping program ( the Times ) and the CIA 's secret prisons in eastern Europe ( the Post ) .
Then President Bush , to his credit , did nothing of the kind , despite referring to the Times ' exposé as "" a shameful act "" .
The Obama - Holder wrinkle is to attempt to draw distinctions between WikiLeaks and the traditional media .
It ca n't be done .
The rhetoric of Assange and his supporters can sometimes be a little scary .
In fact , though , their actions have been quite moderate .
The US state department cables , after all , were not top secret , and WikiLeaks says it has taken pains to withhold potentially dangerous information .
In that respect , attempts to separate the Times and the Guardian , on the one hand , and WikiLeaks , on the other , should be seen as entirely political .
Presumably , dragging a handcuffed - and - shackled Assange into federal court would prove quite popular .
By contrast , sentencing Times publisher Arthur Sulzberger to a long stint in a federal penitentiary would likely prove too much , even though senator Joe Lieberman , an occasionally moderate former Democrat , has suggested that the Times could be prosecuted .
Almost since his inauguration nearly two years ago , Barack Obama has been disappointing liberals , whether it 's through his half - measures on the economy and healthcare , his continued pursuit of unpopular wars in Iraq and Afghanistan or his failure to close Guantánamo , the very symbol of Bush - era overreach .
Some of those complaints are overwrought .
Politics is the art of the possible , and Obama can justifiably claim to have done what 's possible in the face of Republican intransigence and the sheer difficulties of what he has faced .
By contrast , the White House 's legal war against WikiLeaks is a shameful assault on our guarantee of free speech and a free press .
It 's ironic that after two years of bogus claims from the right that Obama is dismantling the constitution , now that he really is , the only people who seem to care are on the left ."
2010-12-16,"Julian Assange may ultimately succeed in his bail application , but the threat of extradition to Sweden will still hang over him ( The Julian Assange case : a mockery of extradition ? , 14 December ) .
The public interest in Assange 's case is understandable , but his case illustrates a wider , less publicised problem .
Last year alone , Europe 's fast - track extradition system was used to extradite nearly 700 people from the UK .
Our work at Fair Trials International leaves us in no doubt that this system , designed to deliver justice , is in fact causing many serious cases of injustice .
A central concern in the Assange case is that Sweden seems not even to have laid charges .
The European arrest warrant should , by law , be used only to prosecute or to enforce a sentence .
Serious though the allegations may be , there is no basis to extradite Mr Assange , unless for the purposes of conducting a criminal prosecution .
We have seen many cases of overseas prosecutors reaching for the quick - fire , tick - box EAW , rather than using other legitimate means of investigating alleged crimes .
Michael Turner and Andrew Symeou are just two of those we have helped , and who experienced horrendous periods in detention after being surrendered , before even being questioned by police .
In such cases as these , less drastic tools should be used .
Sweden should ask the UK to assist with its investigations , starting by questioning Assange .
The EAW , used properly , is a key weapon in the fight against serious cross - border crime .
It should not , however , be the measure of first resort .
Catherine Heard Head of policy
, Fair Trials International Sarah Ludford is right : the EU 's existing "" mutual legal assistance "" regime allows representatives from a prosecution authority in one member state to investigate in another member state , where a known suspect is living , an offence committed in their own state ( Letters , 14 December ) .
The host state can arrange for a suspect to be detained in order to be interviewed about the alleged offence .
Why do the Swedish authorities not use these provisions to investigate the allegations against Assange ?
Given the abuse of the EAW provisions in the Assange case and others , it was a serious mistake for the government to decide the UK should opt into the EU draft directive for a European investigation order .
This will be a significant step up from the existing mutual legal assistance regime and is likely to lead to a reduction in human - rights protection for suspects .
Member states will be given substantial powers to conduct investigations within other member states with the host states exercising little in the way of checks or controls .
There will , therefore , be a significantly increased risk of unjustified detention and other interferences with liberty .

2010-12-16,"As Julian Assange emerged from his nine - day imprisonment , there were renewed concerns about the physical and psychological health of Bradley Manning , the former US intelligence analyst suspected of leaking the diplomatic cables at the centre of the storm .
Manning , who was arrested seven months ago , is being held at a military base in Virginia and faces a court martial and up to 52 years in prison for his alleged role in copying the cables .
His friends and supporters also claim they have been the target of extra - judicial harassment , intimidation and outright bribery by US government agents .
According to David House , a computer researcher from Boston who visits Manning twice a month , he is starting to deteriorate . ""
Over the last few weeks I have noticed a steady decline in his mental and physical wellbeing , "" he said .
"" His prolonged confinement in a solitary holding cell is unquestionably taking its toll on his intellect ; his inability to exercise due to [ prison ] regulations has affected his physical appearance in a manner that suggests physical weakness .
"" Manning , House added , was no longer the characteristically brilliant man he had been , despite efforts to keep him intellectually engaged .
He also disputed the authorities ' claims that Manning was being kept in solitary for his own good .
"" I initially believed that his time in solitary confinement was a decision made in the interests of his safety , "" he said .
"" As time passed and his suicide watch was lifted , to no effect , it became clear that his time in solitary – and his lack of a pillow , sheets , the freedom to exercise , or the ability to view televised current events – were enacted as a means of punishment rather than a means of safety . ""
House said many people were reluctant to talk about Manning 's condition because of government harassment , including surveillance , warrantless computer seizures , and even bribes .
"" This has had such an intimidating effect that many are afraid to speak out on his behalf , "" House said .
Some friends report being followed extensively .
Another computer expert said the army offered him cash to – in his words – "" infiltrate "" the WikiLeaks website .
He said : "" I turned them down .
I do n't want anything to do with this cloak and dagger stuff . ""
When the Washington Post tried to investigate the claim , an army criminal investigation division spokesman refused to comment .
"" We 've got an ongoing investigation , "" he said .
"" We do n't discuss our techniques and tactics . ""
On 3 November , House , 23 , said he found customs agents waiting for him when he and his girlfriend returned to the US after a short holiday in Mexico .
His bags were searched and two men identifying themselves as Homeland Security officials said they were being detained for questioning and would miss their connecting flight .
The men seized all his electronic items and he was told to hand over all passwords and encryption keys – which he refused .
The items have yet to be returned , said House .
He added : "" If Manning is convicted , it will be because his individual dedication to human ethics far surpasses that of the US government . ""
House , who met Manning through friends but came to know him only after his detention , said he was committed to his cause . ""
Like many computer scientists , I identify with the open government issues at the core of this case . """
2010-12-17,"\Has Assange been charged with an offence , or are these just accusations ?
Assange has not formally been charged with any crime .
His lawyers insist the warrant against him is merely for questioning on the accusations made by the two women , Miss A and Miss W.
But Gemma Lindfield , for the Crown Prosecution Service , said in court that the European Arrest Warrant "" quite clearly states [ Assange ] is wanted for prosecution "" .
Mr Justice Ouseley , the head of the administrative court who rejected the appeal against Assange 's bail , acknowledged the dispute in his judgment : "" There is a debate , which may yet be had elsewhere , over whether the warrant is a warrant for questioning or a warrant for trial . ""
He was proceeding , he said , on the basis that it was an extradition warrant for trial .
A charge by the requesting country is a prerequisite for a valid EAW .
What are the accusations or charges ?
Four were outlined at the hearings : â€¢ That Assange "" unlawfully coerced "" Miss A by using his body weight to hold her down in a sexual manner .
â€¢ That he "" sexually molested "" Miss A by having sex with her without a condom when it was her "" express wish "" one should be used .
â€¢
That he "" deliberately molested "" Miss A "" in a way designed to violate her sexual integrity "" .
â€¢ That he had sex with a second woman , Miss W , without a condom while she was asleep .
None of those mentions rape , so why is Assange being described as an alleged rapist ?
The accusation in the fourth point , involving Miss W , falls into the category of rape under Swedish law .
An arrest warrant , issued on 20 August , was withdrawn the following day , when one of Sweden 's chief prosecutors , Eva FinnÃ © , said she did not think there was "" reason to suspect that he has committed rape "" .
On 1 September , Marianne Ny , the Swedish director of prosecutions , overturned FinnÃ © 's judgment . ""
Considering information available at present , my judgment is that the classification of the crime is rape , "" said Ny .
What is the Swedish law on rape ?
Three categories of rape are defined , with different sentencing guidelines .
These were described in court on Thursday by Assange 's barrister , Geoffrey Robertson QC , as "" severe rape "" , "" normal rape "" and "" minor rape "" .
While the first carries a maximum 10-year sentence , he said , the last has no minimum sentence .
The accusation relating to Assange and Miss W is held to fall into the third category .
Does this mean it would not be a crime under British law ?
The charge that he had sex with Miss W while she was asleep would be a clear allegation of rape in this country .
Legal experts consider that the third charge would directly correlate to an accusation of indecent assault in Britain ."
2010-12-17,"Documents seen by the Guardian reveal for the first time the full details of the allegations of rape and sexual assault that have led to extradition hearings against the WikiLeaks founder , Julian Assange .
The case against Assange , which has been the subject of intense speculation and dispute in mainstream media and on the internet , is laid out in police material held in Stockholm to which the Guardian received unauthorised access .
Assange , who was released on bail on Thursday , denies the Swedish allegations and has not formally been charged with any offence .
The two Swedish women behind the charges have been accused by his supporters of making malicious complaints or being "" honeytraps "" in a wider conspiracy to discredit him .
Assange 's UK lawyer , Mark Stephens , attributed the allegations to "" dark forces "" , saying : "" The honeytrap has been sprung ...
After what we 've seen so far you can reasonably conclude this is part of a greater plan . ""
The journalist John Pilger dismissed the case as a "" political stunt "" and in an interview with ABC news , Assange said Swedish prosecutors were withholding evidence which suggested he had been "" set up . ""
However , unredacted statements held by prosecutors in Stockholm , along with interviews with some of the central characters , shed fresh light on the hotly disputed sequence of events that has become the centre of a global storm .
Stephens has repeatedly complained that Assange has not been allowed to see the full allegations against him , but it is understood his Swedish defence team have copies of all the documents seen by the Guardian .
He maintains that other potentially exculpatory evidence has not been made available to his team and may not have been seen by the Guardian .
The allegations centre on a 10-day period after Assange flew into Stockholm on Wednesday 11 August .
One of the women , named in court as Miss A , told police that she had arranged Assange 's trip to Sweden , and let him stay in her flat because she was due to be away .
She returned early , on Friday 13 August , after which the pair went for a meal and then returned to her flat .
Her account to police , which Assange disputes , stated that he began stroking her leg as they drank tea , before he pulled off her clothes and snapped a necklace that she was wearing .
According to her statement she "" tried to put on some articles of clothing as it was going too quickly and uncomfortably but Assange ripped them off again "" .
Miss A told police that she did n't want to go any further "" but that it was too late to stop Assange as she had gone along with it so far "" , and so she allowed him to undress her .
According to the statement , Miss A then realised he was trying to have unprotected sex with her .
She told police that she had tried a number of times to reach for a condom but Assange had stopped her by holding her arms and pinning her legs .
The statement records Miss A describing how Assange then released her arms and agreed to use a condom , but she told the police that at some stage Assange had "" done something "" with the condom that resulted in it becoming ripped , and ejaculated without withdrawing .
When he was later interviewed by police in Stockholm , Assange agreed that he had had sex with Miss A but said he did not tear the condom , and that he was not aware that it had been torn .
He told police that he had continued to sleep in Miss A 's bed for the following week and she had never mentioned a torn condom .
On the following morning , Saturday 14 August , Assange spoke at a seminar organised by Miss A. A second woman , Miss W , had contacted Miss A to ask if she could attend .
Both women joined Assange , the co - ordinator of the Swedish WikiLeaks group , whom we will call "" Harold "" , and a few others for lunch .
Assange left the lunch with Miss W. She told the police she and Assange had visited the place where she worked and had then gone to a cinema where they had moved to the back row .
He had kissed her and put his hands inside her clothing , she said .
That evening , Miss A held a party at her flat .
One of her friends , "" Monica "" , later told police that during the party Miss A had told her about the ripped condom and unprotected sex .
Another friend told police that during the evening
Miss A told her she had had "" the worst sex ever "" with Assange : "" Not only had it been the world 's worst screw , it had also been violent . ""
Assange 's supporters point out that , despite her complaints against him , Miss A held a party for him on that evening and continued to allow him to stay in her flat .
On Sunday 15 August , Monica told police , Miss A told her that she thought Assange had torn the condom on purpose .
According to Monica , Miss A said Assange was still staying in her flat but they were not having sex because he had "" exceeded the limits of what she felt she could accept "" and she did not feel safe .
The following day , Miss W phoned Assange and arranged to meet him late in the evening , according to her statement .
The pair went back to her flat in Enkoping , near Stockholm .
Miss W told police that though they started to have sex , Assange had not wanted to wear a condom , and she had moved away because she had not wanted unprotected sex .
Assange had then lost interest , she said , and fallen asleep .
However , during the night , they had both woken up and had sex at least once when "" he agreed unwillingly to use a condom "" .
Early the next morning , Miss W told police , she had gone to buy breakfast before getting back into bed and falling asleep beside Assange .
She had awoken to find him having sex with her , she said , but when she asked whether he was wearing a condom he said no . ""
According to her statement , she said : ' You better not have HIV ' and he answered : ' Of course not , ' "" but "" she could n't be bothered to tell him one more time because she had been going on about the condom all night .
She had never had unprotected sex before . ""
The police record of the interview with Assange in Stockhom deals only with the complaint made by Miss A.
However , Assange and his lawyers have repeatedly stressed that he denies any kind of wrongdoing in relation to Miss W.
In submissions to the Swedish courts , they have argued that Miss W took the initiative in contacting Assange , that on her own account she willingly engaged in sexual activity in a cinema and voluntarily took him to her flat where , she agrees , they had consensual sex .
They say that she never indicated to Assange that she did not want to have sex with him .
They also say that in a text message to a friend , she never suggested she had been raped and claimed only to have been "" half asleep "" .
Police spoke to Miss W 's ex - boyfriend , who told them that in two and a half years they had never had sex without a condom because it was "" unthinkable "" for her .
Miss W told police she went to a chemist to buy a morning - after pill and also went to hospital to be tested for STDs .
Police statements record her contacting Assange to ask him to get a test and his refusing on the grounds that he did not have the time .
On Wednesday 18 August , according to police records , Miss A told Harold and a friend that Assange would not leave her flat and was sleeping in her bed , although she was not having sex with him and he spent most of the night sitting with his computer .
Harold told police he had asked Assange why he was refusing to leave the flat and that Assange had said he was very surprised , because Miss A had not asked him to leave .
Miss A says she spent Wednesday night on a mattress and then moved to a friend 's flat so she did not have to be near him .
She told police that Assange had continued to make sexual advances to her every day after they slept together and on Wednesday 18 August had approached her , naked from the waist down , and rubbed himself against her .
The following day , Harold told police , Miss A called him and for the first time gave him a full account of her complaints about Assange .
Harold told police he regarded her as "" very , very credible "" and he confronted Assange , who said he was completely shocked by the claims and denied all of them .
By Friday 20 August , Miss W had texted Miss A looking for help in finding Assange .
The two women met and compared stories .
Harold has independently told the Guardian Miss A made a series of calls to him asking him to persuade Assange to take an STD test to reassure Miss W , and that Assange refused .
Miss A then warned if Assange did not take a test , Miss W would go to the police .
Assange had rejected this as blackmail , Harold told police .
Assange told police that Miss A spoke to him directly and complained to him that he had torn their condom , something that he regarded as false .
Late that Friday afternoon , Harold told police , Assange agreed to take a test , but the clinics had closed for the weekend .
Miss A phoned Harold to say that she and Miss W had been to the police , who had told them that they could n't simply tell Assange to take a test , that their statements must be passed to the prosecutor .
That night , the story leaked to the Swedish newspaper Expressen .
By Saturday morning , 21 August , journalists were asking Assange for a reaction .
At 9.15am , he tweeted : "" We were warned to expect ' dirty tricks ' .
Now we have the first one . ""
The following day , he tweeted : "" Reminder : US intelligence planned to destroy WikiLeaks as far back as 2008 . ""
The Swedish tabloid Aftonbladet asked if he had had sex with his two accusers .
He said : "" Their identities have been made anonymous so even I have no idea who they are .
We have been warned that the Pentagon , for example , is thinking of deploying dirty tricks to ruin us . ""
Assange 's Swedish lawyers have since suggested that Miss W 's text messages â€ “ which the Guardian has not seen â€ “ show that she was thinking of contacting Expressen and that one of her friends told her she should get money for her story .
However , police statements by the friend offer a more innocent explanation : they say these text messages were exchanged several days after the women had made their complaint .
They followed an inquiry from a foreign newspaper and were meant jokingly , the friend stated to police .
The Guardian understands that the recent Swedish decision to apply for an international arrest warrant followed a decision by Assange to leave Sweden in late September and not return for a scheduled meeting when he was due to be interviewed by the prosecutor .
Assange 's supporters have denied this , but Assange himself told friends in London that he was supposed to return to Stockholm for a police interview during the week beginning 11 October , and that he had decided to stay away .
Prosecution documents seen by the Guardian record that he was due to be interviewed on 14 October .
The co - ordinator of the WikiLeaks group in Stockholm
, who is a close colleague of Assange and who also knows both women , told the Guardian : "" This is a normal police investigation .
Let the police find out what actually happened .
Of course , the enemies of WikiLeaks may try to use this , but it begins with the two women and Julian .
It is not the CIA sending a woman in a short skirt . ""
Assange 's lawyers were asked to respond on his behalf to the allegations in the documents seen by the Guardian on Wednesday evening .
Tonight they said they were still unable obtain a response from Assange .
Assange 's solicitor , Mark Stephens , said : "" The allegations of the complainants are not credible and were dismissed by the senior Stockholm prosecutor as not worthy of further investigation . ""
He said Miss A had sent two Twitter messages that appeared to undermine her account in the police statement .
Assange 's defence team had so far been provided by prosecutors with only incomplete evidence , he said .
"" There are many more text and SMS messages from and to the complainants which have been shown by the assistant prosecutor to the Swedish defence lawyer , Bjorn Hurtig , which suggest motivations of malice and money in going to the police and to Espressen and raise the issue of political motivation behind the presentation of these complaints .
He [ Hurtig ] has been precluded from making notes or copying them .
"" We understand that both complainants admit to having initiated consensual sexual relations with Mr Assange .
They do not complain of any physical injury .
The first complainant did not make a complaint for six days ( in which she hosted the respondent in her flat [ actually her bed ] and spoke in the warmest terms about him to her friends ) until she discovered he had spent the night with the other complainant . ""
The second complainant , too , failed to complain for several days until she found out about the first complainant : she claimed that after several acts of consensual sexual intercourse , she fell half asleep and thinks that he ejaculated without using a condom â€ “ a possibility about which she says they joked afterwards . ""
Both complainants say they did not report him to the police for prosecution but only to require him to have an STD test .
However , his Swedish lawyer has been shown evidence of their text messages which indicate that they were concerned to obtain money by going to a tabloid newspaper and were motivated by other matters including a desire for revenge . """

2010-12-17,"WikiLeaks faces a "" very aggressive "" and secretive investigation by US authorities stung by a perceived loss of face following the release of thousands of secret American diplomatic cables , the organisation 's founder , Julian Assange , said today .
Speaking to reporters outside Ellingham Hall , the Norfolk house at which he is staying on bail following his release from prison , Assange said WikiLeaks faced "" what appears to be an illegal investigation ...
certain people who are alleged to be affiliated to us have been detained , followed around , had their computers seized and so on "" .
He said he believed it was "" 80 % likely "" that the US authorities were seeking to prepare an attempt to have him extradited there to face charges of espionage .
He added that he was reliant on public opinion to rein in "" a superpower that does not appear to be following the rule of law "" .
"" I would say that there is a very aggressive investigation , that a lot of face has been lost by some people , and some people have careers to make by pursuing famous cases , but that is actually something that needs monitoring , "" he said .
He criticised the way Swedish authorities have sought to have him extradited to Sweden to face allegations of sexual assault â€ “ the reason he was held in jail for 10 days .
"" That is something that actually needs monitoring , it needs scrutiny , "" he said .
"" We have seen this with the Swedish prosecutor in representations to the British government here , and the British courts say that it did not need to provide a shred of evidence â€ “ said this three times â€ “ and in fact has provided nothing , not a single shred of evidence in its extradition hearings , in the hearings that ended up putting me in solitary confinement for 10 days . ""
Similarly , in the United States , what appears to be a secret grand jury investigation against me , or our organisation â€ “ not a single comment about what is actually going on .
"" The bulk of WikiLeaks ' efforts were currently devoted to fending off various attacks , including technical assaults on its website , Assange said .
"" Over 85 % of our economic resources are spent dealing with attacks â€ “ dealing with technical attacks , dealing with political attacks , dealing with legal attacks , not doing journalism , "" he said .
"" And that , if you like , is attack upon investigative journalism . ""
Assange said he was worried about the prospect of being sent to the US , adding : "" There have been many calls by senior political figures in the United States , including elected ones in the Senate , for my execution , the kidnapping of my staff , the execution of the young soldier Bradley Manning ... that 's a very , very serious business . ""
The United States has shown recently that its institutions seem to be failing to follow the rule of law .
And dealing with a superpower that does not appear to be following the rule of law is a serious business . ""
US efforts to prosecute Assange appear to rely on connecting him to Manning , the presumed source of the leaked cables .
Assange , an Australian , was at pains today to stress his remove from Manning , referring to him as "" a young man somehow embroiled in our publishing activities "" and saying WikiLeaks did not know who its sources were .
Targeting him personally would not stop the work of WikiLeaks , Assange pledged .
"" People like to present WikiLeaks as me and my backpack .
It is not true .
We are a large organisation .
"" It is resilient .
It is designed to withstand decapitation attacks , and our publication rate actually increased during the time I was in solitary confinement . ""
Assange was held in jail because prosecutors argued that as a non - British national with no permanent ties to the country he was a potential absconder .
To satisfy the judge he had to post Â£200,000 in surety , provided by supporters , and agree to stay at Ellingham Hall , owned by his friend Vaughan Smith .
He must wear a tag , observe a curfew and report to a police station daily ."
2010-12-17,"US officials regard European human rights standards as an "" irritant "" , secret cables show , and have strongly objected to the safeguards which could protect WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange from extradition .
In a confidential cable from the US embassy in Strasbourg , US consul general Vincent Carver criticised the Council of Europe , the most authoritative human - rights body for European countries , for its stance against extraditions to America , as well as secret renditions and prisons used to hold terrorist suspects .
He blamed the council for creating anti - US sentiment and hampering the US war on terror . ""
The Council of Europe ( COE ) likes to portray itself as a bastion of democracy , a promoter of human rights , and the last best hope for defending the rule of law in Europe â€ “ and beyond , "" Carver said .
"" [ But ] it is an organisation with an inferiority complex and , simultaneously , an overambitious agenda . ""
An investigation [ by the Council of Europe ] into renditions and ' secret prisons ' in Europe connected to the US war on terrorism
â€ ¦ created a great deal of controversy and anti - US sentiment in the Council of Europe , "" wrote Carver .
The European court of human rights , the final court of appeal for human rights claims from the UK , whose judgments include the decision to ban deportations to countries which practise torture , is also singled out by the cables .
""
The European court of human rights â€ ¦ has also requested more information on pending British extradition cases to the US where it believes the prisoners might be sentenced in the US to life imprisonment with no possible appeal or automatic judicial review of the life sentence , "" Carver wrote .
Amid growing speculation over whether Assange could face extradition to the US , the cables make clear America 's opposition to any attempts to interfere on human rights grounds , out of concern for prison conditions in the country .
Assange would have the right to appeal against any extradition decision to the European court of human rights if all other legal avenues failed .
His lawyers are already forming human rights arguments to block his extradition within the EU .
The cables also single out high - profile individuals within the Council of Europe for criticism , in particular British secretary general Terry Davis â€ “ now retired â€ “ who is described by the Americans as an "" unpopular lame duck . ""
Terry Davis leaves office this summer , after a five - year term that has been , according to many sources , devoid of vision , "" Carver wrote in 2009 .
"" Davis is known as a micro - manager and will not be missed by many of his staff as well as by many resident ambassadors . ""
Davis provoked the wrath of American officials through his outspoken attacks on secret renditions .
The cables show that US diplomats wanted to visit his successor , current secretary general ThorbjÃ¸rn Jagland , to persuade him to refrain from similar public criticism of the US . ""
Jagland can be expected to criticise the US for the death penalty ; he may , however , be less enthusiastic than the previous secgen , Terry Davis , in publicly criticising renditions , particularly if we review such issues with him soon , "" Carver wrote .
"" In this regard , we highly recommend a visit by a ranking department official ... to review our human rights agenda with the new secretary general in the next several weeks . ""
News that the Americans sought to pressure Jagland , the former prime minister of Norway , to prevent him from criticising secret renditions is likely to anger many in Europe , who see the council 's role in protecting human rights from counter - terrorism policy as crucial .
But the Americans also reserved judgment on Thomas Hammarberg â€
“ the council 's human rights commissioner â€ “ for his criticism of US counter - terrorism policy .
In a separate cable referring to comments made to the US by the Maltese ambassador , Hammarberg is accused of seeing himself as "" God 's gift to the world "" .
The cables also reveal the pettiness of diplomatic exchanges within the Council of Europe .
In one exchange the US noted "" a rather sad exchange "" where Greece complained that Hammarberg had chosen photos of Turkey for his website that portrayed a positive image of the country . ""
The Greek ambassador criticised photos apparently chosen for Hammarberg 's website regarding [ his ] recent official visit to Turkey , "" Carver wrote .
"" The Greek contrasted the ' vacation - like , very positive ' images with those associated with the commissioner 's visit to Greece . """
2010-12-17,"The sight of Julian Assange giving a stream of television interviews from the grounds of an 18th - century country house on the Norfolk - Suffolk borders was , at the very least , a confusion of the cinematic genre the plot has hitherto taken .
It was as if Julian Fellowes had been drafted in to finish a script begun by Stieg Larsson .
The James Bond villain had stumbled into an Edwardian stately home soap opera .
A quick interview with Kay Burley before Carson announces dinner .
It is nearly three weeks since the Guardian and a handful of other news organisations began publishing stories and selected US state department cables based on the 250,000 documents passed to WikiLeaks .
In that time the world has changed in a number of interesting ways .
Millions of people around the world have glimpsed truths about their rulers and governments that had previously been hidden , or merely suspected .
Hackers ' revenge
The cables have revealed wrongdoing , war crimes , corruption , hypocrisy , greed , espionage , double - dealing and the cynical exercise of power on a wondrous scale .
We feel some sympathy with the poster on a Guardian comment thread this week who complained of Wiki - fatigue .
The revelations have flowed at such a rate that it may be months , or even years , before the full impact of what has been disclosed can be fully absorbed .
It is all too easy to feel defeated by the sheer scale of the blurred torrent of information unleashed on the world .
During these three weeks the man who kicked this particular hornet 's nest , Julian Assange , has been arrested , jailed and freed .
Hackers have taken revenge on huge corporations accused of aiding those who would dearly like to choke off the organisation he founded and runs .
The US government has announced a thoroughgoing review of the principles on which it shares the intelligence it collects .
The porous nature of the digital world has been driven home to those in charge of international businesses , banks , armies , governments – and even news and gossip websites .
The implications for large state databases are as yet unknown .
And now Assange is promising to speed up the release of the documents and to scatter them more broadly around the world .
Though the global implications of what has happened are far reaching , there is an inevitable sense in which the story is , indeed , being reduced to a biopic – the life and times of Julian Assange .
In some ways this is a fair representation of events , but it is also limiting , and highly diversionary .
There is no question that Assange has a missionary zeal , technical skill and high intelligence , without which the whole WikiLeaks project would never have gained its present prominence and/or notoriety .
Sex allegations
In last Sunday 's Observer Henry Porter compared him to the 18th - century libertine , John Wilkes .
Wilkes is remembered now as the fearless publisher , editor and politician who fought crucial skirmishes in the journey towards a free press in Britain .
He risked exile , imprisonment and death for the right to publish – including the proceedings of parliament .
But in his own times he was also regarded as a rake .
One biographer has noted how "" the reports of his sexual liaisons – both factual and fictitious – leaked from the private realm to fuel the hectic debate over his qualities as a public man "" .
The parallels with Assange are hard to ignore .
He found himself in Wandsworth prison , not for breaches of the Espionage Act , but because he is wanted for questioning in Sweden over sex offences relating to two women he met earlier this year .
To many ( though doubtless not to the women ) this is a side show to the main event .
To others – including Assange and his legal team ( who have disparagingly referred to the events as a "" honeytrap "" )
– this is a dark conspiracy to frame him , in much the same way that Al Capone was put out of circulation for tax offences .
Unnoticed toil
It is impossible to make judgments about what happened in private circumstances : that will be for the Swedish courts eventually to decide .
But it is wrong that the notion that the allegations are simply a conspiracy or smear should go unexamined .
Having been given access to the relevant Swedish police papers – including the womens ' claims and Assange 's rebuttal – we have felt it right to present a brief summary of the nature of the complaints , together with Assange 's response .
It is unusual for a sex offence case to be presented outside of the judicial process in such a manner , but then it is unheard of for a defendant , his legal team and supporters to so vehemently and publicly attack women at the heart of a rape case .
As with Wilkes , none of this should have any bearing on the wider question of Assange 's role in bringing the cables into the open .
For some years Assange toiled away , largely unnoticed , leaking documents which exposed corruption and wrongdoing by governments and powerful organisations .
It is wholly understandable that the US government should feel both embarrassed and furious at the scale and nature of the material he has been filtering out over the past three weeks .
So far the administration has acted with some restraint rather than lash out in some form of retributive fashion .
Assange 's legal team believe that this may soon change and that he may soon face charges of an unspecified nature to do with obtaining and publishing the cables .
Nor should it be forgotten that Bradley Manning , a 23-year - old private accused of being the original source of the leak , is currently in solitary confinement awaiting a court martial and the prospect of spending the next five decades behind bars .
Painstaking task
We and four other news organisations have worked with WikiLeaks over many months in order carefully and responsibly to publish a small number of cables .
The first amendment of the American constitution is a formidable bulwark of free speech , rightly admired around the world .
As Max Frankel , a former executive editor of the New York Times , recently wrote in these pages , the supreme court defended the publication of the Pentagon Papers in 1971 , even though the lead judge , Justice Potter Stewart , was sure it was not in the public interest .
It would be dismaying if there was now an attempt to prosecute Assange for his role in publishing the documents .
He is clearly in some senses a publisher and journalist as well as a source .
In that respect he deserves protection , not criminal indictment .
The broader plan of WikiLeaks is to move beyond the arrangement with the five newspapers currently involved , and to partner with other news organisations who can highlight stories of particular interest to specific regions .
We hope that , if so , it is done with due care to anything that might jeopardise individuals or sensitive ongoing operations .
The process of editing , contextualising , explanation and redaction is a painstaking one .
It is part of the craft of journalism .
Journalism is also about disclosure .
It is at its best when it is the disclosure of matters of high public interest .
Judge Assange on that score , as much as any other ."
2010-12-17,"This week the Julian Assange case has focused attention once more on the European arrest warrant ( EAW ) .
The request for Assange to be "" surrendered "" – the term used by the EAW – follows in the footsteps of other high - profile cases such as that of Andrew Symeou .
The EAW has therefore proven a popular bête noire that unites foes against what is seen as a European injustice .
However , the EAW does not mock extradition –
it abolishes it and puts in place something entirely new .
The premise is simple : to combat cross - border crime in Europe it should be easier to transfer suspects from one EU state to another .
We should trust in each other 's legal systems and should co - operate accordingly .
Thus the principle of mutual recognition – so successful in building the common market – was adopted for criminal justice co - operation in 1999 at the suggestion of the then UK home secretary , Jack Straw .
However , the necessary trust was absent and proposals such as the EAW languished until 9/11 provided renewed impetus .
Since then , and despite many legal challenges , EAW usage statistics have rocketed .
It is attractive to law enforcement as it abolishes the requirement for 32 offences that the alleged behaviour be recognised as criminal in both states .
While an EAW may only be used if the maximum custodial sentence is at least three years , this is a rather low threshold in an era when popular punitiveness has driven sentences up .
There are other safeguards such as requiring that the accused be allowed to serve any sentence in the surrendering state as well as complex territoriality and double jeopardy rules .
Nevertheless it remains rather easy to have someone transferred from the UK to Greece to face dubious charges .
Waiting for the European court of human rights to identify violations of rights takes far too long .
The idea that the innocent will , eventually , be acquitted is little comfort if the process itself is punishing .
As such , much of the opposition is justified .
The solution though is not to reject the EAW as European interference – a simplified regime also applies in relation to UK - US extradition .
Instead , campaigners should look to the EU to remedy the problem .
To improve co - operation within Europe , the EU needs to play a more active role in promoting human rights and in monitoring compliance in domestic criminal justice systems .
It is the same lack of human rights monitoring that is behind the Saeedi case – an attempt by an asylum seeker to avoid transfer from the UK to Greece as he believes the Greek asylum system will leave him destitute .
Better oversight by the European commission or a greater role for the Fundamental Rights Agency would help allay the fears of those subject to either criminal justice or asylum systems on the continent .
A further potential improvement was proposed this year by a German judge , Joachim Vogel .
In a case before the Stuttgart higher regional court , Vogel used the EU charter of fundamental rights to read a proportionality requirement into the German EAW legislation .
Thus , the judge would only execute an EAW if it did not impose a disproportionate burden on the individual in question or the state from whom the individual was requested .
Such a requirement would put paid to the idea of an EAW for shoplifting but would not help those accused of serious offences such as rape or murder .
Nonetheless , there is hope for reform .
The EU 's Stockholm programme has promised to "" explore the results of the evaluation of the European arrest warrant , and , where appropriate , make proposals to increase efficiency and legal protection for individuals in the process of surrender , by adopting a step - by - step approach to other instruments on mutual recognition "" .
Due process across Europe has recently been improved by the adoption of a directive on the right to interpretation and translation in criminal proceedings .
This is the first action taken to implement a roadmap towards better procedural rights for suspects in the EU .
The EAW would be an acceptable tool if there were good reason to trust other states ' legal systems and if law enforcement officials used it responsibly .
The Stockholm programme promises action in both respects .
Reactionary legal nationalism will not improve the lot of those subject to EU criminal justice .
Whether we like it or not , enforcement co - operation is here to stay .
Campaigners seeking justice should not reject the EAW but should support the proposals for better procedural rights .
With some improvements , the EAW might work to the satisfaction of both prosecutors and defence lawyers .
It 's premature , not perverse .

2010-12-18,"Julian Assange said today his life and the lives of his colleagues at the whistleblowing website WikiLeaks are under threat .
Speaking to reporters outside Ellingham Hall , the Norfolk house at which he is staying following his release on bail from prison , Assange said : "" There is a threat to my life .
There is a threat to my staff .
There are significant risks facing us . ""
Assange is wanted in Sweden , after he was accused of committing sex offences .
He denies the allegations and his lawyers have accused the Swedish authorities of waging a "" vendetta "" .
He was initially remanded in custody but freed from prison on Thursday after a judge granted bail pending a court ruling on extradition to Sweden .
Assange said : "" The case in Sweden is a travesty .
No person should be exposed to that type of investigation and persecution .
"" I have seen a statement from one of the witnesses that she was bamboozled ...
I have heard a rumour that one has withdrawn her statement . ""
Meanwhile , Bank of America has become the latest financial institution to refuse to handle payments for WikiLeaks .
The bank released a statement saying it will no longer process any transactions that it believes are intended for the site , which has released thousands of secret US diplomatic cables . ""
This decision is based upon our reasonable belief that WikiLeaks may be engaged in activities that are , among other things , inconsistent with our internal policies for processing payments , "" the bank said .
The action comes as WikiLeaks says it plans to release information about banks .
Other financial institutions , including MasterCard and PayPal , have also stopped handling payments for the site .
In response to the bank 's announcement , WikiLeaks issued a message on Twitter urging its supporters to leave the bank .
"" We ask that all people who love freedom close out their accounts at Bank of America , "" it said .
"" Our advice is to place your funds somewhere safer , "" the organisation said in another post .
Assange told Forbes magazine last month that the data on banks would show "" unethical practices "" ."
2010-12-18,"As fresh snow erases the traces of Friday 's scrum of camera crews from the elegant lawns of a Georgian mansion in East Anglia , inside Ellingham Hall Julian Assange is considering his next move .
Transformed from cyber celebrity into household name , Assange â€ “ the man who kicked a diplomatic hornet 's nest across the globe
â€ “ is carrying an extraordinary weight of controversy and opprobrium on his narrow shoulders .
Assange faces a whole new debate this weekend over his personal conduct , after the allegations made by two women in Sweden , who accuse him of sexual misconduct and rape , were published in their fullest form in the Guardian .
An increasingly diverse cast of characters are forming unlikely coalitions over the case across ideological divides .
The accounts of the two women have led Stockholm authorities to request the extradition of Assange so that he can be questioned by a prosecutor .
That request led to Assange spending nine days on remand in Wandsworth prison â€ “ a controversial decision by the courts , which was overturned on Tuesday when he was given Â£240,000 bail .
He was released on Thursday after the high court dismissed an appeal from prosecutors against the bail decision .
A condition of his bail was that he reside at Ellingham Hall , the estate of former British Army officer and journalist Vaughan Smith , who offered bed and board as "" an act of principle "" .
Dismissed by his supporters as a smear campaign , the case against Assange now threatens to move from a sideshow to overwhelm the main act â€ “ the work he has done in his public life as editor of WikiLeaks .
In part , Assange , 39 , who has become a figurehead for whistleblowers , can blame this on supporters who have pressed accolades on the man rather than the cause , and who range from left wing historians , feminists and human rights campaigners to misogynist right wing bloggers and a porn baron .
Today Larry Flynt , the founder of American sex magazine Hustler , announced that he would give $ 50,000 ( Â£32,000 ) to the Assange defence fund , calling him a "" hero "" who deserved a "" ticker - tape parade "" .
Flynt 's support was not for WikiLeaks itself , but because he thought the rape charges a nonsense .
Assange has been called "" the new Jason Bourne "" by Jemima Khan , the "" Ned Kelly of the Cyber Age "" by members of the press in his native Australia and a libertine 007 by those who note his fondness for martinis .
On the other side , Republican US senators have lined up behind the Democrat secretary of state Hillary Clinton to condemn him .
Sarah Palin claims that he is "" an anti - American operative with blood on his hands "" that America should pursue "" with the same urgency we pursue al - Qaida and Taliban leaders . ""
George Packer of the New Yorker magazine , called Assange "" megalomaniacal "" and Vanity Fair 's Christopher Hitchens called him "" a middle man and peddler who resents the civilisation that nurtured him "" .
There have been disturbing calls from both Republicans and Democrats for him to be assassinated .
Smith agreed there was a "" risk "" of the allegations against Assange overshadowing WikiLeaks ' revelations . ""
When a friend of mine looks me in the eye and tells me they are not guilty
I tend to believe them , "" he said .
"" One has to remember that conviction rates are amazingly low , and I suppose if one had to stand back away from this â€ “
and I say this without trying to diminish claims of any form of crime of this nature â€ “
but if one takes enough distance one might observe that perhaps it is something of a distraction , "" he told the Observer . ""
When , as I believe , he is determined to be innocent one might look on this and ask : was this in the interests of it all ?
"" It is now nearly three weeks since Assange and his WikiLeaks team began disseminating secret US state department cables to internet users and newspaper readers around the world , who were in turns fascinated and appalled .
The cables have revealed wrong - doing , international double - dealing , espionage , plots , bitchiness , bad behaviour and scandal in the political , military and business worlds .
Within a torrent of 250,000 documents was information on how world leaders lied and connived on everything from the direction of the conflict in Afghanistan to spying at the UN and Saudi Arabia 's push to have the US bomb Iran .
The WikiLeaks campaign of reveal and be damned has splintered opinion on both left and right .
The US government was furious , and is expected to take some kind of legal action .
Already pressure may have been exerted as large financial institutions including PayPal , MasterCard and Visa â€ “ and today the Bank of America â€ “ have refused to do business with WikiLeaks , cutting it from donors .
But after Assange 's period in jail last week , the focus was switching .
In today 's Guardian editorial , the newspaper explained why it had chosen to publish the sexual misconduct allegations in detail : "" It is unusual for a sex - offence case to be presented outside of the judicial process in such a manner , but then it is unheard of for a defendant , his legal team and supporters to so vehemently and publicly attack women at the heart of a rape case . ""
The paper is reflecting a growing discomfort among many , in both camps , at the widespread vilification â€ “ and naming â€ “ of the two alleged victims on websites and blogs , and also of the kind of language being used by people including Assange 's own lawyer Mark Stephens who referred to the allegation as a "" honeytrap "" .
"" I have never heard the like .
Legal representatives do not and should not stand on the steps outside a court of law and make such comments about their clients , it is neither right nor fitting , "" said one outraged barrister .
"" It is certainly in my view deeply unprofessional .
"" It 's understood that several high- profile Assange supporters have been shown what they understand to be translations of texts and emails to help persuade them Assange is not guilty of rape .
Human rights campaigner
Bianca Jagger has directed her Twitter followers to a blog suggesting that one of the women had links to an anti - Castro Cuban group .
She insisted to the Observer that she had been in court and taken great care over her analysis of the charges , and believed in Assange 's innocence .
Michael Moore , the US film - maker , has suggested Sweden does not always pursue rape allegations .
He has offered money towards the bail surety .
Others have been suggesting that Assange has fallen foul to a pact between jealous female groupies .
A range of deeply misogynistic blog posts have blamed "" feminists "" , despite insistence from people close to Assange that there is no conspiracy .
A new campaign called "" talkaboutit "" has been started online by Swedish women to defend the accusers from the extraordinary verbal attacks being made after Johanna Koljonen , of the Swedish thinktank Lacrimosa , wrote passionately this week in favour of justice being seen to take its course .
But many young activists in the UK see a conspiracy with the power of the US at its heart .
Jim Cranshaw , 29 , a campaigner with the UK Uncuts movement said that a commonly held view among young activists was that the allegations against Assange amounted to a witchhunt by the US . ""
The majority of my peers are deeply sceptical about the whole process .
He is wanted by the most powerful country in the world and the timing of the allegations , the extradition attempts , it all seems too convenient .
"" The CIA has used sex offence allegations in the past because it makes people dislike you even if you win the case , as with Castro .
However there is a view that if a woman makes allegations like these then they have to be taken seriously .
"" There seems to be a lot of political pressure to get him to America and to possibly kill him . ""
It is a view shared by members of Anonymous , a group of hackers directing cyber attacks against companies that have withdrawn their support for WikiLeaks .
Most have chosen to ignore the content of the sexual allegations , believing that the claims are part of a conspiracy .
But a colleague of Assange in Stockholm , who knows both women , said that Sweden was pursuing a "" normal police investigation "" and said that while WikiLeaks ' enemies may exploit the case , "" it 's not the CIA sending a woman in a short skirt "" .
UK author Joan Smith told the Observer that there was a disturbing "" Polanski "" effect among people who did n't know Assange .
"" It 's like Julian and the WikiLeaks â€ “ a new boy band , that 's turned into a phenomenon of celebrity .
But people who assert the innocence of a man they have never met are on dangerous ground .
It 's that rush to judgement which is so extraordinary . ""
Sexual manners and sexual conduct come in for careful consideration in Sweden and on the whole I rather approve . ""
Others showed similar reservations .
WikiLeaks supporter , the historian Tariq Ali , said that it was possible to separate Assange the man and the allegations from the cables . ""
WikiLeaks is an organisation and he [ Julian ] is one of them .
So I am very glad he is out and all that , but WikiLeaks would go on even without him and that is important to stress . ""
Investigative journalist John Pilger believes it is necessary to defend Assange . ""
He is an innocent man until proven otherwise , "" he said .
"" It is clear that in Sweden the presumption of innocence has been publicly torn up by those whose duty was to safeguard it .
This has encouraged a vicious campaign in the US , including incitement to murder Assange , and secret planning to stitch him up as some sort of terrorist . ""
Such views are being rejected in Sweden , where a counter campaign is now building among those who do n't see the US hand in these allegations .
Claes BorgstrÃ¶m , the lawyer for the two women , is calling on Assange to return to answer the allegations .
Now it is for a fresh prosecutor , Marianne Ny , a specialist in sex crime , to decide if the evidence would stand in court , and for that she wants to question Assange .
A Swedish senior civil servant , who asked not to be named , dismissed allegations of a plot and insisted that Swedes are capable of seeing the advantages of WikiLeaks , in terms of debate about freedom of expression , while conceding that Assange may have unsavoury morals between the sheets .
But like many , he conceded that the case has been handled clumsily . ""
The fact that one prosecutor dismissed the charges against Assange and another picked them up afterwards , makes the case look fishy .
The prosecuting authorities should have acted more expeditiously and speedily . ''

2010-12-19,"The US vice - president , Joe Biden , today likened the WikiLeaks founder , Julian Assange , to a "" hi - tech terrorist "" , the strongest criticism yet from the Obama administration .
Biden claimed that by leaking diplomatic cables Assange had put lives at risk and made it more difficult for the US to conduct its business around the world .
His description of Assange shows a level of irritation that contrasts with more sanguine comments from other senior figures in the White House , who said the leak had not done serious damage .
Interviewed on NBC 's Meet the Press , Biden was asked if the administration could prevent further leaks , as Assange warned last week .
"" We are looking at that right now .
The justice department is taking a look at that , "" Biden said , without elaborating .
The justice department is struggling to find legislation with which to prosecute Assange .
Asked if what Assange had done was criminal , Biden seemed to suggest it would be considered criminal if it could be established that the WikiLeaks founder had encouraged or helped Bradley Manning , the US intelligence analyst suspected of being behind the leak .
Biden claimed this was different from a journalist receiving leaked material . "" If he conspired to get these classified documents with a member of the US military that is fundamentally different than if someone drops on your lap
â€
¦ you are a press person , here is classified material .
"" Asked if he saw Assange as closer to a hi - tech terrorist than the whistleblower who released the Pentagon papers in the 1970s , which disclosed the lie on which US involvement in Vietnam was based , Biden replied : "" I would argue it is closer to being a hi - tech terrorist than the Pentagon papers .
But , look , this guy has done things that have damaged and put in jeopardy the lives and occupations of people in other parts of the world . ""
He 's made it more difficult for us to conduct our business with our allies and our friends .
For example , in my meetings â€ “
you know I meet with most of these world leaders
â€ “ there is a desire now to meet with me alone , rather than have staff in the room .
It makes things more cumbersome â€ “ so it has done damage . ""
The interview , though broadcast yesterday , was conducted on Friday .
In an interview the previous day , he had been more neutral about WikiLeaks , saying : "" I do n't think there 's any substantive damage . ""
The US secretary of state , Hillary Clinton , led criticism of the WikiLeaks revelations at the end of November when she accused the website of mounting an "" attack "" on the world ."
2010-12-19,""" Was it worth it ? ""
That was what Julian Assange was asked , through his mother , by an Australian TV channel last week as he sat in Wandsworth jail .
It was , perhaps , a not unexpected question for someone who had found himself in solitary confinement , facing extradition to Sweden and the United States and death threats from conservative American politicians .
So do people whose revelations about secret government activities reverberate around the world , and who find themselves pursued and vilified as a result , live to regret their actions ?
More than 30 years ago Philip Agee , then a 41-year - old former CIA officer living in Cambridge , was told that he was to be deported from Britain as a threat to the security of the state .
He had published a damaging exposÃ © of the CIA , Inside the Company , and had made clear his intent to reveal the identities of CIA agents .
In Britain he worked with publications such as Time Out to name the agents , leading to many of them being sent back to Washington , their cover blown .
The US government vowed vengeance .
Agee wept on the ferry that took him from Britain after his deportation in 1977 , but remained unrepentant right up to his death in 2008 .
He had been motivated initially by his horror at the backing given by the CIA and US government to Latin American military dictatorships .
Reflecting years later on what he had done and the damage it has caused to him and his young family , Agee told me : "" There was a price to pay .
It disrupted the education of my children and I do n't think it was a happy period for themâ€‰ ...
â€‰But it made me a stronger person in many ways , and it ensured I would never lose interest or go back in the other direction politically .
The more they did these dirty things , the more they made me realise what I was doing was important . ""
Under the US Freedom of Information Act , Agee was able to see the scope of the operation mounted against him by an unforgiving CIA which accused him through the media of being a boozer and a womaniser .
"" They admitted to having 18,000 pages on me .
I figured out there were 120 pages a day for seven or eight years . ""
He was , like WikiLeaks , accused of endangering lives .
The name of Richard Welch , the CIA station chief in Athens assassinated in 1975 , was often invoked .
He was named , however , not by Agee but in other publications . ""
George Bush 's father came in as CIA director in the month after the assassination and he intensified the campaign , spreading the lie that I was the cause of the assassination . ""
Agee 's fellow American , Daniel Ellsberg , also faced prison and death threats after his leaking in 1971 of 7,000 pages of Pentagon documents , which is credited by many with helping to end the Vietnam war . ""
Let 's get the son of a bitch into jail , "" President Nixon was recorded as saying to his henchmen in what sounded like a Mafia confab .
"" We 've got to get him , "" Henry Kissinger , then secretary of state , replies .
"" Do n't worry about his trial , "" says Nixon .
"" Try him in the press . ""
Ellsberg , too , remains unbowed and is active today on behalf of other whistleblowers and leakers .
In the preface to his book , Secrets : a Memoir of Vietnam and the Pentagon Papers , he writes : "" Telling the truth , revealing wrongly kept secrets , can have a surprisingly strong unforeseeable power to help end a wrong and save lives . ""
Not everyone who decides to leak manages to escape the harsher penalties .
Mordechai Vanunu , the technician who leaked details of the Israeli nuclear weapons programme to the Sunday Times in 1986 , was pursued to England , lured to Italy by a female Mossad agent , kidnapped , and jailed for 18 years , and spent 11 in solitary confinement .
He also remained convinced that he had done the right thing .
If he has regrets , it is about the way he chose to leak the story .
"" It was a mistake to go with one newspaper , but I did n't have any experience with the media , "" he said in an interview in Jerusalem after his release ; significantly , WikiLeaks worked with five separate publications in five different countries .
"" My target was to bring information to the world , so the best way would have been a press conference or to send it to 20 newspapers so that it would not be controlled by anyone .
Now things have changed and the internet has made it much easier for information to be passed on . ""
Vanunu had plenty of opportunities to decide whether it was all worth it .
"" There was a lot of pressure , a lot of attempts at brainwashing , "" he said .
"" I decided from the beginning that they could have my body in prison but my spirit , mind , brain , I would keep free , under my control ; that would be my way out . """
2010-12-19,"A little adulation with your turkey , sir ?
But let 's not spend too long wondering whether Julian Assange is anyone 's idea of a perfect Christmas house guest , for there are other nominated heroes in the great WikiLeaking saga .
It 's a shame that "" more medals are n't being pinned on the chest "" of those who actually obtained the data , David Leigh of the Guardian told a Times reporter .
And it 's a shame , too , that Leigh himself is n't getting his fair share of praise either .
Leigh is investigations editor of the Guardian , professor of reporting at City University and , for well over 30 years , one of Britain 's most resourceful turners - over of greasy stones .
He can also take primary credit for the orchestration and delivery of the US embassy papers these past three weeks – a monumental task of good - tempered organisation , explanation and sheer news nous ( as anyone who has tried to wander through the winding cyber corridors of WikiLeaks can attest ) .
Do you get awards for turning raw data into brilliant storytelling ?
Tony Gallagher and the Telegraph team did over MPs ' expenses .
Maybe Leigh wo n't get the same treatment – but then , as Assange is prone to say at length , there ai n't no justice ."
2010-12-19,"It could be a quality lost on suspicious interviewers , or one he has quite recently acquired , but in all the profiles I have read of the extraordinary Julian Assange , none has begun to convey the man 's dazzling effect on his admirers , male as well as female .

But his chief British benefactor , the former army officer Vaughan Smith , has shown that the Assange effect goes way beyond standard manipulation of the groupie - reflex .

Julian is hungry , as he had no dinner last night . ""
A similar , doting concern for Assange 's physical wellbeing pervaded every pre - release bulletin from his lawyer , Mark Stephens , with his repeated emphasis on the privations of his client in the "" Orwellian "" and "" Victorian "" conditions in which , it was discovered , Oscar Wilde had previously been incarcerated , though without the benefit of Victorian TV .
Ghastly as Wandsworth jail must be , an earlier Assange myth had depicted someone more along the lines of Jason Bourne than Lady Jane Grey , one perhaps better prepared than most prisoners for discomfort and isolation .
All his life , it is said , Assange rejected domesticity , catnapped on floors and mattresses , if not up trees , shunned routine and regular meals .
The New York Times interviewer John F Burns recently found him moving , excitingly , "" like a hunted man "" , using false names and encrypted phones .
This hard , lonesome Assange told Burns : "" When it comes to the point where you occasionally look forward to being in prison on the basis that you might be able to spend a day reading a book , the realisation dawns that perhaps the situation has become a little more stressful than you would like . ""
That , however , was written in October , before both the latest tranche of revelations and the Swedish extradition order relating to alleged sexual offences against two women .
Conspiracy theorists are not alone in thinking this coincidence reason enough to forget any serious consideration of the sex allegations .
"" The honeytrap has been sprung , "" Stephens said .
"" Dark forces are at work .
After what we 've seen so far you can reasonably conclude this is part of a greater plan . ""
Thus far , if he is right , it is hard to see the plan as an unqualified success for the dark forces .
Unless , always a possibility , it was always part of the plan for Assange to mesmerise a host of brilliant , clever new supporters , plus John Pilger , to experience martyrdom in the same cell as Oscar Wilde , and now to move his operation into WikiLeaks 's answer to Downton Abbey .
Was it the plan , back at dark forces HQ , that Assange 's name should now be so potent , among legions of influential , normally judicious supporters , as to place him above the law ?
To listen to them , the creation of WikiLeaks and an allegation of sexual impropriety are two utterly irreconcilable concepts : there is no way the person who did the former could have to answer for the latter .
Even if the dark forces are not responsible , their hero could never have done the things the women say he did .
Negligible though they were .
As a captivated Tariq Ali said last week : "" The charges are wishy - washy , even in Sweden . ""
In court , Assange 's liberal barrister , Geoffrey Robertson , considered the offences so minor he would probably get off anyway .
On Thursday , however , Assange said he did not know what the allegations are .
Classic Sweden .
In the most unexpected places , any interest in establishing the truth through the Swedish legal process , as opposed to claim and counter - claim in the media , instantly translates as disloyalty to Assange , the world 's greatest champion of the truth .
Any sympathy for the women he slept with , as their frailties are indefinitely , globally exposed , will earn you none from , say , John Pilger , slamming the "" false tribunes of feminism "" he blames for trusting the "" chaotic , incompetent and contradictory accusations against Assange "" .
But some feminist supporters have similar problems with his accusers .
Naomi Wolf , the American intellectual , said they are "" using feminist - inspired rhetoric and law to assuage what appears to be personal injured feelings "" .
Right , stick to your own language , blondie .
In Britain , Assange 's lawyer , Jennifer Robinson , also had her doubts about those false tribune favourites .
"" We are seeing increasingly on the internet research into the backgrounds of both women that raises real questions about their credibility and the credibility of their claims , "" she told one broadcaster .
An interesting view , in the week that Keir Starmer declared , of rape investigations , that "" myths and stereotypes have no place in the criminal justice system "" .
On the internet , of course , the women can be joyfully named , pictured and pilloried , assessed and obscenely condemned for everything from their feminism to loose morals , clothing and idle , pre - WikiLeaks blogs .
Jemima Khan , an Assangist , has tweeted a personal favourite : one accuser , months before meeting Assange , composed a document called "" 7 steps to Legal Revenge "" .
The Daily Mail and now the Guardian have had much to add about the women 's story , of separate sexual encounters with Assange , followed by accusations of his alleged impropriety , followed by formal charges , followed by a withdrawal of those charges and , in yet another reversal , the restoration of the women 's case by the lawyer Claes Borgström .
With the women 's statements now out there in full , everyone , including Mr Assange , can check out the way the honeytrap combo has used feminist - inspired rhetoric – you bet without asking – to get round the fact that one of them actually went out in a bright pink cashmere jersey and now expects her moment in court .
Only in Sweden .
Of course , if Julian Assange accepts his extradition , travels to this liberal hell - hole and answers the relevant questions , something approaching the facts might be established .
Why does n't he just do it ?
He could clear his name .
But any outcome would , surely , be better for his reputation than celebrity - funded evasion .
To keep delaying the moment of truth , for this champion of fearless disclosure and total openness , could soon begin to look pretty dishonest , as well as inconsistent .
If and when the Americans come after Assange , there should be any number of admirers who want to contribute to his survival , in particular , one hopes , all the media organisations that have gained so much from his years of hardship and skulking .
Is it too much , until then , to act like a decent person ?

With the women 's statements now out there in full , everyone , including Mr Assange , can check out the way the honeytrap combo has used feminist - inspired rhetoric – you bet without asking – to get round the fact that one of them actually went out in a bright pink cashmere jersey and now expects her moment in court .
Only in Sweden .
Of course , if Julian Assange accepts his extradition , travels to this liberal hell - hole and answers the relevant questions , something approaching the facts might be established .
Why does n't he just do it ?
He could clear his name .
But any outcome would , surely , be better for his reputation than celebrity - funded evasion .
To keep delaying the moment of truth , for this champion of fearless disclosure and total openness , could soon begin to look pretty dishonest , as well as inconsistent .
If and when the Americans come after Assange , there should be any number of admirers who want to contribute to his survival , in particular , one hopes , all the media organisations that have gained so much from his years of hardship and skulking .
Is it too much , until then , to act like a decent person ?
Like Tariq says , it 's only Sweden ."
2010-12-19,"Step aside , Julian Assange –
there 's a new cause celebre in the world of censorship – and no top - secret cables were involved .
Blu , an Italian street artist , was recently invited by MOCA , the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles , to contribute a mural to its forthcoming gritty - sounding show Art of the Streets .
The mural , depicting serried ranks of coffins draped not with the Stars and Stripes but with the dollar bill , was duly created in early December .
At first , all was well .
Blu even stayed at the home of MOCA director Jeffrey Deitch .
When Deitch went off to attend to the arduous business of the Miami Art Fair , Blu got down to the messy process of painting .
Luckily , pictures were taken as he picked away at the detail of the coffins , and they soon surfaced on a variety of street art blogs .
Then Deitch came back from Miami and ordered Blu 's work - in - progress erased , whitewashed , obliterated .
"" I did n't feel so motivated to spend more time on it once I learned that it was going to disappear the day after , "" Blu wrote on his blog .
"" I am stupid but not a masochist . "" Deitch was unabashed .
"" I have supported protest art more than just about any other mainstream gallery in the country , "" he told the LA Times . ""
But as a steward of a public institution , I have to balance a different set of priorities – standing up for artists and also considering the sensitivities of the community .
"" The gallery , it has been noted , is in the same neighbourhood as a veterans ' hospital and a war memorial to Japanese - American soldiers .
MOCA 's current exhibition , a showing of the 146 grandees of its collection , is titled the Artists ' Museum .
It 's a good title , hitting all the cultural buttons , a museum of the artists , by the artists , for the artists .
But Blu , for one , does not share Deitch 's vision of MOCA as the Artists ' Museum .
"" It is censorship that almost turned into self - censorship when they asked me to openly agree with their decision to erase the wall , "" he says .
"" In the Soviet Union they were calling it ' self - criticism ' .
Deitch invited me to paint another mural over the one he erased , and I will not do that . """
2010-12-20,"There seems to be an assumption that any US attempt to extradite Julian Assange will have to take place after Sweden 's European arrest warrant has been disposed of ( The US embassy cables , 18 December ) .
I 'm not so sure .
Hidden away in part 5 of the UK 's Extradition Act is section 179 .
This appears to deal with the situation where an EAW is in process and an extradition request is received from a category 2 country , such as the US .
When this happens , it is the home secretary who decides which goes first .
That decision is based , in part , on four criteria , one of which is the relative seriousness of the offences concerned .
Does n't this imply that the home secretary , after weighing a request to an interview by the Swedish police against a US grand jury indictment for espionage , could order a halt to the EAW and let the US extradition request go ahead first ?

Some people assert that diplomatic negotiating is impossible without the secrecy that is breached by WikiLeaks .
Yet the opposite is the truth .
Negotiations are made difficult by mismatches of knowledge between parties , which force them to gamble and bluff in the face of uncertainties .
A key factor in the causation of wars is discrepancies of information .
For instance , Stalin 's ignorance of Hitler 's intentions in 1941 and Hitler 's ignorance of the defensive capabilities of the USSR led to war on the eastern front .
If we 'd had WikiLeaks - type unsecrecy back then , that biggest conflict in history might not have happened .
Robin Clarke Birmingham • Comparison has been made between WikiLeaks and the Pentagon papers during the Vietnam war .
But one can go much further back .
In 1645 , after King Charles
I 's defeat at the battle of Naseby in the English civil war , his letters were captured by the parliamentary army and published .
The 17th - century royal response to these disclosures was similar to the denunciations of WikiLeaks .
First , it was said nothing really new of any importance was revealed .
Second , that they were an unwarranted intrusion into the privacy of the king .
This defence was ineffective , as the correspondence revealed the king 's public posture of agreeing to peace negotiations with parliament was a sham , because he was actively seeking allies abroad to carry on the fight for an absolute monarchy .
Today governments talk of the progress in Afghanistan and publicly voice many other opinions that are far from how they think and act .
As in 1645 , the issue is not one of wrongful disclosure , but of government dishonesty towards the public .

How WikiLeaks uses specialsied software to hide the origins and destinations of data ."
2010-12-21,"Julian Assange is understood to have sold his memoirs , to publishers Canongate in the UK and Knopf in the US .
The news leaked appropriately enough via a tweet from Spanish publisher Random House Mondadori , with head of the literary division Claudio Lopez telling the world that "" Manuscrito listo en marzo "" â€ ”
the manuscript will be ready in March .
Online money and finance website DailyFinance said Canongate publisher Jamie Byng had confirmed the news to the site by email , telling them that the UK publisher was handling all the translation rights .
Literary agency Peters , Fraser and Dunlop declined to comment on reports that agent Caroline Michel had sealed the English language deals for the WikiLeaks founder 's book .
Assange is currently on bail in England , and defending himself against the Swedish authorities ' demands that he return to the country to face questioning over allegations of sexual assault .
Assange 's memoir would come hard on the heels of a volume from his former second - in - command Daniel Domscheit - Berg , whose Inside Wikileaks :
My Time at the World 's Most Dangerous Website is set to tell the inside story of the whistle - blowing site in the new year .
The book is due out from German publisher Econ Verlag on 27 January .
Contacted by the Guardian this morning , Canongate refused to "" confirm or deny "" the story ."
2010-12-21,"Julian Assange today defended his decision not to return to Sweden for questioning over allegations of sexual assault , saying he did not need to be "" at the beck and call of people making allegations "" .
The WikiLeaks founder said he was not obliged to return to the country , adding that there were "" serious problems "" with the prosecution against him .
In a separate interview with the Times , Assange claimed documents had been leaked to the Guardian by the Swedish authorities in an attempt to "" undermine "" his bail application hearing last week .
Speaking from the mansion in East Anglia where he is staying under the terms of his bail , he told BBC Radio 4 's Today programme : "" I do n't need to go back to Sweden .
The law says I also have certain rights , and these rights mean that I do not need to speak to random prosecutors around the world who simply want to have a chat , and wo n't do it in any other standard way . ""
Assange said he had waited in Sweden for five weeks to be interviewed by police â€ “ "" so I can put my side of the case forward
"" â€ “ but the interview did not happen .
He added that he had been told there was no reason for him to remain in the country .
In a separate interview with the Times , Assange said documents had been leaked to the Guardian by the Swedish authorities in an attempt to "" undermine "" his bail application hearing last week .
However , the documents were not leaked to the Guardian by Swedish authorities , and details from the documents to which Assange referred were only published after the 16 December hearing .
Asked by the BBC 's John Humphrys why he would not return to Sweden to deal with the allegations , Assange said : "" If they want to charge me , they can charge me .
They have decided not to charge me . ""
He added : "" They have asked , as part of their application , that if I go to Sweden and am arrested , I am to be held incommunicado . ""
They have asked that my Swedish lawyer be gagged from talking to the public . ""
Asked by Humphrys : "" Are you a sexual predator ? ""
Assange said it was a "" ridiculous "" suggestion , adding : "" Of course not "" .
He was then asked how many women he had slept with .
He refused to answer , saying : "" A gentleman does n't count . ""
Discussing the effect WikiLeaks had brought through its publications , Assange said the organisation had "" changed governance
â€ “ we have certainly changed many political figures within governments "" .
Assange was granted bail on 14 December , but remained in jail for a further two days after the Swedish authorities challenged the decision .
The Times reportedthat Assange was unhappy with the Guardian for "" selectively publishing "" sections of the documents .
The Guardian was allowed access to documents relating to the case â€ “ including interviews with some of the central characters â€ “ but none of these were in fact leaked for such a purpose .
It is understood Assange 's defence team had seen copies of everything seen by the Guardian .
Assange 's final bail hearing was on Thursday 16 December .
The Guardian published an article which included some details from the police statementsonline at 9.30pm on Friday 17 December , and in the Guardian newspaper on Saturday 18 December .
â€¢
This article was amended on 23 December 2010 .
A quote in the original referred to "" changed governments "" .
This was taken from a transcript on the BBC website which has subsequently been revised ."
2010-12-21,"What with Julian Assange explaining his complex self on Radio 4 's Today programme and Vince Cable being turned over by the Daily Telegraph in his own constituency surgery , it 's a challenging day for media ethics and our ideas about privacy , let alone trust .
Cable first .
As you must have heard by now the business secretary was interviewed without realising it by undercover reporters posing as mums worried about benefit cuts .
The result : today 's "" I could bring down the government "" headline here .
The Guardian 's version , what the trade calls a "" catch up "" , is here .
Unsurprisingly , Dr Cable told the Telegraph that negotiations can be difficult within the coalition but that everyone knows he has a "" nuclear option "" to resign .
Do n't quote me outside , he told the Twickenham mums .
Were the mums unshaven , I asked myself , or sporting moustaches ?
Did n't Vince notice anything odd ?
As with WikiLeaks there 's not really much very surprising about this .
Much of the value lies in the titillation provided by clandestine methods and frank language .
But we all know Cable – the cabinet 's Hamlet ,
I call him – has been fighting semi - public battles over bank bonuses and break - ups , over tuition fees and much else .
And – as with the US diplomatic cables ( no relation ) we have been reading courtesy of Mr Assange –
it 's to Cable 's credit that he says nothing in his supposedly private conversation that is different from what he says in public .
Good .
It would only have been a story if he 'd said something dishonest like : "" The banks have promised me a free supply of call girls if I go easy on the bonus issue .
Great , is n't it ? ""
But what about the Telegraph 's own behaviour ?
We 'll come to that .
There 's an old Fleet Street adage that dog does n't eat dog , an adage widely if selectively ignored .
Thus the Daily Mail turned over Ed Miliband 's new communications chief , Tom Baldwin , in spectacular fashion on Saturday .
As regular readers know , the Guardian has gone after David Cameron 's man , Andy Coulson , over his role – denied – in systematic interception of private telephony traffic by reporters at the News of the World , and the curious role of Scotland Yard .
Perhaps the Guardian should treat both men the same , some Tory chums suggest by way of a tease .
Fair point .
Meanwhile , today 's Times has come after the Guardian , interviewing Assange in his country retreat , under a paywall headline "" WikiWars : Assange turns on friends , foes and lovers . ""
Having initially condemned the Guardian for publishing the early Wiki leaks , and then itself publishing the one about top US infrastructure targets ( the Guardian decided there was no public interest and some risk to the targets in doing so ) , the Times has now gone back on the attack .
That 's what papers do , especially when times are hard : they bite other dogs .
Assange is particularly angry with Nick Davies 's carefully balanced background article in Saturday 's Guardian setting out the sexual allegations made in Sweden against the WikiLeaks capo , though it was published only after he obtained bail .
There has been a falling - out , it seems .
I mention all this to provide context .
"" The Telegraph has a scoop , so do n't whinge , Mike "" is one way of looking at it .
Freedom of the press justifies entrapment of a cabinet minister , incidentally a Lib Dem cabinet minister , not a Tory .
They do n't like Cable , went after him over his ( tiny ) expense claims .
But does it justify the sting ?
Cable gives interviews to whomever he pleases – or not .
He is a pretty open chap , too open perhaps , too prone to wear his big heart on his sleeve .
In any case he is regularly accountable in public , in parliament and to his Twickenham constituents .
That 's what he thought he was being when talking to the two wired reporters .
As a local MP he has obligations of confidentiality to constituents – MPs take this very seriously
and so they should .
People can lose their jobs , homes ( landlords can be nasty ) , even children if private conversations get leaked .
In other words , they – and he – are entitled to some privacy .
It was a principle that Assange repeatedly raised , unembarrassed , when asked about his sexual conduct by the BBC 's John Humphrys this morning .
Talking about such matters "" is not what a gentleman does "" , he explained , deadpan .
My feeling is that there was no public interest justification for the Telegraph sting .
It 's not as if the tape proved that Vince likes cocaine or underage rent boys , both illegal activities and thus legitimate targets of press inquiry – as was the News of the World 's Pakistani match - fixing probe , but not its hacking into royal or celeb gossip .
Times are hard in our business .
But the Telegraph did this only last month to Lord Young , who made some unguarded remarks about the unemployed in what he must have thought was a private lunch at an expensive West End restaurant .
The tape ended up on the paper 's website and he had to resign as a Cameron adviser , silly man .
There are rumours there are more such stings up the Telegraph 's pinstriped sleeves .
Vince will not walk the plank .
He might well be within his rights to find a means to sue or report the paper for breach of parliamentary privilege – which the sting surely was in interfering with his duties as Twickenham 's MP .
But politicians have long been cowed and rarely take such steps unless the case is watertight and then some .
Cowed by whom ?
By the media usually .
Was it not the Telegraph that obtained
( bought ? )
the discs containing all those details of MPs ' expenses and ran them for weeks ?
It was and there was a defendable public interest in doing so , though it was much exaggerated and exploited by us all .
Most MPs were OK – are OK .
All MPs are accountable .
Who would sue nowadays ?
Why , people like the reclusive Barclay twins , Dave and Fred , tax - exiles who own the Daily Telegraph and ferociously defend their own privacy on their absurd "" castle "" at Brecqhou in the Channel Islands .
Their cautious Wikipedia entry gives barely anything about their attempts to use the courts , French courts as well as ours , including suing the Times .
Google it yourself .
Would the paper try this on with a City tycoon , I wonder ?
Somehow I doubt it .
They have hot lawyers .
You may know my line : no one 's perfect ; let 's try to be more tolerant and judge others as we would hope to be judged .
In that spirit – reinforced by Christmas cheer –
I urge you to listen to the BBC 's Assange interview , broadcast in two parts , all of which ( I think )
you can find here .
That is what I 'd call a scoop , a tribute to Humphrys , whom I sometimes criticise for excessive aggression but who played this assignment with probing skills .
As you 'd expect Assange sounds complicated , he makes good points and some , political and personal , that made me flinch .
To me he comes across as clever , solitary , geeky , convinced of his own virtue who says things like "" everyone would like to be a messiah figure without dying "" and believes he is changing the world for the better .
Listen and form your own festive judgment .
1.30pm update :
Telegraph colleagues assure me that the terms of Lord Young 's interview were agreed with him and there was no element of subterfuge involved ."
2010-12-22,"Truly , I would sooner doubt the honesty of my own mother than question the veracity of a survey I read in a newspaper .
However , at some point yesterday morning , after waking up to Julian Assange being questioned on the Today programme about how many women were fortunate enough to be the beneficiaries of his unsheathed leaking wiki , and then battling my way into work past the 752-mile - long queue of angry people in St Pancras station waiting for a train that can cope with only three inches of snow , a nugget of scepticism formed in my mind .
According to a survey done by the Samaritans , one third of Britons think that 2010 was one of the worst years of their lives .
Clearly , this survey was conducted before the news on Monday that More4 will now only air one episode of The Daily Show a week , but even so , one does n't need to be a reader of the Daily Mail to feel that 33 % seems suspiciously low for those unimpressed with 2010 .
The election of a Tory government , Nick Clegg 's betrayal , tuition fees , snow , Stephen Fry 's inexhaustible capacity for self - publicity – were the rest of the survey 's respondents asleep for the rest of the year ?
2010 has been officially rubbish But cheer up !
2011 is going to be the best year ever .
That 's right – the best !
No , I 'm not gazing into a crystal ball while sporting a turban patterned with astrology signs .
Well , actually , I am , but that 's because it is my usual look .
But in this case , I draw my conclusions from sober study , philosophical pondering and cold , hard evidence .
Behold !
1 .
We will all stop thinking about Julian Assange 's penis I could discuss how interesting it is that web weirdos such as Assange and Mark Zuckerberg are such determined champions of transparency and sharing personal information , except when that information is personal to them .
But I 'm afraid I ca n't because I just ca n't stop thinking about Assange 's penis .
I surely speak for the world when I say that we have all read , thought and spoken quite enough about Julian Assange 's sex life for this lifetime and several more , thank you very much .
At least Assange – who has always sounded a bit too much like an STD for my liking ( "" Just rub some of this cream on , ma'am , and your assange will go down in a few days "" )
– has gifted the world with a new name for a pudding : next year , "" sex by surprise "" will be on the menus of all of the nation 's top restaurants , easily overtaking tiramisu in popularity .

Instead , think about your vagina
If you 're a woman , chances are that you have been thinking the same thing as me for years : ""
My gosh , if there 's one thing that 's been missing from my life it 's feeling insecure about one more part of my body and being told that I should spend hundreds of pounds a year torturing it in order to bring it up to magazine - approved standards . ""
Ladies , happy news !
2011 will be , unquestionably , the year of the vagina .
Thanks to the TV treasure that is The Only Way is Essex , you have already heard of "" vajazzling "" .
What , you have n't ?
Um , er , do you mind moving over there ?
No , further .
No , further still .
OK , "" vajazzling "" is when you shave in a particular shape , embellish with appliques and then flavour with strawberry gel
your –
well , see if you can guess .
Because , you know , in its natural un - rhinestoned state it is just DISGUSTING .
So this Christmas , ask your parents for a Tajazzle kit – the infomercial for which is highly recommended .

Rogue Vince Cable and Nicolle Wallace 2011 is looking most promising for going rogue .
Personally , I give Vince Cable until mid January at the latest before he gives his rogue interview to Paxman and resigns from the coalition in a bonfire of acrimony , bitterness and tattered reputations .
Nicolle Wallace has been making dark noises about her now very former colleague , Sarah Palin , for some time , and with each interview she hints harder and harder that "" something "" is going to come out about Palin .
Sex change ?
With Palin , anything is possible .
4 .
Single celebrities
As has been widely noted , 2010 was the year of celebrity splits .
Ergo , 2011 is the year of single celebrities !
Just imagine it now : you go on match.com ,
you embark on email banter with a lovely sounding lady , you arrange to meet up for a drink on the high street , you turn up , and there 's a freshly divorced Scarlett Johansson , sipping a glass of chablis as she waits for you in All Bar One .
Make those A - list divorces work for you .
5 .
Snow – have you heard of it ?
If so , you have a head start on pretty much every transportation bigwig in this country .
But perhaps after two nationally paralysing snow storms this year , Britain 's airports and train operators will come to grips with the concept of "" snow "" falling in this season
we call "" winter "" and prepare accordingly .
Maybe .
Or perhaps I 've just been inhaling the glue fumes of my Tajazzle kit too much to think properly ."
2010-12-23,"Julian Assange said today that it would be "" politically impossible "" for Britain to extradite him to the United States , and that the final word on his fate if he were charged with espionage would rest with David Cameron .
In an interview with the Guardian in Ellingham Hall , the Norfolk country mansion where he is living under virtual house arrest , the founder of WikiLeaks said it would be difficult for the prime minister to hand him over to the Americans if there was strong support for him from the British people .
"" It 's all a matter of politics .
We can presume there will be an attempt to influence UK political opinion , and to influence the perception of our standing as a moral actor , "" he said .
Assange is currently fighting extradition to Sweden .
He strongly denies allegations of sexual misconduct with two Swedish women .
But he believes the biggest threat to his freedom and to WikiLeaks , his whistleblowing website , emanates from a wrathful United States .
There is no evidence of any imminent US move to indict him .
But according to Assange , the Obama administration is "" trying to strike a plea deal "" with Bradley Manning , the 23-year - old intelligence officer and alleged source of the more than a quarter of a million US diplomatic cables embarrassingly leaked last month .
The US attorney general , Eric Holder , wants to indict Assange as a co - conspirator and is also examining "" computer hacking statutes and support for terrorism "" , Assange claims .
Sitting in front of a log fire , his Apple MacBook Pro perched on his lap , Assange said his recent nine - day spell in Wandsworth jail had prepared him for the possibility that he might spend a long period in prison if indicted by the US .
He said the prospect of solitary confinement was no longer an "" intellectual abstraction "" but a reality .
The high court bailed him to Norfolk last Thursday , with his extradition hearing scheduled for 6 - 7 February .
He said : "" Solitary confinement is very difficult .
But I know that provided there is some opportunity for correspondence I can withstand it .
I 'm mentally robust .
Of course it would mean the end of my life in the conventional sense .
"" If the US succeeded in removing him from the UK or Sweden , Assange said there was a "" high chance "" of him being killed "" Jack Ruby - style "" in the US prison system .
Since moving to Ellingham Hall , a Georgian country house and organic farm owned by his friend and supporter Vaughan Smith , Assange has given numerous media interviews .
But he said he was fed up with the press and described an interview with BBC Radio 4 's Today programme â€ “ in which John Humphrys grilled him on how many people he had slept with â€ “ as "" awful "" .
Assange also took issue with a lengthy report in Saturday 's Guardian setting out the prosecution allegations against him in Sweden .
Assange acknowledged that the Guardian had a right to publish the material , dealing with his alleged encounters with the women .
But he said it had been "" sub - selected "" and not placed properly in context .
Swedish prosecutors have demanded that he return to Sweden to face further questions about the allegations .
Assange also said WikiLeaks did not have enough money to pay its legal bills , even though "" a lot of generous lawyers have donated their time to us "" .
He said legal costs for WikiLeaks and his own defence were approaching Â£500,000 .
The decisions by Visa , MasterCard and PayPal to stop processing donations to WikiLeaks â€ “ apparently following US pressure â€ “ had robbed the website of a "" war chest "" of around â‚¬500,000 , he complained .
This would have been enough to fund WikiLeaks ' publishing operations for six months .
At its peak the organisation was receiving â‚¬100,000 a day , he said .
According to publishing sources , however , Assange can take cheer from the fact that he has secured a seven - figure advance for a book about WikiLeaks and his life story .
The sources suggest he is likely to receive Â£250,000 himself , allowing him to pay off some of his debts and to settle his personal defence fund , currently "" paralysed "" .
The book is to be published in the spring by Knopf in the US and Canongate in the UK , the sources suggest .
Assange â€ “ who has to wear his electronic tag in the bath , and report every day to Beccles police station
â€
“ confessed he has no idea where he will be in a year 's time .
He described the next chapter in his life as "" not yet predictable . ""
Legally the UK has the right to not extradite for political crimes .
Espionage is the classic case of political crimes .
It is at the discretion of the UK government as to whether to apply to that exception . ""
He argued that Cameron and Nick Clegg were in a stronger position than the previous , Labour government to resist his extradition by Washington .
"" There is a new government , which wants to show it has n't yet been co - opted by the US , "" he said , claiming that the security services â€ “ British and Australian â€ “ had a history of spying on and unduly influencing Labour politicians .
Many WikiLeaks supporters have now gone home for Christmas , leaving Assange with a scaled - down team over the holiday period , on an estate where the pheasant and grouse greatly outnumber the humans .
His immediate plan , he said , was to rest after a gruelling couple of months and then to continue with the staged global release of redacted US state department cables in the new year .
Physically , he appeared somewhat wrung out , although very much composed and in good spirits .
Assange defended one of WikiLeaks ' collaborators , Israel Shamir , following claims Shamir passed sensitive cables to Belarus 's dictator , Alexander Lukashenko .
Lukashenko has arrested 600 opposition supporters and journalists since Sunday 's presidential election .
The whereabouts and fate of several of the president 's high - profile opponents are unknown .
Of Shamir , Assange said : "" WikiLeaks works with hundreds of journalists from different regions of the world .
All are required to sign non - disclosure agreements and are generally only given limited review access to material relating to their region .
We have no reason to believe these rumours in relation to Belarus are true . ""
Over the past month the Guardian has published more than 200 articles based on the trove of US diplomatic dispatches obtained by WikiLeaks , and 739 of the cables themselves .
All cables published by the Guardian and the four other international news organisations who had exclusive early access to the material have been carefully redacted to protect sources who could be placed in danger , and the redacted versions have been passed to WikiLeaks .
WikiLeaks now plans to begin sharing the cables with a wider group of regional news organisations .
Julian Assange says all future cables released by WikiLeaks will either be redacted by other partner news organisations , or by WikiLeaks itself .
The Guardian and its partners in the project , the New York Times , Der Spiegel , El Pais and Le Monde , will continue to share redactions with WikiLeaks for any cables they publish in future ."

2010-12-26,"The founder of the WikiLeaks website , Julian Assange , has said he expects to earn more than Â£1 m from book deals .
Assange , who achieved global notoriety after his whistleblower website began releasing more than a quarter of a million diplomatic cables , said he would use the money for legal costs .
The 39-year - old is fighting extradition to Sweden , where two women have accused him of sexual misconduct .
He denies the allegations .
Since being released on bail earlier this month pending extradition proceedings , Assange has been living under virtual house arrest at Ellingham Hall , a Norfolk country mansion , from where he regularly gives media interviews .
He told the Sunday Times that he was forced to sign a deal worth more than Â£1 m for his autobiography due to financial difficulties .
"" I do n't want to write this book , but I have to , "" he said .
"" I have already spent Â£200,000 for legal costs and I need to defend myself and to keep WikiLeaks afloat . ""
He will reportedly receive $ 800,000 dollars from Alfred A Knopf , his American publisher , while a British deal with Canongate is said to be worth Â£325,000 .
An estimated Â£1.1 m will be generated from the deal , including serialisation , he said .
Previously Assange told the Guardian that WikiLeaks does not have enough money to pay its legal bills , even though "" a lot of generous lawyers have donated their time to us "" .
Legal costs for WikiLeaks and his own defence were approaching Â£500,000 , he said .
The decisions by Visa , MasterCard and PayPal to stop processing donations have cost the organisation Â£425,000 , enough to fund WikiLeaks ' publishing operations for six months .
At its peak the organisation was receiving Â£85,000 a day , he said .
Assange has said that his greatest concern is not the pending extradition request to Sweden , but a potential prosecution in the United States over his released of leaked data .
There is no evidence of an imminent US move to indict him , but there have been calls by senior figures for his arrest .
The US vice - president , Joe Biden , has likened Assange to a "" hi - tech terrorist "" .
Assange has said he believes the Obama administration is "" trying to strike a plea deal "" with Bradley Manning , the 23-year - old intelligence officer and alleged source of the diplomatic cables .
The US attorney general , Eric Holder , wants to indict Assange as a co - conspirator and is also examining "" computer hacking statutes and support for terrorism "" , Assange claims .
Assange 's extradition hearing has been scheduled for 6 - 7 February ."
2010-12-27,"Here 's what I 've learned so far from the furore over the rape allegations against Julian Assange : when it comes to rape , the left still does n't get it .
The problem is not that many WikiLeaks supporters question the zeal with which Swedish authorities are pursuing Assange .
Maybe it 's true that an ordinary guy , faced with similar accusations , would have been allowed to slip away quietly once he left Sweden rather than become the subject of an Interpol red notice .
( Maybe not , though .
The 11 Swedes on Interpol 's public red list include people wanted for fraud and other non - spectacular crimes .
Much has been made of the fact that only one of these , an alleged child molester , is charged with a sex crime .
But the vast majority of wanted people are privately listed , so actually there 's no way of knowing if Assange 's case is exceptional . )
Given that US politicians , from Joe Biden to Sarah Palin , have called for Assange 's head , it is n't paranoid to suspect that he is being singled out in order to extradite him to the United States .
But it could also be that Sweden is following up because law enforcement officials get mad when world - class celebrities flee the country and then thumb their noses at them – cf Roman Polanski .
What 's disturbing is the way some WikiLeaks admirers have misrepresented the allegations , attacked the women and made light of date rape .
It 's been known for some time that Assange was accused of using his body weight to force sex on one woman , ignoring her demand that he use a condom , and penetrating the other woman while she slept , also without a condom , despite her wishes ; yet writer after writer has treated the whole thing as a big joke .
It was "" sex by surprise "" – some arcane Swedish thing – wrote Dave Lindorff on Truthout .
Also , Assange did n't tell the second woman about the first and did n't return her phone call .
Hell hath no fury like a groupie scorned .
Appearing on Keith Olbermann 's show after he put up $ 20,000 to help bail Assange out of a British jail , Michael Moore – apparently an expert on Swedish rape law – called the case "" a bunch of hooey "" : "" the condom broke during consensual sex "" .
Olbermann made matters worse when he retweeted Bianca Jagger 's tweet linking to a blog post by Mark Crispin Miller , claiming that Assange accuser ""
Ms A "" had "" interacted "" in Cuba with an anti - Castro women 's group supported by terrorist and former CIA agent Luis Posada Carriles , and had published anti - Castro "" diatribes "" in a Swedish magazine .
You would think the left would be more sensitive to charges of guilt by association – since when did marching in a demonstration mean you signed on to everything its supporters support ?
By those lights , everyone who went to an Answer - sponsored march against the Iraq war thinks North Korea is a Marxist paradise .
And everyone who believes and promotes the "" information "" that "" Ms A "" is a CIA "" honeytrap "" is an antisemite and a Holocaust denier – because the original source for that story is one Israel Shamir , writing in Counterpunch and vigorously defended by Counterpunch editor and Nation columnist Alexander Cockburn , who also belittles the accusations as "" unsafe sex and failure to phone his date the following day "" .
I spent a few hours on israelshamir.net and learned that "" the Jews "" foisted capitalism , advertising and consumerism on harmonious and modest Christian Europe ; were behind Stalin 's famine in Ukraine ; control the banks , the media and many governments ; and that "" Palestine is not the ultimate goal of the Jews : the world is . ""
There are numerous guest articles by Holocaust deniers , aka "" historical revisionists "" .
We have now produced on the left an echo chamber like that on the far right , where the scurrilous charges of marginal fanatics are disseminated through electronic media and end up , cleansed of their original associations , as respectable opinion .
The heroic Sady Doyle , a blogger at Tiger Beatdown , gets lots of credit for starting a Twitter campaign that forced Moore and Olbermann to – sort of – back off their sexist chortling .
But it 's too late
: the "" revelations "" that Sweden has laws against condomless sex and that "" Ms A "" is a CIA "" honeytrap "" are all over the left blogosphere .
And it is n't just men who are spreading it .
On the Huffington Post , Naomi Wolf posted a satirical letter to Interpol , aka the "" world 's dating police "" , repeating the broken - condom falsehood and adding that Assange 's crimes include "" texting and tweeting in the taxi … while on a date and , disgustingly enough , reading stories about himself online "" in the cab .
Is this the same Naomi Wolf who wrote a 2004 New York magazine cover story accusing Harold Bloom of putting his hand on her thigh 20 years before ?
Wolf argues that the accusations against Assange demean the seriousness of rape .
In fact , Swedish law does distinguish among degrees of rape , with Assange being accused on one count of the least grave kind .
In a much - cited letter to the Guardian , Katrin Axelsson of Women Against Rape argued that Sweden 's low rape conviction rate proved that Assange was being set up – in 2006 , she claimed , only six people were convicted out of 4,000 reported .
Not so .
"" I do n't know where they got those figures , "" Amnesty International 's Katarina Bergehed told me by phone from Sweden . ""
In 2006 there were 3,074 rapes and 227 convictions . ""
( Sweden tracks rape by individual acts , not by number of victims , so the prevalence of rape is less than it looks . )
Bergehed should know : she wrote the Swedish section of the Amnesty report on sex crimes in the Nordic countries that Assange supporters cite as proving that Sweden is the worst place in Europe for rape victims .
One reason the Swedish rape conviction rate is low is that – thanks to 30 years of feminist progress – the law defines sexual violence and coercion broadly but , as in other countries , police and juries often do not .
The same seems to be true of large swaths of the American left .
WikiLeaks is revealing information citizens need to know
–
it 's a good thing .
Assange may or may not have committed sex crimes according to Swedish law .
Why is it so hard to hold those two ideas at once ?

This piece was amended on Monday 27 December at 14:13 to anonymise the names of the two women in question"
2010-12-30,"Two journalists with access to a secret transcript of comments by Bradley Manning , the US soldier accused of leaking confidential material to whistleblowing website WikiLeaks , have denied speculation that the material could potentially help a prosecution against Julian Assange .
The pair , from Wired magazine , said there was nothing "" newsworthy "" in unpublished internet chat logs between Manning and Adrian Lamo , a former hacker who claims to have discussed the leak with the young intelligence officer and later tipped off the FBI .
Wired.com claimed a scoop in June when it obtained a transcript of the chats and published excerpts in which Manning , 23 , appeared to confess to being the source of classified material handed to WikiLeaks , which was founded by Assange .
However , in recent days the journalists have found themselves at the centre of an increasingly acrimonious spat with critics who accuse them of withholding crucial information about the largest leak of military data in history .
The dispute has centred on the 75 % of the transcript
Wired has not published , claiming the information would infringe Manning 's privacy or compromise sensitive military information .
Amid reports that federal prosecutors want to establish that Assange "" encouraged or helped "" Manning to leak the material in order to make him a co - conspirator , Wired has found itself under pressure to reveal more about the unpublished chats .
Over the past month , Lamo has made fresh claims about the soldier 's relationship with Assange .
Suggesting that Assange was more than a passive recipient of the leaks , Lamo has claimed that WikiLeaks either provided Manning with a special FTP server to prioritise his leak or arranged a physical drop - off in the United States .
But he admits his claims are based on memory , as the hard drive that contained his copy of the full chat transcript was taken by the FBI .
Apart from US law officials , the Wired journalists are the only individuals known to have copies of the full chat . ""
The chats Wired has but is withholding – and about which they are refusing to comment – are newsworthy in the extreme , "" Glenn Greenwald , one of Wired 's fiercest critics , wrote on Monday .
The following day Evan Hansen , editor - in - chief of Wired.com , and Kevin Poulsen , the journalist who obtained the web chats , published a response to what they said were Greenwald 's personal and unfounded attacks .
Today both told the Guardian they had reviewed the unpublished transcripts in the last 24 hours .
They concluded there was no discussion shedding new light on the relationship between Manning and Assange .
"" If I were a prosecutor , everything I would be looking at [ in seeking to mount a case against Manning or Assange ] would be in the published record , "" Hansen said .
"" We 're trying to get the news out there that is relevant to the public .
If there was something like that in the unpublished [ chat logs ] we would have made that public six months ago . ""
Poulsen also said that there was nothing "" newsworthy "" in the parts of the transcript they had decided to hold back , adding that nothing "" of substance "" about Manning 's relationship with Assange had been kept secret .
"" We have discussions in the newsroom , at every major turn in the Manning case , about whether it is now appropriate to publish the complete logs , "" he said .
"" And so far we have concluded it is n't . ""
Assange is fighting extradition to Sweden , where he faces unrelated allegations – which he denies – of sexual misconduct with two women .
Although there is no evidence of an imminent indictment from the US .
Assange has said his greatest fear is extradition to the US , where he believes federal prosecutors are "" trying to strike a plea deal "" with Manning so that he can be charged as a co - conspirator .
The material allegedly leaked by Manning is said to include more than 250,000 confidential diplomatic cables ; redacted versions of a selection of these have been published by the Guardian and other media outlets over the last two months .
•
This article was amended on 3 January 2011 , to clarify that a segment of the leaked material has been published , rather than the entire body of material ."
2011-01-03,"The Republicans plan to hold a congressional inquiry into WikiLeaks and its founder , Julian Assange , following the organisation 's release of thousands of classified US diplomatic cables .
The party , which will wrest control of house committees from the Democrats tomorrow , has included WikiLeaks in a list of priorities for investigation .
The move is partly political , aimed at the attorney general , Eric Holder , who the Republicans claim has been too slow and too weak in reacting to the leaks .
He said last month that the justice department was looking at what action can be taken against Assange but that lawyers are struggling to find legislation under which the Australian national can be prosecuted .
Darrell Issa , who will take over as chair of the House of Representatives oversight committee and is calling for Holder 's resignation , said of Assange in a television interview on Sunday : "" If the president says , ' I ca n't deal with this guy as a terrorist , ' then he has to be able to deal with him as a criminal , otherwise the world is laughing at this paper tiger we 've become . ""
The Politico website today published a list of areas
Issa 's committee intends to investigate , including WikiLeaks .
The committee , which has a broad remit covering fraud and waste , has the power to subpoena witnesses from the highest reaches of Washington political life .
Hearings could begin later this month .
Issa said his committee would investigate WikiLeaks because it wanted "" to get that right so the diplomats can do their job with confidence and people can talk to our government with confidence "" .
He suggested the new Congress would have to pass legislation to try to prevent similar acts of whistleblowing .
Doug Schoen , a former adviser to Hillary Clinton , cautioned Issa against over - reaching himself , telling Fox News yesterday that there was a grand jury in place looking at Assange and these investigators should be left to complete their work .
Charges were needed that would stick , Schoen said .
In a separate development , Bank of America has set up a crisis team preparing for a possible dump of material about the bank by WikiLeaks .
Assange in November said he intended to "" take down "" a major American bank but did not specify which one .
The New York Times reported today that Bank of America has a team of 15 to 20 top officials sifting through thousands of documents , and trying to establishing if security has been compromised .
The bank has also hired consultants and spoken to law firms in preparation for any disclosures .
Among concerns is legal liability if private information about clients was to be disclosed ."
2011-01-05,"As Swedish prosecutors ' sex - crime allegations against Julian Assange play out , one aspect of the case merits serious scrutiny .
We know Assange , the founder of WikiLeaks , by name .
But his two accusers are consistently identified only as "" Miss A "" and "" Miss W "" in the media , and their images are blurred .
In the UK it is against the law to name an accuser in a sex - crime case once a complaint has been made ; elsewhere – in the US , and much of Europe – media convention demands that accusers get the same protection .
This is bad law and bad policy .
Motivated by good intentions , the outcome harms women .
The convention of shielding rape accusers is a relic of the Victorian era , when rape and other sex crimes were being codified in what descended to us as modern law .
Rape was seen as "" the fate worse than death "" , rendering women – supposed to be virgins until marriage – "" damaged goods "" .
The practice of not naming rape victims took hold for this reason .
Borrowing from a poem by Coventry Patmore , Virginia Woolf labelled the ideal of womanhood in this period "" the Angel in the House "" : a retiring creature who could not withstand the rigours of the public arena .
"" Good "" women 's ostensible fragility and sexual purity was used to exclude them from influencing outcomes that affected their destinies .
For example , women could not fully participate in legal proceedings .
Indeed , suffragists fought for the right to be found guilty of one 's own crimes .
Nonetheless , even after women gained legal rights – and as other assumptions about women went the way of whalebone stays –
the convention of not naming women who make sex - crime allegations remains .
Not only is this convention condescending , but it makes rape prosecutions more difficult .
Anonymity serves institutions that do not want to prosecute rapists .
In the US military , for instance , the shielding of accusers ' identities allows officials to evade responsibility for transparent reporting of assaults – and thus not to prosecute sex crimes systematically .
The same is true with universities .
My alma mater , Yale , used anonymity to sweep incidents under the carpet for two decades .
Charges made anonymously are not taken as seriously as charges brought in public .
It is only when victims have waived their anonymity – a difficult , often painful thing to do – that institutions change .
It was Anita Hill 's decision in 1991 not to make anonymous accusations against Clarence Thomas , now a US supreme court justice , that spurred a wave of enforcement of equal opportunity law .
Hill knew that her motives would be questioned .
But as a lawyer she understood how unethical anonymous allegations are , and how unlikely to bring about change .
The convention of anonymity , conversely , lets rape myths flourish .
When accusers are identified , it becomes clear that rape can happen to anyone .
Stereotypes about how "" real "" rape victims look and act fall away , and myths about false reporting of rape relative to other crimes can be challenged .
Feminists have long argued that rape must be treated like any other crime .
But in no other crime are accusers ' identities hidden .
Treating rape differently serves only to maintain its mischaracterisation as a "" different "" kind of crime , loaded with cultural baggage .
Finally , there is a profound moral issue here .
Though children 's identities should , of course , be shielded , women are not children .
If one makes a serious criminal accusation , one must be treated as a moral adult .
The importance of this is particularly clear in the Assange case , where public opinion matters far more than usual .
Here , geopolitical state pressure , as well as the pressure of public attitudes about Assange , weigh unusually heavily .
Can judicial decision - making be impartial when the accused is exposed to the glare of media scrutiny and attack by the US government , while his accusers remain hidden ?
It is no one 's business whom a victim of sex crime has had sex with previously , or what she was wearing when attacked .
Laws exist to protect women from such inquiries .
But some questions of motive and context , for both parties , are legitimate in any serious allegation .
The Oscar Wilde trial of 1895 is worth remembering .
Wilde , like Assange , was held in solitary confinement .
Like Assange , he faced a legal proceeding for alleged sex crimes in which there was state pressure on the outcome : the alleged behind - the - scenes involvement of the then prime minister , Lord Rosebery , ensured the likelihood of a "" guilty "" verdict .
The roar of public opprobrium , in the wake of reports from accusers shielded in some cases by anonymity , also sealed Wilde 's fate .
His sentence – two years ' hard labour – was atypically severe .
No one is proud of the outcome of that trial today .
The lesson for us ?
Top - level political pressure and virulent public opprobrium – inflamed and enabled by anonymous accusations – can grossly distort legal process ."
2011-01-05,"US journalists are not offering support to Julian Assange and WikiLeaks , according to an interesting article in Newsweek .
"" You might expect the American media to respond assertively [ in defence of press freedom ] , "" it says .
"" But the pushback has been piecemeal and somewhat muted . ""
Though some journalistic bodies - such as the Committee to Protect Journalists - have called on the US government not to prosecute Assange , other organisations have refused to comment on ther whole business .
They include the American Society of Magazine Editors and the National Association of Broadcasters .
The Society of Professional Journalists did issue "" a statement on ethical journalism "" that is "" tortured "" and "" somewhat inscrutable "" , which says their members could not reach a consensus on the probity of WikiLeaks 's actions .
Individual newspaper and magazine editors have also avoided issuing statements on the matter , although the Washington Post editorial page came out against prosecution , Do n't charge WikiLeaks .
By contrast , the New York Times , which received earlier WikiLeaks document dumps , has not run an editorial on the subject and did not respond to Newsweek 's request for comment .
"" There 's a lot of hair - splitting going on about whether WikiLeaks is journalism or Assange is a journalist , "" says Bruce Shapiro , executive director of the Dart Center for Journalism and Trauma .
"" To me that is not a relevant question .
WikiLeaks is a publisher ; Assange is a publisher . ""
Nineteen professors — a little more than half the faculty — at the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism did sign a letter to the Obama administration arguing against prosecution .
It said : "" While we hold varying opinions of WikiLeaks ' methods and decisions , we all believe that in publishing diplomatic cables WikiLeaks is engaging in journalistic activity protected by the First Amendment . ""
The letter was the first , and so far the only , one from an American journalism - school faculty on the subject .
So why are American journalists hesitant to speak up for Assange ?
The Newsweek article offers three reasons .
1 .
A refusal to engage in advocacy .
American journalists , unlike many of their foreign counterparts , have a strong commitment to objectivity and nonpartisanship .
At many mainstream media organisations , signing petitions is verboten , and many journalists impose such rules on themselves .
2 .
Opposition to Assange 's purpose .
That same notion of objectivity shared by journalists makes many of them suspicious of WikiLeaks 's journalistic bona fides .
Assange has an advocacy mission : to disrupt the functioning of governments .
Many mainstream journalists might see associating with Assange as inappropriately endorsing an advocacy mission .
3 .
Opposition to Assange 's methods .
Some journalists , while perhaps believing Assange should not be prosecuted , are so disgusted with his approach that they are reluctant to speak up for him in public .
For example , Sam Freedman , a journalism professor at Columbia University , did not sign the letter circulated by his colleagues , explaining that it "" did not adequately criticise the recklessness — the disregard for the consequences of human lives — of a massive dump of confidential info . ""

2011-01-06,"The WikiLeaks US embassy cables revelations caused a world - wide sensation .
But the story behind their publication turns out to be just as sensational too .
It transpires that the partnership between the WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange and The Guardian was anything but straightforward .
According to a Vanity Fair article by Sarah Ellison , there were rows , legal threats and a series of shocks before the newspaper was able to publish what she calls "" one of the greatest journalistic scoops of the last 30 years . ""
She has reconstructed a blow - by - blow account of the twists and turns of the strained relationship between The Guardian - and other papers , including the New York Times - and Assange .
He emerges as an enigmatic , erratic and high - handed individual whose changes of mind and mood bedevilled the process of publishing the documents .
Assange is now under police bail in Britain , facing extradition to Sweden for questioning about claims of sexual assault .
But Ellison 's report sticks only to his dealings with The Guardian .
She tells how The Guardian 's Nick Davies and Ian Traynor made the original contact with Assange in June last year .
From that sprang the first revelatory cache of military logs of the war in Afghanistan .
The Guardian , having brought the New York Times on board , then got its first inkling of the difficulties it might have with Assange .
Without consulting the paper , Assange arranged for Germany 's Der Spiegel to join the partnership .
It also became clear that there was a major difference between the ethos of the newspapers and that of WikiLeaks .
While the papers ' editors were not prepared to publish anything that might lead to reprisals , WikiLeaks was happy to allow the names of Afghan civilians to be posted on its website .
Assange did not favour redaction .
Ellison quotes The Guardian 's investigations editor , David Leigh , as saying : "" We were starting from : ' Here 's a document .
How much of it shall we print ? '
Whereas Julian 's ideology was , ' I shall dump everything out and then you have to try and persuade me to cross a few things out . '
We were coming at it from opposite poles . ""
By this time , WikiLeaks colleagues noted that Assange was "" becoming increasingly autocratic and dismissive . ""
So did The Guardian .
Just before publication of the Afghan logs , a furious Davies was shocked to discover that Assange had unilaterally given the database to Channel 4 .
Next came the war logs relating to the war in Iraq , and Assange sprang yet another surprise on The Guardian by demanding that the Bureau of Investigative Journalism should have access to the material .
This meant a delay in publishing .
Leigh agreed to that , but only if Assange would gave the paper another batch of documents - the so - called "" package three "" - which was the highly sensitive US embassy cables .
According to Leigh , Assange told him : "" You can have package three tonight , but you have to give me a letter signed by the Guardian editor saying you wo n't publish package three until I say so . ""
Assange got his letter
Meanwhile , there were continuing problems of WikiLeaks 's refusal to redact as The Guardian started its Iraq war logs publication on 23 October amid what Ellison refers to as "" a growing sense of unease among the media outlets , both with one another and with Assange . ""
The NY Times went so far as to publish a critical profile of Assange in which it quoted his anonymous former colleagues as speaking of his "" erratic and imperious behaviour , and a nearly delusional grandeur . ""
The Guardian then discovered that a former WikiLeaks volunteer had leaked "" package three "" to the freelance journalist , and freedom - of - information campaigner , Heather Brooke .
Leigh , having invited Brooke to join The Guardian team , realised that by obtaining the data from a source other than Assange , the paper was released from its promise to wait for Assange 's green light to publish .
Leigh passed on the documents to Der Spiegel and the NY Times , and the three titles were poised to publish on 8 November .
With seven days to go , Assange and his lawyer stormed into the office of Guardian editor Alan Rusbridger and threatened to sue .
Rusbridger , Leigh and executives from Der Spiegel then spent a marathon session with Assange , his lawyer and another WikiLeaks member , Kristin Hrafnsson , before "" an uneasy calm "" was restored .
Ellison writes of that crucial meeting in detail : "" Assange was pallid and sweaty , his thin frame racked by a cough that had been plaguing him for weeks .
He was also angry , and his message was simple : he would sue the newspaper if it went ahead and published stories based on the quarter of a million documents that he had handed over to The Guardian just three months earlier ... ""
Rusbridger somehow kept all parties at the table â€ ” a process involving a great deal of coffee followed by a great deal of wine .
Ultimately , he agreed to a further delay , allowing Assange time to bring in other media partners , this time France 's Le Monde and Spain 's El PaÃ­s . ""
In the end , The Guardian and the other four papers were able to publish , thus sparking a hugely critical response from the US administration , which is seeking ways to prosecute Assange .
But , as we have seen , it had been a rocky road for The Guardian way before it faced up to that controversy .
Ellison writes : "" When I asked Rusbridger if he had any regrets about the way his paper handled the cables or the way it worked with WikiLeaks , he said , "" No , "" but his response was so tentative that it seemed to reveal how fragile the project was in his mind .
"" I think given the complexity of it all , touch wood , as I speak at the moment , it is remarkable it has gone so well .
Given all the tensions that were built into it , it would have been surprising to get out of it without some friction , but we negotiated it all quite well . ""

2011-01-07,"Wikileaks founder Julian Assange has confirmed that Edinburgh publisher Canongate has bought the rights in his first book .
The deal will see the firm , based on the Royal Mile , publishing the book in the UK in April 2011 .
Alfred A. Knopf will publish in North America .
In what Canongate say will be a "" revelatory account , "" Assange expands on the philosophies that underpin his media company .
He will draw on his own life story and offer insights into his work challenging transparency , democracy and power .
Assange said : "" I hope this book will become one of the unifying documents of our generation . ""
In this highly personal work , I explain our global struggle to force a new relationship between the people and their governments . ""
The deal between Assange and Canongate has been widely rumoured since the end of last year .
Today the publisher confirmed on Twitter that Assange had signed with them .
They have already sold rights to Feltrinelli ( Italy ) , Kiepenheuer and Witsch ( Germany ) , Laffont ( France ) , Text ( Australia ) , Random House / Mondadori ( Spain ) , De Geus ( Holland ) , Objectiva ( Portugal ) , Font ( Norway ) , Norstedts ( Sweden ) , Ara Llibres ( Catalonia ) and Companhia das Letras ( Brazil ) , all of whom will be part of an internationally coordinated launch .
A spokesperson for Canongate said : "" WikiLeaks has helped redefine our idea of investigative journalism and our understanding of how information should be disseminated . ""
Assange , the visionary creator of and driving force behind this new publishing phenomenon , has a unique perspective on how WikiLeaks has evolved into one of today 's most influential and fearless news organisations . """
2011-01-08,"WikiLeaks has demanded that Google and Facebook reveal the contents of any US subpoenas they may have received after it emerged that a court in Virginia had ordered Twitter to secretly hand over details of accounts on the micro - blogging site by five figures associated with the group , including Julian Assange .
Amid strong evidence that a US grand jury has begun a wide - ranging trawl for details of what networks and accounts WikiLeaks used to communicate with Bradley Manning , the US serviceman accused of stealing hundreds of thousands of sensitive government cables , some of those named in the subpoena said they would fight disclosure . ""
Today , the existence of a secret US government grand jury espionage investigation into WikiLeaks was confirmed for the first time as a subpoena was brought into the public domain , "" WikiLeaks said in a statement .
The writ , approved by a court in Virginia in December , demands that the San Franscisco - based micro - blogging site hand over all details of five individuals ' accounts and private messaging on Twitter – including the computers and networks used .
They include WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange , Manning , Icelandic MP Brigitta Jonsdottir and Dutch hacker Rop Gonggrijp .
Three of them – Gonggrijp , Assange and Jonsdottir – were named as "" producers "" of the first significant leak from the US cables cache : a video of an Apache helicopter attack that killed civilians and journalists in Baghdad .
The legal document also targets an account held by Jacob Appelbaum , a US computer programmer whose computer and phones were examined by US officials in July after he was stopped returning from Holland to America .
The court issuing the subpoena said it had "" reasonable grounds "" to believe Twitter held information "" relevant and material to an ongoing criminal investigation "" .
It ordered Twitter not to notify the targets of the subpoena – an order the company successfully challenged .
The court order crucially demands that Twitter hand over details of source and destination internet protocol addresses used to access the accounts , which would help investigators identify how the named individuals communicated with each other , as well as email addresses used .
The emergence of the subpoena appears to confirm for the first time the existence of a secret grand jury empanelled to investigate whether individuals associated with WikiLeaks , and Assange in particular , can be prosecuted for alleged conspiracy with Manning to steal the classified documents .
The US attorney general , Eric Holder , has already said publicly that he believes Assange could be prosecuted under US espionage laws .
The court that issued the subpoena is in the same jurisdiction where press reports have located a grand jury investigating Assange .
It has been reported that Manning has been offered a plea bargain if he co - operates with the investigation .
The emergence of the Twitter subpoena – which was unsealed after a legal challenge by the company – was revealed after WikiLeaks announced it believed other US Internet companies had also been ordered to hand over information about its members ' activities .
WikiLeaks condemned the court order , saying it amounted to harassment . ""
If the Iranian government was to attempt to coercively obtain this information from journalists and activists of foreign nations , human rights groups around the world would speak out , "" Assange said in a statement .
Jonsdottir said in a Twitter message : "" I think I am being given a message , almost like someone breathing in a phone . ""
Twitter has declined to comment , saying only that its policy is to notify its users where possible of government requests for information .
The specific clause of the Patriot act used to acquire the subpoena is one that the FBI has described as necessary for "" obtaining such records [ that ] will make the process of identifying computer criminals and tracing their internet communications faster and easier "" .
The subpoena itself is an unusual one known as a 2703(d ) .
Recently a federal appeals court ruled this kind of order was insufficient to order the disclosure of the contents of communication .
Significantly , however , that ruling is binding in neither Virginia – where the Twitter subpoena was issued – nor San Francisco where Twitter is based .
Assange has promised to fight the order , as has Jonsdottir , who said in a Twitter message that she had "" no intention to hand my information over willingly "" .
Appelbaum , whose Twitter feed suggested he was travelling in Iceland , said he was apprehensive about returning to the US . ""
Time to try to enjoy the last of my vacation , I suppose , "" he tweeted .
Gonggrijp praised Twitter for notifying him and others that the US had subpoenaed his details .
"" It appears that Twitter , as a matter of policy , does the right thing in wanting to inform their users when one of these comes in , "" Gonggrijp said .
"" Heaven knows how many places have received similar subpoenas and just quietly submitted all they had on me . """

2011-01-11,"Julian Assange today expressed his satisfaction after a procedural hearing on his extradition to Sweden and vowed that WikiLeaks would continue its work .
After the hearing at Belmarsh magistrates court , Assange said he was "" happy about today 's outcome "" and said the skeleton argument he and his legal team hastily produced over Christmas would be made publicly available later .
This outlines "" some important issues which will be gone into in detail on 6 and 7 February "" , he said .
"" I would also like to say that our work with WikiLeaks continues unabated and we are stepping up our publishing for matters relating to ' cablegate ' and other materials .
This will shortly be occurring through our newspaper partners around the world , big and small newspapers and some human rights organisations . ""
In today 's 10-minute session , Assange 's QC , Geoffrey Robertson , said all legal preparations were in place for a full two - day extradition hearing next month .
District judge Nicholas Evans released Assange , who spoke only to confirm his name , age and address , on conditional bail .
Assange , who wore a dark suit and light - coloured shirt , listened intently as he sat behind a glass screen at the top - security court .
His bail was modified , allowing him to stay at the Frontline Club for journalists in Paddington on 6 and 7 February , so he does not have so far to travel .
Robertson said Assange 's legal team was collecting evidence from further witnesses in Sweden , but the judge said the authorities there were likely to take the view that the extradition warrant would stand nevertheless .
Media interest in Assange was maintained as journalists from around the world filled 100 seats in the court and an annexe connected by video link .
High - profile supporters of Assange who turned up today included Bianca Jagger , Jemima Khan and Gavin MacFadyen , director of the Centre for Investigative Journalism .
A high court judge released Assange on Â£240,000 bail last month after the WikiLeaks founder had spent nine days in Wandsworth prison in London .
Assange spent Christmas at a manor house on the Norfolk - Suffolk border owned by Vaughan Smith , a former army captain and the founder of the Frontline Club .
Sweden is seeking extradition of the 39-year - old Australian over allegations of rape , molestation and unlawful coercion , made by two women over 10 days in August .
One of the women alleges that Assange had sex with her without a condom when it was her "" express wish "" that one should be used .
The second woman accuses him of having sex with her on 17 August without a condom while she was asleep at her Stockholm home .
Assange admits having had consensual sex with both women , but denies any criminal wrongdoing .
In interviews with Swiss newspapers yesterday , Assange said he might move to Switzerland or Australia , and revealed that WikiLeaks has been losing more than Â£400,000 a week since releasing a collection of US diplomatic cables that severely embarrassed the US government .
He said he had not made a request for political asylum in Switzerland , and declined to say whether he would .
Guardian Books will publish next month the first in - depth account of the WikiLeaks phenomenon .
The book will be called WikiLeaks :
Inside Julian Assange 's War on Secrecy .
US officials have stepped up their pressure on WikiLeaks by seeking information from Twitter .
A federal court approved a US department of justice subpoena demanding that the site hand over data about users with ties to WikiLeaks .
â€¢
This article was amended on 12 January 2011 .
The original said that Assange has signed a deal with Guardian Books , which will publish next month the first in - depth account of the WikiLeaks phenomenon .
This has been corrected ."
2011-01-11,"Julian Assange , the founder of WikiLeaks , could be at "" real risk "" of the death penalty or detention in GuantÃ¡namo Bay if he is extradited to Sweden on accusations of rape and sexual assault , his lawyers claim .
In a skeleton summary of their defence against attempts by the Swedish director of public prosecutions to extradite him , released today , Assange 's legal team argue that there is a similar likelihood that the US would subsequently seek his extradition "" and/or illegal rendition "" , "" where there will be a real risk of him being detained at GuantÃ¡namo Bay or elsewhere "" . ""
Indeed , if Mr Assange were rendered to the USA , without assurances that the death penalty would not be carried out , there is a real risk that he could be made subject to the death penalty .
It is well known that prominent figures have implied , if not stated outright , that Mr Assange should be executed . ""
The 35-page skeleton argument was released by Mark Stephens , Assange 's lawyer , following a brief review hearing this morning at Belmarsh magistrates court .
The WikiLeaks founder , who is on conditional bail while his extradition case is being considered , appeared for no more than 15 minutes in the dock , while supporters including Jemima Khan and Bianca Jagger looked on and waved support from the public gallery .
He later emerged to give a brief statement to a large number of reporters , saying : "" Our work with WikiLeaks continues unabated .
We are stepping up our publications for matters relating to Cablegate and other materials . ""
These will shortly be available through our newspaper partners around the world â€ “ big and small newspapers and human rights organisations . ""
The skeleton argument outlines seven points on which Assange 's lawyers will contest his extradition , which was sought by the Swedish DPP , Marianne Ny , following accusations from two women that he had sexually assaulted them in separate incidents in August .
One accusation , that Assange had sex with one of the women while she was asleep , would amount to rape under Swedish law if proven .
Both women had previously had consenting sex with Assange .
The other points of argument include : â€¢ That the European arrest warrant ( EAW ) is not valid , because Ny is not the authorised issuing authority , and it has been sought for an improper purpose
â€ “
ie "" simply in order to question him and without having yet reached a decision on whether or not to prosecute him "" .
This , they argue , would be in contravention of a well - established principle "" that mere suspicion should not found a request for extradition "" .
â€¢ That there has been "" abuse of process "" as Assange has not had full disclosure of all documents relating to the case , in particular text messages sent by one of the women , in which she allegedly said she was "" half asleep "" ( ie not fully asleep ) at the time they had sex , and messages between the two women in which they allegedly spoke of "" revenge "" .
â€¢ That the "" conduct "" of the Swedish prosecutor amounts to abuse of process .
Assange 's lawyers cite the fact that the rape allegations were initially dismissed and then reopened by a second prosecutor , that the prosecutor has refused Assange 's offers of interview , and that it has not made documents available to Assange in English .
They also cite the leak of part of the prosecution case to the Guardian as "" a breach of Mr Assange 's fair trial and privacy rights "" .
â€¢ That the alleged offences would not be considered crimes in the UK , and therefore , they argue , an EAW between the two countries would not be valid .
â€¢ That the extradition attempt is politically motivated , and that his trial would be prejudiced because of his political opinions or because , they argue , of his gender .
Assange 's team will make their case on 7 and 8 February , when Assange will return to court for the full extradition hearing .
The case for his extradition is being argued by the Crown Prosecution Service on behalf of the Swedish prosecutor ; the full prosecution case is not expected to be released before that date .
District Judge Nicholas Evans agreed at this morning 's hearing to ease the terms of his bail conditions , which require Assange to wear an electronic tag and report daily to a police station close to the stately home on the Suffolk / Norfolk border where he is staying .
For the nights of 6 and 7 February Assange will be permitted to stay in London ."

US officials have stepped up their pressure on WikiLeaks by seeking information from Twitter .

2011-01-11,"I wrote last week about the way in which American journalists are failing to offer support to Julian Assange and/or WikiLeaks .
Now comes more evidence that the US journalistic community is backing away from Assange despite the continuing interest in publishing stories based on the embassy cables posted on the WikiLeaks site .
The freedom of the press committee of the Overseas Press Club of America has declared him "" not one of us . ""
The Associated Press , which once filed legal actions on Assange 's behalf , refuses to comment about him .
And the National Press Club in Washington , the venue less than a year ago for an Assange news conference , has decided not to speak out on his behalf .
But club president Alan Bjerga has said his organisation might take a stand if the Justice Department acted against WikiLeaks . ""
Any action against Julian Assange that would impede journalists is one we would oppose , "" he said .
The Watergate investigator Bob Woodward went on the record in November to criticise WikiLeaks for its "" willy - nilly "" release of documents that would be "" fuel for those who oppose disclosure . ""
However , Woodward 's newspaper , the Washington Post , is one of very few papers to have argued against prosecuting Assange .
According to Lucy Dalglish , executive director of the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press , the problem with speaking up for WikiLeaks is that she does n't consider Assange to be a journalist .
She said that though Assange "" has done some things that journalists do ... I would argue that what the New York Times does is more journalism .
They vet the information . . . .
They consider outside sources .
They take responsibility .
They publicly identify themselves ...
They do some value added .
They do something original to it . ""
But Joel Simon , executive director of the New York - based Committee to Protect Journalists , believes that if Assange is prosecuted "" it will be because he a journalist . ""
The group has sent a letter to US attorney general Eric Holder to warn that a prosecution of Assange could have a chilling effect on journalism around the world .

2011-01-12,"Julian Assange , the founder of WikiLeaks , claimed today he was in possession of "" insurance "" files on Rupert Murdoch and his global media company , News Corporation .
Assange also claimed that WikiLeaks holds more than 500 confidential US diplomatic cables on one broadcasting organisation .
Speaking to journalist John Pilger for an interview to be published tomorrow in the latest edition of the New Statesman , Assange said : "" There are 504 US embassy cables on one broadcasting organisation and there are cables on Murdoch and News Corp.
"" Assange refers to these specific cables as "" insurance files "" that will be released "" if something happens to me or to WikiLeaks "" .
The Guardian has published stories based on more than 700 of the cables and has access to all 250,000 .
He said yesterday that the whistleblowers ' site would "" shortly "" continue publishing cables stories which would "" speak more of the same truth to power "" .
WikiLeaks began publishing the leaked cables through international media partners including the Guardian , part of the group that publishes MediaGuardian.co.uk , in late November .
Their release slowed over Christmas as the partner media organisations , which supplied redacted versions of the documents to WikiLeaks , scaled back their cable operations .
The 39-year - old Australian is currently fighting extradition from the UK to Sweden on accusations of rape and sexual assault .
Pilger , who counts Assange as a personal friend , last month offered to stand Â£20,000 in surety to secure the whistleblower 's bail .
Attempts by the US to take legal action against Assange should worry the mainstream media , he said .
"" I think what 's emerging in the mainstream media is the awareness that if I can be indicted , other journalists can , too , "" he added . ""
Even the New York Times is worried .
This used not to be the case .
If a whistleblower was prosecuted , publishers and reporters were protected by the first amendment , which journalists took for granted .
That 's being lost . ""
Despite pressure from the US on private companies to severe ties with WikiLeaks , Assange insisted that China is the real "" technological enemy "" of the site .
China has deployed "" aggressive and sophisticated "" interception technology to stop details of the diplomatic dispatches reaching its citizens , he said , adding that there were now "" all sorts of ways "" Chinese users could access the controversial material .

2011-01-17,"Julian Assange , the WikiLeaks founder , today pledged to make public the confidential tax details of 2,000 wealthy and prominent individuals , after being passed the data by a Swiss banker who claims the information potentially reveals instances of money - laundering and large - scale illegal tax evasion .
In a carefully choreographed handover in central London , Rudolf Elmer , formerly a senior executive at the Swiss bank Julius Baer , based in the Cayman islands , said he was handing the data to WikiLeaks as part of an attempt "" to educate society "" about the amount of potential tax revenues lost thanks to offshore schemes and money - laundering . ""
As banker , I have the right to stand up if something is wrong , "" he said .
"" I am against the system .
I know how the system works
and I know the day - to - day business .
I want to let society know how this system works because it 's damaging our society , "" he said .
Elmer will appear in a Swiss court on Wednesday charged with breaking Swiss banking secrecy laws , forging documents and sending threatening messages to two officials at his former employer .
He denies the charges .
He refused to comment on the period of time covered by the data , contained on two compact discs , or the precise source of the information ; nor would he give the names of any corporations or individuals whose details he was handing over , saying that the information needed to be "" investigated "" before it was released into the public domain .
Assange , making his first public appearance since being bailed in December on sex assault allegations , for which Sweden is seeking his extradition , said he would pass the information to the Serious Fraud Office(SFO ) , examine it to ensure sources were protected , and then release it on the WikiLeaks site , potentially within "" a couple of weeks "" .
"" Once we look at the data , yes , there will be full disclosure , "" he said .
He would not be drawn on questions relating to the extradition case , which will be heard at Belmarsh magistrates court on 7 February , or on other leaks the site has promised are forthcoming , including information involving a "" big US bank "" , which many believe to be Bank of America .
The site was not yet fully functional , he said .
"" We are not open yet for public business .
The volume of material that we would receive is too high for our internal mechanisms , but we are receiving in other ways , like this , in this manner , "" he said .
The release of leaked US diplomatic cables , which the site originally released through the Guardian and four other international media organisations , would continue , however .
Elmer said he was passing the information to WikiLeaks because he had previously approached universities with the information but it had not been followed up .
He said his attempts to interest the Swiss media had resulted only in his being dismissed as "" a paranoid person , a mentally ill person "" .
"" I was close to giving up , but then a friend of mine told me : ' There 's WikiLeaks . '
I looked at it and thought : ' That 's the only hope I have to [ let ] society know what 's going on . '
"" In 2008 , he released to the site a much smaller collection of documents , also detailing the tax details of some of the bank 's clients .
Though the site has never published that information , Julius Baer succeeded briefly in shutting down Wikileaks.org before the site , supported by a number of US media and civil liberties organisations , succeeded in overturning the injunction .
He also passed the information to the US tax authorities .
The data was later seen by the Guardian , which found "" details of numerous trusts in which wealthy people have placed capital .
This allows them lawfully to avoid paying tax on profits , because legally it belongs to the trust "" ; the data also "" [ appeared ] to include several cases where wealthy individuals sought to use trust money as though it were their own "" .
In a statement to the Observer on Friday , Julius Baer said : "" The aim of [ Elmer 's ] activities was , and is , to discredit Julius Baer as well as clients in the eyes of the public .
With this goal in mind , Mr Elmer spread baseless accusations and passed on unlawfully acquired , respectively retained documents to the media , and later also to WikiLeaks .
To back up his campaign , he also used falsified documents . ""
A spokeswoman for the SFO said it would "" consider allegations made to it to determine if the matter is within its jurisdiction and criteria for investigation or possibly for another authority to consider "" ."
2011-01-18,"There has been mounting disquiet among some members of the Frontline Club over the relationship forged between its founder , Vaughan Smith , and Julian Assange of WikiLeaks .
Now Smith has invited concerned members to an "" open forum "" tomorrow evening to discuss the issue .
It will begin with a conversation between Smith and John Owen , chairman of the club 's board of trustees .
Smith will explain the decision - making process behind the club 's involvement with Assange .
He spent two months working from the club before his arrest in early December .
He is facing extradition to Sweden .
When Assange was refused bail because he had no fixed abode , Smith offered his home in Norfolk as an address in order to secure bail for Assange .
He has been staying there since being released .
But some journalists who frequent the Frontline Club have become uneasy about Smith 's support for Assange , claiming that it raises issues of transparency and compromises the club 's neutrality .
Smith explained in an open letter to members on 7 December , the day he offered Assange an address for bail , why he considered it important to back the WikiLeaks co - founder : "" In the face of a concerted attempt to shut him down and after a decade since 9/11 that has been characterised by manipulation of the media by the authorities , the information released by WikiLeaks is a refreshing glimpse into an increasingly opaque world .
The Frontline Club was founded seven years ago to stand for independence and transparency .
Recent informal canvassing of many of our more than 1,500 members ... suggests almost all are supportive of our position . ""
But there have been rumblings of discontent in recent weeks .
Hence tomorrow 's meeting at the club in Paddington , west London .
NB : Only paid - up members are eligible to attend the discussion , which kicks off at 7 pm ."

2011-01-19,"A former Swiss banker has been arrested for passing apparently leaked account details to WikiLeaks , hours after he was found guilty of breaching Switzerland 's bank secrecy laws in another case .
The Zurich state police and state prosecutor said they were investigating whether Rudolf Elmer had broken Swiss banking law when he handed a CD of hundreds of offshore bank account holders to WikiLeaks 's founder Julian Assange at a press conference on Monday .
In a joint statement , they said : "" The state prosecutor 's office is checking to see whether Rudolf Elmer has violated Swiss banking law by handing the CD over to WikiLeaks . ""
Just hours before being taken into custody , Elmer had been found guilty of breaching banking laws for publicising private client data and for threatening an employee at his former firm Julius Baer .
He was fined 7,200 Swiss francs ( £ 4,714 ) , suspended for two years .
A written judgment will follow .
Following the verdict , Kurt Langhard , a lawyer for Julius Baer , said : "" We are satisfied . ""
The court ruling did not concern WikiLeaks and the defence will decide whether to appeal within 10 days .
Elmer , who helped bring WikiLeaks to prominence three years ago when he used it to publish secret client details , had admitted sending Julius Baer data to tax authorities .
Trial judge Sebastian Aeppli acquitted Elmer on charges that he sought $ 50,000 ( £ 31,276 ) for returning client data to his former employer and that he threatened to bomb the bank 's headquarters .
Elmer admitted writing anonymous emails in 2005 threatening to send client details to tax authorities and the media if Julius Baer did not stop unspecified actions .
He also admitted charges that he sent client details to Swiss tax authorities , but he denied making threats against former colleagues .
"" I am a critic of the system and want to tell society what happens in these murky oases , "" Elmer , who ran the Cayman Islands branch of the Swiss bank until he was fired in 2002 , told a news conference before the verdict .
Swiss bank secrecy has come under increasing scrutiny in recent years , with Germany buying secret data from informants in a bid to track down tax evaders .
Switzerland last year gave details of about 4,450 UBS accounts to US authorities as part of a deal to settle a tax probe into its biggest bank ."
2011-01-19,"The damage caused by the WikiLeaks controversy has caused little real and lasting damage to American diplomacy , senior state department officials have concluded .
It emerged in private briefings to Congress by top diplomats that the fallout from the release of thousands of private diplomatic cables from all over the globe has not been especially bad .
This is in direct opposition to the official stance of the White House and the US government which has been vocal in condemning the whistle - blowing organisation and seeking to bring its founder , Julian Assange , to trial in the US .
A congressional official briefed on the reviews told Reuters news agency that the administration felt compelled to say publicly that the revelations had seriously damaged American interests in order to bolster legal efforts to shut down the WikiLeaks website and bring charges against the leakers .
"" I think they want to present the toughest front they can muster , "" the official said .
The official implied that the WikiLeaks fiasco was bad public relations but had little concrete impact on policy .
"" We were told [ it ] was embarrassing , not damaging , "" the official added .
It appears that damage was localised in terms of a few specific cables , for example about Yemen , and thus expected to be containable in the long - run .
US officials say the continued media attention on revelations has made it difficult for Washington to repair relations with governments critical to its counter - terrorism operations , such as Pakistan and Yemen .
Last November Hillary Clinton , the secretary of state , strongly condemned the leak of more than 250,000 diplomatic cables , claiming : "" It puts people 's lives in danger , threatens our national security and undermines our efforts to work with other countries to solve shared problems . ""
She added : "" We are taking aggressive steps to hold responsible those who stole this information . ""
So far WikiLeaks has released just a fraction of a cache of diplomatic messages which came into its possession .
It has done so with the co - operation of several global news organisations like the Guardian , the New York Times and Der Spiegel .
The US government is currently checking to see if criminal charges can be brought against Assange who is in London fighting extradition to Sweden for questioning over allegations of sexual misconduct .
Damage assessments by the state department , Pentagon and US intelligence community are meanwhile still continuing to focus on the leaks .
The assessments also cover the leaking of tens of thousands of military field reports from Iraq and Afghanistan ."
2011-01-20,"Sweden 's extradition request for Julian Assange has raised concerns about onward extradition to the US , and the treatment that might be administered under US justice .
Yet , extradition arrangements with America are fair , follow due process and do not present fears for "" injustice "" – perhaps a hard and inconvenient statement for those with entrenched views about the US .
But is it accurate ?
Misunderstandings of the UK 's extradition arrangements with the US ( Scotland has its own system ) abound .
Consider the high - profile cases of Gary McKinnon to the US , the "" NatWest Three "" ( three British businessmen convicted in 2007 in the US of Enron - related offences ) , Ian Norris ( the retired business man extradited to the US last year on price - fixing allegations ) , and Julian Assange awaiting extradition to Sweden , with suggestions that US authorities are preparing an extradition request .
Advocates in some of these cases argue that the 2003 Extradition Act was intended simply for terrorist offences in the wake of 9/11 , but is being used for a range of extradition requests ; that British citizens are returned to the US too easily and without sufficient safeguards , which had existed under the previous Extradition Act ; and that those accused of crimes will not face a fair trial in the US .
These voices fail to understand that the Extradition Act 2003 was n't intended to deal only with terrorist offences , but replaced all existing extradition arrangements with European countries ( under part 1 of the act ) , and other countries with which Britain has bilateral treaties , such as the US ( under part 2 ) .
Therefore , anyone wanted by the American authorities would be sought under this process .
A frequent point made that US requests are not fair because of the removal of the prima facie bar , a standard English legal test that requires an initial case to be proven , does not warrant undue alarm .
This test was discarded over 15 years ago for many European nations , and no serious failings were exposed from that time to the new act 's introduction .
Indeed , any trial in the US will more than have to prove a substantial case , just as in English law : defendants are , in both jurisdictions , presumed innocent , until the prosecution case proves otherwise .
Anyone facing an American extradition request will receive protection .
English courts have to be satisfied that if the alleged ( or convicted ) conduct was committed here , it would result in an offence in English law that has a penalty of 12 months or more imprisonment ( or else the person would not be extradited ) .
Moreover , the affected person can challenge the rulings of the courts and of the home secretary .
And if anyone is wanted for political crimes , faces capital punishment ( execution ) or is likely to face additional charges that were n't in the extradition request , they will not be extradited .
As for the arguments about a fair trial , the fact of the matter is that America 's domestic legal system is a mature and advanced one .
No system is perfect , but the US trial system is as fair as any , and contains plenty of safeguards .
There are rigorous standards of evidence , full rights of defence , a well - trained and scrupulous judiciary , an advanced appeals system up to the state and US supreme courts ( depending on the nature of the offence ) and full transparency .
Any loud retorts about "" Guantánamo "" are not relevant to the cases in hand .
The Guantánamo issue is a discrete argument about the judicial status of war "" combatant "" detainees and the consequent law that should apply ; it does not apply to how civilians accused or convicted of crimes under the US penal code are treated .
We should not allow emotive appeals based on a few , high - profile and politically contentious cases to undermine our confidence in the US as a valued and safe extradition country partner ."
2011-01-21,"It has all the ingredients for a big - screen tale of intrigue and conspiracy : the plucky underdog vying to buck the system , sexual complications and powerful government forces with secrets to hide .
WikiLeaks :
the Movie moved a step closer to reality yesterday after studio executives picked up the screen rights to the forthcoming Julian Assange biography The Most Dangerous Man in the World by award - winning Australian writer Andrew Fowler .
The book details Assange 's life from his childhood on Magnetic Island in Queensland , Australia , all the way through to his founding of the whistleblower website in 2006 to publish classified material .
Assange has been labelled "" a high - tech terrorist "" by his foes and "" the internet 's freedom fighter "" by his supporters .
In November , WikiLeaks scored its most high - profile coup to date when it partnered with the Guardian to publish over 250,000 secret US diplomatic cables .
The full story story of the WikiLeaks scandal is covered in WikiLeaks :
Inside Julian Assange 's War on Secrecy , a behind - the - scenes account by the Guardian 's investigation editor David Leigh and Moscow correspondent Luke Harding .
The WikiLeaks book will be published by the Guardian on February 10 .
Assange incurred the ire of US authorities by publishing cables concerning American involvement in the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq .
He has also revealed details of toxic waste dumping in Africa and Guantánamo Bay procedures , as well as putting the contents of Church of Scientology manuals online .
The journalist and publisher remains on bail awaiting the outcome of an extradition request from Swedish authorities who want to question him over allegations of a sexual nature by two women .
He is also writing an autobiography after agreeing to a $ 1 m deal in December – in part to offset his mounting legal costs .
Producers Barry Josephson and Michelle Krumm , who have optioned The Most Dangerous Man in the World , say they are planning a "" suspenseful drama "" in the vein of All the President 's Men and with the thrill of a Tom Clancy novel .
"" As soon as I met Andrew and read a few chapters of his profound book , I knew that – with his incredibly extensive depth of knowledge – it would enable us to bring a thought - provoking thriller to the screen , "" Krumm told Variety .
As yet no director is attached to the project and there are no cast details ."
2011-01-21,"Suzanne Moore accuses Naomi Wolf of having "" muddled the personal with the political ""
( All this polite and smiley feminism is pointless .
It 's time to get angry , 15 January ) .
True , Wolf 's call for an end to anonymity for rape victims – following the Julian Assange extradition case – shows ignorance ( The morality of anonymity , 5 January ) .
We know no one who 's found the protection afforded by anonymity "" condescending "" .
Nor does it "" make rape prosecutions more difficult "" – low reporting ( about 10 % of rapes ) and low conviction rates result largely from negligent and biased investigations .
But Moore herself is muddled .
Somehow women concerned with the dangers the WikiLeaks founder faces – extradition , rendition and even execution – because of the effectiveness of WikiLeaks are "" losing their heads around Assange .
I picture Bianca Jagger washing his feet with her tears soon . ""
By dismissing Jagger , Moore removes upholding human rights and opposing dictatorships from feminist concern .
What an indictment of her feminism !
In this way the nub of the question is avoided : rape allegations against Assange can no longer be disentangled from the political agenda shaping how they are dealt with .
He 's become an easy target for expressions of fury and frustration at sexism .
As part of a movement of rape survivors for over 35 years , we campaign for justice and protection , for rape victims ' right to anonymity – and defendants ' right to be presumed innocent until proven guilty .
Moore rails against the "" pitiful results "" achieved by "" smiley "" feminism which fears to be labelled as "" man - haters "" .
She objects to "" silicone implants "" , "" shopping "" and the term "" sex workers "" : "" We are all sex workers these days … we are all encouraged to pursue lifelong sexiness . ""
She says , "" I want a movement . ""
And who does she propose ?
Pornography - obsessed Andrea Dworkin – "" batty "" , but she had "" balls "" .
Are "" balls "" what women need ?
We thought we needed principles .
Sadly they have been scarce .
Moore acknowledges that "" turning vulnerable young girls into drug - addicted prostitutes is disgusting in any culture "" , but belittles complaints about Jack Straw 's racist comments that Asian men "" target vulnerable young white girls "" .
Arguments "" about ethnicity and faith "" are not "" the central issue "" , she says .
Yet most "" groomers "" and rapists in the UK are , of course , white .
It is reminiscent of Susan Brownmiller 's Against Our Will , the feminist anti - rape bible , which was ambivalent on the lynching of 14-year - old Emmet Till for whistling at a white woman .
His whistling "" was … just short of physical assault , a last reminder … that this black boy , Till , had in mind to possess her "" .
Moore would do better to rail against feminists in government who rarely act for women and often act against us .
When she says "" Women are suffering most from the cuts that men are making "" , she forgets that Yvette Cooper 's welfare cuts insisted that even victims of domestic violence had to be available for work .
And when , after the Abu Ghraib horrors , we wrote to all women MPs about the rape and torture of Iraqi women , their silence was deafening ."
2011-01-25,"US investigators have been unable to find evidence directly linking WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange and Bradley Manning , the army private suspected of passing on confidential documents to the whistleblowing website , according to a report last night .
Jim Miklaszewski , NBC News 's chief Pentagon correspondent , reported sources inside the US military as saying they could detect no contact between Manning and Assange .
According to NBC News : The officials say that while investigators have determined that Manning had allegedly unlawfully downloaded tens of thousands of documents onto his own computer and passed them to an unauthorized person , there is apparently no evidence he passed the files directly to Assange , or had any direct contact with the controversial WikiLeaks figure .
If accurate , then US authorities have no realistic chance of successfully prosecuting or extraditing Assange for the leak of thousands of classified documents .
NBC also reported that the commander of Manning 's military jail at the Quantico US Marine base exceeded his authority in placing the private on suicide watch last week , and that army lawyers had the restrictions removed : Military officials said Brig Commander James Averhart did not have the authority to place Manning on suicide watch for two days last week , and that only medical personnel are allowed to make that call .
The official said that after Manning had allegedly failed to follow orders from his Marine guards .
Averhart declared Manning a "" suicide risk . ""
Manning was then placed on suicide watch , which meant he was confined to his cell , stripped of most of his clothing and deprived of his reading glasses â€
” anything that Manning could use to harm himself .
At the urging of US Army lawyers , Averhart lifted the suicide watch .
Manning remains in solitary confinement in his cell for 23 hours each day , with only one hour for exercise and one hour watching television .
Manning 's treatment has attracted criticism from human rights watchdog Amnesty International , which describes his conditions as "" inhumane "" : Manning is classed as a "" maximum custody "" detainee , despite having no history of violence or disciplinary offences in custody .
This means he is shackled at the hands and legs during all visits and denied opportunities to work , which would allow him to leave his cell .
ABC 's Jake Tapper raised questions about Manning 's treatment during Monday 's press briefing with White House spokesman Robert Gibbs :
Jake Tapper , ABC :
A quick question about Bradley Manning , suspected of leaking information .
Is the administration satisfied that he 's being kept in conditions that are appropriate for his accused crime and that visitors to Bradley Manning are treated as any visitors to any prison are treated ?
Robert Gibbs :
I have n't ,
you know , truthfully , Jake , have not heard a lot of discussion on that inside of here .
I 'm happy to take a look at something .
In terms of a specific question about that , I think that I would direct you to the authorities that are holding him ."
2011-01-28,"Back in the days when almost no one had heard about WikiLeaks , regular emails started arriving in my inbox from someone called Julian Assange .
It was a memorable kind of name .
All editors receive a daily mix of unsolicited tip - offs , letters , complaints and crank theories , but there was something about the periodic WikiLeaks emails which caught the attention .
Sometimes there would be a decent story attached to the emails .
Or there might be a document which , on closer inspection , appeared rather underwhelming .
One day there might arrive a diatribe against a particular journalist – or against the venal cowardice of mainstream media in general .
Another day this Assange person would be pleased with something we 'd done , or would perambulate about the life he was living in Nairobi .
In Britain the Guardian was , for many months , the only paper to write about WikiLeaks or to use any of the documents they were unearthing .
In August 2007 , for instance , we splashed on a remarkable secret Kroll report which claimed to show that former Kenyan president Daniel Arap Moi had been siphoning off hundreds of millions of pounds and hiding them away in foreign bank accounts in more than 30 different countries .
It was , by any standards , a stonking story .
This Assange , whoever he was , was one to watch .
Unnoticed by most of the world , Julian Assange was developing into a most interesting and unusual pioneer in using digital technologies to challenge corrupt and authoritarian states .
It 's doubtful whether his name would have meant anything to Hillary Clinton at the time – or even in January 2010 when , as secretary of state , she made a rather good speech about the potential of what she termed "" a new nervous system for the planet "" .
She described a vision of semi - underground digital publishing – "" the samizdat of our day "" that was beginning to champion transparency and challenge the autocratic , corrupt old order of the world .
But she also warned that repressive governments would "" target the independent thinkers who use the tools "" .
She had regimes like Iran in mind .
Her words about the brave samizdat publishing future could well have applied to the rather strange , unworldly Australian hacker quietly working out methods of publishing the world 's secrets in ways which were beyond any technological or legal attack .
Little can Clinton have imagined , as she made this much praised speech , that within a year she would be back making another statement about digital whistleblowers – this time roundly attacking people who used electronic media to champion transparency .
It was , she told a hastily arranged state department press conference in November 2010 , "" not just an attack on America 's foreign policy interests .
It is an attack on the international community . ""
In the intervening 11 months Assange had gone viral .
He had just helped to orchestrate the biggest leak in the history of the world – only this time the embarrassment was not to a poor east African nation , but to the most powerful country on earth .
It is that story , the transformation from anonymous hacker to one of the most discussed people in the world – at once reviled , celebrated and lionised ; sought - after , imprisoned and shunned – that this book sets out to tell .
Within a few short years of starting out Assange had been catapulted from the obscurity of his life in Nairobi , dribbling out leaks that nobody much noticed , to publishing a flood of classified documents that went to the heart of America 's military and foreign policy operations .
From being a marginal figure invited to join panels at geek conferences he was suddenly America 's public enemy number one .
A new media messiah to some , he was a cyber - terrorist to others .
As if this was n't dramatic enough , in the middle of it all two women in Sweden accused him of rape .
To coin a phrase , you could n't make it up .
Since leaving Nairobi , Assange had grown his ambitions for the scale and potential of WikiLeaks .
In the company of other hackers he had been developing a philosophy of transparency .
He and his fellow technologists had already succeeded in one aim : he had made WikiLeaks virtually indestructible and thus beyond legal or cyber attack from any one jurisdiction or source .
Lawyers who were paid exorbitant sums to protect the reputations of wealthy clients and corporations admitted – in tones tinged with both frustration and admiration – that WikiLeaks was the one publisher in the world they could n't gag .
It was very bad for business .
At the Guardian we had our own reasons to watch the rise of WikiLeaks with great interest and some respect .
In two cases – involving Barclays Bank and Trafigura – the site had ended up hosting documents which the British courts had ordered to be concealed .
There was a bad period in 2008/9 when the high court in London got into the habit of not only banning the publication of documents of high public interest , but simultaneously preventing the reporting of the existence of the court proceedings themselves and the parties involved in them .
One London firm of solicitors over - reached itself when it even tried to extend the ban to the reporting to parliamentary discussion of material sitting on the WikiLeaks site .
Judges were as nonplussed as global corporations by this new publishing phenomenon .
In one hearing in March 2009 the high court in London decided that no one was allowed to print documents revealing Barclays ' tax avoidance strategies – even though they were there for the whole world to read on the WikiLeaks website .
The law looked a little silly .
But this new form of indestructible publishing brought sharp questions into focus .
For every Trafigura there might be other cases where WikiLeaks could be used to smear or destroy someone .
That made Assange a very powerful figure .
The fact that there were grumbles among his colleagues about his autocratic and secretive style did not allay the fears about this new media baron .
The questions kept coming : who was this shadowy figure "" playing God "" ?
How could he and his team be sure of a particular document 's authenticity ?
Who was determining the ethical framework that decided some information should be published , and some not ?
All this meant that Assange was in many respects – more , perhaps , than he welcomed – in a role not dissimilar to that of a conventional editor .
As this book describes , the spectacular bursting of WikiLeaks into the wider global public eye and imagination began with a meeting in June 2010 between the Guardian 's Nick Davies and Assange .
Davies had sought out Assange after reading the early accounts that were filtering out about the leak of a massive trove of military and diplomatic documents .
He wanted to convince Assange that this story would have more impact and meaning if he was willing to ally with one or two newspapers – however traditional and cowardly or compromised we might be in the eyes of some hackers .
An agreement was struck .
And so a unique collaboration was born between ( initially ) three newspapers , the mysterious Australian nomad and whatever his elusive organisation , WikiLeaks , actually was .
That much never became very clear .
Assange was , at the best of times , difficult to contact , switching mobile phones , email addresses and encrypted chat rooms as often as he changed his location .
Occasionally he would appear with another colleague – it could be a journalist , a hacker , a lawyer or an unspecified helper – but , just as often , he traveled solo .
It was never entirely clear which time zone he was on .
The difference between day and night , an important consideration in most lives , seemed of little interest to him .
What now began was a rather traditional journalistic operation , albeit using skills of data analysis and visualisation which were unknown in newsrooms until fairly recently .
David Leigh , the Guardian 's investigations editor , spent the summer voraciously reading his way into the material .
The Guardian 's deputy editor in charge of news , Ian Katz , now started marshalling wider forces .
Ad hoc teams were put together in assorted corners of the Guardian 's offices in King 's Cross , London , to make sense of the vast store of information .
Similar teams were assembled in New York and Hamburg – and , later , in Madrid and Paris .
The first thing to do was build a search engine that could make sense of the data , the next to bring in foreign correspondents and foreign affairs analysts with detailed knowledge of the Afghan and Iraq conflict .
The final piece of the journalistic heavy lifting was to introduce a redaction process so that nothing we published could imperil any vulnerable sources or compromise active special operations .
All this took a great deal of time , effort , resource and stamina .
Making sense of the files was not immediately easy .
There are very few , if any , parallels in the annals of journalism where any news organisation has had to deal with such a vast database –
we estimate it to have been roughly 300 million words ( the Pentagon papers , published by the New York Times in 1971 , by comparison , stretched to two and a half million words ) .
Once redacted , the documents were shared among the ( eventually ) five newspapers and sent to WikiLeaks , who adopted all our redactions .
The extent of the redaction process and the relatively limited extent of publication of actual cables were apparently overlooked by many commentators – including leading American journalists – who spoke disparagingly of a "" willy nilly dump "" of mass cables and the consequent danger to life .
But , to date , there has been no "" mass dump "" .
Barely two thousand of the 250,000 cables have been published and , six months after the first publication of the war logs , no one has been able to demonstrate any damage to life or limb .
It is impossible to write this story without telling the story of Julian Assange himself , though clearly the overall question of WikiLeaks and the philosophy it represents is of longer lasting significance .
More than one writer has compared him to John Wilkes , the rakish 18th - century MP and editor who risked his life and liberty in assorted battles over free speech .
Others have compared him to Daniel Ellsberg , the source of the Pentagon Papers leak , described by the New York Times 's former executive editor , Max Frankel , as "" a man of incisive , devious intellect and volatile temperament "" .
The media and public were torn between those who saw Assange as a new kind of cyber - messiah and those who regarded him as a James Bond villain .
Each extremity projected on to him superhuman powers of good or evil .
The script became even more confused in December when , as part of his bail conditions , Assange had to live at Ellingham Hall , a Georgian Manor set in hundreds of acres of Suffolk countryside .
It was as if a Stieg Larsson script had been passed to the writer of Downton Abbey , Julian Fellowes .
Few people seem to find Assange an easy man with whom to collaborate .
Slate 's media columnist , Jack Shafer , captured his character well in this pen portrait : "" Assange bedevils the journalists who work with him because he refuses to conform to any of the roles they expect him to play .
He acts like a leaking source when it suits him .
He masquerades as publisher or newspaper syndicate when that 's advantageous .
Like a PR agent , he manipulates news organisations to maximise publicity for his ' clients ' , or , when moved to , he threatens to throw info - bombs like an agent provocateur .
He 's a wily shape - shifter who wo n't sit still , an unpredictable negotiator who is forever changing the terms of the deal .
"" We certainly had our moments of difficulty and tension during the course of our joint enterprise .
They were caused as much by the difficulty of regular , open communication as by Assange 's status as a sometimes confusing mix of source , intermediary and publisher .
Encrypted instant messaging is no substitute for talking .
And , while Assange was certainly our main source for the documents , he was in no sense a conventional source –
he was not the original source and certainly not a confidential one .
Latterly , he was not even the only source .
He was , if anything , a new breed of publisher - intermediary – a sometimes uncomfortable role in which he sought to have a degree of control over the source 's material ( and even a form of "" ownership "" , complete with legal threats to sue for loss of income ) .
When , to Assange 's fury , WikiLeaks itself sprang a leak , the irony of the situation was almost comic .
The ethical issues involved in this new status of editor / source became more complicated still when it was suggested to us that we owed some form of protection to Assange – as a "" source "" – by not inquiring too deeply into the sex charges leveled against him in Sweden .
That did not seem a compelling argument to us , though there were those
– it is not too strong to call them "" disciples "" – who were not willing to imagine any narrative beyond that of the smear .
These wrinkles were mainly overcome – sometimes eased by a glass of wine or by matching Assange 's extraordinary appetite for exhaustive and intellectually exacting conversations .
As Sarah Ellison 's Vanity Fair piece on the subject concluded : "" Whatever the differences , the results have been extraordinary .
Given the range , depth , and accuracy of the leaks , the collaboration has produced by any standard one of the greatest journalistic scoops of the last 30 years . ""
The challenge from WikiLeaks for media in general ( not to mention states , companies or global corporations caught up in the dazzle of unwanted scrutiny ) was not a comfortable one .
The website 's initial instincts were to publish more or less everything , and they were at first deeply suspicious of any contact between their colleagues on the newspapers and any kind of officialdom .
Talking to the State Department , Pentagon or White House , as the New York Times did before each round of publication , was fraught territory in terms of keeping the relationship with WikiLeaks on an even keel .
By the time of the Cablegate publication , Assange himself , conscious of the risks of causing unintentional harm to dissidents or other sources , offered to speak to the State Department – an offer that was rejected .
WikiLeaks and similar organisations are , it seems to me , generally admirable in their single minded view of transparency and openness .
What has been remarkable is how the sky has not fallen in despite the truly enormous amounts of information released over the months .
The enemies of WikiLeaks have made repeated assertions of the harm done by the release .
It would be a good idea if someone would fund some rigorous research by a serious academic institution about the balance between harms and benefits .
To judge from the response we had from countries without the benefit of a free press , there was a considerable thirst for the information in the cables – a hunger for knowledge which contrasted with the occasional knowing yawns from metropolitan sophisticates who insisted that the cables told us nothing new .
Instead of a kneejerk stampede to more secrecy , this could be the opportunity to draw up a score sheet of the upsides and drawbacks of forced transparency .
That approach – a rational assessment of new forms of transparency – should accompany the inevitable questioning of how the US classification system could have allowed the private musings of kings , presidents and dissidents to have been so easily read by whoever it was that decided to pass them on to WikiLeaks in the first place .
Each news organisation grappled with the ethical issues involved in such contacts – and in the overall decision to publish – in different ways .
I was interested , a few days after the start of the Cablegate release , to receive an email from Max Frankel , who had overseen the defence of the New York Times in the Pentagon papers case 40 years earlier .
Now 80 , he sent me a memo he had then written to the New York Times public editor .
It is worth quoting as concise and wise advice to future generations who may well have to grapple with such issues more in future :
1 .
My view has almost always been that information which wants to get out will get out ; our job is to receive it responsibly and to publish or not by our own unvarying news standards .
2 .
If the source or informant violates his oath of office or the law , we should leave it to the authorities to try to enforce their law or oath , without our collaboration .
We reject collaboration or revelation of our sources for the larger reason that ALL our sources deserve to know that they are protected with us .
It is , however , part of our obligation to reveal the biases and apparent purposes of the people who leak or otherwise disclose information .
3 .
If certain information seems to defy the standards proclaimed by the supreme court in the Pentagon papers case ie that publication will cause direct , immediate and irreparable damage we have an obligation to limit our publication appropriately .
If in doubt , we should give appropriate authority a chance to persuade us that such direct and immediate danger exists .
( See our 24-hour delay of discovery of Soviet missiles in Cuba as described in my autobiography , or our delay in reporting planes lost in combat until the pilots can perhaps be rescued . )
4 .
For all other information , I have always believed that no one can reliably predict the consequences of publication .
The Pentagon papers , contrary to Ellsberg 's wish , did not shorten the Vietnam war or stir significant additional protest .
A given disclosure may embarrass government but improve a policy , or it may be a leak by the government itself and end up damaging policy . ""
Publish and be damned , "" as Scotty Reston used to say ; it sounds terrible but as a journalistic motto it has served our society well through history .
There have been many longer treatises on the ethics of journalism which have said less .
One of the lessons from the WikiLeaks project is that it has shown the possibilities of collaboration .
It 's difficult to think of any comparable example of news organisations working together in the way the Guardian , New York Times , Der Speigel , Le Monde and El País have on the WikiLeaks project .
I think all five editors would like to imagine ways in which we could harness our resources again .
The story is far from over .
In the UK there was only muted criticism of the Guardian for publishing the leaks , though their restraint did not always extend to WikiLeaks itself .
Most journalists could see the clear public value in the nature of the material that was published .
It appears to have been another story in the US , where there was a more bitter and partisan argument , clouded by differing ideas of patriotism .
It was astonishing to sit in London reading of reasonably mainstream American figures calling for the assassination of Assange for what he had unleashed .
It was surprising to see the widespread reluctance among American journalists to support the general ideal and work of WikiLeaks .
For some it simply boiled down to a reluctance to admit that Assange was a journalist .
Whether this attitude would change were Assange ever to be prosecuted is an interesting matter for speculation .
In early 2011 there were signs of increasing frustration on the part of US government authorities in scouring the world for evidence to use against him , including the subpoena of Twitter accounts .
But there was also , among cooler legal heads , an appreciation that it would be virtually impossible to prosecute Assange for the act of publication of the war logs or state department cables without also putting five editors in the dock .
That would be the media case of the century .
And , of course , we have yet to hear an unmediated account from the man alleged to be the true source of the material , Bradley Manning , a 23-year - old US army private .
Until then no complete story of the leak that changed the world can really be written .
But this is a compelling first chapter in a story which , one suspects , is destined to run and run .

WikiLeaks :
Inside Julian Assange 's war on secrecy is published on Monday"
2011-01-30,"WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange disguised himself as an old woman in a wig for fear he was being followed by US intelligence , according to a Guardian book published tomorrow .
The first full , inside account of the story that dominated global headlines for weeks reveals how a secret deal was brokered in a Brussels hotel that led to five international media outlets simultaneously publishing disclosures based on the leak of 250,000 US diplomatic cables .
The leak has led to calls from US right - wingers for Assange to be indicted on espionage charges , or even assassinated .
The alleged source , US army private Bradley Manning , is being held under harsh conditions in a military prison in Quantico , Virginia .
WikiLeaks :
Inside Julian Assange 's War on Secrecy , which begins serialisation in the Guardian today , discloses what lay behind the sometimes - fraught negotiations with Assange .
At one stage the Australian computer hacker and his lawyers "" ambushed "" Guardian editor - in - chief Alan Rusbridger and threatened to sue him for endangering WikiLeaks 's "" financial assets "" .
Tomorrow 's first extract reveals court documents about Assange 's Australian childhood , and the strange personality of the man his supporters call the messiah of the internet .
When the teenage Assange was convicted of hacking , the court was told he was a gifted boy with a "" tragic "" background whose "" computer is his only friend "" .
The book also describes the project 's cloak and dagger measures .
Assange dressed up as a woman and took elaborate steps to lose pursuing cars as he travelled to Ellingham Hall , the Norfolk stately home where his followers secretly set up camp last November .
Some of the journalists involved communicated using throwaway "" burner "" phones inspired by the TV series The Wire , and encrypted Jabber chat software .
In his introduction to the book Rusbridger acknowledges that the relationship between the five international papers and WikiLeaks had "" moments of difficulty and tension "" , at times threatening to collapse into farce , "" as if a Stieg Larsson script had been passed to the writer of Downton Abbey , Julian Fellowes "" .
But Rusbridger says Assange behaved as "" a new breed of publisher - intermediary "" who sought to have a degree of control over the information he brought to the table .
But he concludes : "" WikiLeaks and similar organisations are generally admirable in their single - minded view of transparency and openness "" .
The book also details : â€¢ How Assange said US informants "" deserve to be killed "" .
â€¢
The full story of the Swedish sex allegations that Assange 's supporters claimed were a honeytrap .
â€¢
Why Assange quarrelled with the Guardian 's star reporter Nick Davies .
â€¢
How Assange paid a notorious anti - semite to represent WikiLeaks in Russia .

2011-01-30,"Julian Assange awakes to talk , from the nap he has stolen in an armchair at the Norfolk country house where he is staying .
He has been up all night disseminating , on his WikiLeaks site , US State Department cables and documents relevant to the momentous events unfolding in Egypt , and they make remarkable reading .
The American diplomats writing the cables leaked to Assange report many of the reasons for the Egyptian uprising : torture of political dissidents , even common criminals , to obtain confessions ; widespread repression and fear ; and â€ “ of special interest to anyone who follows WikiLeaks â€ “ the increasingly important role of internet activism , opposition blogging and communication with democratic movements within and without the country over the web .
As ever with the diplomatic memorandums published by WikiLeaks â€ “ an act of dissemination for which Assange has become public enemy number one in the US â€
“ the cables are , ironically , testimony to the professionalism and straight- talking of the US State Department .
Assange concedes that the cables contain "" a relative honesty and directness , and quite a lot of wannabe Hemingway "" .
This is exactly what WikiLeaks considers itself established to do , exactly the kind of moment in history that Assange 's organisation feels it can illuminate for the world â€ “ and to which it may even have contributed , he claims , "" by creating an attitude towards freedom of expression "" , and by being read by Egyptians themselves .
This should be one of the great days in the history of his organisation : Assange and a group of his colleagues huddled over a thicket of laptop computers , downloading , following events , sharing news and occasionally whooping at it .
It is one hell of an hour in WikiLand , but a weird one , too , for other things are also on Assange 's mind .
Tomorrow a book he considers to be an attack on him will be published by journalists with whom he once closely collaborated at the Guardian , sister newspaper to the Observer .
Neither the Guardian nor Assange now speaks of one another with affection .
The front page of the International Herald Tribune on the kitchen table next door carries an article of record length by the executive editor of the New York Times , Bill Keller , charting what Keller sees as an odyssey through the dealings with a difficult man , after which a "" period of intense collaboration and regular contact with our source "" came to a close â€ “ and an acrimonious one at that .
Keller 's article appears reasoned , I say to Assange , who retorts that he finds it "" grotesque "" .
Moreover , in eight days ' time Assange must face an extradition hearing instigated by authorities in Sweden , wishing to question him over alleged sex offences , a subject that his lawyers had advised him not to speak about in this interview .
The hearings in London are due for 7 - 8 February â€ “ and on the first night , "" right in the middle of the hearings "" , says Assange , "" BBC Panorama will broadcast a sleazy piece "" about Wiki - Leaks .
"" It 's a mad scramble to get books out that self - justify their roles in all this , "" claims Assange , "" instead of getting on with the job of writing about the information and the cables themselves .
"" It was not , he concedes , always this way .
I first met Julian Assange in late summer last year , when he was staying at the Frontline Club for journalists in London .
We had convened to discuss , for an article in Frontline 's quarterly broadsheet , what was then the biggest single leak of official material in history , pertaining to the war in Iraq .
In partnership with Iraq Body Count â€ “ considered to be ( and criticised by the left for being )
the more exacting and forensic of groups seeking to quantify the toll of Tony Blair 's and George W Bush 's war â€ “ WikiLeaks revealed , via the Guardian and other outlets of its choosing , 16,000 previously unrecorded civilian deaths between January 2004 and the end of 2009 , recorded in thousands of leaked US army reports .
Assange had , among many other interesting things to say , a cogent observation about warfare : "" What these documents show is that the bulk of civilian deaths are the ' car crashes ' of war , not the ' bus crashes ' of war that are picked up by the media .
It is the vast number slain in incremental events killing one , two or three people which go unreported , as opposed to the deaths of 20 or more , which are reported .
The number of ' small kills ' is huge â€ “ a family here , a kid there , someone in a house , someone caught in a crossfire .
It is the everyday squalor of war that takes the life of most . ""
This finding was riveting for two reasons .
First , because it authenticated my own experience in trying to demonstrate the calamitous levels of civilian casualties during the Iraq invasion in spring 2003 .
In the hospital in Nasiriyah from which Private Jessica Lynch had been "" rescued "" by US forces ( with the help of Iraqi medical staff ) , I found the wounded Kaham Kassim and his wife , two of whose children were shot dead by US troops at a roadblock as they tried to flee town .
A third â€ “ a five - year - old girl , Zainab â€ “ was dying when she and her parents were turned out of beds in a barracks to make way for wounded soldiers .
I found several similar cases .
The other intriguing reason was the way Assange had arrived at his conclusion , which seemed more scientific than journalistic .
He asked me to bear in mind that his background was as a computer hacker and specialist in quantum mechanics .
He was fascinated by the "" media information flow economy "" .
People forget Assange is as interested in physics as he is in ideology , and that much of his work has been motivated by an application of the laws of mechanics to information .
At that first meeting , he pulled a book off the shelf and talked at length about the many propulsions and interests that had got it there
â€ “ "" multiple reasons why the book has arrived on that shelf "" .
There was also "" a miasma of interests behind the spread of information , "" he said , "" and the reasons why a piece of information reaches you.""And the conversation went on for seven hours in that compelling vein .
Those were the days when Assange would invite you to return and visit him in his room at Frontline when some elaboration on a point he had made came to mind .
Before it all got nasty , before solitary confinement and forests of television cameras parked outside the Norfolk house belonging to Vaughan Smith â€ “ Assange 's guarantor of an address on bail .
Before Assange became uncomfortable with questions based on articles by Keller that throw his thought patterns off course .
Before Assange came to feel vilified and betrayed by the media .
Yet there was still time to talk , on Friday , with the sun streaming into Ellingham Hall â€ “ though it felt mean to drag Assange away from Egypt .
One of the main points raised in Keller 's article is that the New York Times ' voyage through WikiLeaks ' information put the paper on a high wire â€ “ or in a "" clash of values "" â€ “ between its commitment to publishing material of public interest and Keller 's staff 's "" large and personal stake in the country 's security "" and loyalty to the US , especially in the face of terrorism aimed "" not only against our people and our buildings but also at our values "" .
There have been suggestions elsewhere that WikiLeaks has supplied grist to the mill of America 's enemies and even endangered the lives of those who are identified in material it has disseminated itself â€
“ identities that Keller 's paper was careful to redact .
"" How do you best attack an organisation ? "" retorts Assange rhetorically .
First , "" you attack its leadershipâ€
¦ with the dozens of wildly fabricated things said about me in the press â€ “ such as that I was living in luxury in South Africa .
I have never been to South Africa . ""
Second , "" you attack the cash flow "" : Assange recounts the "" extra - legal "" sanctions by Visa , MasterCard , PayPal and others that have "" cost us 90 % of our revenue "" .
And then "" you attack our moral standing .
There have even been claims we have killed people .
Although no person is infallible , we have to date a perfect record in two important respects .
One : we have not once , in our four years of publishing , got it wrong .
We have never published something that was false and said that it was true .
Two : despite our publication of serious material on over 100 countries , no one has come to any harm ; neither is there any specific claim that anyone has .
"" Two of WikiLeaks ' sources are in jail , however : Bradley Manning , alleged source of the army diary leaks , and Rudi Elmer , the former Swiss banker who handed Assange two disks of allegedly confidential financial information in London two weeks ago .
Elmer was re - arrested in Zurich last week
and is now being held without charge in solitary confinement .
"" I ca n't talk about our sources , "" says Assange , "" but I can talk about what is happening to them .
Manning , over 240 days in solitary , harsh solitary conditions , and still not tried .
"" In both cases , "" there 's an immediate decision to find someone to blame for the exposures , rather than find culprits responsible for the crimes .
It is a matter of ' save face , or you will lost control ' . ""
Another criticism often levelled at WikiLeaks is that bursting the banks of information in this way will only lead to the construction of new flood defences by powerful institutions ; in other words to more , not less , secrecy . ""
The reaction by large corporations and government power , "" says Assange , "" to a substantial increase in disclosure to the public was thought about in depth in 2006 , when we launched WikiLeaks . ""
The idea that powerful institutions would "" go off record "" in such a way is fanciful , he argues ; discovering their behaviour will always be possible by obtaining internal records . ""
For instance , when I obtained the manual for standard operating procedure at GuantÃ¡namo Bay , I was surprised to see that it included not only many inhumane practices , but it instructed guards to falsify records to the Red Cross .
[ Because ] there is no way for the centre of an organisation to reliably have its peripheral elements reliably carry out its ordersâ€ ¦ there is a clear , authorised paper trail .
Any form of large - scale abuse must be systemised . ""
And the acquisition of that paper trail , he argues , is the way to expose the abuse .
In this situation , organisations have two choices , says Assange .
One is to "" engage in plans that the public will support if they are revealed "" , meaning that they will have nothing to fear from transparency .
The other is to "" spend additional resources to keep those plans secret "" .
The second , more common , course entails a toll on the economic logic of the organisation , which Assange calls a "" secrecy tax "" .
Also , "" when an organisation acts in a more clandestine manner "" , he says , "" its own internal efficiency decreases , because information can not flow quickly through the organisation .
This is another form of secrecy tax . ""
For organisations to be efficient , they should be transparent , he insists .
I put it to him that all this is heading in the right direction from the point of view of persuading organisations of the virtues of transparency .
"" It 's not optimism "" , he says , suddenly animated , "" it 's part of the plan ! ""
Of all the thousands of columns about WikiLeaks , few opened up the discourse more than David Rieff in the New Republic last December , which invoked cyber - baron Bill Gates 's doctrine of "" universal connectivity "" on the web almost as a new ideology .
Rieff makes an analogy between the WikiLeaks saga and the legal and popular challenges to Microsoft over the restrictions to "" universal connectivity "" built into its products , saying "" the state is like Microsoft , with its closed - source technology , while WikiLeaks is the open - source alternative "" .
Assange says : "" We called their bluff regarding how much ' universal connectivity ' the political system really wanted after the cold war "" .
He talks about "" an unusual alliance "" during the cold war between liberalism and the "" military - intelligence - diplomatic sphere "" , both of which sought to illustrate freedom of expression as epitomising "" our cultural valuesâ€ ¦ in pointing out the lack of freedoms in the Soviet Union "" .
But the end of the cold war coincided with "" new technology permitting more to be published , more cheaply , to a wider audience than ever before "" â€ “ so there ensued a "" clash between the surface ideology and the real underlying self - interest "" ; between "" the rise of the internet on one handâ€ ¦ and , on the other , the government 's natural interest to tolerate as little dissent as possible "" .
And so it would go on if Assange were not distracted by what he sees as the forthcoming blizzard of books and TV programmes about him and the speed with which he has become a bÃªte noire of the Anglo - American media .
"" I think he 's held a mirror up to the media , "" says Vaughan Smith , his host , "" to the idea of the media as priesthood , and I do n't think we come out of it very well .
"" Smith , the owner and founder of the Frontline Club , was challenged by some of its divided membership at a meeting last week over his shelter of and perceived support for Assange , though most supported it .
Assange points out that "" non - Anglo media organisations are broadly supportive "" , citing an editorial in Spain 's El PaÃ­s , a book in Germany called WikiLeaks : Enemy of the State and the fact that Le Monde in France named him man of the year .
But today even these discourses must come to an abrupt stop , as Assange 's principal aide bursts into the room â€ “ "" Quick , quick !
The people have taken over Alexandria ! ""
â€ “ and Assange , though sleepless , leaps from his chair .
With some relief , it seems , he grabs a laptop , swivels round to sit on the floor and taps , taps ,
excitedlyâ€ ¦"

2011-02-01,"WikiLeaks is spawning , please forgive the pun , lots of leak - a - like sites .
Clones are springing up across the world , as ReadWriteWeb reports here , with examples in Belgium , the Balkans , the Philippines , Israel and Indonesia .
And Reuters lists more in Europe , including OpenLeaks.org , whose principal creator is Daniel Domscheit - Berg , a German who was once Julian Assange 's closest collaborator .
One of the latest is based in the United States , localeaks , which has been developed by a journalism college student .
It provides a drop - box for whistleblowers to leak information on behalf of 1,400 American newspapers .
It has launched in advance of a possible "" in - house submission system "" planned by the New York Times .
Sources : ReadWriteWeb / Yahoo News"
2011-02-03,"As the cables rolled out day by day , an ugly , and in many ways deranged , backlash took place in the US .
A vengeful chorus came mostly from Republicans .
Former Alaska governor Sarah Palin , darling of the unhinged right , denounced Julian Assange 's "" sick , un - American espionage "" and came close to inciting his assassination : "" Why was he not pursued with the same urgency we pursue al - Qaida and Taliban leaders ?
â€
¦
He is an anti - American operative with blood on his hands . ""
But it was Senator Joe Lieberman , Senate homeland security committee chairman , a foreign policy hawk and maverick Democrat , who was the most practical attack dog .
Lieberman described the leak in apocalyptic terms as "" an outrageous , reckless and despicable action that will undermine the ability of our government and our partners to keep our people safe and to work together to defend our vital interests "" .
He stopped short of denouncing Assange as a "" terrorist "" but said : "" It 's a terrible thing that WikiLeaks did .
I hope we are doing everything we can to shut down their website . ""
Contrary to the bloodcurdling claims made in public about the crimes of WikiLeaks , senior state department officials appeared to have concluded by mid - January that the WikiLeaks controversy had caused little real and lasting damage to American diplomacy .
Reuters news agency reported on 19 January 2011 that in private briefings to Congress , top US diplomats admitted the fallout from the release of thousands of private diplomatic cables across the globe had not been especially bad .
One congressional official briefed on the reviews told Reuters that the administration felt compelled to say publicly that the revelations had seriously damaged American interests in order to bolster legal efforts to shut down the WikiLeaks website and bring charges against the leakers .
"" I think they want to present the toughest front they can muster , "" the officials said .
The tacit retraction of Hillary Clinton 's lurid claim that the release of the WikiLeaks cables had been an attack on the entire international community followed the equally low - key admission that Assange did not in fact have "" blood on his hands "" from the release of the earlier Iraq and Afghan war logs .
That may have been thanks to the learning curve imposed on Assange by his mainstream partners .
Assange eventually agreed to make extensive redactions in what he published on the Wikileaks site , to prevent reprisals against individuals .
But his initial attitude had been very different .
Declan Walsh , the Guardian 's Islamabad correspondent , recalls one tense evening : "" We went out to a Moorish restaurant , Moro , with the two German reporters .
David Leigh broached the problem again with Julian .
The response floored me . '
Well , they 're informants , ' he said . '
So , if they get killed , they 've got it coming to them .
They deserve it . '
There was , for a moment , silence around the table .
I think everyone was struck by what a callous thing that was to say . """
2011-02-03,"Buried away inside today 's Guardian , there 's a touching insight into the impact of the WikiLeaks cables on countries such as Tunisia and Egypt , the giant of the Arab world whose fate now hangs in the balance .
The article suggests that when I fretted at the time about the asymmetry of the leaked diplomatic cables – the fact that we were all reading US material , but not equivalent data from far shadier states – I got it back to front by concentrating on producers , not consumers .
In their new book on the WikiLeaks affair , one of a flood heading our way , my colleagues David Leigh and Luke Harding note the varied response to the pre - Christmas publication in the Guardian , the New York Times and the other mainstream media then dealing with Julian Assange .
On the kneejerk left , some people felt the cables failed to reveal enough misconduct by US diplomats and therefore must have been censored .
On the American right , populist politicians such as Sarah Palin denounced the leaks in extravagant terms as a major crime , virtually inciting Assange 's assassination in some cases .
My own response was closer to what Leigh and Harding dismiss as the "" metropolitan yawn from bien pensants who felt they knew it all "" .
Fair enough , we did feel that , and that most people who read broadsheets newspapers or listen to Radio 4 must have thought leaks a bit over - hyped .
That 's modern media for you .
Where we were wrong , suggests today 's extract from WikiLeaks :
Inside Julian Assange 's War on Secrecy ( I 've not yet paid my £ 9.99 or £ 6.99 for an online Guardian bargain ) , is in underestimating "" the hunger for the cables in countries that did n't have fully functioning democracies or the sort of free expression enjoyed in London , Paris or New York "" .
In consequence , the Guardian 's leaks team took a flood of calls from editors and journalists around the world asking what the 300m - word cache said about their own country – not easy for colleagues sifting a mountain of cables in friendly competition with a vastly better staffed parallel trawl by the New York Times .
I 'm told that our lot emerged creditably .
We still ca n't draw solid conclusions about how this kind of data journalism – trawling the internet for stuff – is going to affect the wider world long term any more than we can confidently evaluate the convulsions now shaking the Arab world .
Will the long - suffering people of these countries , the rotting victims of a decaying Ottoman empire for centuries before the western European imperialists moved into the region in the 19th century , emerge with better , more accountable governments ?
Or will they slide into new autocracies like the cruel and increasingly incompetent theocracy in Iran ?
I suppose I should add Iraq , too , at this point for fairness , though that outcome , too , is uncertain .
Since it 's always best to try and be optimistic , we may one day look back on the past decade – especially the events now unfolding – as the one when Islam in the Arab world ( the two are politically and socially inseparable ) finally embraced the modern world as more successful Muslim states such as Indonesia and Malaysia have now done .
I do n't share Simon Jenkins 's well - defined pessimism , that all this is none of our business and that – from Kosovo to Kabul – the west ( east too ) does more harm than good by our interventions .
Great powers have great responsibilities , as China is discovering and Britain ( America 's "" deputy sheriff "" , as a senior British official put it this week ) knows because it used to be a great power .
We do good , we do bad – but either way , we have interests .
In the Middle East , they are acute because the region still holds two - thirds of the world 's proven oil reserves ( half the gas ) which make our faltering economies function and help China 's and India 's race ahead .
Thus three of the past five global recessions have followed a geopolitical shock in the Middle East , and even the bankers ' crash of 2007 - 9 became serious only in late 2008 after Lehman Brothers crashed but also after oil prices doubled to $ 148 a barrel in a year .
With characteristic calm , today 's Daily Mail predicts a £ 90 petrol tank for Mondeo Man in 2011 .
Oil is one just one factor .
Immigration across the Med , crime , religious fanaticism ( much of it funded by oil - rich Saudi Arabia ) , Iran 's nuclear ambitions , footloose capital from oil - sodden Gulf States which help , or hurt , our economies –
the list is a long one .
Watching Cairo 's crowds on TV , you can be forgiven for being both cheered and fearful .
Yesterday , the pro - Mubarak goons were out on the street , menacing anti - government protesters .
We should not be surprised by that
, it 's part of the familiar pattern .
I 've seen it at first hand myself in Asia and Latin America .
It does not mean that the regime will survive , only that it is fighting to rescue what it can for the Chinese - style military - industrial - political complex which enjoys most of Egypt 's growing economic wealth .
The ace in its hand is stability and security –
few people want chaos and disorder to engulf their country .
Which of us would ?
The Egyptian army , the backbone of the state , is the key .
Such a law and order agenda can be manipulated and probably is , both in Egypt and in other Arab countries facing unrest like Jordan – and those still held down .
The outcome in Tunisia , where WikiLeaks helped focus a simmering resentment ( as the US ambassador noted in his cables ) , is far from clear .
Leigh and Harding note that some Tunisians gave America brownie points for candour about the old regime – conspicuously absent from analysis by France , the ex - colonial power .
No surprise there , then !
But the White House has to decide when it has to jump ship to maintain stability – it has now abandoned Hosni Mubarak – which is too expedient to ever look attractive .
But optimists ca n't endorse free elections , as everyone should , without acknowledging the risk that accompanies a free expression of views .
Egypt 's Islamist Muslim Brotherhood seems to be accepted as a major player in society .
Does that mean that Egyptians would vote for them – or treat them as most British Catholics treat their own theological leaders , to be listened to but not governed by ?
Listening to some evasive answers by a Muslim Brotherhood spokesman on Radio 4 's Today a few minutes ago , I was not encouraged about his views on a religious council adjudicating on the laws of the state , the Shia Iranian model .
We 're not against Israel , we are against injustice , he also said – which sounds better .
But did I hear him say "" if a lady like Margaret Thatcher ruled over Egypt we would support her "" ?
I did .
Steady on there , chaps .
But that 's the thing about free elections , people get to elect who they want .
Maggie or , dare I say it , even the Muslim Brotherhood ."

2011-02-07,"Julian Assange will appear in court today for a two - day hearing as he attempts to resist extradition to Sweden .
The WikiLeaks founder is wanted for questioning in Sweden over allegations of rape , molestation and unlawful coercion , made by two women over 10 days in August .
He denies the charges .
Yesterday his solicitor said Assange 's full defence argument would be published on the legal firm 's website at 10 am today .
Preliminary defence arguments released by Assange 's legal team claim "" there is a real risk that , if extradited to Sweden , the US will seek his extradition and/or illegal rendition to the US , where there will be a real risk of him being detained at GuantÃ¡namo Bay or elsewhere . ""
The document adds that "" there is a real risk that he could be made subject to the death penalty "" if sent to the US .
Under European law , suspects can not be extradited to jurisdictions where they may face execution .
Nils Rekke , head of the legal department at the Swedish prosecutor 's office in Stockholm , said the 39-year - old Australian would be protected from transfer to the US by strict European rules .
"" If Assange was handed over to Sweden in accordance with the European arrest warrant , Sweden can not do as Sweden likes after that , "" he said .
"" If there were any questions of an extradition approach from the US , then Sweden would have to get an approval from the United Kingdom . ""
Assange 's lawyers will battle extradition on the grounds that he has not been charged with a crime in Sweden and is only wanted for questioning .
They argue that "" it is a well - established principle of extradition law ... that mere suspicion should not found a request for extradition "" .
Lawyers for Sweden have yet to disclose their legal arguments .
The case is being heard at Belmarsh magistrates court in London .
Judge Howard Riddle is likely to take several weeks to consider his ruling , which can be appealed against by either side ."
2011-02-07,"The prosecutor leading the rape and sexual assault case against Julian Assange is a "" malicious "" radical feminist who is "" biased against men "" , a retired senior Swedish judge has told the hearing into Assange 's extradition to Sweden .
In caustic evidence on the first day of the two - day hearing , Brita Sundberg - Weitman , a former appeal court judge , told Belmarsh magistrates court that Sweden 's chief prosecutor , Marianne Ny , who is seeking the WikiLeaks founder 's extradition , "" has a rather biased view against men "" .
"" I ca n't understand her attitude here .
It looks malicious , "" she said .
Geoffrey Robertson QC , acting for Assange , asked if it was her view that Ny wanted "" to get [ Assange ] into her clutches and then arrest him no matter what ? ""
"" Yes "" said Sundberg - Weitman .
"" It might be her attitude to have the man arrested and maybe let him suffer for a few weeks to have him softer [ for interrogation ] . ""
Such was the hostility towards Assange in Sweden that "" most people take it for granted that he 's raped two women "" , she said .
The country is seeking Assange 's extradition in relation to allegations of rape , sexual assault and sexual molestation made by two women in August .
He denies all the allegations and has not been charged .
Under cross - examination by Clare Montgomery QC , for the Swedish government , however , Sundberg - Weitman admitted she had no personal knowledge of the conduct of the prosecutor in the case , basing her views instead on what she had been told .
She also acknowledged that while she believed the warrant to have been disproportionate , a Swedish district court and the appeal court , considering evidence from Assange 's Swedish lawyer BjÃ¶rn Hurtig , had judged it both proportionate and legal .
"" I must say I am very concerned about the state of the rule of law in Sweden , "" she said in response .
"" It has been decaying since the mid-1970s . ""
The hearing is being presided over by Judge Howard Riddle , the chief magistrate .
Assange listened intently from the dock , watched by supporters including Jemima Goldsmith , Bianca Jagger and Tony Benn , who had agreed to attend following an invitation from Goldsmith .
Montgomery also led the former judge to acknowledge that she was not an expert in the European arrest warrant , despite criticising its use in this case , and challenged line by line the newspaper article on which she said she was basing her assertion that Ny was a "" radical feminist "" .
Sundburg - Weitman pointed to lectures on sexual violence that the prosecutor had made , to which Montgomery said : "" But she 's a rape prosecutor . ""
The former judge maintained her assertion that the prosecutor was "" a bit biased "" .
Robertson argued that both Ny and Claes BorgstrÃ¶m , the lawyer representing the two women , were politically motivated .
Ny had illegally confirmed Assange 's identity on the charges when asked by a Stockholm tabloid , he said ( accused sex offenders are customarily anonymous in Sweden ) .
"" This man BorgstrÃ¶m "" , meanwhile , had vilified Assange in the press and "" would be behind bars for contempt in this country , "" the lawyer said .
Also called by the defence was GÃ¶ran Rudling , a Swedish blogger and campaigner on the country 's rape laws , which he believes are not tough enough .
Rudling said he was not a supporter of Assange or WikiLeaks , but had taken an interest in the case after finding tweets that were later deleted sent by "" Miss A "" , one of the two women , in the hours after the alleged offences , in which she had asked if anyone was holding a crayfish party that she could attend with Assange , and in a tweet from the partythat she was "" sitting outside at 2 am , with the coolest and smartest people "" .
"" It meant that the story told to police was not consistent with the tweets , "" he said .
He had reported the tweets to police but had not heard back from them , he said .
Rudling also translated another document for the court that he had found on the internet , entitled "" A seven point programme for legal revenge "" , apparently posted by Miss A in January 2010 but deleted in November .
The last point included the admonition : "" Remember , your victim has to suffer as much as he made you suffer . ""
Asked had he seen the police file relating to the case , Rudling said his knowledge was based on a 100-page bundle of documents faxed in November by Hurtig to Mark Stephens , Assange 's British solicitor , and leaked onto the internet last week .
Earlier , Robertson , in opening the case for the defence , said that the Swedish custom of trying rape cases in secret was a "" flagrant denial of justice "" .
Assange had been subject to "" trial by media "" , and it was "" hyperbolic and irrational to suggest there was wickedness involved "" in Assange 's sexual behaviour , he said .
All relationships had "" moments of frustration , irritation and argument "" , he said .
"" It does n't mean that the police are entitled to slip between the bedclothes . ""
The act of "" minor rape "" allegedly committed by Assange against the second woman would not be an extradition offence in English law , he said .
After three "" utterly consensual "" sex acts , she had objected to Assange having sex with her again without a condom , but "" she let him continue "" .
"" It 's not natural to call this rape . ""
Outside court , Assange said that since August "" a black box has been applied to my life .
On the outside of that black box has been written the word rape .
That box has now , thanks to an open court process , been opened .
I hope in the next days you will see that the box is in fact empty . ""
The case continues ."
2011-02-07,"Sweden 's attempt to extradite Julian Assange has placed a spotlight on the procedure for extradition between European countries â€ “ the European arrest warrant .
The little - known legal instrument has been controversial since it was introduced in 2003 under the Labour government and then home secretary , David Blunkett .
It was described as a mechanism for fast - tracking extraditions across Europe for terrorism and serious crime , initially agreed as part of moves to tighten security for cross - border offences just days after the 11 September terrorist attacks .
The EAW speeds up extradition within Europe by providing a uniform set of procedures once a country receives a warrant from another on the continent .
The regime replaces the bilateral arrangements that had existed between countries .
It also removes the discretion for the secretary of state , who could previously order or refuse extradition .
Only district judges , sitting in a magistrates court , have the power to refuse an extradition request from another European country â€ “ on the basis of limited grounds , many of which have been disputed by the Assange legal team .
An extradition can be refused on the basis that the alleged offence is not "" extraditable "" , or that the warrant was flawed .
For an EAW request to be granted the warrant must have been issued by the requesting country , must indicate a formal charge and be served on the person accused .
Lawyers often argue that human rights considerations , such as evidence that the defendant would not receive a fair trial in the requesting country , should prevent extradition in individual cases .
This argument is being made by Assange 's lawyers .
However , judges have relatively limited discretion to block extradition requests from other European countries .
Similar constraints exist in respect of extraditions outside the EU , in particular to the US , where a separate treaty entered into in 2003 provides for people in the UK to be extradited there upon the US government 's request .
Advocates argue that the long - running case of Gary McKinnon shows that the home secretary should have discretion to block extraditions to the US in exceptional circumstances , such as where a person facing extradition would face an unfair prison sentence , or there is a risk of suicide .
The government has so far said it does not have a discretion to block extraditions on this basis .
Other European countries also have bilateral extradition treaties with the US , including Sweden which has an agreement dating back to 1961 .
Assange 's legal team have claimed the threat of a further extradition from Sweden to the US , should the EAW be granted , is an additional reason to refuse his extradition ."

2011-02-08,"Julian Assange 's Swedish lawyer was shown scores of text messages sent by the two women who accuse him of rape and sexual assault , in which they speak of "" revenge "" and extracting money from him , an extradition hearing was told .
Björn Hurtig , who represents the WikiLeaks founder in Sweden , told Belmarsh magistrates court that he had been shown "" about 100 "" messages sent between the women and their friends while supervised by a Swedish police officer , but had not been permitted to make notes or share the contents with his client .
"" I consider this to be contrary to the rules of a fair trial , "" he said .
A number of the messages "" go against what the claimants have said "" , he told the court .
Sweden is seeking the WikiLeaks founder 's extradition in relation to allegations of rape , sexual assault and sexual molestation .
He denies the accusations .
One message referred to one of the women being "" half asleep "" while having sex with Assange , Hurtig said , as opposed to fully asleep . ""
That to my mind is the same as saying ' half awake ' .
"" One of the women alleges that Assange had sex with her while she was sleeping .
But the lawyer admitted that Swedish prosecutors had tried to interview his client before he left the country , contradicting earlier claims by Assange 's legal team and his own witness statement .
Hurtig told the extradition hearing that he had been wrong to assert that the prosecutor Marianne Ny had made no active attempt to interview Assange between her appointment to the case , on 1 September last year , and 27 September , when Assange left the country with her permission .
Under cross - examination by Clare Montgomery QC for the Swedish government , Hurtig admitted the prosecutor 's office had contacted him on 22 September requesting an interview .
Montgomery asked him to take out his mobile and read two text messages received on that date .
One , in Swedish , he translated as : "" Hello , is it clear if it 's going to be good to have interrogation on Tuesday , 1700h ? ""
Hurtig said he could not recall calling Assange after receiving the request , but was sure he would have done .
"" You should bear in mind that it was very difficult to get hold of him during this time , "" he said .
The omission was "" embarrassing and should n't have happened "" , he said .
"" It 's true that that gave an impression that was to Julian 's advantage . ""
But he insisted it was accidental :
"" I am myself a member of the Swedish bar association and it 's important that what I say is right .
It 's also important for Julian that my statement is reliable and correct . ""
The hearing did not conclude in the allotted two days and will resume on Friday .
Judge Howard Riddle is not expected to deliver his judgment immediately .
He agreed to amend Assange 's bail conditions until Friday , lifting the requirement that he attend a police station near his rural bail address each afternoon .
Earlier , the court heard from a retired prosecutor who said the conduct of the prosecutor had been "" quite peculiar "" in not seeking to interview Assange earlier .
Sven - Erik Alhem said he would also have tried to have Assange interviewed in the UK before seeking his extradition .
He added , however , that if he were Assange "" I would have gone to Sweden immediately to give my version of events . ""
Outside court , Assange tried to put the spotlight on the Swedish prosecutor : "" She has refused to come to these hearings .
Our witnesses were brought from Sweden , my lawyer was brought from Sweden and expensively cross - examined .
"" Where is the equality in this case ?
There is not an equality .
Rather , we see an unlimited budget of Sweden and the UK being spent on this matter and my rather limited budget being spent in response . ""
His lawyer , Mark Stephens , said : "" We have seen Hamlet without the princess .
We have seen a prosecutor who has been ready to feed the media with information but has been unprepared to come here and subject herself to the cross - examination she knows she can not withstand . """
2011-02-08,"No doubt , in the coming days , many more column inches will be dedicated to Julian Assange 's battle against extradition to Sweden .
His case , however , is the tip of the iceberg .
In 2009 more than 4,000 people were extradited under Europe 's fast - track extradition system , 700 from the UK alone .
This kind of EU co - operation may help in the fight against crime but the benefits of a streamlined system should be weighed against the heavy toll taken upon an individual when surrendered to another state .
A few days ago , four of Fair Trials International 's clients spoke in parliament about their personal extradition ordeals .
These examples clearly demonstrate that the European arrest warrant is not operating "" efficiently and in the interests of justice "" .
Frank Symeou explained how his 21-year - old son , Andrew , spent a year in horrendous prison conditions in Greece .
Eighteen months after he was extradited
he is still waiting for the trial to start .
Edmond Arapi described his 12-month battle against extradition to Italy where , with no notice whatsoever , he had been sentenced to 16 years for murder .
Ultimately , Italian judges were persuaded that Arapi could not possibly have committed the crime and the wrong man had been convicted .
He had spent weeks in custody , torn from his young family .
Similar examples of injustice are happening all over Europe .
In the Netherlands , for example , a political storm is brewing over the case of Cor Disselkoen , a 65-year - old man who is due to be extradited to Poland ( a country that issues about one - third of European arrest warrants ) .
Disselkoen suffers from a severe heart condition and is the primary carer for his terminally ill son .
He faces charges for an alleged fraud dating back to the mid-1990s , allegations he strenuously denies .
Given the notoriously bad conditions in Polish prisons there is a fear that , if extradited , he would not survive the ordeal .
At the heart of the problem with the European arrest warrant is the inability or unwillingness of Europe 's judges to prevent injustice .
The standard retort to arguments against extradition is that we must co - operate with our European neighbours , we must trust them to do the right thing .
We do , of course , need an effective system of extradition in Europe : we can not allow people to evade justice by crossing Europe 's open borders .
Given the grave human consequences of extradition , the current blind faith approach to justice is not acceptable .
On occasion , judicial frustration at this no - questions - asked system overflows .
Last year , before concluding that he could not stop Garry Mann 's extradition to Portugal , Lord Justice Moses spoke of the court 's "" inability … to rectify what appears to be a serious injustice to Mr Mann "" .
"" I can not believe anybody wants this man to go and do two years in an Albufeira jail .
It is just an embarrassment for everybody , this whole case , and it ought to disappear , "" he said .
Garry is in Portugal serving a two - year sentence .
The scales finally seem to be falling from the eyes of those responsible for the warrant .
A review is under way in the UK to examine its operation and the European justice commissioner , Viviane Reding , has recently acknowledged "" there is considerable room for improvement in the operation of the arrest warrant system "" .
The challenge is to fix the system by building in much - needed safeguards against misuse and injustice .
Fair Trials International has given the UK 's extradition review panel suggestions on how this could be achieved .
Until it is , many more people will suffer an unjustified extradition ordeal and public confidence in the European arrest warrant will continue to ebb away .
Jago Russell is chief executive of Fair Trials International"
2011-02-09,"Alongside the obvious questions of freedom of information and criminal justice , the Julian Assange affair has also made visible a multitude of contemporary anxieties concerning sex and gender .
This was brought into sharp relief by claims that Assange 's prospects of a fair trial might be compromised by the possibility that Sweden 's chief prosecutor Marianne Ny is a "" malicious radical feminist "" with a "" bias against men "" .
But what exactly is radical feminism ?
If popular attitudes to feminism are anything to go by , it 's clearly something pretty terrifying .
Research suggests that , in the popular imagination , the feminist – and the radical feminist in particular – is seen as full of irrational vitriol towards all men , probably a lesbian and certainly not likely to be found browsing in Claire 's Accessories .
As an academic working on issues concerning gender and politics , I 've had the good fortune of meeting lots of inspiring feminist women – and men – but despite searching I 've yet to locate a feminist matching that particular description .
Perhaps I have n't looked hard enough .
A more likely possibility is that the popular insistence that radical feminists – and often by implication feminists in general – are all man - haters reflects wider misunderstandings about the history of feminism and its impact on contemporary gender relations .
So what is radical feminism ?
Historically , radical feminism was a specific strand of the feminist movement that emerged in Europe and North America in the late 1960s .
Distinctive to this strand was its emphasis on the role of male violence against women in the creation and maintenance of gender inequality ( as argued by the likes of Susan Brownmiller , Andrea Dworkin and Catherine MacKinnon ) .
And while a minority of radical feminists – most infamously
Valerie Solanas – were hostile to men , radical feminism was much more instrumental in generating widespread support for campaigns around issues such as rape , domestic violence and sexual harassment .
However , in Britain at least , radical feminism has never been particularly dominant , partly because – in the eyes of many socialist and postcolonial feminists – it has been insufficiently attentive to the intersections between gender inequality and other categories , such as race and class .
So Rod Liddle 's peddling of the tiresome rightwing idea that radical feminism has destroyed the family , along with Dominic Raab 's assault on "" feminist bigotry "" and the Vatican 's efforts to address "" distortions "" caused by radical feminism , rest on at least two implausible assumptions .
First , they reduce feminism to a horrifying caricature that never really existed and second , they make the frankly bizarre suggestion that radical feminism is the dominant ideology of our times .
It would seem that not only do these radical feminists commit the outrage of not wearing makeup , but they use the time this frees up to consolidate their world domination .
Or an alternative explanation might be that these are the paranoid anxieties of fearful anti - feminists .
Their fear is not totally misplaced , for radical feminism has undoubtedly had some success .
Fortunately for Dominic Raab , world domination is not one of them .
Three decades ago , the notion that rape and domestic violence are pressing political issues rather than trivialities , or that men should play an active role in childcare , would have been seen by many as radical and dangerous .
Today , thanks to the influence of the insights of diverse strands of feminism ( including , but not limited to , radical feminism ) , these ideas have seeped into the mainstream .
Despite this , genuine gender equality can seem distant , but many groups and individuals continue to push in the right direction .
Although the rights and wrongs of the Assange affair are at this stage far from clear , whenever accusations of "" man - hating feminism "" enter into a debate , our suspicions should be immediately aroused .
For more often than not , the temptation to close down debate by tossing around accusations of man - hating radical feminism is caused not by a fear of debate , but by the deeper fear that feminism might actually have something important to say ."
2011-02-09,"Is there a legitimate demand for the use of live , text - based communications from the courtroom ?
That 's one of the questions that the Judicial Office for England and Wales is asking in a new consultation paper .
Because I spent a couple of days this week sending tweets from the courtroom where Julian Assange is challenging extradition to Sweden –
and as I started writing this in court when the evidence started to get rather dull –
my affirmative answer to this question will surprise nobody .
After all , if you were looking for the most appropriate case to launch the Twitter era of court reporting , you could n't do better than Assange .
It 's not just the international appetite for news of the case , particularly among those with an interest in electronic communications .
It 's not just the evidence we heard that one of Assange 's alleged victims had deleted tweets that were helpful to the defendant .
It 's that reporters covering an extradition case enjoy all the advantages of court reporting and none of the downsides : accurate reports are privileged against libel but there is no risk of prejudicing a British jury .
So while reporters from the Guardian and elsewhere have been providing valuable running news reports on the evidence , I have tried to give my followers more of an impression of who was winning the argument .
I even offered the occasional comment .
When Björn Hurtig , Assange 's Swedish lawyer , alleged from the witness box that Swedish prosecutors had leaked information to the press about the WikiLeaks founder , I ventured that he had no sense of irony .
There was an immediate response from someone who said : "" It 's not terribly difficult to argue that individuals should be allowed privacy protection and governments should not .
"" I tweeted back that WikiLeaks had breached the privacy of individuals , arguing that even those who worked for governments had a right to privacy .
All this was going on while the witness was still giving evidence .
That was not a problem in this case – professional judges are presumed not to be influenced by tweets or even pieces such as this – but it could certainly have been seen by a jury if Assange was being tried on charges of breaking the Official Secrets Act .
And it exposes the fundamental difficulty inherent in controlling Twitter .
As the consultation paper frankly acknowledges , even if a journalist tweeting from a courtroom has complied with the requirements of the Contempt of Court Act 1981 , "" other users of Twitter may respond to these posts by posting or linking to prejudicial material or commentary which would not be admissible in court "" .
And that , of course , assumes that the only people tweeting from court are trained journalists who understand the requirements of "" fair and accurate reporting "" .
The paper wrestles with the problem of access to Twitter in the courtroom , suggesting at one point that the only people in court allowed to use mobile devices might be those in the press seats .
But who would they be ?
The family courts are already familiar with the concept of "" accredited journalists "" –
those with a recognised press card .
But the courts also know that journalism is not a profession : the right to freedom of expression demands that anyone can profess to be a journalist .
As the paper says : "" Student newspapers , bloggers and social commentators may wish to engage in live , text - based communications from court but would not necessarily have media accreditation .
"" They could apply to the judge for accreditation on a case - by - case basis , as they may in the family courts .
But they could not be presumed to have the same appreciation as accredited journalists of the legal framework surrounding court reporting or the industry standards set by the Press Complaints Commission ( PCC ) .
Instant reporting without self - restraint is more likely to produce prejudicial reporting .
There is only one answer to this problem and the wider risk of prejudice inherent in the internet .
Without relaxing our contempt laws , we must simply acknowledge that there is an increasing risk that juries will have read and seen things that are prejudicial to defendants they are trying .
Judges must put much greater emphasis than they do now on explaining to juries why they are required to try cases only on the evidence they hear in court .
Just as we no longer sequester juries in hotels while they are deliberating , we should no longer pretend that we can protect juries from being influenced through modern communications .
Twitter has become a form of public broadcasting – as the PCC has acknowledged – and there is nothing the courts can do to stop it .

2011-02-10,"Julian Assange has threatened to sue a former friend and collaborator who has written a book portraying the WikiLeaks founder as an "" emperor "" who was obsessed by power and money and who had a fondness for young women .
Daniel Domscheit - Berg , a German computer scientist who was a spokesman for the whistleblowing site until last autumn , said the legal threat showed that Assange had become "" exactly the kind of person he used to hate and wanted to expose "" .
At a press conference in Berlin , he said : "" We need to set the record straight before Assange turns into a cult , a pop phenomenon . ""
The 32-year - old said he had received a letter from Assange 's lawyer accusing him of sabotage over revelations in his memoir , Inside WikiLeaks â€
“
My Time with Julian Assange at the World 's Most Dangerous Website , which is being published in 20 countries over the next week .
Domscheit - Berg claims in the book that he and a top programmer seized the submission system when they defected from the organisation last September , along with around 3,500 documents in the system at the time .
He told reporters that he had committed no crime and had taken the system for "" safe - keeping "" .
He also accused Assange of exaggerating WikiLeaks ' functionality in recent months .
He said that , contrary to the claim that the site 's submission system was not working because it had been besieged with more leaks than it could process , the system has been broken ever since he walked out , taking key software with him .
This , said a WikiLeaks spokeswoman , amounted to a confession of sabotage .
Asked about the ostensibly sensational bank leaks Assange keeps suggesting he is ready to release , Domscheit - Berg said the only banking documents he knew WikiLeaks had were "" totally unspectacular "" .
In the book , he questions Assange 's attitude to money , saying that he and other staff members expressed reservations about charging TV companies a fee to use footage of a "" collateral murder "" video , showing a US air crew in Iraq targeting civilians and photographers , but were summarily overruled .
More allegations of Assange 's philandering are made in the book , which claims he would regularly "" boast about how many children he had fathered "" , and preferred women "" younger than 22 "" .
Domscheit - Berg is soon to launch his own whistleblowing site , Open Leaks ."
2011-02-10,"WikiLeaks is threatening to take legal action against a former employee whose book chronicling his time with the organisation characterises its founder , Julian Assange , as obsessed by power and money and with a fondness for young women .
A statement from WikiLeaks said it was taking unspecified action against Daniel Domscheit - Berg , a German national who was once Assange 's closest collaborator , after extracts of his book were printed on another site .
Kristinn Hrafnsson , a spokeswoman for WikiLeaks , told the Forbes website that Domscheit - Berg confessed in his book to sabotaging the organisation 's submission system for new leaks and that he had been suspended from his duties last September .
In a response to Forbes , Domscheit - Berg denied sabotage and ridiculed the legal threat , saying he had received a letter from a lawyer representing Assange "" written in the worst German I ever read "" , which failed to mention a single law he might have broken .
Assange 's latest falling out with former collaborators – among them the Guardian – will focus attention on accusations he runs WikiLeaks as a personal fiefdom , something alleged in the book by Domscheit - Berg , who has now helped to set up OpenLeaks.org , a rival whistleblowing site .
The extracts from a forthcoming English edition of Inside WikiLeaks :
My Time with Julian Assange at the World 's Most Dangerous Website , say that Domscheit - Berg and other WikiLeaks malcontents took control of the main system used to accept leaked materials , deliberately keeping these out of Assange 's hands as they feared he could not be trusted to protect sources .
It says : "" We were not motivated by revenge .
And we did not want to get our own hands on the material , or divert it to OpenLeaks .
We just decided to take away these dangerous toys so that Julian could not do harm to anyone else . ""
This passage , the WikiLeaks spokeswoman said , amounted to a confession of sabotage .
His action had necessitated "" an overhaul of the entire submission system , an ongoing project that is not being expedited due to its complex nature and the organisation 's need to focus its resources on publication and defence "" .
Domscheit - Berg rejected this in his statement to Forbes .
"" The overhaul of the system is needed because the owner and developer of that system has decided to no longer allow WikiLeaks to use it , due to the lack of trust in Julian and the way he is ' leading ' this organisation , and Julian behaving irresponsibly with source material , "" he said .
Domscheit - Berg also questioned Assange 's attitude to money , saying he and other staff members expressed reservations about charging TV companies a fee to use footage of the "" collateral murder "" video , showing a US air crew in Iraq targeting civilians and photographers , but were summarily overruled .
Domscheit - Berg claims Assange refused to reimburse the costs of investigators who had travelled to Iraq to do background research on the video .
He also claims that Assange refused to accept other views , writing : "" Julian always cut off any discussions between me and the others . '
Do not challenge leadership in times of crisis , ' was one of his favourite answers to any critical questions we asked . ""
The book touches on Assange 's alleged philandering , saying he would regularly "" boast about how many children he had fathered in various parts of the world "" , and preferred women "" younger than 22 "" .
The WikiLeaks statement did not go into these details but dismissed Domscheit - Berg 's role in the group as limited : "" He has falsely misrepresented himself in the press as a programmer , computer scientist , security expert , architect , editor , founder , director and spokesman .
He is not a founder or co - founder and nor was there any contact with him during the founding years .
He did not even have an email address with the organisation until 2008 ( we launched in December 2006 ) .
He can not programme and wrote not a single programme for the organisation , at any time . ""
In his response , Domscheit - Berg denied that he had ever made such claims .
•
After this story was published we were contacted by Daniel Domscheit - Berg , who said the extracts of the book come from an unauthorised translation containing errors .
In particular he wishes to point out that he did not claim Julian Assange liked women younger than 22 , but aged around 22 ."
2011-02-11,"The accusation of sexual assault made against Julian Assange by one of his two alleged Swedish victims describes "" the missionary position "" , his lawyer said in court , as he denied such an attack took place .
Geoffrey Robertson QC told the extradition hearing , at Belmarsh magistrate 's court in south London , that any resistance had been "" unarticulated "" on the part of Miss A , who has accused the WikiLeaks founder of ripping off her clothes , snapping a necklace , pinning her down and trying to force himself on her without wearing a condom . ""
In so far as Mr Assange held her arms and there was a forceful spreading of her legs , there 's no allegation that this was without her consent , "" he said .
"" Sexual encounters have their ups and downs , their ebbs and flows .
What may be unwanted one moment can with further empathy become desired .
These complex human interactions are not criminal in this country . ""
The argument that Assange used the weight of his body to pin her down "" describes what is usually termed the missionary position , "" he said .
Sweden is seeking Assange 's extradition in relation to the allegations of rape , sexual assault and sexual molestation by the two women .
The second woman , Miss B , accuses Assange of having sex with her while she was sleeping , which amounts to an allegation of rape .
Assange denies all the allegations , and is fighting the extradition request .
He has not been charged .
The defence argues that the sexual behaviour would not amount to rape and sexual assault in English law , and that the European arrest warrant against him was invalid .
But Clare Montgomery QC , for the Swedish prosecutor , said of Miss A 's account : "" In popular language , that 's violence . ""
The account given by Miss B , meanwhile , "" would undoubtedly be rape here .
If you penetrate a sleeping woman there 's an evidential assumption that she did not consent .
"" The defence had unsuccessfully sought an adjournment following remarks this week by the Swedish prime minister , Fredrik Reinfeldt , in which , Robertson said , he had vilified Assange as "" public enemy number one "" in Sweden and created a "" toxic atmosphere "" against him .
Reinfeldt is reported to have said that Assange 's defence team had patronised Swedes by criticising its legal system .
"" What worries me is that [ Assange 's lawyers ] are trying to shy away from the fact that there exist allegations that are very serious , "" he told Swedish channel TV4 .
Montgomery said the prime minister was responding in part to media briefings given by Assange and his lawyers outside court .
"" You may think that those who seek to fan the flames of a media firestorm ca n't be too surprised when they get burnt . ""
Robertson , summing up , restated the defence argument that the Swedish prosecutor , Marianne Ny , was not authorised to issue the warrant for his extradition , and that the warrant sought Assange for interrogation rather than prosecution , which the defence says is illegal .
The Swedish practice of hearing rape trials in secret , he said , was "" antipathetic to the British rule of law that justice must be seen to be done "" .
Montgomery said the use of the word "" secret "" was "" a parody "" , arguing that while evidence at rape trials was heard in private , legal arguments and judgment were public .
Outside court , Assange , who said that Montgomery had represented the former Chilean president Augusto Pinochet at an extradition hearing told reporters : "" We have not been able to present my side of the story .
I have never been able to present my side of the story . ""
He hoped his case would highlight "" abuses "" suffered by others who did not benefit from the same media spotlight .
The parties will return to court on 24 February , when the district judge , Howard Riddle , will deliver his judgment ."
2011-02-18,"The Australian ambassador to Sweden has written to the country 's justice minister seeking assurances that Julian Assange , the WikiLeaks founder , would be treated justly under Swedish and international law , should he be extradited there .
Assange , an Australian citizen , is currently fighting extradition from Britain to Sweden over allegations of rape , sexual assault and sexual molestation made by two women in August last year , which he denies .
He will learn within days whether his attempt to resist the European arrest warrant has been successful .
His letter to Sweden 's minister for justice , Beatrice Ask , ambassador Paul Stephens writes , is to convey the Australian government 's "" expectation that , should Mr Assange be brought into Swedish jurisdiction , his case would proceed in accordance with due process and the provisions prescribed under Swedish law , as well as applicable European and international laws , including relevant human rights norms "" .
He does not state what reasons , if any , Australia might have for seeking such assurances .
Assange 's lawyers argue that the conduct of the Swedish prosecutor has been "" illegal and/or corrupt "" in confirming his identity to the press against Swedish custom for accused sex offenders , and issuing a warrant without charge .
The Swedish custom of hearing evidence in sex abuse cases in private is , they say , "" a flagrant denial of justice "" .
They also argue that extraditing the Australian to Sweden would be a breach of his human rights , suggesting this would make more likely his onward extradition to the US , where a number of politicians have called for his imprisonment , or worse , over WikiLeaks ' publication of leaked US embassy cables .
Such a move would carry a "" real risk "" of Assange being confined in GuantÃ¡namo Bay or facing the death penalty , according to a skeleton argument released last month by his legal team .
Assange will learn his fate on Thursday , when chief magistrate Howard Riddle will deliver his judgment on the extradition warrant .
The magistrate has already spoken of the strong likelihood of an appeal from one side or the other , whatever his judgment .
Earlier this month Assange , who is currently on bail in the UK , appealed to the Australian prime minister , Julia Gillard , to "" bring me home "" .
"" There have been outrageous and illegal calls to have me and my staff killed , clear cases of incitement to violence , "" he said in a video message to supporters in Melbourne . ""
Yet the Australian government has condoned this behaviour by its diplomatic silence . ""
The Swedish justice ministry declined to comment on the Australian ambassador 's letter , saying only that the judiciary is independent and the established norm is that ministers never comment on ongoing court cases .
Speaking to the Guardian earlier this month , Ask said there had been no political influence on any of the decisions taken by Swedish prosecutors in the Assange case . ""
Meeting the law , each one of us is worth as much as one another .
That 's the whole principle of justice , that the law works in the same way whoever breaks it .
"" The government had had no discussions with the US regarding Assange 's case , she said , but she did not believe that the conduct of WikiLeaks in leaking the cables had been contrary to Swedish law .
"" People can have opinions about what is in the information , but Swedish regulations on freedom of speech and press are very liberal â€ ¦ the publisher is not liable . """
2011-02-23,"It is "" very likely "" that a senior district judge will order the extradition of Julian Assange to Sweden to face sexual assault charges , a barrister at Matrix Chambers predicted this week .
Julian Knowles , who has written books on extradition law , was being interviewed on Law in Action , the weekly programme I present for BBC Radio 4 .
He dismissed two preliminary arguments raised by Assange 's defence team : that the Swedish prosecutor Marianne Ny had no power to issue a European arrest warrant and that the WikiLeaks founder was wanted merely for questioning rather than to face trial .
"" There is no doubt that a Swedish prosecutor does have the power to issue warrants , "" said Knowles . ""
And the Swedish prosecutor has made it clear that Mr Assange is wanted for trial if he goes back .
Unless he can demonstrate his innocence before trial , he will be tried . ""
Another argument put forward by Assange was that the allegations of rape and sexual assault against him did not amount to offences for which he could be extradited .
Again , though , Knowles was unimpressed .
If what 's alleged against Assange had taken place in the UK , the barrister explained , it would "" obviously "" constitute sexual assault .
As for the claim that there might be a breach of Assange 's right to a fair trial because some of the evidence against him would be heard behind closed doors , Knowles said that the threshold of unfairness was a very high one : "" You have to show there would be no meaningful trial at all . ""
And the barrister was scathing about defence arguments that Assange might be re - extradited from Sweden to the US , where he might be held at GuantÃ¡namo Bay or face the death penalty .
"" That is , frankly , a hopeless argument , "" Knowles said .
This was confirmed by Amy Jeffress , the US justice department 's attache to the American embassy in London . ""
The president , of course , has decided to close GuantÃ¡namo Bay , "" she told Law in Action , "" and so no one is going to GuantÃ¡namo Bay and that claim is baseless . ""
Jeffress added that the US always gave assurances in any case for which it had requested extradition that prosecutors would not seek the death penalty .
But Thursday 's ruling by Judge Riddle will not be the end of the story .
The losing side has a right of appeal to the high court and will certainly exercise it .
So the case might not be resolved before the summer .
Jeffress stressed that no charges had been brought against Assange over in the US , although she confirmed that there was an investigation into the WikiLeaks case and accepted that any application to a grand jury for a federal arrest warrant would be heard in private .
But what would happen if the US requested Assange 's extradition while he was still at risk of being sent to Sweden ?
It would then be up to the home secretary to decide between the two competing applications .
Knowles thought that the home secretary , Theresa May , would give preference to an application from the US .
While I was at the US embassy , I asked Jeffress about the case of Gary McKinnon , who is accused of hacking into US military computers from his bedroom in London .
The offences were said to have begun 10 years ago , when he was still using a slow , dial - up modem .
Jeffress said that the US was still seeking McKinnon 's extradition , despite medical evidence that he has Asperger 's syndrome .
His extradition has been held up while May considers doctors ' reports .
But how can this be when the Extradition Act 2003 deliberately removed the discretion that ministers used to have in extradition cases ?
It turns out that the law has changed without anybody noticing it
â€ “ and all thanks to the Human Rights Act .
The home secretary apparently accepts that a person whose extradition has been ordered by the courts can still claim that being sent abroad for trial would breach his or her human rights , particularly if circumstances have changed since the case was before the courts .
That opens the door for a whole new round of applications for judicial review .
It 's something of a lifeline for a government that does not want to see a sympathetic figure like McKinnon extradited .
Whether ministers will look so kindly on a similar application by Assange remains to be seen .

2011-02-24,"The WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange is preparing to find out whether Sweden has been successful in its attempt to extradite him in relation to allegations of rape and sexual assault .
Assange has consistently denied the accusations , made by two women in August last year , and has been fighting extradition since he was arrested and bailed in December .
The decision will be handed down on Thursday .
At a two - day hearing earlier this month , his legal team argued that the European arrest warrant ( EAW ) issued by Sweden was invalid since the Australian has not been charged with any offence , that the alleged assaults would not be legitimate extraditable offences , and that he would not receive a fair trial in Sweden .
Howard Riddle , the chief magistrate , will deliver his ruling on those arguments at a hearing in London .
The Swedish prosecutor , represented in court by the British Crown Prosecution Service , has maintained throughout that despite the lack of charge , Assange is being sought for prosecution rather than merely for questioning , which it argues means the warrant is valid .
The most serious of the four allegations relates to an accusation that Assange , during a visit to Stockholm in August , had sex with a woman , Miss B , while she was sleeping and without a condom , against her consent .
Three counts of sexual assault are also alleged against another woman , Miss A.
If found guilty of the rape charge he could face up to four years in prison .
Since there is no system of bail in Sweden , he would be detained in custody if extradited until a possible trial or release .
Riddle has already remarked on "" the possibility , perhaps the inevitability "" of an appeal against his decision , whichever way he leans , which would delay a final decision on the Australian 's fate for some months .
A senior extradition barrister said this week Riddle was "" very likely "" to rule against Assange .
The Australian ambassador to Sweden , Paul Stephens , wrote to the country 's justice minister last week to insist that , if extradited , any possible case against Assange "" would proceed in accordance with due process and the provisions prescribed under Swedish law , as well as applicable European and international laws , including relevant human rights norms "" .
Assange also fears that if sent to Sweden it would make more likely an onward extradition to the United States on possible charges relating to WikiLeaks 's release of leaked US embassy cables .
In such an event , Sweden would be required to ask permission from the UK for the onward extradition .
No such charges have been laid , though the website 's activities are under investigation in the US .
EAWs were introduced in 2003 with the aim of making extradition swifter and easier between European member states .
But campaigners have raised concerns about the application of the controversial warrants , arguing that they are sometimes applied before a case is ready to prosecute , and that while they were originally intended to counter terrorism , their use has greatly increased : 700 people were extradited from the UK under the system last year ."
2011-02-24,"Julian Assange , the beleaguered inventor of WikiLeaks , stood on the Belmarsh courtroom steps and delivered what has become a familiar harangue against those trying to extradite him to Sweden , where he is accused of sexual misconduct .
The climax of almost a quarter of an hour of oration came when he complained of "" this ridiculous time I have to spend on this nonsense ! "" .
Such was his dismissive reaction to a reasoned 28-page ruling by the district judge , Howard Riddle , who no doubt burned some midnight oil composing findings he knows will be scrutinised carefully by an appeal court .
It might have been more diplomatic of Assange to have kept quieter , following a devastating finding in the judgment that one of Assange 's fleet of lawyers , the Swedish advocate BjÃ¶rn Hurtig , made "" a deliberate attempt to mislead the court "" .
It was a striking reminder of the dangers over - enthusiastic solicitors face when they cross the line and engage in media grandstanding .
The issue could not have been more crucial : the Assange team had attempted to give the impression that the Swedish prosecutor Marianne Ny had behaved in an "" astonishing "" and improper manner , by making no attempt to interview Assange while he was in Sweden , and then unscrupulously chasing after him in England to have him arrested .
This false allegation was bolstered with unsubstantiated claims that Ny , the senior sex crimes specialist prosecutor , was a "" malicious radical feminist "" .
Apparently undaunted by the wholesale rejection of his case , Assange shifted tack to mount a lengthy attack against the entire European arrest warrant system , which , as he said , was devised after the 2001 terrorist atrocities of 9/11 to make it easier to bring Islamist suspects to justice in European courts .
He may well have a point about the subsequent overuse and abuse of the warrants .
State power frequently needs watching and curbing .
But he is scarcely well placed to be a disinterested advocate of British legal reform , while he is himself frantically trying to avoid facing the music in Sweden .
Nor do his pious remarks about "" our system of justice "" make much sense when they come from a peripatetic Australian citizen who has made a virtue out of a nomadic , virtually stateless , existence that circumvented traditional systems of justice .
Assange has now been mired in what he calls this "" nonsense "" for a considerable time â€ “ since six months ago , when two Swedish women went to the Stockholm police complaining about Assange 's sexual behaviour .
This might seem like "" nonsense "" in Assange 's eyes .
He has previously said the women got into a "" tizzy "" and were "" bamboozled "" by police .
He has sought in this way to wage a high - profile information war about what ought to have remained his private life , through hearing after hearing , interview after interview , and has repeatedly tried to blur the boundary between the sex allegations and the attacks on him by US politicians because he masterminded the WikiLeaks free speech exposures .
He was at it again on Thursday , talking about "" the pressure the US brings to bear on the UK , on Sweden and on the media "" .
Meanwhile , the night before the Belmarsh verdict , the editors of the five international publications involved in the leaks gathered in Madrid .
The Guardian , the New York Times , El PaÃ­s , Der Spiegel and Le Monde debated before an audience , but with much less fanfare , the real issues thrown up by the pioneering work of WikiLeaks .
Has the exposure of the US diplomatic cables made it harder for governments to lie in the age of the internet ?
How far did WikiLeaks contribute to the online dissent currently sweeping the Arab world ?
Can Bradley Manning , the US soldier accused of the actual leaking , expect civilised treatment in his military jail ?
These are the real issues that should be at the front of civil libertarians ' minds , not Assange 's legal problems ."
2011-02-24,"The WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange is to be extradited to Sweden to face allegations of rape and sexual assault .
Assange will appeal , his legal team has confirmed .
If they lose he will be sent to Sweden in 10 days .
Speaking outside Belmarsh magistrates court in south - east London after the judgment , Assange attacked the European arrest warrant system .
He dismissed the decision to extradite him as a "" rubber - stamping process "" .
He said : "" It comes as no surprise but is nevertheless wrong .
It comes as the result of a European arrest warrant system amok .
"" There had been no consideration of the allegations against him , Assange said .
His extradition would thrust him into a legal system he did not understand using a language he did not speak .
Assange said the US government by its own admission had been waiting to see the British court verdict before determining what action it could take against him . ""
What does the US have to do with a Swedish extradition process ?
"" he asked .
"" Why is it that I am subject , a non - profit free speech activist , to a $ 360,000 ( Â£223,000 ) bail ?
Why is it that I am kept under electronic house arrest when I have not even been charged in any country , when I have never been a fugitive ? ""
Assange had earlier heard the chief magistrate , Howard Riddle , dismiss each of the defence 's arguments .
Assange 's legal team had contended that the Swedish prosecutor Marianne Ny did not have the authority to issue a European arrest warrant .
The magistrate ruled that she did possess this authority and the warrant was valid .
Ny 's credibility had been questioned by the defence team but Riddle said those doubts amounted to "" very little "" .
A retired judge who had criticised her , Brita Sundberg - Weitman , had no firsthand knowledge or evidence to back up her opinion , he said .
The defence had argued that the allegations against Assange were not offences in English law and therefore not grounds for extradition .
But Riddle said the alleged offences against Miss A of sexual assault and molestation met the criteria for extradition , and an allegation made by Miss B if proven "" would amount to rape "" in this country .
In his summary Riddle accused Assange 's Swedish lawyer , BjÃ¶rn Hurtig , of making a deliberate attempt to mislead the court .
Assange had clearly attempted to avoid the Swedish justice system before he left the country , Riddle said .
"" It would be a reasonable assumption from the facts that Mr Assange was deliberately avoiding interrogation before he left Sweden . ""
The judge was severely critical of Hurtig , who had said in his statement that it was "" astonishing "" Ny had made no effort to interview his client before he left Sweden . ""
In fact this is untrue , "" said Riddle .
Hurtig had realised his mistake the night before he gave evidence and corrected his evidence in chief , said the judge .
But it had been done in a manner that was "" very low key "" . ""
Mr Hurtig must have realised the significance of ... his proof when he submitted it , "" Riddle said .
"" I do not accept that this was a genuine mistake .
It can not have slipped his mind .
The statement was a deliberate attempt to mislead the court . ""
Riddle acknowledged there had been "" considerable adverse publicity against Mr Assange in Sweden "" , including statements by the prime minister .
But if there had been any irregularities in the Swedish system the best place to examine them was in a Swedish trial .
Outside the court Assange 's lawyer , Mark Stephens , said the ruling had not come as a surprise and reaffirmed the Assange team 's concerns that adhering to the European arrest warrant ( EAW ) amounted to "" tick box justice "" .
"" We are still hopeful that the matter can be resolved in this country , "" he said .
"" We remain optimistic of our chances on appeal . ""
The possibility of a secret trial â€ “ which Assange 's lawyers argue he could face if extradited â€ “ was "" anathema to this country and to most civilised countries in the world "" , Stephens said .
During Assange 's extradition hearing Clare Montgomery QC , for the Swedish authorities , said trial evidence would be heard in private but the arguments would be made in public .
This did not amount to a secret trial .
Stephens suggested Riddle had been "" hamstrung "" by the EAW .
"" We 're pretty sure the secrecy and the way [ the case ] has been conducted so far have registered with this judge .
He 's just hamstrung , "" he told reporters .
Assange had already paid large amounts to defend himself , with the cost of translating material alone amounting to more than Â£30,000 , Stephens said .
"" That 's a cost the prosecution should be bearing .
The prosecution should be translating everything into a language he understands .
"" Assange has been fighting extradition since he was arrested and bailed in December .
He has consistently denied the allegations , made by two women in August last year .
At a two - day hearing this month his legal team argued that Assange would not receive a fair trial in Sweden .
They said the EAW issued by Sweden was invalid because the Australian had not been charged with any offence and the alleged assaults were not grounds for extradition .
Assange fears that being taken to Sweden will make it easier for Washington to extradite him to the US on possible charges relating to WikiLeaks 's release of the US embassy cables .
Sweden would have to ask permission from the UK for any onward extradition .
No charges have been laid by the US , though it is investigating the website 's activities .
The most serious of the four allegations relates to an accusation that Assange , during a visit to Stockholm in August , had sex with a woman , Miss B , while she was sleeping , without a condom and without her consent .
Three counts of sexual assault are alleged by another woman , Miss A.
If found guilty of the rape charge he could face up to four years in prison .
Assange will be held in custody because there is no system of bail in Sweden until a possible trial or release .
The Australian ambassador to Sweden , Paul Stephens , wrote to the country 's justice minister last week to insist that if extradited , any possible case against Assange must "" proceed in accordance with due process and the provisions prescribed under Swedish law , as well as applicable European and international laws , including relevant human rights norms "" .
European arrest warrants were introduced in 2003 with the aim of making the process swifter and easier between European member states .
But campaigners have raised concerns about their application , arguing they are sometimes used before a case is ready to prosecute and have been extended far beyond their original purpose of fighting terrorism .
Last year 700 people were extradited from the UK under the system ."
2011-02-24,"Julian Assange , the founder of WikiLeaks , will be extradited to Sweden to answer accusations of rape and sexual assault , a judge has ruled , bringing to an close the first stage of what is now likely to be a lengthy legal battle .
Assange , who has been fighting extradition since being arrested in Britain in December , must face interrogation in Sweden on the sex assault claims , ruled chief magistrate Howard Riddle , rejecting arguments that the prosecutor seeking his extradition had behaved illegally and was unqualified to issue a warrant , and that he would not receive a fair trial .
But if the judgment had been widely anticipated by both sides , the Australian 's decision to appeal against the ruling was , he told reporters afterwards , never in question .
"" What we saw today was a rubber - stamping process .
It came as no surprise , but is nonetheless wrong .
Of course , we always knew we would appeal . ""
He now has seven days to lodge an appeal , otherwise extradition would automatically take place within 10 days .
His solicitor , Mark Stephens , who called the ruling an example of "" tick - box justice "" , insisted he was "" still hopeful that the matter will be resolved in this country .
We still remain very optimistic about our opportunities on appeal . ""
Outside court Assange , who remains on bail subject to curfew conditions , preferred not to assert his innocence of the accusations but to appeal instead to public opinion in Sweden and internationally over what he sought to portray as an unjust legal system .
In an impassioned denunciation of a mechanism that "" drags people off to an uncertain destiny "" on the basis of no more than "" a two - page form filled out by a member of the bureaucracy "" , Assange appealed to his supporters to challenge the system of European arrest warrants ( EAWs ) , by which extradition requests are fast - tracked between EU member states .
Challenging that system , he said , would "" make the ridiculous time that I have spent on this nonsense "" worthwhile .
He also questioned why the US ambassador to Britain had made comments relating to the case to a BBC journalist : "" What does the US have to do with a Swedish extradition case ? ""
Assange fears that the American government may seek his onward extradition on possible charges relating to WikiLeaks ' publication of leaked US embassy cables .
Assange has never been charged with any offence relating to accusations made by two Swedish women in August while he was visiting Stockholm , nor has he been formally interrogated in connection with all four of the alleged crimes of rape and sexual assault .
His lawyers had argued that this meant the EAW , issued by prosecutor Marianne Ny , was not legal .
They also maintained that the alleged offences would not be illegal in the UK , and that a "" secret "" rape trial would be a breach of Assange 's human rights .
Riddle dismissed the defence arguments , however , in a judgment that was damning in its criticism of Bjorn Hurtig , the Australian 's Swedish lawyer .
Hurtig acknowledged during a three - day hearing earlier this month that his witness statement , in which he maintained Ny had "" made no effort "" to interview Assange before he left Sweden , was untrue .
Riddle said : "" He says he realised the mistake the night before giving evidence .
I do not accept that this was a genuine mistake .
It can not have slipped his mind .
The statement was a deliberate attempt to mislead the court . ""
In fact , said Riddle , the prosecutor had made "" constant attempts "" to question Assange between 21 and 30 September , when Hurtig said he was alerted that Assange had left the country .
As Assange did not give evidence , Riddle could not say whether the WikiLeaks chief had known that the prosecutor was trying to contact him , but "" it would not have been an unreasonable assumption from the facts ( albeit not necessarily an accurate one ) that Mr Assange was deliberately avoiding interrogation in the period before he left Sweden "" .
The untruth in Hurtig 's statement in turn "" fatally undermined "" the evidence of two other defence expert witnesses who had been briefed by him , said Riddle .
The judge also addressed the defence argument that public comments made by the Swedish prime minister about the case had vilified Assange "" as an enemy of the Swedish state "" .
The prosecution , he noted , had suggested that those comments "" may have been a response to comments made publicly on the steps of this court by the defence team here .
Certainly the conventional wisdom is that prosecutors , lawyers and politicians are best advised not to comment on a case until it is over .
Sometimes public comment damages the cause more than it helps .
"" With the preliminary stage of his case at its conclusion , Assange emerged alone , unlike at previous hearings where he has been flanked by his lawyers , to address his supporters .
He said : "" I call on you to make this bigger than me .
Take this case and bring it back home .
Make it your case and your own virtue . ""
He was calling on Swedes , he said "" not to be scared "" to speak out about legal abuses of which they were aware , and Swedish newspaper editors to "" let your bravest journalists speak "" .
They are now likely to have ample opportunity .
What happens next ?
Given what they consider to be the "" constraints "" of the European arrest warrant mechanism , Julian Assange and his legal team said they had expected to lose the extradition case and were already preparing to appeal before the judgment .
Appeal papers must be lodged within seven days , but it is likely that a hearing requiring the WikiLeaks founder 's attendance will not take place for some months .
Mark Stephens , Assange 's solicitor ( above left ) , indicated that the appeal would centre on the fact that Swedish rape trials are heard in part in private , and the argument that this would be a breach of the Australian 's human rights .
The chief magistrate Howard Riddle acknowledged in his ruling that such conduct was "" alien as far as our system is concerned "" .
Should the court of Aappeal rule against him , Assange could ask for permission to appeal to the supreme court on point of law .
A last - resort appeal to the European court has not been ruled out , said Stephens ."

2011-02-25,"Julian Assange will , according to the judge 's finding of fact , be held in prison in solitary confinement when he is returned to Sweden and will then be interrogated , held without bail and later subjected to a secret trial on accusations that have been bruited around the world , not least by this newspaper .
He has a complete answer to these charges , which he considers false and baseless .
Even if acquitted , however , the mud will stick and , if convicted , the public will never be able to able to assess whether justice has miscarried .
This country , which has given to the world the most basic principles of a fair trial â€ “ that justice must be seen to be done â€ “ denies that basic liberty for those that are extradited to Sweden .
How come our courts abandon our cherished principles in deference to European systems and prosecutors ?
The answer is that they are bound to regard the prosecutors of no less than 26 countries , including Poland and Romania â€ “ as perfect .
This is the result of the European arrest warrant ( EAW ) , one of the civil liberties disasters bequeathed by the Labour government when it passed the Extradition Act in 2003 .
This act , quite incredibly , allows European countries to deem prosecutors and even policemen "" as judicial authorities "" ( a contradiction in terms , because they are neither independent nor impartial ) and to pluck their suspects from the UK so long as they tick the right box on the EAW form .
In Assange 's case , for example , they ticked "" rape "" and the court can not dispute that the allegation is of rape , even though the leading authority on sexual offences , the Oxford Vinerian professor , Andrew Ashworth , disputes this characterisation .
There can be no questioning on the merits of the charges â€ “ in 2003 parliament abolished the traditional right of a suspect to require foreign governments to show a prima facie case before dragging them off to unfair trials .
An inquiry into the working of the EAW system has been set up and Assange 's appeal to the high court may demonstrate the extent to which it allows our judges to stand up against unfair European systems .
In the case of Sweden , for all its civilised and rational approach to many criminal justice issues â€ “ especially sentencing â€ “ it is a human rights black spot in relation to solitary confinement , the lack of a money - bail system and ill - treatment of foreigners in the very prison for which Assange may be destined â€ “ all matters for which it has been condemned by the recent European Committee report on torture .
But nothing so breaches the most fundamental principle of justice as its custom of holding all rape trials behind closed doors .
This , so the prosecutor Marianne Ny explains , is so that "" complainants may give their evidence better "" .
Of course it is absolutely right to give complainants the protection of anonymity and to limit the right to cross examine them on their past , but it is utterly wrong to keep it from public view , for three reasons : 1 .
As Jeremy Bentham pointed out , "" publicity is the very soil of justice , it keeps the judge , while trying , under trial "" .
In this case , which will be heard by three lay judges appointed by political parties who are usually members of such parties , it is essential to see justice being done , especially since the Swedish prime minister has publicly attacked Assange .
2 .
Second , openness is essential to truth .
It ensures that witnesses will be afraid to perjure themselves less they be found out .
Others will come forward to confound them if they learn that they are lying .
In this case , where both complainants tweeted and text - messaged their friends in ways which can be said to be inconsistent with their complaint , justice demands a public hearing .
3 .
Finally , the public itself has an interest , and that must override the interest of individuals whether the complainant or even defendants are happy that their details of conduct are hidden from public view .
No democracy can commit secret court , because then there is no check that the formidable powers of prosecutors and judges are not being abused .
There are two philosophic approaches to the EAWs open to our courts .
At present most adopt the "" rubber stamp "" approach â€ “ hand suspects over to the European policeman and prosecutors if the formalities on the warrant are correct .
But the alternative â€ “ which we will invite the high court to adopt in this case â€ “ is that the EAW system should be used to actually improve the quality of justice throughout Europe , but to refuse extradition when the trial in prospect is likely to be unfair , judged according to our fundamental principles .
That way , things can only improve and human rights blind spots can be eradicated .
If our courts declare that open justice is the only possible justice by denying Sweden the extradition of Assange , this would very likely have the result that Sweden would change its unacceptable policy .
Open justice is one of the greatest contributions the UK has made to international human rights law .
It goes back to the famous demand of "" freeborn John Lilburne the leveller "" â€ “ to have the doors of his court opened so that Cromwell 's judges could not try him in "" holes or corner "" .
The rhetoric about the importance of open justice is found throughout law reports and often in cases brought by journalists at newspapers like this one .
Will all this judicial rhetoric be empty or even hypocritical when it comes to deporting Julian Assange ?
We must wait and see .

2011-02-28,"Julian Assange , the embattled WikiLeaks founder fighting extradition to Sweden over allegations of rape and sexual assault , has applied to trademark his name .
The 39-year - old computer hacker â€ “ who will shortly be extradited to Sweden to contest the charges unless he opts to appeal â€
“ wants to protect his name for use in "" public speaking services "" and "" entertainment services "" , it has emerged .
Assange becomes the latest high - profile figure seeking to trademark his name .
Sarah Palin , who famously likened Assange to an al - Qaida operative , has applied for similar protection for both herself and her daughter , Bristol Palin .
Assange applied for the trademark on 14 February through his London - based law firm Finers Stephens Innocent .
If granted , he will own the trademark to his name for the purposes of "" news reporter services "" , "" journalism "" , "" publication of texts other than publicity texts "" and "" education services "" .
Assange has long vowed to clear his name of the allegations , which he denies .
Earlier this month he said that the charges , made in August last year , had applied a "" black box "" to his life . ""
On the outside of that black box has been written the word rape .
That box has now , thanks to an open court process , been opened .
I hope in the next days you will see that the box is in fact empty . ""
The combative Australian , described by foes as a terrorist and by friends as a freedom fighter , also looks set to feature as the central subject in a movie about the whistleblowers ' site he set up in 2006 .
Studio executives last month secured the screen rights to the biography of Assange by award - winning Australian writer Andrew Fowler , The Most Dangerous Man in the World , .

Owing to an editing error , the original suggested that an appeal by Julian Assange was in progress and that this would be heard on 3 March .

2011-03-01,"Julian Assange has blamed a number of journalists for a "" Jewish "" conspiracy against his whistleblowing website , WikiLeaks , according to the editor of Private Eye , Ian Hislop .
In the latest issue of the satirical magazine , Hislop writes that Assange called him on 16 February to complain about an article on Israel Shamir , a WikiLeaks associate in Russia who has denied the Holocaust and has published a string of antisemitic articles . ""
He said that I and Private Eye should be ashamed of ourselves for joining in the international conspiracy to smear WikiLeaks , "" Hislop writes .
"" The piece was an obvious attempt to deprive him and his organisation of Jewish support and donations , he said angrily , and he knew perfectly well who had written it .
He then named a Fleet Street hack who had nothing to do with it . ""
Hislop adds that Assange went on to claim that Private Eye was "" part of a conspiracy led by the Guardian which included journalist David Leigh , editor Alan Rusbridger and John Kampfner from Index on Censorship â€ “ all of whom ' are Jewish ' "" .
"" I pointed out that Rusbridger is not actually Jewish , but Assange insisted that he was ' sort of Jewish ' because he was related to David Leigh ( they are brothers - in - law ) , "" writes Hislop .
"" When I doubted whether his Jewish conspiracy would stand up against the facts , Assange suddenly conceded the point . '
Forget the Jewish thing ' . ""
Assange denied the allegations in a statement , saying : "" Hislop has distorted , invented or misremembered almost every significant claim and phrase .
In particular , ' Jewish conspiracy ' is completely false , in spirit and in word .
"" It is serious and upsetting .
Rather than correct a smear , Mr Hislop has attempted , perhaps not surprisingly , to justify one smear with another in the same direction . ""
WikiLeaks promotes the ideal of "" scientific journalism "" â€ “ where the underlaying evidence of all articles is available to the reader precisely in order to avoid these type of distortions .
We treasure our strong Jewish support and staff , just as we treasure the support from pan - Arab democracy activists and others who share our hope for a just world . ""
A judge ruled last week that Assange should be extradited to Sweden to answer accusations of rape and sexual assault , bringing to an close the first stage of what is still likely to be a lengthy legal battle .
Assange , who has been fighting extradition since being arrested in Britain in December , must face interrogation in Sweden on the sex assault claims , ruled chief magistrate Howard Riddle , rejecting arguments that the prosecutor seeking his extradition had behaved illegally and was unqualified to issue a warrant , and that he would not receive a fair trial .
His solicitor , Mark Stephens has insisted that he was "" still hopeful that the matter will be resolved in this country .
We still remain very optimistic about our opportunities on appeal . """

2011-03-03,"Lawyers representing the WikiLeaks founder , Julian Assange , have lodged papers to appeal against his extradition from Britain to Sweden to face allegations of rape and sexual assault .
The high court in London confirmed it had received documents to challenge the ruling made at Belmarsh magistrates court , south London , last week .
No date has been set for a hearing .
The 39-year - old Australian had always planned to appeal if he failed to escape the European arrest warrant ( EAW ) at the first attempt .
He faces being sent to Sweden within 10 days if his appeal is unsuccessful .
Last week Assange dismissed the decision to extradite him as a "" rubber - stamping process "" .
It came as no surprise , he said , but was wrong .
"" There was no consideration during this entire process as to the merit of the allegations made against me , no consideration or examination of even the complaints made in Sweden and , of course , we have always known we would appeal .
"" He has been fighting extradition since he was arrested and bailed in December , and has consistently denied the allegations , made by two women in August last year .
Assange 's lawyers argued he would not receive a fair trial in Sweden .
They said the warrant was invalid because he had not been charged with any offence and the alleged assaults were not grounds for extradition .
Assange fears removal to Sweden will make it easier for Washington to extradite him to the US on possible charges relating to WikiLeaks 's release of the US embassy cables .
The US has been investigating the WikLeaks website , although no charges have been laid .
Sweden would have to ask the UK for any onward extradition .
Assange faces four allegations , the most serious that , during a visit to Stockholm , he had sex with a woman , Miss B , while she was sleeping , without a condom and without her consent .
Three counts of sexual assault are alleged by another woman , Miss A.
If found guilty of the rape charge he could face up to four years in prison .
Howard Riddle , the chief magistrate at the extradition hearing , acknowledged "" considerable adverse publicity "" against Assange in Sweden but said if there had been any irregularities in the Swedish system the best place to examine them was in a Swedish trial ."
2011-03-03,"I 've always wanted a walk - on part in a Hollywood movie , but I do n't suppose Steven Spielberg will indulge me .
The mogul has bought the film rights to two recent books critical of Julian Assange , both of which provide racy accounts of the difficult relationship between the WikiLeaks founder , his comrades and the newspapers he worked with .
Now my role as an alleged "" Jewish "" conspirator against him may , if I 'm lucky , go celluloid .
All this would be entertaining , but for anyone who cares about free expression and freedom of information , the catfight between WikiLeaks and the organisations that were longstanding supporters is a shame .
At the risk of sounding pious , it 's time to refocus on the big issues .
When Index on Censorship began nearly 40 years ago , the issues were perhaps more black and white than those posed by instant information and the internet , and the competing needs of free expression , confidentiality , privacy and security Assange has raised .
Index strongly supported the publication of the leaked US embassy cables .
With the odd exception , we saw no evidence that they posed a clear and present danger to sources ; we saw them as strongly in the public interest .
The days when governments or corporations believed they had a right to secrecy , to protect their narrow interests or save them embarrassment , are gone .
Index 's association with Assange goes back some time .
In 2008 WikiLeaks won the new media prize at our annual awards .
We were pleased to host him in a debate in London last September , but his combative demeanour that evening was a surprise .
Throughout the past few months we have been at the heart of the tussle .
Two of Index 's trustees are Assange 's lawyer , Mark Stephens and his agent , Caroline Michel .
Whenever asked , particularly in the US , about reconciling Stephens 's two roles , I have pointed out that Index is a broad church , and that Stephens has been a longstanding battler for free speech .
It has often felt like treading on egg shells .
We were asked in December to channel Assange 's defence fund through our bank account .
Our chairman , the broadcaster Jonathan Dimbleby , and I thought it inappropriate for a charity to become involved in the personal allegations against Assange .
So we declined .
When urged at the start of January by Assange 's publisher to help him write his memoirs I said I was ready to assist , but only if I had strong editorial input and that no subject was off - limits .
This , I was told , was not acceptable .
Roughly at the same time our organisation started asking questions about Israel Shamir , a man accused of Holocaust denial and of being a close associate of Belarus 's autocratic leader Alexander Lukashenko .
Index is one of the founders of the Belarus Committee .
Despite repeated but polite requests to WikiLeaks , our team was stonewalled , so we went public with our concerns .
Assange 's reported conspiracy remarks to Private Eye magazine about me and senior figures in the Guardian do not help his cause .
With so many genuine adversaries , why seek more ?
His approach has reinforced a view that whistleblowing is the preserve of irresponsible eccentrics â€ “ playing into the hands of malign forces in the US seeking to prosecute him for "" terrorism "" or under the espionage act .
Thanks in large part to WikiLeaks , no matter how hard the authorities try , it will be impossible in future to prevent conscientious whistleblowers from passing on material that seeks to cast a light on the actions of the powerful â€ “ information that might otherwise remain secret .
Due to the published documents , people around the world â€ “ notably in the Middle East and north Africa
â€ “ have a better sense of what others thought of their autocratic leaders .
All this is the positive legacy .
The rest is soap opera or , dare I say it , Tinseltown ."
2011-03-10,"The police investigator who first interviewed two Swedish women about allegations of rape and sexual assault against Julian Assange is a friend and political associate of one of the women , a Swedish newspaper has claimed .
The female officer became friends with the woman referred to in court as Miss A through Sweden 's Social Democratic party , in which both are involved , according to Expressen .
The pair corresponded on the internet 16 months before the allegations were made against Assange .
Miss A commented on a Facebook update on the police officer 's page as recently as 10 February , the paper said , and Miss A links to the officer 's private blog from her personal page .
The paper said the officer had made anti - Assange comments on the internet .
The WikiLeaks founder is appealing against a British magistrate 's decision last month to extradite him to Sweden to answer the accusations , which include an allegation of rape against another woman , Miss B. Miss A alleges Assange had sex with her without a condom , against her wishes .
He has not been charged with any offence .
His legal team has argued that the Swedish judicial process is unfair and a number of those involved in the prosecution are politically motivated .
According to Expressen , Miss A and the police interrogator had internet contact in April 2009 , when Miss A wrote a blog about white men "" who take the right to decide what is not abusive "" .
The officer commented that the author "" puts her finger on the bottom line and speaks out "" , to which Miss A replied : "" Hello !
Thanks for the compliment .
And like you say , white men must always defend the right to use abusive words .
Then they of course deny that these very words are part of a system that keeps their group at the top of the social ladder . ""
The paper said that when another newspaper , Aftonbladet , hosted a recent webchat with Assange , the officer commented "" What the heck is this !
Judgment zero !
"" The previous day she had commented on the same page : "" Way to go , Claes Borgstrom ! ""
Borgstrom is the lawyer representing the women and a former SDP politician , who Assange 's team has argued is acting from political motives .
The paper says the officer had just started her shift at Klara police station in Stockholm on 20 August when Miss A and Miss B arrived to make a complaint against Assange .
It says she did not declare a conflict of interest .
The police say that the officer in question did not interview Miss A and she played no further part in the investigation .
On the basis of the interrogations , duty prosecutor Maria HÃ¤ljebo Kjellstrand ordered Assange 's arrest , a decision overturned by a more senior prosecutor .
Borgstrom appealed against that decision and the case was reinstated by prosecutor Marianne Ny .
Mark Stephens , Assange 's lawyer , said they had been aware of the relationship , which had informed their arguments in court last month that the Swedish judicial process had been improper .
"" There are a whole raft of issues like this which should cause reasonable people a bit of concern , "" he said .
"" I 'm delighted that the Swedes , who objected so strongly to our criticisms of the case , have started to acknowledge that there are systemic problems in their judicial process which allow this sort of thing to happen . ""
Police superintendent
Ulf GÃ¶ranzon told Expressen he was not aware of any relationship between the two women , and would not comment on rumours .
The Swedish prosecutor 's office also declined to comment , citing the ongoing extradition process in the UK ."
2011-03-15,"The internet is the "" greatest spying machine the world has ever seen "" and is not a technology that necessarily favours the freedom of speech , the WikiLeaks co - founder , Julian Assange , has claimed in a rare public appearance .
Assange acknowledged that the web could allow greater government transparency and better co - operation between activists , but said it gave authorities their best ever opportunity to monitor and catch dissidents . ""
While the internet has in some ways an ability to let us know to an unprecedented level what government is doing , and to let us co - operate with each other to hold repressive governments and repressive corporations to account , it is also the greatest spying machine the world has ever seen , "" he told students at Cambridge University .
Hundreds queued for hours to attend .
He continued : "" It [ the web ] is not a technology that favours freedom of speech .
It is not a technology that favours human rights .
It is not a technology that favours civil life .
Rather it is a technology that can be used to set up a totalitarian spying regime , the likes of which we have never seen .
Or , on the other hand , taken by us , taken by activists , and taken by all those who want a different trajectory for the technological world , it can be something we all hope for . ""
Assange also suggested that Facebook and Twitter played less of a role in the unrest in the Middle East than has previously been argued by social media commentators and politicians .
He said : "" Yes [ Twitter and Facebook ] did play a part , although not nearly as large a part as al - Jazeera .
But the guide produced by Egyptian revolutionaries â€ ¦ says on the first page , ' Do not use Facebook and Twitter ' , and says on the last page , ' Do not use Facebook and Twitter ' .
"" There is a reason for that .
There was actually a Facebook revolt in Cairo three or four years ago .
It was very small â€ ¦ after it , Facebook was used to round - up all the principal participants .
They were then beaten , interrogated and incarcerated . ""
Assange said that cables released by WikiLeaks played a key role in both fomenting unrest in the Middle East and forcing the US government not to back former Egyptian president Hosni Mubarak .
Assange said diplomatic cables concerning US attitudes to the former Tunisian regime had given strength to revolutionary forces across the region . ""
The Tunisian cables showed clearly that if it came down to it , the US , if it came down to a fight between the military on the one hand , and Ben Ali 's political regime on the other , the US would probably support the military . ""
He continued : "" That is something that must have also caused neighbouring countries to Tunisia some thought : that is that if they militarily intervened , they may not be on the same side as the United States . ""
Assange , who is appealing against his extradition to Sweden on alleged sex charges , said the WikiLeaks releases had also forced the US to drop their tacit support of Mubarak . ""
As a result of releasing cables about Suleiman [ the vice - president of Egypt under Mubarak ] , the US and Israel 's preferred option for regime takeover in Egypt , as a result of releasing cables about Mubarak 's approval of Suleiman 's torture methods , it was not possible for Joseph Biden to [ repeat his earlier claim that Mubarak was not a dictator ] .
It was not possible for Hillary Clinton to publicly come out and support Mubarak 's regime . ""
Responding to a question about Bradley Manning , the US soldier incarcerated for allegedly leaking classified information , Assange said : "" We have no idea whether he is one of our sources .
All our technology is geared up to make sure we have no idea . ""
He expressed sympathy for Manning . ""
He is in a terrible situation .
And if he is not connected to us , [ then ] he is there as an innocent â€ ¦
and if he is in some manner connected to our publications , then of course we have some responsibility .
That said , there is no allegation that he was arrested as the result of anything to do with us .
The allegation is that he was arrested as a result of him speaking to Wired magazine in the United States . ""
Assange also criticised the New York Times , which he claimed had suppressed stories about secret American military activity in Afghanistan ."
2011-03-16,"Extradition , extradition , extradition .
The attention being paid to the attempts made by the Swedish government to extradite Julian Assange and what is happening to Bradley Manning in Virginia has inevitably obscured another battle being fought out behind the scenes , that of Gary McKinnon , the hacker with Asperger 's syndrome who left rude messages in the Pentagon 's computer system a decade ago .
Every member of both houses of parliament should by now have received a letter containing fresh details of McKinnon 's medical history and that of close members of his family .
The decision to make public this intimate side of his life has been taken because McKinnon 's family now feel that there is a real possibility the government may bow to repeated requests from the United States and allow the extradition .
What MPs and members of the House of Lords will learn is that McKinnon 's mental problems were first noted back in 1983 , when he was only 17 .
When he was diagnosed three years ago as suffering from Asperger 's syndrome , suggestions were made in some quarters that this was a convenient way for him to avoid being extradited .
This new evidence – which will form part of a debate in the Lords , initiated by Lord Maginnis , on March 23 – gives the lie to that scepticism .
In the letter McKinnon 's mother , Janis Sharp , writes : "" On 10 February 1983 we were compelled to take my son to see a neurologist because of our grave concerns regarding the sudden deterioration in Gary 's mental health and the loss of his intellectual faculties , leading us to fear that Gary may have a brain tumour . ""
She goes on to spell out the family 's painful medical history .
She had taken the decision to go public with the family 's many problems because she feels that MPs and members of the House of Lords need all the ammunition available as McKinnon runs out of legal options to fight extradition .
To her credit , Theresa May , the home secretary , stayed the extradition process once the coalition government took office .
She is , according to the Home Office , "" looking afresh "" at the medical evidence , and is asking McKinnon to submit to a further examination – which he has agreed to , provided the examiner is an expert in Asperger 's syndrome .
May then has to make what may be a speedy decision as to whether allowing extradition would be a breach of McKinnon 's human rights .
What politicians may want to digest is the assessment made by Professor Declan Murphy – an expert in Asperger 's and autism and a psychiatrist regularly used by the Home Office – that "" [ Gary ] now has a fixed autistic - like idea , which is currently unshakable , that his best outcome is to take his own life "" .
Thanks to WikiLeaks , it has emerged that Gordon Brown , when prime minister , approached the US ambassador in the UK , Louis Susman , on McKinnon 's behalf .
Brown 's reasonable suggestion – that McKinnon would plead guilty to hacking offences but would serve any sentence in the UK – was then snubbed by a secretary of state who this week has been lecturing Middle Eastern countries on tolerance and humanity .
It is perfectly possible for the United Kingdom to refuse to grant an extradition request .
Life will go on .
Last July Switzerland refused an American request for the extradition of the film director Roman Polanksi , who was convicted of a far more serious crime than computer hacking , and so far Hillary Clinton has not instituted a no - fly zone over Geneva .
Coincidentally , this month the National Archives released official and previously censored documents about UFOs .
It was McKinnon 's belief in the existence of UFOs that sent him on his weird and wonderful hacking mission through the computer systems of Nasa and the Pentagon .
The Ministry of Defence documents show this was something that even quite senior government figures around the world were concerned about , although many "" flying saucer "" sightings have turned out to be pranks or misunderstandings .
When confidential government documents are released in 30 years , detailing discussions about a computer hacker with Asperger 's syndrome who did no harm beyond embarrassment to the American military , we must hope that future generations see that our ministers stood up for decency and common sense , and did not bow to demands for an ignoble extradition ."
2011-04-06,"Tomorrow 's New Statesman has been guest - edited by Jemima Khan .
It 's a free speech special issue featuring contributions from Julian Assange ( for whom Khan stood bail ) , film director Oliver Stone , actor Tim Robbins , Tory MP Rory Stewart and the artist Damien Hirst .
The issue will include Khan 's interview with deputy prime minister Nick Clegg and a piece by Tony Benn about the way in which new media has aided the Arab revolts .
Robbins takes the press to task while Stone gives his verdict on President Barack Obama .
The magazine 's regular editor , Jason Cowley , said he asked Khan to be guest editor "" because I admired her work as a human rights activist in Pakistan and her support for freedom of information . ""

2011-04-09,"WikiLeaks is more accountable than democratically elected governments because it accepts donations from members of the public , Julian Assange has claimed , in his first formal public appearance since being arrested in December following accusations of rape and sexual assault .
Questioned at a public debate about the whistleblowing organisation 's own transparency , Assange told an audience of 700 people , many of them supporters : "" We are directly supported on a week - to - week basis by you .
You vote with your wallets every week if you believe that our work is worthwhile or not .
If you believe we have erred , you do not support us .
If you believe we need to be protected in our work , you keep us strong . ""
That dynamic feedback , I say , is more responsive than a government that is elected after sourcing money from big business every four years . ""
The WikiLeaks founder , who is currently appealing against his extradition to Sweden to face allegations of sexual assault , told the audience at a packed debate organised by the New Statesman and the Frontline Club that whistleblowing was essential in a democracy because "" the only way we can know whether information is legitimately kept secret is when it is revealed "" .
He cited the examples of Vietnam and "" the disaster that was the Iraq war "" , saying that if whistleblowers had had the courage to speak up earlier about both conflicts , "" bloodbaths "" could have been avoided .
He said he "" could speak for hours "" about the impact of the publication of leaked US embassy cables , much of it through the Guardian , and that leak 's positive impact .
The Hindu newspaper had in recent weeks published 21 front pages based on so - called "" cablegate "" revelations , he said , leading to the Indian government walking out four times and a growing anti - corruption movement in the country .
But the political commentator Douglas Murray , director of the centre for social cohesion , challenged Assange over the website 's sources of funding , its staffing and connections with the Holocaust denier Israel Shamir , who has worked with the site .
"" What gives you the right to decide what should be known or not ?
Governments are elected .
You , Mr Assange are not . ""
Murray also challenged the WikiLeaks founder over an account in a book by Guardian writers David Leigh and Luke Harding , in which the authors quote him suggesting that if informants were to be killed following publication of the leaks , they "" had it coming to them "" .
Assange repeated an earlier assertion that the website "" is in the process of suing the Guardian "" over the assertion , and asked if Murray would like to "" join the queue "" of organisations he was suing .
The Guardian has not received any notification of such action from WikiLeaks or its lawyers .
Jason Cowley , the editor of the New Statesman and chair of the debate , interjected to ask : "" How can the great champion of open society be using our libel laws to challenge the press ? ""
The WikiLeaks founder was obliged to leave before responding to all the questions in order to comply with the curfew conditions of his bail .
WikiLeaks ' lawyer Mark Stephens could not be reached for comment .
Asked after the debate whether he could shed any light on the supposed legal action , WikiLeaks spokesman Kristin Hrafnsson said "" not really "" ."
2011-05-11,"The US government has opened a grand jury hearing into the passing of hundreds of thousands of state secrets to WikiLeaks â€ “ the start of the process of deciding whether to prosecute the website and its founder , Julian Assange , for espionage .
The first session of the grand jury is understood to have begun in Alexandria , Virginia , with the forced testimony of a man from Boston , Massachusetts .
The unidentified man was subpoenad to appear before the panel .
The terms of the subpoena â€ “ first revealed by the Salon blogger Glenn Greenwald â€ “ gave a clear indication that the jury has been convened specifically to consider whether to approve the prosecution of Assange and Wikileaks .
It said the hearing was investigating "" possible violations of federal criminal law involving , but not necessarily limited to , conspiracy to communicate or transmit national defence information in violation of "" the Espionage Act .
The Act , which was introduced in 1917 just after the US entered the first world war , was modelled on Britain 's Official Secrets Act .
It was most famously applied , unsuccessfully , in 1971 against Daniel Ellsberg , who leaked the Pentagon papers on the Vietnam war .
The subpoena also reveals that the grand jury is considering approving a prosecution on grounds of "" knowingly accessing a computer without authorisation or exceeding authorized access "" and "" knowingly stealing or converting any record or thing of value of the United States or any department or agency thereof "" .
That would appear to point more in the direction of Bradley Manning , the US military intelligence specialist currently facing court martial as the suspected source of the WikiLeaks documents .
The US has had a hard time so far trying to make charges , other than against Manning , stick in the WikiLeaks saga .
The Espionage Act has never been applied successfully against a non - government party , and to have a reasonable chance of prosecuting Assange or WikiLeaks as an organisation , the authorities would need to be able to prove to the satisfaction of a jury that they had actively encouraged or assisted the source of the leaks to transmit unauthorised material .
The FBI has been focusing its investigations aggressively on the hacker community of Boston , around the technology university MIT , in the hope of gaining information on how Assange made contact with his source .
Wednesday 's hearing is likely to be part of that effort .
The public radio network NPR pointed out that the WikiLeaks grand jury is just one of a spate of federal investigations into leaking that constitutes a major crack down by the Obama administration .
There are currently five separate criminal prosecutions relating to official leaks under way , a surge in activity that national security experts say is a worrying attack on the rights of whistle blowers .
The WikiLeaks grand jury , comprising between 16 and 24 jurors , will sit in secret .
It will act as a kind of pre - trial , considering the prosecution evidence and calling witnesses , before finally deciding on whether or not to advance a prosecution ."
2011-05-13,"A former WikiLeaks spokesman has condemned Julian Assange for demanding that staff for the whistleblowing website sign a gagging order that imposes a penalty of up to £ 12 m on anyone who breaks it .
German activist Daniel Domscheit - Berg said that in imposing the draconian confidentiality agreement on its employees WikiLeaks was behaving too much like the governments and businesses it purports to expose . ""
WikiLeaks has become what it despises : a repressive organisation , using restrictive contracts to gag its staffers , cultivating intransparency and unaccountability , "" Domscheit - Berg said in an email to Reuters .
Domscheit - Berg , who was once one of Assange 's closest associates , said he felt "" sorry ... for all those new staffers that had no idea what they were getting into "" in working for WikiLeaks .
The activist , who has written a book about his time with WikiLeaks , also said he regretted having helped set up the whistleblowing website .
His comments came after media lawyer and legal blogger David Allen Green published the full text of the gagging order signed by almost all WikiLeaks employees earlier this year .
Clause 5 of the confidentiality agreement imposes a £ 12 m penalty on any employee who reveals any information about WikiLeaks ' day - to - day operations .
The agreement has been likened to superinjunctions because even revealing the existence of the gagging order is itself a breach .
One of Assange 's London lawyers , Mark Stephens , said he could not comment on the contents of the gagging order posted on the New Statesman 's website earlier this week .
Domscheit - Berg 's comments come after Guardian journalist James Ball , a former WikiLeaks aide , described how Assange demanded that 10 staff and volunteers sign the document during a meeting at the Norfolk mansion where he was confined due to the ongoing legal case against him .
After he refused to sign , Ball wrote , Assange "" spent two hours – shouting – explaining why I must sign the document , or else risk the lives and wellbeing of everyone in the room and never be trusted again . ""
Ball said other WikiLeaks staff pressured him to sign the document but he refused .
In an article for the Guardian 's Comment is Free website , Ball criticised Assange 's demand , contending that it confirms criticism that WikiLeaks is unaccountable .
He writes : "" If any organisation in the world relies on whistleblowers to keep it honest , it is WikiLeaks . ""
In such circumstances , silencing dissent is not just ironic , it 's dangerous .
WikiLeaks needs to get out of the gagging game . ""
In the months since his personal behaviour and website came under increasingly harsh public scrutiny , Assange has periodically threatened to sue his critics .
Those who say they have been targets of his legal threats include the Guardian , with whom Assange once closely collaborated , and Domscheit - Berg ."
2011-05-26,"The books have been written and the film optioned ; now Australia is braced for WikiLeaks the play .
Rehearsals start in Sydney next week for a stage production believed to be the first about the life of Julian Assange .
Stainless Steel Rat , by the award - winning Australian playwright Ron Elisha , is set late last year , when WikiLeaks released thousands of secret government cables with newspapers including the Guardian .
It tells the story of a director making a film about Assange 's rise to fame .
The fictional director casts actors to play real - life figures including Barack Obama , the Russian president , Dmitry Medvedev , the Australian prime minister , Julia Gillard , and Assange .
"" We 're interested in the momentum of the story and the forces that move against Assange on a global scale , "" said Stainless Steel Rat 's director , Wayne Harrison .
"" It 's about people making decisions about whether they are going to support or oppose him . ""
Harrison , who divides his time between London and Sydney , says one of the themes of the play is how the furore over the leaked cables projected Assange 's "" private concerns on to the public stage
â€
¦
that 's what the movie within the play is all about "" .
Assange will be played by Darren Weller , an Australian actor who has dyed his hair white to match the WikiLeaks founder 's .
"" People are so familiar with him , the way he sounds and looks .
I think first and foremost I really need to get those things right , "" Weller said .
"" Assange has a manner of speaking that is quite monotonous : he stays on the same note .
He also has a slight speech impediment and his Rs sound almost like Ws , "" he said .
As well as covering the events surrounding the mass release of WikiLeaks material last year , the play will also focus on Assange 's life in Australia , including his early years touring the country with his theatrical mother and stepfather and his time as a hacker in Melbourne .
Its title is a reference to the pseudonym Assange used on the OKCupid dating website in 2006 .
His profile name was Harry Harrison , the same as the author of the 1961 sci - fi spy novel Stainless Steel Rat .
In the book the protagonist joins a spy agency comprising mainly former criminals like himself .
The cast read through the play for the first time a month ago .
"" We feel like we 're in guerilla theatre because it 's all happening so quickly .
It 's very exciting , "" said Katrina Retallick , who will play two characters in the production , including one of the Swedish women who has accused the WikiLeaks founder of rape .
Assange is fighting extradition from the UK to Sweden over sexual assault allegations made by two women .
He denies any wrongdoing ."
2011-06-09,"In April , the EU justice commissioner , Viviane Reding , warned that crossborder pursuits of bicycle thieves , piglet rustlers and those accused of trivial offences was damaging the authority of the European arrest warrant ( EAW ) .
This week it was the turn of MEPs to voice their alarm – or appreciation – of the accelerated system of extradition that is meant to speed up the wheels of justice across the EU .
Inevitably , questions about Julian Assange 's fate resurfaced .
The EU Commission has tried to sugar the pill , promising legislation to ensure that no one facing criminal charges in any member country will be denied access to a lawyer . ""
The law would require every person facing extradition under Europe 's fast - track extradition regime – the EAW – to be guaranteed access to a lawyer in both countries , to ensure protection of their fundamental rights , "" a soothing statement from Brussels declared .
The new measure includes a "" right for non - nationals to have their own country informed that they have been arrested "" , which , unless individuals wish to boast about bad behaviour , may sound less reassuring than intended .
Improved access to lawyers has been welcomed by Jago Russell , chief executive of Fair Trials International .
He said : "" It is a shocking fact that , even within Europe , people are still being denied private access to a lawyer at crucial points in their case .
This law will be an important step in the right direction , towards a Europe where countries can work together to tackle serious crime , safe in the knowledge that basic defence rights will be respected .
"" There have been calls for the introduction of a threshold below which extradition would not be permitted for minor allegations .
Poland , in particular , has become notorious among EU states for the large quantity of its warrants .
EAWs have been sought for such offences as bicycle theft , possession of 0.45 grams of cannabis , removing car tyres and stealing piglets .
More than 2,400 requests were received by the UK from Poland last year .
The EAWwas introduced in January 2004 to help speed extraditions between EU states .
Among those resisting removal from the UK is Julian Assange , the WikiLeaks founder , who is facing allegations of rape and sexual assault in Sweden .
The debate in the European parliament on Wednesday , which was launched on the initiative of the Greens , raised concerns about flaws in the EAW system .
Some fear it will be expanded to provide for the extradition of those merely wanted for questioning abroad .
Catherine Heard , head of policy at Fair Trials International said : "" MEPs from a broad political base clearly share our concerns about the serious and continuing misuse of the arrest warrant .
Only by working together to introduce key safeguards in the European arrest warrant system will the EU produce a fairer extradition system .
"" Questions tabled by MEPs included the use of warrants for questioning only ; warrants being issued to prosecute minor offences ; countries not respecting other states ' decisions to refuse extradition , leading to people being arrested repeatedly ; inadequate legal representation and poor prison conditions for extradited people held in pre - trial detention .
Labour MEP , Claude Moraes and Liberal Democrat MEP , Baroness Ludford asked : "" How is the commission going to guarantee that disproportionate use of the EAW is put to an immediate end both in law and practice ? ""
The reputation of the EAW , they warned , has been tarnished by reports of it being used for questioning instead of prosecution and execution of sentences and minor offences without proper consideration of whether surrender is proportionate .
Each warrant is said to cost on average € 25,000 ( £ 22,000 ) .
UKIP MEP Gerard Batten asked a more provocative question , inquiring whether "" the case against Mr Julian Assange demonstrates the possible abuse of the EAW for political purposes "" ?"
2011-06-15,"For those who like their meals to come with a side of indiscreet chatter , WikiLeaks may have an appetising opportunity .
The not - for - profit organisation is offering eight people the chance to dine with founder Julian Assange to raise funds for its work .
While Assange is said to often go long periods without eating , he is unlikely to be short of conversation given that he has become one of the most recognisable media figures over the past year and is rarely shy of offering an opinion .
The places are up for auction on eBay 's UK site and bidding for one place had reached Â£620 on Wednesday .
It says 100 % of the final sale price will support WikiLeaks .
Slovenian Marxist philosopher Slavoj Zizek will also be at the three - hour lunch at "" one of London 's finest restaurants "" on 2 July .
The pair will be giving a talk at the Troxy , east London , later the same day , "" discussing the impact of WikiLeaks on the world and what it means for the future "" .
WikiLeaks is dependent on public donations .
It suffered a blow when companies including Mastercard , Visa and PayPal stopped processing payments citing illegality after the site leaked US state department cables .
But a board member of Germany 's Wau Holland Foundation , one of the whistle - blowing platform 's main funding channels , said in December last year that despite the blocking of payment channels , funding was booming and that in two - and - a - half months it had collected more than â‚¬900,000 ( Â£790,000 ) on behalf of WikiLeaks .
Assange is on bail in Britain as he fights extradition to Sweden on allegations of sexual misconduct against two women .
He denies the allegations and claims they are politically motivated .
A separate fund is paying for his defence .
US authorities are investigating whether WikiLeaks broke the law by releasing thousands of secret government documents .
Earlier this month , Assange was awarded the 2011 Martha Gellhorn prize for journalism .
The annual prize is awarded to a journalist "" whose work has penetrated the established version of events and told an unpalatable truth that exposes establishment propaganda "" .
Zizek , international director of Birbeck Institute for the Humanities , described Assange as "" a real - life counterpart to the Joker in Christopher Nolan 's The Dark Knight "" in an essay for the London Review of Books , adding that the Joker was "" the only figure of truth in the film "" ."

2011-06-17,"Updated Saturday 9.30am ( as marked below ) : Too little has been made of the Daily Telegraph 's revelation about the government 's surveillance of Julian Assange during his current house arrest .
Whether or not you like him , whether or not you agree with him , whether or not you support WikiLeaks , whether or not you believe the allegations made against him , the conditions under which he is being forced to live are disproportionately harsh .
Updated par :
The above video shows that there are cameras outside Vaughan Smith 's house in Norfolk , the place where Assange is required to live .
It transpires that these are neither CCTV cameras nor automatic number - plate recognition ( ANPR ) cameras .
An "" embarrassed "" Smith says he now believes them to be radar - operated speed signs .
It is true that jail would be worse for Assange .
It is also true that the alleged leaker of much of the material released by WikiLeaks , Bradley Manning , is having a much tougher time in a US prison .
But think for a moment about the reason Assange has been bailed .
He is fighting extradition to Sweden where he is alleged to have committed sexual offences , which he denies .
Has anyone ever in Britain facing such charges been held in similar circumstances ?
His passport has been confiscated , he is tagged , he must sign in at a police station once a day , and all his movements are monitored .
Is all this really necessary , or even fair ?
Is n't this more about WikiLeaks than about an extradition case ?
And how much is it costing ?
One truly hilarious moment comes when two staff from Serco - a "" government services company "" ( aka security monitoring outfit ) - arrive to check the boxes linked to Assange 's tag .
They demand that filming is stopped and refuse to carry out their work because the camera remains on .
Why ?

2011-07-01,""" Without us , there would be no Arab spring . ""
Thus Julian Assange , or at least an actor playing Julian Assange , or to be more accurate an actor playing an actor playing Julian Assange .
If you thought WikiLeaks was complicated , welcome to WikiLeaks the play .
Stainless Steel Rat , by the award - winning Australian playwright
Ron Elisha at the Seymour Centre in Sydney , is a comic polemic , a theatrical device to explore the forces marshalled for and against Assange in his pyrrhic assault on the global establishment .
Outrageously funny in parts , it reflects on the human frailties that have cost Assange so much and examines whether WikiLeaks and its succession of whistleblowing scoops was a force for good or evil .
The action starts , inevitably , with a sex scene .
On a darkened stage a man 's vigorous thrusting is punctuated by the loud , impassioned cries of the two lovers .
We ca n't see their faces
but it 's clear one is Assange .
The other , a Swedish woman .
It 's August 2010 in Stockholm .
From the darkness , a film set emerges with lights , cameras and production props .
Two actors argue about the sex scene . ""
Did he really do this ? "" asks one .
"" This guy 's in IT .
They invented porn , "" replies the other .
"" What if the cables were a diversion ? ""
The action in the play takes place on a movie set .
The actors play real people including Assange , various world leaders and the lawyers defending the WikiLeaks founder .
It is a device that allows debate on stage about whether public information about Julian Assange is fact or fiction .
"" I wrote it like that because when I finished the play [ in February ] there was very little in print about Julian Assange , "" said Melbourne - based Elisha , who is a GP by day .
"" Everything about him was splattered across cyberspace but it was hard to know what was true and what was n't , "" he said .
One problem for Elisha and for the director , Wayne Harrison , comes when big international figures make their entrances .
Dmitry Medvedev , for example , who wants to give Assange the Nobel peace prize for exposing America 's secrets , comes across as an overpowering Russian oligarch figure .
While it works in terms of the comedy , his character seems more like Vladimir Putin than Medvedev .
The Barack Obama character , who wants Assange locked up , is brash , simplistic and aggressive .
It seems a spoof too far which ultimately dents the character 's believability .
The Assange character does n't appear on stage until an hour into the play .
When he does the actor , Darren Weller , does n't quite capture the introversion of the real Assange , but later he lights up the stage with fiery displays of temper .
Part of the appeal of the play is that it is about real people â€ “ "" theatre of the moment "" as Harrison calls it .
It means the comedy ( and there are plenty of laugh - out - loud moments ) is fresh and appealing .
Elisha 's pithy one - liners are delivered with brilliant timing .
At one point the Assange character is in Wandsworth prison , once also home to Oscar Wilde . ""
This cell is reserved for people who have been careless with their genitals , "" his character says .
The play runs to nearly two and a half hours and probably includes too much detail of Assange 's life , such as how many schools he went to and his protracted battle for custody of his son .
Assange 's falling out with the Guardian and New York Times rates a brief mention but the final half hour of the production is devoted to whether WikiLeaks has been a force for good or evil .
No conclusion is reached other than that Assange believed in what he and his colleagues were doing , whatever the cost , perceived or otherwise ."
2011-07-06,"The million - pound book deal signed by Julian Assange to write his memoirs has collapsed , the Guardian has learned , after the WikiLeaks founder became unhappy with the process .
Assange signed a high profile deal for his memoirs in December with the Edinburgh - based publishers Canongate and US firm Alfred A Knopf , for a reported sum of Â£930,000 .
The rights have subsequently been sold in 35 countries .
At the time , Assange said he hoped the book "" would become one of the unifying documents of our generation "" .
But he also indicated that the deal was critical in helping to fund his legal fight against extradition to Sweden to face accusations of rape and sexual assault .
According to publishing sources , however , the contract has fallen through , at least in its original form , after Assange indicated he no longer wished to write the kind of book that was initially envisaged .
He is thought to have told publishers that the book , ghostwritten by the novelist Andrew O'Hagan , could give ammunition to US prosecutors , whom he fears may seek his extradition on terrorist charges relating to WikiLeaks disclosures .
A spokeswoman for the Canongate said the publisher would not discuss the book "" until it is ready to "" , and would not make any statement until after next week , when the Australian will appear at the high court in London to appeal against a ruling in February that he should be extradited .
But she said the contract with Assange "" is still very much alive , with over 35 publishers around the world committed to publishing this book "" .
Assange did not return calls requesting comment .
O'Hagan also declined to comment , as did Assange 's agent , Caroline Michel of PFD .
It is not clear whether Canongate will seek to persuade Assange to change his mind or pursue the project in a different form , or whether material gathered in the course of researching the book will fall under the publisher 's copyright , which potentially could allow it to proceed without his involvement .
Also unclear is how much of the advance Canongate and the other publishers will recoup if the deal is not salvageable in another form .
Assange expressed discomfort with the memoir process soon after the deal was signed , telling the Sunday Times : "" I have spent Â£200,000 for legal costs and I need to defend myself . ""
Assange replaced his legal team , led by media lawyer Mark Stephens , earlier this month , before he had settled his account .
Asked the current financial position , Stephens said : "" I 'm sorry
but I 'm not in a position to comment . """
2011-07-11,"Julian Assange , the WikiLeaks founder wanted in Sweden over accusations of sexual assault , will launch a fresh appeal on Tuesday against his extradition at the high court in London .
The Australian will begin the latest stage of his legal challenge against attempts to send him to Sweden to face charges relating to alleged incidents with two women during a trip to Stockholm in August 2010 .
One accusation , that he had sex with a woman while she was asleep , would amount to rape under Swedish law if proved .
Both women had previously had consenting sex with Assange .
He denies any wrongdoing .
Swedish authorities secured a European arrest warrant in December and shortly afterwards he was detained by British police and bailed .
At his first appeal in February , Westminster magistrates court â€ “ sitting at Belmarsh â€ “ ordered that he should be extradited , despite his defence alleging he would not get a fair trial and that the extradition attempt was politically motivated .
The arrest warrant came as WikiLeaks was releasing thousands of classified US diplomatic cables it had obtained through a whistleblower .
Assange 's legal team argued that the conduct of the Swedish prosecutor amounted to an "" abuse of process "" because the allegations against him were initially dismissed and then reopened , the prosecutor had refused Assange 's offer of an interview and documents had not been made available to him in English .
They also claimed the Swedish prosecutor , Marianne Ny , was "" biased against men "" .
Westminster magistrates found against Assange and ordered his extradition to Sweden .
Assange has claimed this would make it easier for US authorities to seek his extradition to face possible charges over his release in 2010 of hundreds of thousands of classified documents including the US diplomatic cables and military logs from Afghanistan and Iraq .
Before their unsuccessful appeal in January , Assange 's legal team warned there was "" a real risk "" he could face the death penalty in the US or detention in GuantÃ¡namo Bay .
Assange has appointed a new legal team for Tuesday 's hearing .
His previous representative , media lawyer Mark Stephens , has been replaced by Gareth Peirce , who has represented the Guildford Four , the Birmingham Six and Moazzam Begg , a British Muslim who was held at GuantÃ¡namo .
Ben Emmerson QC , who specialises in European human rights law , will be Assange 's barrister , replacing Geoffrey Robertson QC , who acted for him in January .
The changes are thought to be part of a more conciliatory approach by Assange .
Peirce 's office would not comment on their strategy on Monday , but she has been previously quoted indicating the need for sensitivity and respect in the case . ""
Each of the human beings involved deserves respect and consideration , "" she reportedly wrote to former US senator Tom Hayden for an article in the Nation , a US magazine .
"" It is hoped that whatever steps as are required to be taken in the future will be taken thoughtfully , with sensitivity and with such respect . ""
Assange recently filmed an online fundraising advert in which he appeared to take credit for inspiring the uprising in Egypt .
The commercial spoofs the MasterCard ads , saying : "" Fighting legal cases across five countries : $ 1 m "" and "" added cost due to house arrest : Â£500,000 "" before concluding with Assange watching footage on his laptop of Egyptian protesters streaming towards Tahrir Square with the voiceover : "" Watching the world change as a result of your work : priceless .
There are some people that do n't like change .
For everyone else there is WikiLeaks . ""
WikiLeaks issued a statement in June marking Assange 's six months under house arrest at Ellingham Hall in Norfolk , the 10-bedroom country home of Vaughan Smith , founder of the Frontline club in London .
Assange celebrated his 40th birthday there on Sunday with about 100 guests .
WikiLeaks said Assange had not been charged with a crime in any country and complained his conditions were "" excessive and dehumanising "" .
The case will be heard by Lord Justice Thomas and Mr Justice Ouseley in court four of the Royal Courts of Justice and will begin at 10.30am .
It is scheduled to last for two days .
If Assange loses the case he could yet appeal to the supreme court ."

Sources close to the collective were unusually close - lipped about the targets of tomorrow 's hack , but talk within chat channels has suggested several top - level members of Anonymous are eager to launch attacks based around Julian Assange 's appeal hearing against extradition , which begins on Tuesday .
Others are also believed to have proposed targeting the Met in retaliation for alleged payments to police officers by News of the World reporters , and the general response to the phone hacking scandal .
Other speculation centres around material claimed to have been obtained last week from contractors relating to security and secrecy of "" former world leaders "" , or plans to target a senior leaders ' retreat at Bohemian Grove , California .
As is typical in the chaotic and occasionally paranoid Anonymous community , other sources close to the collective are warning some prominent members are probably engaging in "" disinformation campaigns "" ahead of any action .
Communication problems around the planned releases were compounded as the main chat channel used by Anonymous was offline for much of Monday , leaving even those close to senior members of the collective unable to verify rumours ahead of the release .
Rumours on Friday suggested that one Anonymous member had broken into the News International servers and taken copies of some internal emails which were being offered for sale or even ransom .
However this could not be confirmed , and the Guardian has not seen any evidence that the claimed email stash is legitimate , although News International 's site is understood to have been "" probed "" by members of Anonymous at the end of last week .
Last Wednesday , two days after the Dowler revelations , a listing of emails of NoW staff appeared on Pastebin , a favourite site for posting the results â€ “ or beginnings â€ “ of attacks against all sorts of sites by Anonymous and other hacker groups .
One source told the Guardian that News International 's server had been probed for up to 30 minutes at a time last week by hackers using "" proxy chaining "" â€ “ a method of logging in via a number of remote computers â€ “ to disguise their identity . ""
Everyone thinks Interpol will get involved at some point , "" the source said .
The hackers ' anger at the company was ignited by the revelation last week that a private detective acting for NoW had listened into voicemails on the phone of the murdered teenager Milly Dowler , which may have interfered with the police investigation to find her .
Anonymous has previously attacked PayPal and Visa over their refusal , following orders from the US government , to process donations for WikiLeaks .
It has also carried out online attacks against the Church of Scientology over what is seen as suppression of information ."
2011-07-12,"He arrived in silence and was told by his lawyer to leave in silence .
In between he was humbled .
Julian Assange , the controversial founder of WikiLeaks , appeared at the high court in London at the start of his latest fight against extradition to Sweden over sex allegations .
He was armed with a new strategy and a new legal team aimed at winning his freedom after 216 days of house arrest .
On Sunday , he celebrated his 40th birthday at Ellingham Hall in Norfolk with "" wiki cupcakes "" and a party for 100 friends and supporters .
But he was fighting an extradition request that he fears could pave the way to further extradition to America , and serious charges related to his leak of several hundred thousand classified US government documents .
The new approach demanded he fight his natural instinct to speak out , so he sealed his lips as he fought through a phalanx of photographers outside the Royal Courts of Justice .
Once inside the vaulted and wood - lined courtroom four where he faced Lord Justice Thomas and Mr Justice Ouseley , his new tactics became clear .
In essence , his lawyers would admit , his sexual behaviour with two Swedish women he had met while on work in Stockholm last August might have been seen as "" disrespectful , discourteous , disturbing "" but it was not illegal .
His failed appeal against the same extradition order in February had been marked by grandstanding speeches and a combative legal approach that tore into the Swedish authorities who wanted him to face questioning over four allegations of unlawful coercion , sexual molestation and rape .
Assange 's side had also claimed there was no chance of a fair trial in Sweden because of the political heat around the case after WikiLeaks released hundreds of thousands of classified US government documents in 2010 .
His new legal team advanced none of these arguments , and his counsel , Ben Emmerson , spelled out the difference in approach .
He told the court : "" Nothing I say should be taken as denigrating the complainants , the genuineness of their feelings of regret , to trivialise their experience or to challenge whether they felt Assange 's conduct was disrespectful , discourteous , disturbing or even pushing at the boundaries of what they felt comfortable with . ""
He then laid out their evidence against his client with relentless and clinical frankness .
Referring to evidence of an encounter on the night of 13 August given by a woman known as AA who was putting Assange up at her apartment , Emmerson said : "" The appellant 's physical advances were initially welcomed but then it felt awkward since he was ' rough and impatient ' ...
AA was lying on her back and Assange was on top of her ...
AA felt that Assange wanted to insert his penis into her vagina directly , which she did not want since he was not wearing a condom ...
she did not articulate this .
Instead she therefore tried to turn her hips and squeeze her legs together in order to avoid a penetration ... ""
AA tried several times to reach for a condom which Assange had stopped her from doing by holding her arms and bending her legs open and try to penetrate her with his penis without using a condom .
AA says that she felt about to cry since she was held down and could not reach a condom and felt this could end badly . ""
Assange , sitting among supporters including John Pilger , the campaigning investigative journalist , and Vaughan Smith , the owner of Ellingham Hall and founder of the Frontline Club for journalists , showed no emotion as these and other highly graphic personal details were recounted .
Emmerson explained how "" on one occasion he suddenly took all his clothes off on the lower part of his body and rubbed it and his erected penis against AA .
AA says she felt it was very strange behaviour and awkward "" .
However , Assange 's case against extradition does not hinge on whether he accepts these versions of events and testimonies relating to other incidents because there are no charges against him , the court heard .
Rather Emmerson said it was a question of whether the arrest warrant in connection with the allegations is valid on "" strict and narrow "" legal grounds .
He said it was not because there are significant discrepancies between the allegations of sexual assault and rape in the European arrest warrant and the testimonies of two women .
The warrant was a misinterpretation of the evidence and it was "" surprising and disturbing "" that Swedish district judges who requested Assange 's extradition had been misled , he said .
Emmerson told the court that there was no evidence that there was a lack of consent in the encounters , as suggested in the warrant , and that three of the allegations would not amount to criminal offences under English law .
Referring to the allegations in the warrant , Emmerson said : "" The senior district judge found that those factual allegations would establish dual criminality on the basis that lack of consent , and lack of reasonable belief in consent , may properly be inferred from the conduct described , particularly the references to ' violence ' and a ' design ' to ' violate sexual integrity ' .
However , that description of conduct is not accurate .
The arrest warrant misstates the conduct and is , by that reason alone an invalid warrant . ""
Mark Summers , also acting for Assange , said the European arrest warrant was not valid for several other technical reasons : under UK law it can not be used to secure pre - prosecution interviews ; Swedish prosecutors have not yet decided to press charges , and he could be interviewed by phone or Skype .
The case continues ."
2011-07-12,"The European arrest warrant issued for the WikiLeaks founder , Julian Assange , is invalid , the high court was told on Tuesday , because of significant discrepancies between its allegations of sexual assault and rape and the testimonies of two women he allegedly had sex with .
The warrant details four allegations of unlawful coercion , sexual molestation and rape , relating to encounters between Assange and two Swedish women while on a trip to Stockholm last August .
But Ben Emmerson QC , for Assange , said the warrant was a misinterpretation of the evidence and it was "" surprising and disturbing "" that Swedish district judges who requested Assange 's extradition had been misled .
Emmerson was opening the latest step in the Australian 's attempt to avoid being sent to Sweden for questioning and possible charges which Assange has said he fears could pave the way for him to be further extradited to the US .
There he could face charges relating to the leak of hundreds of thousands of classified government documents through WikiLeaks .
An earlier appeal failed and Assange has appointed a new legal team which is taking a more conciliatory approach .
Emmerson told Lord Justice Thomas and Mr Justice Ousely that there was no evidence about there being a lack of consent in the encounters as appeared to be suggested in the wording of the arrest warrant .
He said three of the allegations would not amount to criminal offences under English law .
Emmerson said : "" The senior district judge found that those factual allegations would establish dual criminality on the basis that lack of consent , and lack of reasonable belief in consent , may properly be inferred from the conduct described , particularly the references to ' violence ' and a ' design ' to ' violate sexual integrity ' .
However , that description of conduct is not accurate .
The arrest warrant misstates the conduct and is , by that reason alone , an invalid warrant . ""
Emmerson examined the witness testimonies of the encounters in graphic detail .
Referring to evidence of an encounter on the night of 13 August given by a woman known as AA who was hosting Assange at her apartment , Emmerson said : "" The appellant 's physical advances were initially welcomed but then it felt awkward since he was ' rough and impatient ' ...
they lay down in bed .
AA was lying on her back and Assange was on top of her ...
AA felt that Assange wanted to insert his penis into her vagina directly , which she did not want since he was not wearing a condom ...
she did not articulate this .
Instead she therefore tried to turn her hips and squeeze her legs together in order to avoid a penetration ...
AA tried several times to reach for a condom which Assange had stopped her from doing by holding her arms and bending her legs open and try to penetrate her with his penis without using a condom .
AA says that she felt about to cry since she was held down and could not reach a condom and felt this could end badly . ""
But , Emmerson said , crucially there was no lack of consent sufficient for the unlawful coercion allegation , because "" after a while Assange asked what AA was doing and why she was squeezing her legs together .
AA told him that she wanted him to put a condom on before he entered her .
Assange let go of AA 's arms and put on a condom which AA found .
"" Emmerson told the court the case did not hinge on whether Assange accepted this version of events and others relating to other incidents because there were no charges against him , but whether the arrest warrant in connection with them was valid on "" strict and narrow "" legal grounds .
As if to illustrate the change of strategy by Assange 's new legal team , Emmerson said : "" Nothing I say should be taken as denigrating the complainant , the genuineness of their feelings of regret , to trivialise their experience or to challenge whether they felt Assange 's conduct was disrespectful , discourteous , disturbing or even pushing at the boundaries of what they felt comfortable with . ""
Assange was in court with supporters including Vaughan Smith , the founder of the Frontline Club who is hosting his house arrest at Ellingham Hall in Norfolk , and John Pilger , the veteran investigative journalist .
Assange arrived at about 9.15am , saying nothing to questions as he moved at a snail 's pace through a tight scrum of photographers .
He was asked if he was looking forward to his latest day in court and whether he would take the case to the supreme court if he lost over the next two days .
He said nothing .
By the court railings , small groups of protesters gathered , including one carrying a banner saying : "" Free Assange !
Free Manning !
End the wars . """
2011-07-15,"Julian Assange 's biological father has described his son as a "" great dissident "" in what he said would be his first and probably only media interview .
John Shipton , who has been attending the Assange extradition hearing in London , spoke to the Spanish newspaper el PaÃ­s and confirmed that his son did not get to know him until his mid-20s .
"" I have kept my mouth closed so as not to hinder things , "" said Shipton , whose name Assange used to register the Wikileaks.org domain name in 2006 .
Shipton met Assange 's mother , Christine , then aged 17 , at an antiques shop on his way to a Vietnam war demonstration â€ “ which she joined .
Little is known about the relationship , except that it had ended by the time of their son 's first birthday â€ “ if not earlier .
Christine then married theatre director Brett Assange .
Shipton told el PaÃ­s that he first got to know his son after Christine rang his Sydney home in 1996 .
Assange was 25 at the time .
"" It was extraordinary , "" Shipton said .
"" Certain of his thought processes made it seem like I was staring into a mirror .
I could barely believe it .
He had the same logic , the same intense curiosity , the same obtuse way of constructing sentences ... that never end . ""
That meeting coincided with , or came soon after , Assange 's 1996 trial for computer hacking â€ “ where his lawyer talked of a "" really quite tragic "" nomadic childhood that saw him attend at least a dozen schools .
His mother became pregnant in her early 20s after she "" effectively ran away from home "" to Sydney , according to court documents used by Guardian journalists David Leigh and Luke Harding in their book WikiLeaks : Inside Julian Assange 's War On Secrecy .
The documents state that Shipton "" never took up residence or if he did only took up residence for a very short time "" and "" had no contact with [ Assange ] "" .
Assange nevertheless later felt confident enough to use his father 's name to register WikiLeaks ' internet domain name , re - registering Shipton 's nominal address in 2008 as Nairobi in Kenya .
Shipton had worried that his son was a modern Don Quixote . ""
At that time it seemed as though Julian loved tilting at windmills , but it turned out not to be like that . ""
He warned Assange that he was setting himself tough , idealistic targets . ""
When someone tells you they want to turn the world upside down , you reply : ' OK , try it .
But it 's not that easy ! '
"" Shipton , who is believed to work as a freelance architect in Sydney , said Assange had inherited Christine 's fighting spirit . ""
He is a great dissident , well - prepared for a new era in which direct action is practised via the internet . ""
He said his son 's style of dissidence followed in the tradition of people like Che Guevara , Apollinaire or south American hero SimÃ³n BolÃ­var .
Shipton is convinced Assange is the victim of a conspiracy .
"" I think all this has been organised , "" he said , while adding that he did not want to hurt Assange 's alleged Swedish victims with his words .
"" The intelligence agencies got involved in this business from the very start . ""
Assange 's father apparently sees the US government behind the decision by Mastercard and Visa to prevent WikiLeaks accepting donations from their credit cards .
"" There is no separation between governments and finance , "" he said .
"" There are many intelligent people in the world , but most seem to be wicked , while Julian seems to have the moral courage and ability to carry his vision through .
He seems to have an immense desire for justice in the world . """
2011-07-24,"Job : founder , WikiLeaks Age : 40 Industry : digital media Budget :
unknown 2010 ranking : 58 Hi - tech terrorist or beacon of information freedom ,
this year it has been impossible to ignore Julian Assange , the public face of WikiLeaks .
In December his organisation , the self - styled "" intelligence service of the people "" , released hundreds of classified US embassy cables , rattling nerves at the very top of the US government .
Assange was forced into hiding following the data release , the media storm whipping up even more when he was revealed to have been wanted for questioning over an alleged rape in Sweden , the country WikiLeaks chose as its home , ironically because of its powerful whistleblower protection laws .
The extradition case saw celebrity backers rush to his banner , from Jemima Khan to John Pilger ( and the deputy foreign minister of Ecuador , no less ) .
But the controversy did not end there .
Having fallen out with the Guardian and New York Times , he has also attracted criticism over the gagging orders that WikiLeaks staff have to sign .
This is probably why Assange was deemed to have "" gone up but with downward tendencies "" , in the words of one panellist .
WikiLeaks was launched in 2007 with a mission to change the world by abolishing official secrecy .
The site claims a range of founders but Assange remains its colourful , charismatic , impossible driving force .
Even so , only so much is known about the silvery haired , quietly spoken man himself .
His background â€ “ he was raised in Melbourne and convicted of computer hacking when he was a teenager is as much as we know â€ “ is information he thinks it wise not to share with the world at large ."
2011-09-01,"WikiLeaks and its founder , Julian Assange , parted company with mainstream opinion when Assange revealed his intention to make public all 250,000 raw US state department cables that have been in his hands since last year , regardless of possible reprisals to named individuals .
This flies in the face of efforts by the Guardian and other news organisations to redact references to confidential informants before publishing selected cables : efforts which may now appear to have been largely wasted .
Assange 's plans were foreshadowed at a secret meeting of the WikiLeaks team last November .
The diary of one of those present at Ellingham Hall , the stately home which was then their base , records : "" Heated conversation about rough plans on releasing cables … JA insistent all cables must somehow eventually be released . ""
His wish has now been realised , after a year punctuated by his arrest , heated quarrels with former associates , and a chapter of accidents within Assange 's chaotic organisation .
A few days after the Ellingham Hall meeting Assange turned himself in for arrest on an extradition warrant sought by Sweden , on allegations of sexual assault by two young WikiLeaks supporters there .
He is still fighting extradition .
On 7 December , the day of his arrest , a huge file of WikiLeaks information was posted on the Pirate Bay filesharing site by one of his supporters .
According to the group 's former No 2 , computer expert Daniel Domscheit - Berg : "" These people said they wanted to keep WikiLeaks operational , but they never spoke to Julian . ""
As a result , it was never apparently realised that the file - set included Assange 's copy of all the classified US cables .
Earlier in the year , according to Domscheit - Berg , Assange gave a copy of the cables file to the Guardian , one of the news organisations with whom he had agreed to work to publish the cables in redacted form .
He provided the Guardian with a password and access to a special online server , on which he said he would place a copy of the cables file , which would only remain in existence for a short time .
What Assange did not reveal was that he had not followed conventional security practice and created a new password for the transaction .
Instead , according to Domscheit - Berg , he had merely reused the existing master password , already known to others within WikiLeaks . ""
The file was never supposed to be shared with anyone at all .
To get a copy you would usually make a new copy with a new password .
He was too lazy to create something new . ""
Early this year the Guardian published a book on WikiLeaks .
In the course of it the password Assange had provided , assumed to be long obsolete , was published .
The book contained no information that would enable anyone to find and download the encrypted file .
This series of events has had unplanned consequences in recent weeks .
Domscheit - Berg , who says he parted company with Assange over security concerns among other reasons , ended up alleging to a German newspaper , Freitag , that WikiLeaks was insecure .
He said a file existed on the internet that contained the raw cables , and was capable of being accessed by the published password .
He and Freitag took care to provide no location information that would enable the file to be accessed by any member of the public .
The quarrel with Domscheit - Berg seemed to have had seismic consequences for Assange , who is still awaiting the result of his extradition appeal .
He published unsubstantiated accusations that Domscheit - Berg had links with western intelligence agencies , and started to pump out tens of thousands of previously unpublished cables , mostly apparently unredacted . ""
He feared he would not be the one any more to be publishing them , "" says Domscheit - Berg .
"" He is so egocentric and completely irrational . ""
To protests from the Australian and US governments that he was endangering sources , Assange dropped a series of hints on Twitter as to the location of the cables file on the internet .
He followed this up with a claim that he was now publishing new material because the Guardian had "" betrayed "" his password seven months earlier .
Assange 's claims about the Guardian were untrue ."
2011-09-02,"We are learning in numerous ways how hard it is , in a digital age , to keep control of information .
Voice messages , emails , corporate documents , medical records , DNA , government secrets â€ “ all are vulnerable to hacking , snooping and simple spillage .
From the moment a hacker ( or , possibly , a whistleblower ) passed a vast store of US government and military records to WikiLeaks
it was always on the cards that this data would eventually spill out indiscriminately into the open .
This week most of it has â€ “ accelerated by WikiLeaks itself , which chose to publish the state department cables in unredacted form .
This paper , and the four other news organisations involved in publishing heavily edited selections from the war logs and cables last year , are united in condemning this act .
From the start of our collaboration , it was clear to the newspapers â€ “ and apparently accepted , if reluctantly , by WikiLeaks 's founder , Julian Assange â€ “ that it was necessary to redact the material in order to minimise the potential risk to vulnerable people who might be placed in harm 's way by publication .
That joint exercise , which ended last December , has never been shown to have placed an individual 's life at risk .
But , with the well - documented rifts in the original WikiLeaks team last year , the data was not secured .
One copy was obtained by Heather Brooke , the freedom of information campaigner .
It now appears that last December another WikiLeaks employee was responsible for a further leak when he placed the unredacted cables on a peer - to - peer site with an old password â€ “ motivated , it seems , by the arrest of Assange on allegations concerning his private life .
It is not clear that even Assange â€ “ distracted by his legal actions over the Swedish sex allegations â€ “ knew of this act .
This , to be clear , was not the original file accessed by the Guardian last year , which was , as agreed with WikiLeaks , removed from a secure file server after we had obtained a copy and never compromised .
A handful of people knew of the existence of this republished file and , realising its potential for harm , they did not publish any clues as to how it might be accessed .
WikiLeaks , by contrast , tried to blame others for the leak , hinted at how it could be accessed , and then finally decided to publish it all to the world in an unredacted form .
Some WikiLeaks devotees and extreme freedom of information advocates will applaud this act .
We do n't .
We join the New York Times , Der Speigel , Le Monde and El PaÃ­s in condemning it .
Many of our newspapers ' reporters and editors worked hard to publish material based on the cables in a responsible , comprehensible and contextualised form .
We continue to believe in the validity and benefits of this collaboration in transparency .
But we do n't count ourselves in that tiny fringe of people who would regard themselves as information absolutists â€ “ people who believe it is right in all circumstances to make all information free to all .
The public interest in all acts of disclosure has to be weighed against the potential harm that can result .
It had never been entirely clear whether Assange thought he had a consistent position on this issue .
At various times he has scorned those who urged redaction ; at others he has portrayed himself as an advocate of responsible redaction .
He shows little or no understanding of the legal constraints facing less free souls than himself , often voicing contempt for publishers constrained by the laws of particular jurisdictions .
At its best Wikileaks seemed to offer the hope of frustrating the most repressive and restrictive .
But the organisation has dwindled to being the vehicle of one flawed individual â€ “ occasionally brilliant , but increasingly volatile and erratic .
There was no compelling need , even with the recent disclosures of the internal leak , for WikiLeaks to publish all the material in the form in which it did .
Julian Assange took a clear decision this week : he must take the responsibility for that ."
2011-09-02,"Julian Assange could face prosecution in Australia after publishing sensitive information about government officials amongst the 251,000 unredacted cables released this week .
WikiLeaks published its entire cache of US diplomatic cables without redactions to protect those named within , a move condemned by all five of the whistleblowing website 's original media partners .
Australia 's attorney general , Robert McClelland , confirmed in a statement on Friday that the new cable release identified at least one individual within the country 's intelligence service .
He added it is a criminal offence in the country to publish any information which could lead to the identification of an intelligence officer .
"" I am aware of at least one cable in which an ASIO officer is purported to have been identified , "" he said .
"" ASIO and other Government agencies officers are working through the material to see the extent of the impact on Australian interests . ""
On occasions before this week , WikiLeaks redacted identifying features where the safety of individuals or national security could be put at risk .
It appears this has n't occurred with documents that have been distributed across the internet this week and this is extremely concerning .
"" The new development adds to the pressure on the WikiLeaks founder , who is currently fighting extradition from the UK to Sweden to answer allegations of sexual misconduct .
Assange will be unable to remain in the UK if his extradition appeal is successful , as his visa will by then have expired .
Assange already faces legal action in the US , where a grand jury has been convened in Virginia to decide whether to prosecute the founder of the whistleblowing website .
Bradley Manning , the alleged source of the document , remains in custody in the US facing 34 separate charges .
The newly published archive contains more than 1,000 cables identifying individual activists ; several thousand labelled with a tag used by the US to mark sources it believes could be placed in danger ; and more than 150 specifically mentioning whistleblowers .
The cables also contain references to people persecuted by their governments , victims of sex offences , and locations of sensitive government installations and infrastructure .
The Guardian , New York Times , El PaÃ­s , Der Spiegel and Le Monde , who worked with WikiLeaks publishing carefully selected and redacted documents in December last year , issued a joint statement condemning the latest release .
"" We deplore the decision of WikiLeaks to publish the unredacted state department cables , which may put sources at risk , "" it said .
"" Our previous dealings with WikiLeaks were on the clear basis that we would only publish cables which had been subjected to a thorough joint editing and clearance process .
We will continue to defend our previous collaborative publishing endeavour .
We can not defend the needless publication of the complete data â€ “ indeed , we are united in condemning it . ""
The decision to publish by Julian Assange was his , and his alone . """
2011-09-02,"I joined WikiLeaks last November as a staffer for a three - month stint .
Culture shock came just a few days in , when Julian Assange gathered core staff and supporters at Ellingham Hall , a manor house owned by the Frontline Club founder and WikiLeaks supporter Vaughan Smith .
Around the dining table the team sketched out a plan for the coming months , to release the leaked US diplomatic cables selectively for maximum impact .
Phase one would involve publishing selected – and carefully redacted – high - profile cables through the Guardian , New York Times , Der Spiegel , Le Monde and El Pais .
Phase two would spread this out to more media organisations .
But clearly a large volume of cables would remain , of little interest to any media organisation .
Several at the meeting – myself included – stressed these documents , which would probably number hundreds of thousands , could not be published without similar careful redaction .
Others vehemently disagreed .
Johannes Wahlström , Swedish journalist and son of antisemitic WikiLeaks activist Israel Shamir , shouted : "" You do realise the idea of not putting ALL of these cables up is totally unacceptable to people around this table , do n't you ? ""
Julian took Wahlström 's their side .
One way or another , he said , all the cables must eventually be made public .
There were further disillusioning incidents .
During December 2010 , a period where WikiLeaks was struggling to muster even a $ 10,000 donation to the defence fund of Bradley Manning , the US soldier alleged to have leaked the cables , Assange nevertheless privately promised several thousand Australian dollars to fund Juice News , the makers of humorous pro - WikiLeaks YouTube videos .
Julian 's arrest loomed , on allegations of sexual assault .
Aware he would need money to post surety , he scrabbled for sources of cash .
He attempted to access WikiLeaks funds , received through donations .
He approached the Wau Holland Foundation , which manages the bulk of WikiLeaks ' finances , to ask for substantial funds – for "" the future of WikiLeaks "" .
Quite properly , it refused , as Julian 's personal legal action was not one of the stated purposes of the donations .
Assange also tried to obtain the cash held by WikiLeaks ' Icelandic division , asking the directors to sign a form authorising the transfer of their ( much smaller ) coffers .
When I asked one of them whether such a transfer was legal , he replied "" I have no idea "" – but signed anyway .
In the event , Julian mustered funds from celebrity backers .
But trying to use WikiLeaks ' precarious resources to fight a personal legal action was , to my view , morally indefensible .
WikiLeaks is not a conventional organisation .
It has no board , no governance , and no effective rules .
In such a febrile environment , and with Julian so central to the organisation 's ability to function , it 's not hard to see how such decisions came to be seen as correct .
So I decided to grit my teeth and carry on .
Dismay mounted , however , with the arrival of Israel Shamir , a self - styled Russian "" peace campaigner "" with a long history of antisemitic writing .
Shamir was introduced to the team under the pseudonym Adam , and it was only several weeks after he had left – with a huge cache of unredacted cables – that most of us started to find out who he was .
Press enquiries started to trickle in .
A little research revealed his unsavoury history , but I was told Julian would be unwilling for WikiLeaks to publish anything critical of Shamir .
Instead , shamefully , we put out a statement simply distancing WikiLeaks from him .
There followed even more damning allegations .
Shamir had been seen leaving the interior ministry of Belarus , an eastern European dictatorship .
The next day , the country 's dictator , Alexander Lukashenko , boasted he would start a Belarusian WikiLeaks showing the US was funding his political rivals .
Scores of arrests of opposition activists followed the country 's elections – but Shamir wrote a piece painting an idyllic picture of free , fair , elections in a happy country .
Human rights groups demanded answers , amid fears that Belarus may have received material from the cables .
No answers were supplied .
Julian would not look into the matter .
For an organisation supposedly devoted to human rights , the apparent lack of concern when faced with such a grave charge was overwhelming .
My trips to WikiLeaks ' HQ became far less frequent , and I attempted to leave the organisation early .
This was refused .
I was cornered for several days and asked to sign a gagging agreement .
Supporters were asked to "" apply psychological pressure "" to encourage me to sign , evidencing a growing cultlike ethos at the centre of the group .
I was disturbed and conflicted .
I still found the organisation 's aims were in many ways laudable , the financial and legal pressures unjust , and its publishing pattern far more responsible than it received credit for .
I could n't support its internal culture , its lack of accountability , willingness to lie publicly , and crucially its failure to condemn Shamir .
I supported the organisation 's principles , but not its methods .
The final straw for me came on Friday .
By drawing attention to , and then publishing in full , the unredacted cache of documents , WikiLeaks has done the cause of internet freedom – and of whistleblowers – more harm than US government crackdowns ever could .
Before the first publication of carefully redacted cables , human rights activists , NGOs , and organisations working with victims of horrific crimes contacted WikiLeaks begging us to take steps not to publish any names .
To be able to assure them details would be protected was an immeasurable relief .
These cables contain details of activists , opposition politicians , bloggers in autocratic regimes and their real identities , victims of crime and political coercion , and others driven by conscience to speak to the US government .
They should never have had to fear being exposed by a self - proclaimed human rights organisation ."
2011-09-18,"You did not have to listen for too long to Julian Assange 's half - educated condemnations of the American "" military - industrial complex "" to know that he was aching to betray better and braver people than he could ever be .
As soon as WikiLeaks received the State Department cables , Assange announced that the opponents of dictatorial regimes and movements were fair game .
That the targets of the Taliban , for instance , were fighting a clerical - fascist force , which threatened every good liberal value , did not concern him .
They had spoken to US diplomats .
They had collaborated with the great Satan .
Their safety was not his concern .
David Leigh and Luke Harding 's history of WikiLeaks describes how journalists took Assange to Moro 's , a classy Spanish restaurant in central London .
A reporter worried that Assange would risk killing Afghans who had co - operated with American forces if he put US secrets online without taking the basic precaution of removing their names . ""
Well , they 're informants , "" Assange replied . ""
So , if they get killed , they 've got it coming to them .
They deserve it . ""
A silence fell on the table as the reporters realised that the man the gullible hailed as the pioneer of a new age of transparency was willing to hand death lists to psychopaths .
They persuaded Assange to remove names before publishing the State Department Afghanistan cables .
But Assange 's disillusioned associates suggest that the failure to expose "" informants "" niggled in his mind .
It is hard to believe now , but honest people once worked for WikiLeaks for all the right reasons .
Like me , they saw the site as a haven ; a protected space where writers could publish stories that authoritarian censors and libel lawyers would otherwise have suppressed .
James Ball joined and thought that in his own small way he was making the world a better place .
He realised that WikiLeaks was not what it seemed when an associate of Assange â€ “ a stocky man with a greying moustache , who called himself "" Adam "" â€ “ asked if he could pull out everything the State Department documents "" had on the Jews "" .
Ball discovered that "" Adam "" was Israel Shamir , a dangerous crank who uses six different names as he agitates among the antisemitic groups of the far right and far left .
As well as signing up to the conspiracy theories of fascism , Shamir was happy to collaborate with Belarus 's decayed Brezhnevian dictatorship .
Leftwing tyranny , rightwing tyranny , as long as it was anti - western and anti - Israel , Shamir did not care .
Nor did Assange .
He made Shamir WikiLeaks 's representative in Russia and eastern Europe .
Shamir praised the Belarusian dictatorship .
He compared the pro - democracy protesters beaten and imprisoned by the KGB to football hooligans .
On 19 December 2010 , the Belarus - Telegraf , a state newspaper , said that WikiLeaks had allowed the dictatorship to identify the "" organisers , instigators and rioters , including foreign ones "" who had protested against rigged elections .
The proof of Assange and Shamir 's treachery was strong but not conclusive .
Given Shamir 's history , there were reasonable grounds for fearing the worst .
But even now , you can not show beyond reasonable doubt that the state has charged this pro - democracy politician or that liberal artist with treason or collaborating with a foreign power because WikiLeaks named names .
One can say with certainty , however , that Assange 's involvement with Shamir is enough to discredit his claim that he published the documents in full because my colleagues on the Guardian inadvertently revealed a link to a site he was meant to have taken down .
WikiLeaks put the cables on the web last month with evident relish , and ever since I have been wondering who would be its first incontrovertible victim .
China appeared a promising place to look .
The authorities and pro - regime newspapers are going through the names of hundreds of dissidents and activists from ethnic minorities .
To date , there have been no arrests , although in China , as elsewhere , the chilling effect WikiLeaks has spread has caused critics of the communists to bite their tongues .
In Ethiopia , however , Assange has already claimed his first scalp .
Argaw Ashine fled the country last week after WikiLeaks revealed that the reporter had spoken to an official from the American embassy in Addis Ababa about the regime 's plans to intimidate the independent press .
WikiLeaks also revealed that a government official told Arshine about the planned assault on opposition journalists .
Thus Assange and his colleagues not only endangered the journalist .
They tipped off the cops that he had a source in the state apparatus .
Once we have repeated Orwell 's line that "" so much of leftwing thought is a kind of playing with fire by people who do n't even know that fire is hot "" , there is work to do .
First , there needs to be relentless pressure on the socialist socialites and haggard soixante - huitards who cheered Assange on .
Bianca Jagger , Jemima Khan , John Pilger , Ken Loach and their like are fond of the egotistical slogan "" not in my name .
"" They are well - heeled and well - padded men and women who know no fear in their lives .
Yet they are happy to let their names be used by Assange as he brings fear into the lives of others .
We need also to question the motives of the wider transparency movement .
Anti - Americanism is one of its driving inspirations and helps explain its perfidies .
If you believe that the American "" military - industrial complex "" , Europe or Israel is the sole or main source of oppression , it is too easy to dismiss the victims of regimes whose excesses can not be blamed on the west .
Assange 's former colleagues tell me that the infantile leftism of the 2000s is not the end of it .
Never forget , they say , that Assange came from a backwater Queensland city named Townsville .
He 's a small - town boy desperate to make the world notice .
The grass or squealer usually blabs because he wants to settle scores or ingratiate himself with the authorities .
Assange represents a new breed , which technology has enabled : the nark as show - off .
The web made Assange famous .
It allows him to monitor his celebrity â€ “ I am told that even the smallest blogpost about him rarely escapes his attention .
When he sees that the audience is tiring , the web provides him with the means to publish new secrets and generate new headlines .
Under the cover of holding power to account , Assange can revel in the power the web gives to put lives in danger and ensure he can be what he always wanted : the centre of attention ."
2011-09-22,"Julian Assange 's publishers will publish on Thursday the "" unauthorised first draft "" of his autobiography without his consent , months after the WikiLeaks founder withdrew from a million - pound contract for his memoirs .
In a dramatic move , Canongate has defied Assange 's wishes and secretly printed thousands of copies of Julian Assange :
The Unauthorised Autobiography , with the book being shipped amid strict security to booksellers in preparation for imminent release .
The enormous security operation was put in place by the publishers , according to a source , to stop the author blocking publication .
Assange signed a high - profile deal , reportedly worth a total of Â£930,000 , with the Edinburgh - based publisher and the US firm Alfred A Knopf in December .
The manuscript was subsequently sold in more than 35 countries .
Assange said at the time that he believed the book would become "" one of the unifying documents of our generation "" .
But after seeing a first draft in March , the WikiLeaks founder told his publishers that he no longer intended to write the book , believing it could give ammunition to US prosecutors seeking his extradition over possible espionage charges relating to the WikiLeaks cable release .
He formally withdrew from his contract on 7 June and since then the Australian and his publisher have been locked in a bitter dispute over the contract and his Â£500,000 advance , which he has not returned .
Assange , requiring funds for his legal fight against extradition to Sweden to face allegations of rape and sexual assault , had placed the advance in escrow , meaning that his former legal team have first claim on any assets .
The Independent , which is to serialise the book , starting on Thursday , said Andrew O'Hagan , Assange 's ghostwriter , had asked for his name to be removed from the book .
The paper said that Canongate , faced with a financial crisis , gave Assange two months to work on the manuscript and , finally , a 12-day window to seek an injunction , which expired on Monday .
Assange has not sought to block the book .
Assange did not respond to requests for comment , but according to a source close to him , he was aware the publisher had plans to release the draft manuscript , and would have liked to have enjoined it , "" but the manner in which this has happened has reduced his options to do so .
The book is not in a form that Julian ever expected or believed should be published , and certainly he 's concerned that it is n't something that he has properly read through and checked . ""
Neither O'Hagan , nor Assange 's current or former lawyers were available for comment .
Canongate said : "" Despite sitting for more than 50 hours of taped interviews and spending many late nights at Ellingham Hall in Norfolk ( where he was â€ “ and still is â€ “ living under house arrest ) discussing his life and the work of WikiLeaks with the writer he had enlisted to help him , Julian became increasingly troubled by the thought of publishing an autobiography .
After reading the first draft of the book that was delivered to the publishers at the end of March , he declared : ' All memoir is prostitution . '
On 7 June 2011 , Julian told Canongate he wanted to cancel his contract . ""
However , he had already signed his advance over to his lawyers to settle his legal bills and has not repaid the advance owed since .
So the contract still stands and Canongate has decided to honour it and publish the autobiography . ""
In a preface to the book , Canongate explains its reasons for defying Assange 's wishes . ""
"" We disagree with Julian 's assessment of the book .
We believe it explains both the man and his work , underlining his commitment to the truth .
Julian always claimed the book was well written ; we agree , and this also encouraged us to make the book available to readers . ""
The volume , Canongate said , "" fulfils â€ ¦ the promise of the original book proposal and is , like its author , passionate , provocative and opinionated . "" .
Given sufficient sales , the publisher confirmed Assange would receive royalties once the advance had been covered .
The Independent says Assange writes in the book about Swedish allegations that he had been warned by a source in an unnamed intelligence agency that the US government was planning to set him up .
Speaking of the two women who accused him of assault , he says : "" The international situation had me in its grip , and although I had spent time with these women , I was n't paying enough attention to them , or ringing them back , or able to step out of the zone that came down with all these threats and statements against me in America .
One of my mistakes was to expect them to understand this ?
I was n't a reliable boyfriend , or even a very courteous sleeping partner , and this began to figure .
Unless , of course , the agenda had been rigged from the start . ""
In the book extracts published on Wednesday , Assange gives his first account of the sexual encounters with the two women in Stockholm which led to the current demands from Swedish authorities for his extradition to answer sexual assault allegations .
The memoirs say Assange describes one of the women , without naming her , as "" a little neurotic "" .
He says that he failed to phone the second women after their night together , which "" turned out to be the most expensive call I did n't make "" .
He insists : "" I did not rape these women , and can not imagine anything that happened between us that would make them think so , except malice after the fact , a joint plan to entrap me , or a terrible misunderstanding that was stoked up between them .
I maybe a chauvinist pig of some sort , but I am no rapist . ""
The book says Assange admits one of the women 's claims : that they wanted him to take an STD test , which he failed to do .
But the book is silent on the main allegation : that he had sex without a condom against his partner 's will .
In the extracts , he also talks of the thrill of computer hacking , and how accessing top - secret websites quickly became addictive : "" The thrill was exorbitant .
It was like the first time you beat an adult at chess . ""
He writes of himself and other hackers finding their "" ways into the workings of vast corporations "" and the excitement of the experience as being "" mindblowing . ""
The book will not be published in the US .
"" We cancelled our contract for Julian Assange 's memoir , "" Knopf told the New York Observer .
"" The author did not complete â€ ¦ the manuscript or deliver a book to us in accordance with our agreement .
We will not be moving forward with our publication . """
2011-09-22,"It started out as a dream Â£1.2 m publishing contract , with a vision of many millions to be made for all parties in worldwide book sales and film deals .
But Julian Assange : the Unauthorised Autobiography â€ “ as the Canongate publishing director , Nick Davies , titled the book jacket â€ “ has turned out to be something of a nightmare , threatening the hoped - for profit bonanza .
There are not many autobiographies whose subject angrily disowns it on publication day , as Assange did , when he revealed that the manuscript had in fact been penned and handed over by someone else : in this case , ghostwriter Andrew O'Hagan , who had hoped to keep his role quiet .
The founder of WikiLeaks upheld his reputation for 360-degree belligerence by claiming that he had been "" screwed over to make a buck "" by an opportunist publisher whom he had tried to injunct .
To complete the picture of acrimony , Assange went on to publicly denounce his former lawyers , claiming they were sitting on his publishers ' advance of Â£412,000 , which they were holding to cover their legal fees .
Assange 's allegations of "" extreme overcharging "" were rapidly denied by the London media firm of Finers , Stephens , Innocent ( FSI ) .
The saga of Assange 's memoirs began last year , when after co - operating with the Guardian and the New York Times to publish a series of huge electronic leaks he had obtained of US military material he was arrested in London , wanted for extradition and questioning by Swedish authorities about claims of sexual assault from two women in Stockholm .
A book deal was drawn up and clinched by the London literary agent Caroline Michel , under which Canongate , the innovative Scottish firm run by Jamie Byng , and the US publishers Knopf agreed to pay Â£600,000 and $ 800,000 respectively for the rights , with Knopf paying $ 250,000 ( Â£162,000 ) in advance .
Canongate also agreed to pay upfront O'Hagan 's ghostwriting fee , believed to exceed Â£100,000 .
Assange already seemed to have the possibility in mind that he might withdraw from the deal .
Sources close to the Canongate negotiations say he demanded a deal that he could keep Â£125,000 of the advance whatever happened .
Byng laughed this out of court , responding according to correspondence seen by the Guardian : "" We can not accept â€ ¦ the idea that regardless of whether Julian delivers ( or regardless of what he delivers or regardless of when he delivers ) , he will keep Â£125,000 . ""
Canongate also negotiated a crucial loophole in the contract , which it was eventually to invoke .
It would pay Assange Â£250,000 immediately on signature of the deal , as the publisher 's share of the first tranche of the advance .
But it said : "" If â€ ¦ the manuscript has not been delivered by the prescribed date or its final form is not acceptable to the Publisher , the Publisher has the right to decide whether to continue to publish the Work .
If the Publisher decides to continue to publish the Work the Proprietor agrees that all typescript or notes relevant to the said Work shall belong to the Publisher . ""
With this reassurance , the publishers on both sides of the Atlantic wrote Assange large cheques and O'Hagan set to work , recording hours of reminiscences from Assange , throughout the winter , at the chilly country premises of Captain Vaughn Smith , owner of the journalists ' Frontline Club in London , who had guaranteed to supervise Assange while he was on bail .
The money went into the client account for the Assange defence fund , administered by solicitor Mark Stephens , who was conducting Assange 's criminal defence .
Assange now claims he thought he was getting the services of top QCs and solicitors pro bono .
But FSI , which says only the initial advice tendered was free , eventually put in bills that in total are reported to exceed the advance .
Stephens , who made spirited speeches on the courtroom steps in defence of Assange , says : "" No single person at FSI believes that Julian was overcharged . ""
But the row over money appears to have played a crucial role in the implosion of the book project .
All sources agree that O'Hagan did his job diligently and produced a draft manuscript by March , as required .
But Assange refused to sign off on it .
Some sources suggest that , after failing to sell the Hollywood film rights to his memoirs , Assange realised that all future payments on the book would be swallowed up by his lawyers .
If , on the other hand , he had no visible assets , his legal representatives could whistle for their money .
Assange himself , according to the statements he put out , denies this .
He claims he was "" not in a position to dedicate my full attention to a book "" in view of his upcoming fight against extradition .
He also claims that he was willing to renegotiate a delivery date .
Canongate firmly rejects these claims , insisting that Assange would never confirm in writing his agreement to any new delivery date .
The publisher says that even a week before it put out the unauthorised version , it gave Assange a final chance to fulfil his side of the bargain .
Both Canongate and Knopf were in a painful position .
Knopf has now cancelled its contract , and the Assange camp will not respond to claims that Knopf wants its $ 250,000 back , other than to say it is sitting in the FSI legal account .
Canongate , Â£350,000 out of pocket on the advance and the ghostwriter fees , had intended to recoup all its money and more besides , by sales deals with 38 foreign publishers .
Had it not published , there would have been a large hole in its finances .
As it is , many of the foreign deals are now in jeopardy and will have to be renegotiated .
Only two are reported to have firmly signed up so far to the new "" unauthorised "" book .
One publishing source says : "" The economic climate of the deal has certainly altered for Canongate . ""
One benefit for the publisher , however , is that under the get - out clause in the contract it will no longer be obliged to pay the second and third tranche of the advance
â€ “ a saving of Â£350,000 .
Canongate has , however , promised to pay Assange any royalties he is due after the paid - out advances have been recouped .
One of the problems Canongate faces in this extraordinary literary imbroglio is that the book it has put out will be criticised for its inadequacy and , in some cases , the manuscript 's errors .
Owing to the secrecy with which copies were dumped out to bookshops , there appears to have been only a limited process of factchecking .
The book appears to stop abruptly late last year , before Assange had even published his final batch of leaks in the form of the US diplomatic cables .
It does not deal with major aspects of Assange 's career , such as his breach with his former partner at WikiLeaks , Daniel Domscheit - Berg .
Assange himself is criticising it on the sidelines for being an erroneous and unchecked manuscript .
Canongate themselves describe it as a "" draft "" rather than a completed work .
Some observers still believe that Assange stands to make a small fortune from his eventual royalties .
The book itself will certainly find a sale among WikiLeaks aficionados around the world .
Its account of the Swedish sex allegations against him , still to be resolved , contains new hints that the young women who complained about him were "" neurotic "" , "" vague "" or had a mysterious hostile agenda .
His references to the "" hardcore feminism "" he suffered from in Sweden will ignite controversy again , weeks before British appeal judges are due to rule on his continued attempt to fight extradition .
A sizeable proportion of the manuscript is devoted to attacks on media organisations with which he formerly co - operated , including the Guardian .
These too , are accused of "" double - crossing "" him .
Guardian reporters are characterised as "" weaklings with a crush "" rather than "" men of action and principle "" , and on one occasion are described as "" lily - livered gits in glass offices "" .
The former editor of the New York Times , Bill Keller , is the target of special ire for his allegedly unco - operative attitude , described as "" a moral pygmy with a self - justifying streak the size of the San Andreas fault "" .
Assange writes : "" The cock crowed three times and Bill Keller shamelessly denied us . ""
Assange denies the disclosure made in the Guardian 's previously published book , that he once said US informants in Afghanistan "" deserved to die "" .
He now maintains he was merely quoting an attitude held by some unnamed others .
He is silent on accusations made against him that he associates with antisemitic propagandists .
He is also silent on some of the details of the sex allegations , particularly the accusation that he had sex without a condom against a woman 's wishes .
He does admit , however , that he may be seen as "" cold "" and a "" chauvinist pig "" by some people .
It is likely that this week 's publication will represent a unique publishing melodrama .
But it is yet to be seen whether Canongate can turn it into adequate sums of cash ."
2011-09-22,"The truth is out â€ “ or at least the "" unauthorised autobiography "" .
Opening with a dramatic scene in the back of a police van with "" press photographers
â€ ¦ scrabbling around the windows like crabs in a bucket "" , and ending in a Norfolk house that "" was soon to become â€ ¦ [ a ] prison for the foreseeable future "" ,
the promised account of the "" global struggle to force a new relationship between the people and their governments "" hits bookshops today , after a cloak - and - dagger operation to prevent its subject from halting its publication .
But whose book is it ?
The subject , Julian Assange , disowns it , claiming in a statement on the Wikileaks website that his publisher , Canongate , is "" profiteering from an unfinished and erroneous draft "" which was never intended for publication , but was handed over "" for viewing purposes only "" .
According to the Independent , which has begun serialising the book today , ghostwriter Andrew O'Hagan became "" increasingly uncomfortable about the furore "" , and appears only as an unnamed writer in the publisher 's note describing the "" more than 50 hours of taped interviews "" on which the book is based .
Perhaps the real author of the book is head of Canongate Jamie Byng , who splashed out on the Assange autobiography at the end of last year , presumably hoping that the man of the moment would deliver the kind of landslide publishing victory his house pulled off with Barack Obama .
But now , Canongate finds itself accused by Assange himself of "" screwing people over to make a buck "" : he claims that the published version was in fact a draft , a "" work in progress "" and that he had promised to provide a new version of the book by the end of this year .
According to Canongate the contract "" still stands "" , since Assange had "" already signed his advance over to his lawyers to settle his legal bills "" before informing them he wanted to cancel the deal .
They have "" decided to honour it â€ “ and to publish "" â€ “
but it 's difficult to see where honour comes into this decision .
Canongate publishing director Nick Davies denies Assange 's advance was the reported Â£500,000 , but tells the Bookseller that the Independent was "" left with no other option "" .
Maybe you have sympathy with a small publisher straining under a "" financial imperative "" , but is n't it just wrong to publish something against an author 's wishes , even if that author is a little hard to work with ?
This autumn might have looked pretty bleak fior Canongate , without a book that has already shot to the top of Amazon 's list of movers and shakers , but sometimes the hard decision is to do nothing at all ."
2011-09-22,"In Julian Assange 's "" unauthorised autobiography "" , which was published yesterday against his wishes , the world 's most famous computer hacker goes into lurid detail about the encounters that led the Swedish authorities to seek his extradition from Britain to face charges of rape .
There were two women involved â€ “ woman "" A "" and woman "" W "" â€ “ with each of whom he says he had casual , consensual sex .
At the time of his visit to Sweden in the summer of last year Assange believed that the US was seeking to prosecute or otherwise punish him for publishing thousands of state secrets on his WikiLeaks website , and he says he was then under such stress that he welcomed the attentions "" of these smiling and affectionate women "" .
He says he had sex "" several times "" one night with woman "" A "" , a political activist , who next day "" seemed totally happy , laughing , and drinking with me and my friends and her friends until late "" .
And similarly with woman "" W "" , whom he had met at a press conference , he had enjoyed a friendly breakfast and a bicycle ride before taking his leave of her with a goodbye kiss .
"" I may be a chauvinist pig of some sort , "" he says , "" but I am no rapist . ""
So why , if so , did these women later go to the police and accuse him of rape ?
Assange toys with the idea that he could have been a victim of an American - sponsored honeytrap , but he seems to veer towards the conclusion that it was simply a case of revenge for his own boorish behaviour .
Not only did he fail to keep up with woman "" A "" , but he was even more offhand with woman "" W "" , who had asked him to telephone her from a train he boarded after they had kissed goodbye .
"" I did n't do that , and it has already turned out to be the most expensive call I did n't make , "" he says .
So , barring the possibility that he is in fact guilty as charged , it seems that William Congreve was right when he wrote in The Mourning Bride , his play of 1697 : "" Heaven has no rage like love to hatred turned , Nor hell a fury like a woman scorned .
"" It has been Congreve 's week , for his wisdom seems to apply equally to the troubles afflicting Chris Huhne , the Liberal Democrat energy secretary .
Last year Huhne suddenly left his wife Vicky Pryce for another woman after 26 years of marriage , and since then she has done all she can to make his life uncomfortable .
Last May she claimed that he had tried to get her to take speeding points on his behalf , which would have been a criminal offence , and just lately she has been up at the Lib Dem conference in Birmingham haunting him and his mistress , Carina Trimingham .
Huhne told party activists at a fringe meeting that he was "" enormously regretful "" for what he had done to Pryce , that he understood her stress , and that he had asked her to forgive him .
But she refused to do that , and this week she responded to his attempt at contrition with a very angry statement : "" I am surprised that my ex - husband considers it appropriate to talk at a public meeting about the very private aspects of our family life .
I consider that what he said is a serious intrusion into mine and our family 's private life .
"" I feel rather sorry for the Essex police and for the Crown Prosecution Service that it is against this background of personal acrimony that they have had to conduct their investigation into the allegation that Huhne was willing to lie about who was driving his car when it was found to be speeding .
This may partly explain why it has taken such a long time for them to decide whether or not to prosecute him .
It is four months now since Pryce first made her allegation , and you might think this would be more than enough time for the police to crack such a case .
But if their decision hangs on nothing more than which of these miserable former spouses to believe , it is understandable that they are slow to reach it .
And if , as Huhne believes , the case against him will shortly be dropped , this may be seen as yet another vindication for Congreve .
Kate Winslet and the sad demise of the stiff upper lip
It is salutary to be reminded how little influence this column has .
How often have I begged Kate Winslet to "" calm down , dear "" and accept her acting awards with dignity , or at least in a manner befitting her chosen image as the down - to - earth girl - next - door from Reading ?
Have I not urged her to live up to the standards for which British actors were once praised by Gil Cates , the 14-times producer of the Academy Awards show , who said that he loved English Oscar winners because "" their speeches are so classy and precise "" ?
But Winslet has taken no notice .
Unconcerned by the derision caused by her sobbing , incoherent utterances at the Golden Globe Awards a couple of years ago
, she was no better this week when she won the Best Actress prize at the Emmy television awards in Los Angeles . ""
Oh look , I really did win it , "" she spluttered .
"" Oh gosh !
OK .
Thank you so much . ""
Asked by a reporter afterwards to explain her breathless ramble , she replied : "" It just comes out the way it comes out .
There 's not a huge amount you can do about it . ""
Is that not a strange thing for a professional actor to say ?"
2011-09-22,"It was n't supposed to happen like this .
Late last year Canongate , the publishing house I work for , signed Julian Assange 's autobiography to huge media attention .
Julian had just been released from Wandsworth prison and wanted to find a publisher for his book .
And why not ?
Everyone else was at it .
Daniel Domscheit - Berg , the disillusioned former WikiLeaks spokesperson , was busy spinning his memoir .
The Guardian and the New York Times were eager to put their respective versions of events across .
Here was Julian 's chance to raise some much - needed money for WikiLeaks and to set his critics straight .
And Canongate Books seemed like the perfect fit : a small , independent publishing house that has always been happy to take a risk and admired what Julian and WikiLeaks had achieved .
The first three months could n't have gone much better .
Canongate 's managing director , Jamie Byng , and I travelled up to Norfolk to see Julian in early January .
Our first priority was to find a ghostwriter to work on the project .
Julian was very clear about what he wanted : "" I have all the facts .
Find me a novelist who can turn those facts into stories .
"" We struck it lucky with the writer we found : an award - winning novelist who was equally comfortable writing serious , hard - hitting reportage .
He was a strong character too .
Somebody who could put his hand up and tell Julian when he was talking shit or veering off subject .
It was a brilliant combination and the two men worked late into the night , most nights , drinking whisky in the icy - cold drawing room at Ellingham Hall through January , February and March .
At the same time , Canongate â€ “ on Julian 's behalf
â€ “ struck rights deals with 38 of the best publishing houses around the world .
This really would be a global book launch , which seemed fitting for the founder of WikiLeaks and his international fanbase .
What could possibly go wrong ?
Julian 's ghostwriter delivered a brilliant first draft of the book , bang on schedule , at the end of March .
We read it and loved it .
Julian did n't .
He did n't love it .
We 're not even sure how much he actually read .
It was an extraordinary reaction to a manuscript he should have been grateful for and immensely proud of .
What followed was a series of broken promises .
We set Julian free to work on the manuscript himself .
He had six weeks to edit and rewrite .
On the day he was supposed to return it to us , we heard that he 'd lost all of his work .
It was buried in one of his many laptops and he could n't find it ( dogs and homework came to mind ) .
Then he told us he wanted to cancel his contract .
But he could n't repay his advance .
He had already signed it over to his lawyers to cover his escalating legal bills .
There have been countless other twists and turns to this extraordinary story .
But the reason we 've decided to publish the book â€ “ against Julian 's will , but with clear forewarning â€ “ is this : with no prospect of ever seeing Julian 's advance repaid to us , and with little chance of convincing Julian to engage with that first draft , we had only one sensible option â€ “ to publish the draft that we felt was so strong and which conformed so closely to the original brief .
There is a financial imperative , of course .
We hope that in publishing the book we will recover some of our losses .
But we are also immensely proud of the book itself .
It is a compelling portrait of one of the most mercurial figures alive today .
As for that much commented - upon subtitle , The Unauthorised Autobiography , it is definitely a publishing first .
And given we 're talking about Julian Assange and WikiLeaks there is , of course , a sweet irony to it too .

2011-09-23,"9.40am :
Good morning .
Julian Assange 's publishers , Canongate , have this morning released his "" unauthorised autobiography "" despite an attempt by the Wikileaks founder to withdraw from his million - pound book deal .
The book â€ “ based on an early 70,000-word draft of the manuscript written by Assange with the novelist Andrew O'Hagan and shown to the publishers in March â€ “ was released amid heavy secrecy to stop the author from seeking an injunction to block publication , the Guardian reported yesterday .
In a statement to the Associated Press last night , Assange accused the publisher of "" profiteering from an unfinished and erroneous draft "" . ""
The events surrounding its unauthorised publication by Canongate are not about freedom of information , they are about old - fashioned opportunism and duplicity screwing people over to make a buck , "" he said .
But the Australian also gave a rare insight into his strained financial situation , which may be helped by publication , since Canongate has confirmed it will pay him royalties if sales are sufficient to first cover his Â£500,000 advance .
"" My legal costs are mounting due to politically motivated legal attacks and a financial blockade jeopardises Wikileaks ' continued operations , "" he said .
We 'll be sharing selected highlights and reaction here .
- 10.24am : The first thing to say about the book is that it is very obviously a fragment .
The narrative ends before the US Embassy cables release in November last year and Assange 's arrest and subsequent bailing under curfew to Ellingham Hall , though the foreword has a short account of his time in Wandsworth prison , which he describes as "" a kind of deviant 's Barbarella "" .
The story focuses instead on Assange 's childhood and early adulthood in Australia , the origins of Wikileaks through the "" Collateral Murder "" video release , and the early days of the organisation 's relationships with media partners including the Guardian , of which more later .
Almost a third of its 339 pages is made up of an appendix of the cable releases and an afterword , and there is no index .
10.48am : Attention is likely to focus on the passages in which Assange addresses the accusations of rape and sexual assault made by two Swedish women , for which his extradition is being sought
( he is currently awaiting the judgement of his appeal against extradition ) .
In a chapter entitled "" Blood "" , Assange writes that he had gone to Sweden initially hoping it could be a haven , given its laws protecting sources .
On arriving he says he was told by an unspecified "" Western intelligence agency "" contact that the US government were talking about "" dealing with [ him ] illegally "" , which he understood to mean planting drugs or child pornography on him .
The first woman who would later accuse him , called Ms A in the book ( and in court documents ) , was an activist in whose apartment Assange was staying while she was away .
She returned early and suggested that they share her only bed , Assange writes ; he adds that he had no reason "" to believe that this was naught [ sic ] but a friendly suggestion .
"" Given the "" stressful "" situation , he says he was "" glad of the attention of these smiling and affectionate women "" though it may be "" ungallant "" to say so .
He says he found the woman "" a bit neurotic "" .
He met the second woman , Ms W , at a press conference , noting : "" I remember she was wearing a nice pink sweater . ""
He met up with her later and went back to her house .
"" My behaviour sounds cold , and no doubt was , which is a failing of mine , but not a crime .
I 'd spent long enough at A _ _ _ 's and could see that it would be a bad idea to stay longer .
Remember I was feeling especially paranoid . ""
On leaving her house , he says , he promised to call her from the train , but did n't .
"" It has already turned out to be the most expensive call I did n't make . ""
"" The international situation had me in its grip , "" he writes , and so he "" was n't paying enough attention "" to the women .
"" One of my mistakes was to expect them to understand this ...
I was n't a very reliable boyfriend , or even a very courteous sleeping partner , and this began to figure .
Unless , of course , the agenda had been rigged from the start . ""
Elsewhere , Assange writes of flirting with another woman â€ ” with whom he was dining along with her boyfriend â€ ” on the same short trip , but being warned by a friend of possible honeytraps .
"" I remember he went into detail about how Mossad had captured [ Mordechai ] Vanunu . ""
The repetition of hints about possibly nefarious motives from his accusers is notable , given that Assange has elsewhere conceded that it is "" not probable "" that there was a honeytrap plot against him .
11.29am :
More from the Wikileaks statement , released overnight , in which Assange gives his account of what appears to have been an extremely acrimonious dispute with his publishers over the book .
Canongate 's statement is here .
Assange says he was advised by his lawyers that he would have grounds to block publication , but when he sought legal advice from "" numerous solicitors "" , they were unwilling to take his case because he would need to show he was in a position to pay Canongate damages if he lost .
"" I am not in a position to give such an undertaking .
Canongate are aware of this . ""
In fact , Assange says , he had a verbal agreement with Jamie Byng , Canongate 's publisher , "" to deliver the agreed 100,000 to 150,000 word manuscript by the end of the year . ""
He says he was given assurances by Byng in a later phonecall "" that Canongate would never , contrary to rumours ... publish the book without the consent . ""
"" Contrary to what The Independent reports , I did not pull the plug on the deal , nor was I unwilling to compromise .
Rather , I proposed on 7 June 2011 to cancel the contract as it stood in order to write up a fresh contract with a new deadline . ""
He writes that he received an email from his agent saying that both Canongate and US publisher Knopf "" insisted on cancelling the existing contract "" .
"" My agent was negotiating a new timetable and we had agreed to draw up a fresh contract for the book I wanted to publish in my name .
The last conversation with Jamie Byng on 16 June was friendly , positive and forward - looking .
Since then , as Canongate secretly prepared the manuscript for publication , it has found excuses not to interact with me , presumably in order to avoid discovery . ""
The statement also criticises Assange 's former legal team from law firm Finers Stephens Innocent , led by solicitor Mark Stephens .
Assange says that the advance from Canongate was paid to his former law firm Finers Stephens Innocent "" wholly without my consent "" and is currently being held by them following a dispute over fees . ""
The outcome of this dispute is pending , but a favourable finding would release the entire advance , which has not been touched , back to Canongate and Knopf .
"" We have asked FSI for their response .
1.28pm :
As might be expected , the memoir is very critical of Wikileaks ' dealings with some of his media partners , particularly the Guardian and New York Times , during their first collaborations on document caches relating to the Afghanistan and Iraq wars .
"" Vanity in a newspaper man is like perfume on a whore , "" Assange opens a chapter entitled "" All the editors ' men "" , "" they use it to fend off the dark whiff of themselves . ""
Nonetheless , he writes of those journalists with whom he has disagreed , "" I bear them no deep resentment , but only mourn , as they must , the failing light of their principles . ""
First , perhaps unexpectedly , some praise of this newspaper .
"" Everyone who likes a cause likes the Guardian , and I am not different finding the paper to be a beacon sometimes ...
After the events of 9/11 , The Guardian was the only truthful newspaper available in America . ""
Its virtues , he writes , "" wo n't diminish as a result of their infamous venality over me "" .
( Readers may be interested to learn that a number of Guardian journalists , notably those who have worked most closely with Assange , Nick Davies and David Leigh , receive no mention by name in the book , being referred to , instead , as "" a special investigations reporter "" and "" another reporter ... a news guy "" respectively . )
But the author is also highly critical of his former media partners , writing of his regret in not realising , soon after forging his relationship with the Guardian and New York Times , "" that these people were not gentlemen "" .
It was a full - time job "" to keep them honest "" , he says .
He himself was "" not always nice .
But I thought these were men of action and principle , not weaklings with a crush . ""
He says there was a "" very personal "" element to his falling out with the unnamed investigations reporter , whom he describes as "" behaving erratically and needily , like a besotted person "" .
His major criticism of the Guardian itself is that , during the period of publication of the Afghanistan and Iraq cables last summer , the paper became more preoccupied with its exclusivity than the material itself .
Criticism from this newspaper of Assange as obstructive was part of its characteristic "" bitching and hissyness "" , he writes .
( The Guardian 's account of this period , which differs in a number of key points from Assange 's , is here . )
The New York Times 's editor Bill Keller is personally criticised very harshly in prolonged passages , with Assange describing a request from the paper that others published a sensitive story on Afghanistan first as "" a piece of strategic cowardice "" .
"" The cock crowed three times , and Bill Kller shamelessly denied us "" .
Later he calls him "" a moral pygmy with a self - justifying streak the size of the San Andreas fault "" .
He refers to Keller 's account of their collaboration , writing : "" By that point I was a bag - lady and a smelly old nutcase , according to him , while he was Bill Keller , the weakest and most self - protecting man ever to edit the New York Times .
"" There 's plenty more , but Assange is clearly extremely angry over Keller 's account of their dealings , which he calls "" sordid "" and says contains "" malicious "" libels of him .
1.29pm :
Later , Assange writes of his dealings with this newspaper over the US embassy cables release , after the freelance journalist and campaigner Heather Brooke , whom he also criticises but does n't name , had obtained a copy of the US embassy cable stash independently , which the Guardian argued increased the urgency to publish .
He describes a now - infamous meeting in the Guardian offices , at which Assange 's lawyers and journalists from Der Spiegel were also present .
Assange says he demanded to know if the New York Times had been given a copy of the cables , while the Guardian journalists "" warbled "" about the fact that other copies of the cables were circulating .
Demanding to know if he could trust those present , he writes : "" It now looked like all their eyes were rolling round the room ... who would n't lose their temper with such lily - livered gits hiding in their glass offices . ""
He describes the Guardian as "" the most ill - named paper in the world "" , suggesting that it "" had been prepared to fuck us all along "" by working with the New York Times on the cablegate release .
The Guardian 's position is that the original deal to involve the NYT in publication had always included the embassy cables .
He also accuses "" my old friend , the special investigations reporter , to write a dirty little attack on me "" .
This appears to refer to this article , which the Guardian published as the first detailed account of the sexual assault allegations against Assange .
2.09pm :
Quite a lot of he - said , she - said , it turns out .
Canongate have in turn responded to Assange 's response to the publication , saying they "" stand by "" their account of their dealings with him , while his account is "" distorted "" .
The full statement is as follows : "" Canongate stands by the press release it issued on 21 September regarding its publication of Julian Assange : The Unauthorised Autobiography .
Julian Assange 's statement made later that day offers a distorted version of events .
We believe in the book and maintain we were right to publish it . ""
3.15pm : ""
The work I have done at Wikileaks , "" Assange writes , "" bears the ghostly imprint of my younger years "" , and some of the most revealing passages in the book deal with his early life in Australia , a peripatetic childhood spent constantly on the move .
Part of that time he and his mother were hiding from an abusive man . ""
Moving in those years ... had a degree of hysteria attached and that , in a sense , took all the simplicity away and replaced it with fear . ""
Wherever they moved , however , "" I had a desk for my computer and a box for my floppy discs .
It was heaven . ""
He started hacking , excited by the possibilities presented by his Commodore 64 and , particularly , modem . ""
The thrill was exorbitant . ""
He and his fellow hackers "" were anarchists , I suppose , by temperament if not by political conviction .
We had started off having fun and ended up wanting to change the world . ""
He does admit , at one point , that he has an undisclosed number of children in addition to his son Daniel , born when he was still a teenager , whose mothers are "" people I cared about "" .
But "" this is a book about my life as a journalist and as a fighter for freedoms : my children are not part of that story
and I wo n't say much more about them .
"" Disclosure is not the same as gossip , he says .
One incident Assange does share was during one Christmas break , when he and Daniel who liked to explore abandoned buildings together , "" gathered Barbie dolls and toy dragons and blew them up with some home - made explosives and liquid nitrogen . ""
4.14pm :
At one point , writing about the beginnings of Wikileaks , Assange offers a rather neat definition that might also hint to his Aussie roots .
"" Our philosophy was , from the beginning , fundamentally anti - bastard , and , coarse as that seems , it 's also got a certain honesty . ""
He describes working obsessively on the early days of the site .
He would call online meetings for volunteers but : "" Once or twice , quite comically ... I turned out to be the only person at those online meetings .
And of course the whole thing was right on the edge of schizophrenia :
I 'd be there , tapping away , being the Chair and the Secretary and bringing the next thing on the agenda and calling the vote .
Mad .
But I felt I had to go on as if the whole thing were possible , and that way it would really happen . ""
In another illuminating passage , Assange says he was mystified by author Michaela Wrong 's "" eruption "" when Wikileaks published on its website a pirated PDF of her book about Kenyan corruption , called It 's Our Turn to Eat , because he considered it an important document .
( Wong has said that she supports Wikileaks in principle but when she wrote to Assange to protest that her copyright had been infringed , she was told "" This book may have been your baby , but it is now Kenya 's son . "" )
"" I found the whole thing baffling , "" Assange writes , "" but another early lesson in the complications of political commitment . ""
4.43pm :
We 're going to wrap up this blog for the day , but first some thoughts on the book from my colleague Nick Davies , whom Assange refers to throughout as the Guardian 's "" special investigations reporter "" rather than by name ( see 1.28pm ) .
Assange may be surprised to find an ally in Davies in his protests over the book .
Davies writes : I think the publishers , Canongate , have behaved very badly .
I ca n't think of any other publisher who has put out an autobiography that has been disowned both by its subject and by its author ...
It just stops in the middle of nowhere ...
Canongate have padded it out to make it look like a full - length book by publishing lots of US cables which are already widely available for free on the Internet .
But worse than that , the section that might be interesting is just riddled with inaccuracy .
Anybody who was involved in these events last year will just gasp at the scale of it .
Some of the inaccuracy is laugh - out - loud stuff ...
The US publisher , Knopf , had hired fact - checkers who had been in touch with lots of people ... but Knopf cancelled the book and so their fact - checking never happened .
Canongate never even tried .
They hired good lawyers who cut out all the really libellous stuff
and then they 've pushed it out , on the assumption that gullible readers will fork out for it even if it is n't remotely reliable .
I fear Julian is right when he says Canongate are guilty of profiteering .
Thanks for reading and commenting ."
2011-09-28,"Julian Assange :
The Unauthorised Autobiography has sold just 644 copies during its first three days of being on sale .

This has been corrected ."
2011-10-06,"Private Bradley Manning should win the Nobel peace prize , according to our readers .
Following a poll in which we asked readers to vote from a selection of main contenders , the US soldier accused of leaking more than 250,000 secret diplomatic cables to Julian Assange 's WikiLeaks received almost 40 % of the votes , relegating Assange himself to second place .
Manning , who has spent the past sixteen months in custody , received just under 2,500 votes in our poll .
Assange received the support of over 1,000 voters , while Burman political activist Aung San Suu Kyi , was in third place , with 11.3 % of the votes .
The winner of the Nobel peace prize will be announced tomorrow .
Readers were invited to share the reason for their choices in the comments section , and were also encouraged to nominate candidates that did not appear on the list of main contenders .
alaysica was one of many who voted for Manning .
She wrote : IF Bradley Manning is responsible for allowing the world to see the shennanigans that have been going on in the name of western democracy and responsible government , then he must be the first on the list .
Those "" shennanigens "" include horrifying acts of murder and torture .
( and it is an IF , because this young man has STILL not received a trial after nearly a year and a half of imprisonment in the US in conditions suspected to be those considered worldwide as torture
He is one of those men and women who tried to show the ordinary people of the world the truth of what is done in their name .
He should receive the Prize for having suffered torture and imprisonment without trial for trying to show the world the truth , irrespective of personal risk SteB1 added : Aung San Suu Kyi is probably the most deserving conventional candidate .
However , I think the selection of Bradley Manning would have the greatest impact on changing things for the better .
The US has lost it 's moral compass , and the US diplomatic cable releases did more than anything to expose the hypocrisy and sham of their moral position .
richard1980 had this view : No to giving it to Assange .
If you must reward Wikileaks and the impact they 've had then give it to Bradley Manning .
He 's the one who did everything and crucially he is the one paying the cost .
Assange 's ego does not need further inflating .
Manning and his actions though need to be remembered and praised .
Snusmumriken felt Aung San Suu Kyi would be a more productive choice : I think Aung San Suu Kyi .
Her release and the recent scrapping of the dam project in Burma indicates that there may be some readiness , however small , for the Burmese government to start listening to the wishes of its people .
it is therefore a crucial time to remind the junta that the world is still watching and still cares and supports the cause of democracy and freedom for Burma .
Clunie explained her choice of Israa Abdel - Fatah , who received 1.9 % of the votes : I think they 're all exceptional , but I voted for Israa Abdel - Fatah because she 's an ordinary person who very literally risked her life to help change ( or take a step towards changing )
her country 's history .
Also , she 'd be a great inspiration to other women in the Middle East who still face daunting barriers beyond the usual , as well as showing that you do n't need to be an academic , politician , campaigner or high - up official to help overthrow a tyrant .
Finally , Abhinav used the comments section to offer this alternative suggestion : I would vote for a posthumous award to Mohamed Bouazizi , the man who set himself on fire in Tunisia and sparked the biggest non - violent freedom struggle in recent times .
Thanks to all who commented and took part in the poll ."
2011-10-07,""" Popular lore characterises him as a stroppy , self - publicising prig with messianic tendencies and a weakness for cheap and faintly dictatorial epigrams . ""
This was Lloyd Evans in the Spectator on Julian Assange , whose The Unauthorised Autobiography , ghost - written by Andrew O'Hagan , was published against his will : "" But the author of this book , and let 's call him Assange for brevity 's sake , has erased that caricature and produced a compelling portrait of a brave , complex , difficult , brilliant and essentially humane individual . ""
Kevin Dunion in Scotland on Sunday was typical of reviewers in seeing a shift in the book as it approaches recent controversies : "" Gone is the reflective and well - crafted reminiscence , as the narrative adopts a manner which is raw , condemnatory and , perhaps inescapably , self - pitying â€ ¦
The final few pages consist of short - sentence rants .
And then it stops â€
¦
Infuriatingly then , this inside account fails to capture the significance of WikiLeaks , even if it gives a troubling insight into the current mindset of Julian Assange . ""
According to Rod Liddle in the Sunday Times , the "" most entertaining section of the book â€ ¦ comes with his uncomfortable alliances with the mainstream media , most notably the Guardian and the New York Times .
In both cases the relationship broke down , the Guardian making the crucial error , in Assange 's view , of bothering to consider the possible outcomes of publishing secret , stolen material ( such as people being shot , stuff like that ) . ""
Charles Frazier 's first two novels , Cold Mountain and Thirteen Moons , were "" marred "" argued Stephen Amidon in the Sunday Times "" by a tendency to overwrite â€ ¦
In Nightwoods , his third novel , the author holds his formidable style in check , and the result is his best book to date â€ ¦ Frazier 's exquisitely efficient style is matched by some finely tuned suspense .
There is enough knife - play here to make Cormac McCarthy proud , though the violence never feels forced , emerging instead from the hardscrabble Carolina terrain . ""
The Independent 's Leyla Sanai felt that "" some of the action seems designed with the celluloid incarnation rather than plausibility in mind â€ ¦ but Frazier is sage enough to cast a few obstacles in the way .
And beneath the chilling , photogenic story , the writing remains beautiful . ""
For George Pendle in the FT , however , "" Frazier seems more concerned with describing the symmetry of a sprig of balsam or the tread of a foot in fresh snow than with the life - and - death struggle of his protagonists , who seem to dissolve and dissipate into the woodscape . """
2011-10-24,"WikiLeaks could be driven out of existence by the new year if it is unable to challenge a financial blockade by banks and credit card companies including Visa , MasterCard and PayPal , the website 's founder Julian Assange has said .
Announcing a "" temporary suspension "" of the whistleblowing website 's publishing activities , Assange said the site had been deprived of 95 % of its revenue by the "" dangerous , oppressive and undemocratic "" blockade , and now needed to direct its energy purely into "" aggressive fundraising "" to fight for the organisation 's survival .
"" This financial blockade is an existential threat to WikiLeaks .
If the blockade is not borne down by the end of the year the organisation can not continue its work , "" Assange told a news conference in central London .
The announcement is the most open acknowledgement of the site 's perilous financial situation since a clutch of financial operators blocked donations in the days after its publication of leaked US embassy cables in November last year .
Paypal , Visa , MasterCard , Bank of America , Western Union and Post Finance cut financial ties following the release , through the Guardian and other media partners , while Every DNS withdrew its domain hosting service .
The website has begun "" pre - litigation action "" in Britain , Iceland , Denmark , Belgium , the United States and Australia against the blockade , said Assange , and an action pressing the European competition authorities to investigate the "" wrongdoing of Visa and MasterCard "" is ongoing .
Assange said the financial companies had bowed to pressure from "" a political grouping in the US "" to block payments to the site , while the US treasury , among other organisations , had found no grounds for the blockade .
"" The most powerful players in the banking industry have been shown to be an arm of rightwing America , "" he said , adding : "" A handful of US financial companies can not be allowed to decide how the whole world votes with its pocket . ""
Donations had slumped from a monthly average of â‚¬100,000 ( Â£87,000 ) at the end of 2010 to an average of â‚¬6 - 7,000 during 2010 .
Based on the rate of donations on the day the blockade was imposed , WikiLeaks argues it has been deprived of between â‚¬40 m and â‚¬50 m .
Assange , 40 , remains on bail pending a ruling on his appeal against extradition to Sweden to answer allegations of rape and sexual assault .
Asked about his own legal fees in that case , he said : "" WikiLeaks collected monies have never gone to the Swedish case to which I am subject . ""
He is soliciting donations towards his personal legal fees , but through separate accounts , he said .
The website needs $ 3.5 m ( Â£2.2 m ) to get through the next 12 months , Assange said .
"" Unusually for a hi - tech organisation , "" he said , "" it is now accepting cheques and cash sent in the post as well as donations via more modern means such as by text message . ""
A new fundraising page on the WikiLeaks website urges supporters to use bank transfers , post cash or cheques or buy "" revenue - generating gifts "" â€ “ WikiLeaks- or Assange - branded merchandise including T - shirts and wallets and "" dog bandanas "" â€ “ to raise money .
A number of smaller online suppliers including BitCoin and Flattr will process WikiLeaks donations .
Assange acknowledged , however , that the organisation would also need to recruit "" a constellation of wealthy individuals from different nations "" to help it to meet legal and publishing costs .
â€¢ James Ball on why the bankers ' blockade of WikiLeaks must end"
2011-10-24,"In December 2010 three of the world 's biggest payment providers , Visa , Mastercard and Paypal , cut off funding to WikiLeaks .
Ten months later , Julian Assange has announced the whistleblowing site will suspend operations until the blockade is lifted â€ “ and warned WikiLeaks does not have the money to continue into 2012 at current levels of funding .
On the surface , it appears as if the bankers ' blockade â€ “ encouraged by several US senators , including Joe Lieberman â€ “ may have come close to accomplishing its goal .
WikiLeaks is , for now , silenced â€ “ though not before publishing the full cache of 251,000 diplomatic cables , and the files of prisoners at GuantÃ¡namo Bay .
The real picture is murkier .
As Reuters journalist Mark Hosenball noted at the WikiLeaks press conference , it 's not clear exactly which operations WikiLeaks has to suspend :
WikiLeaks has not released a single file since the publication of the GuantÃ¡namo Bay material â€ “ obtained independently by the Guardian and New York Times â€ “ in April .
The site 's primary submissions system has been offline since Daniel Domscheit - Berg and others walked away from WikiLeaks in the summer of 2010 .
Assange says a replacement will be online by the end of November .
Assange also claims WikiLeaks has over 100,000 documents waiting to be released â€
“
but this claim might not bear scrutiny .
WikiLeaks has previously been publicly criticised for claiming to hold five million documents when in reality it did not , by John Young of Cryptome.org , in whose name the WikiLeaks website was originally registered .
In reality , WikiLeaks ' cupboard presently stands almost bare : Assange has laid the responsibility for the non - appearance of a much - heralded cache of documents relating to Bank of America on sabotage by ex - employees .
However , sources close to the site believe the real issue is more mundane : journalists at more than one financial outlet have been given access to review the material , and found nothing of interest .
WikiLeaks ' financial claims are similarly questionable .
Assange declared the site will need $ 3.5 m to continue operations at their current level .
Questions as to who needs $ 3.5 m to publish nothing new in six months aside , this figure is highly dubious .
In 2010 , when the Collateral Murder video was published ( and a crew flown to Iraq ) , the Afghan and Iraq war logs were released , and the massive cache of diplomatic cables was unveiled to the world , WikiLeaks spent just â‚¬400,000 .
Given Assange also requested â€ “ but was refused â€ “ access to WikiLeaks funds towards his bail surety , WikiLeaks ' track record on financial claims is also not unblemished .
So given WikiLeaks ' status as an unreliable purveyor of financial information , and given its operations might have crashed to a halt with or without financial restrictions , is the banking blockade a mere non - issue ?
In short , it is not .
The banking blockade against WikiLeaks is one of the most sinister developments in recent years , and perhaps the most extreme example in a western democracy of extrajudicial actions aimed at stifling free speech â€ “ made all the worse by the public support of numerous people sitting in the US House of Representatives .
Payment companies representing more than 97 % of the global market have shut off the funding taps between WikiLeaks and those who would donate to it .
Unlike many of the country 's leading corporations , WikiLeaks has neither been charged with , nor convicted of , any crime at either state , federal , or international level .
When the Department of Justice mounted a lawsuit against Microsoft in 1998 , the idea that payment companies might cut it off due to state disapproval would rightly have been seen as ludicrous and illiberal .
Yet when payment companies do exactly this to WikiLeaks , who have never appeared in court opposite the US state , many tacitly accept the action .
Visa , Mastercard and Paypal are none - too - choosy about who they provide payment services for .
Want to use your credit card to donate to the Ku Klux Klan ?
Go right ahead .
Prefer to support the English Defence League ?
Paypal will happily sort you out .
Prefer to give cash to Americans for Truth about Homosexuality , who oppose the "" radical homosexual agenda "" ?
Feel free to use your Visa , Mastercard or Paypal .
Visa and Mastercard are already inescapable .
As the world becomes ever - more digital , and cash continues its journey to obsolescence , they will become still more pervasive .
If they are allowed to cut off payment to lawful organisations with whom they disagree , the US 's first amendment , the European convention on human rights ' article 10 , and all other legal free speech protections become irrelevant .
Those who value free expression , whether they like WikiLeaks or loathe it , should hope it wins its current battle ."
2011-10-26,"From time to time , biography is declared dead .
Certainly the writer Hilary Spurling said so five years ago when she won the Whitbread book of the year prize for her two - volume life of Matisse .
But perhaps she meant the fat literary kind .
For in daily life , biography is everything .
It is not only the stuff of reality television and gossip magazines and the global appeal of the Daily Mail 's gluttonous website : it is also the colour in politicians ' speeches and the come - on in popular science and it underlies the invention of the artist as art .
Even between hard covers , it still sells .
Even a biography of a chief executive .
But then we are talking Steve Jobs .
Once upon a time the personal really was personal .
Actors were supposed to have rackety private lives but no one needed to know about them .
Clement Attlee 's irreproachably conservative youth was of no significance to his government 's radical agenda , and only a small coterie knew at the time that for 20 years Harold Macmillan 's wife Lady Dorothy was in love with and the lover of a Tory colleague .
Now it seems everyone lives with their curtains open â€ “ and yet the more people reveal , the more people want to know .
Jobs sought out his biographer , Walter Isaacson , on the strength of his earlier life of Benjamin Franklin .
He co - operated with him , opening up for the first time about his family , addressing his shocking behaviour in the office , sharing his moments of catastrophe and even selecting photographs in the weeks before he died .
So in a world without secrets , there plainly has to be some other reason to part with the price of a good bottle of wine for the story of a life , and that is all the truer when it is the story the subject has collaborated in telling .
A biography that is authorised risks the deathly hand of sanctity , the sense of an authorial hand stayed by the compact between subject and writer .
The only interesting thing Roy Jenkins told me when I interviewed him about his former cabinet colleague Barbara Castle , of whom I was writing an authorised biography and of whom he thought little , was that I must not publish it until she was dead . ""
It 's impossible to write a good biography when your subject is still alive , "" he admonished .
He himself , he declared magisterially , had made his death a precondition of the publication of his biography .
The death of Jobs was the perfect launch - pad for his biography .
But it overshadows it , too .
In the New York Times , Joe Nocera says the intimacy of the authorised storyteller diminishes the Jobs biography .
How , he asks , can you watch a man die and maintain a sense of distance ?
Sam Leith in the Guardian suggests that it 's not the truth - telling so much as the capacity to be selective that 's missing .
But it would take more than a little criticism to hold down the sales of a book about the "" i "" in the 21st century .
So Jobs , even though he was just an amazingly gifted CEO , was a sure - fire winner .
It is harder to explain why the authorised - but - unauthorised biography of Julian Assange , hero of the world 's subversives , has been such a flop , apparently outsold by a collection of Mills and Boon short stories .
Maybe the publishers , Canongate , misjudged their market .
People who were interested in what made Assange tick would not also buy a book that arguably was a betrayal in itself , published only halfway through its preparation .
But there was more to it than that .
For a start , Assange is not a recently dead hero , but an all - too - alive fugitive from rape allegations whose lack of interpersonal skills has yet to be modified by blistering commercial success .
His stock - in - trade was not to be difficult but irresistible .
It was just to be difficult ..
In fact , if you look at biographies that sell , especially those that sell for months and months , it is hard to detect an obvious pattern .
Royalty is a winner , especially in US sales , and within that broad category Elizabeth I is a top pick .
Hitler or Churchill in the title is always a good wheeze in the Anglophone market .
But no one , probably including its author , would have predicted the extraordinary success of Edmund de Waal 's family saga , The Hare with Amber Eyes , now heading for a year in the Amazon top 20 .
And let 's face it , the huge success of Tony Blair 's memoir A Journey is a sharp lesson of celebrity as commodity .
If in doubt , read Jonathan Margolis on his biography of Lenny Henry for a painful discovery of the importance of biographical sales as an expression of personal success .
Pitching the bestseller ratings of Jobs v Assange says a lot about public attitudes to success and subversion , to the cult of personality and the importance of desirability ( yes , Jobs definitely understood about that ) .
But the results say much more about the glorious bagginess of biography as a form ."
2011-10-28,"Wikileaks founder Julian Assange will find out on Wednesday if he is to be extradited to Sweden to face rape allegations .
Lord Justice Thomas and Mr Justice Ouseley in the high court are due to hand down their judgment in the 40-year - old Australian 's appeal against a European arrest warrant .
The warrant was issued by Swedish prosecutors after rape and sexual assault accusations made by two Swedish women following his visit to Stockholm in August 2010 .
The high court said the verdict would be issued at 9.45am at the royal courts of justice in what is expected to be another media circus surrounding the hacker turned freedom - of - information activist .
The July extradition appeal hearings were packed with Assange supporters including John Pilger and legal onlookers such as Helena Kennedy QC , as well as a battalion of international journalists and Assange supporters .
If the court finds in Assange 's favour he could become a free man after 11 months living under strict bail conditions in the Norfolk home of Frontline Club owner , Vaughan Smith .
Conversely , he could be removed to Sweden within 14 days of the judgement .
The status of the warrant means that he would have no recourse to the Home Office , according to Julian Knowles , a barrister at Matrix Chambers who has been following the case .
Legal observers believe it is likely that whatever the verdict , either side will seek permission to appeal to the supreme court in London on the grounds that a wider legal principle is at stake .
That could see Assange continue on bail into next year , possibly under relaxed conditions , which is the earliest his case is likely to reach the highest court in Britain .
For either Assange or the Swedish prosecutor to take the case to the supreme court , the high court must first be convinced there is a wider issue of "" public importance "" at stake in the decision .
If the case is won or lost on the basis of fact rather than legal opinion , this is less likely to be granted , Knowles said .
The verdict comes amid growing uncertainty for Assange 's whistleblowing website which in the past 18 months has published hundreds of thousands of classified US government documents relating to the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan , as well as 250,000 classified diplomatic cables from US embassies around the world .
This week it said it could be forced to close in the new year thanks to a crippling funding blockade by major banks and credit card companies , which has seen its income plummet .
Assange said donations towards Wikileaks ' work have never gone to the Swedish extradition case , nor would they in future if the organisation succeeded in a number of legal challenges to the blockade .
The Australian is facing enormous personal legal bills as a result of his extradition case , and is actively soliciting donations towards those costs .
While PayPal has blocked donations to Wikileaks , it will still process payments towards Assange 's own legal bills .
Assange 's relationship with his former solicitors , led by Mark Stephens , ended in acrimony ; he accused them of withholding the Â£412,000 advance for his autobiography to cover legal fees which he said arose from "" extreme overcharging "" .
The solicitors , Finers Stephens Innocent , deny the accusation .
Assange is now represented by the prominent human rights lawyer Gareth Peirce , who represented the Guildford Four , the Birmingham Six and GuantÃ¡namo detainee Moazzam Begg ."
2011-11-02,"The WikiLeaks founder , Julian Assange , has lost his high court appeal against extradition to Sweden to face rape allegations .
Lord Justice Thomas and Mr Justice Ouseley on Wednesday handed down their judgment in the 40-year - old Australian 's appeal against a European arrest warrant issued by Swedish prosecutors after rape and sexual assault accusations made by two Swedish women following his visit to Stockholm in August 2010 .
Assange , who was wearing a navy blue suit , pale blue tie and a Remembrance Day poppy , remains on bail pending a decision on a further appeal .
The judges ruled the issuing of the warrant and subsequent proceedings were "" proportionate "" and dismissed arguments that the warrant had been invalid and descriptions of the alleged offences unfair and inaccurate .
Assange gave no sign of emotion as the judges gave reasons for the decision .
Assange 's lawyers said they would take 14 days to decide whether to seek the right to appeal to the supreme court and said they would challenge the Â£19,000 costs against him , indicating he might not have the means to pay .
After the hearing , Assange made a short statement on the steps of the court , saying : "" We will be considering our next step . ""
He urged people to turn to a website set up in his support . ""
No doubt there will be many attempts made to try to spin these proceedings as they occured today but they were merely technical .
So please go to swedenversusassange.com if you wish to know what is really going on in this case . ""
Assange refused to answer shouted media questions as he left .
The judges rejected the appeal on all four grounds made by his legal team , opening up the possibility that Assange could be removed to Sweden by the end of the month .
Lord Justice Thomas said a date would be fixed in three weeks ' time to hear any case by Assange that he should be allowed to take the case to the supreme court .
To appeal again , Assange must persuade the judges there is a wider issue of "" public importance "" at stake in the latest decision .
If he is successful in persuading the high court of that , he is likely to remain on conditional bail until a hearing in front of the supreme court .
This is unlikely to take place until next year .
If he is denied the right to appeal then British law enforcement officers will be responsible for arranging his removal to Sweden within 10 days .
Earlier Assange was surrounded by a melee of photographers as he arrived to hear the decision .
Supporters had fixed banners to railings saying : "" Free Assange !
Free Manning !
End the wars .
""
Bradley Manning is the detained American soldier alleged to have leaked hundreds of thousands of US diplomatic cables to WikiLeaks .
After the decision , supporters outside the court said they were outraged .
Ciaron O'Reilly , 51 , said : "" Assange is probably the most amazing person in recent history who 's upset so many powerful people in such a short space of time
so it 's obviously not a level playing field .
"" The decision comes three and a half months after the end of an appeal hearing in July , when lawyers for Assange argued the arrest warrant was invalid because of significant discrepancies between its allegations of sexual assault and rape and the testimonies of the two women he allegedly had sex with .
Ben Emmerson QC , for Assange , had claimed the warrant "" misstates the conduct and is , by that reason alone , an invalid warrant "" .
He recounted evidence of the encounter on the night of 13 August 2010 between Assange and a woman known as AA , who was hosting Assange at her apartment , during which AA said Assange tried to have sex with her without a condom .
Emmerson said there was no evidence of a lack of consent sufficient for the unlawful coercion allegation contained in the arrest warrant .
He argued the court had to decide only on whether the arrest warrant in connection with the events was valid on "" strict and narrow "" legal grounds .
Acting for the Swedish director of public prosecutions , Clare Montgomery QC said the charges detailed in the warrant were valid allegations and said AA , and another woman , known as SW , had described "" circumstances in which they did not freely consent without coercion "" .
She said the definition of an extradition offence "" means the conduct complained of .
It has nothing to do with the evidence . ""
In February , when Assange challenged the extradition moves at Westminster magistrates court , his legal team warned their client could be at "" real risk "" of the death penalty of detention in GuantÃ¡namo Bay because they feared the US authorities would request his extradition from Sweden to face charges relating to WikiLeaks obtaining and publishing hundreds of thousands of classified US government documents .
The senior district judge threw out the appeal and ordered his extradition , and a week later Assange appealed to the high court .
He changed his legal team and adopted a less vocal strategy .
Assange has in effect been under house arrest at Ellingham Hall in Norfolk since December 2010 .
He has to sign in at a local police station every day , he wears an electronic tag that monitors his movements and he has to be back inside the house by 10 pm each night .
Swedish prosecutors said Assange has been "" detained in his absence on probable cause suspected of rape ( less severe crime ) , sexual molestation and unlawful coercion . """
2011-11-02,"The Swedish view of Julian Assange , who lost his appeal against extradition to face sex allegations on Wednesday , has changed in a year from the James Bond of the internet to a paranoid chauvinist pig .
The man who has been holed up in an English country house instead of allowing himself to be questioned here about an alleged rape cuts an increasingly pitiable figure .
His attempts to depict Sweden as a banana republic that would ship him on to the US is another sign of how desperate Assange has become .
You can blame Sweden for lots of things â€ “ filthy weather , overrated crime novels , Ikea furniture â€ “ but to claim this country is the CIA 's accomplice , with an extremist law on sex crimes , irritates even his most loyal fans , of whom there are still a few .
WikiLeaks really was a historic moment in the history of journalism , but little is left of Assange 's kingdom now .
It is ironic that Sweden , the country Assange once admired because of laws that shield our freedom of expression and of the press , should have been the place where his sun began to set .
In the spring of 2010 , when the Collateral Damage video had just been released , he announced that he wanted to move central parts of the WikiLeaks operation to Stockholm .
This happened with the help of the Pirate Party , a grouping which opposed surveillance on the net and and intellectual property rights .
Ours is one of the most wired - up countries in the world , and a culture of illegal downloading and net activism is strong here .
Perhaps that 's why the love affair between Assange and Sweden started so strongly .
Even among those who would never use their computers for anything but Google and email , the remains of the anti - Americanism of the radical left of the 70s produced a certain admiration for the man .
Last April the freelance journalist Johannes WahlstrÃ¶m conducted a grovelling interview in the leftwing culture pages of the Stockholm tabloid Aftonbladet , in which his hero appeared almost supernatural : "" To meet Julian Assange is a bit like meeting James Bond .
The man behind WikiLeaks has no public background .
His name is spelled in different ways .
His age is uncertain .
He has no fixed address .
No one has seen him in the hotel where he is staying , and when we finally meet he suddenly appears half a metre in front of me . ""
The journalist who wrote this later became the WikiLeaks representative in Sweden and Norway , while his father â€ “ the notorious antisemitic propagandist Israel Shamir â€ “ ran the site 's dealings with Russia .
Assange has subsequently called Sweden "" the Saudi Arabia of feminism "" ; Shamir had earlier talked about "" the CIA feminism "" that he claimed lay behind the two women who had reported Assange to the police .
Assange - the - hero vanished somewhere in that antisemitic and antifeminist slime .
Sweden 's relatively high measure of sexual equality and consciousness in gender questions is a matter of national pride .
That a dodgy hacker from Australia started knocking it was not popular .
Last Tuesday two women journalists who started a Twitter campaign against Assange 's contemptuous remarks about Swedish women were nominated for the most prestigious prize in Swedish journalism .
The "" Let 's Talk About It "" campaign got thousands of people openly discussing the grey areas of sexual conduct , and was copied in many countries .
Not even the culture pages of Aftonbladet , which kept up their uncritical admiration for Assange longer than anyone else , can keep it up now .
The noted leftwing commentator Dan Josefsson admitted recently that Assange was not the radical hero he had supposed , but "" a solitary and shabby libertarian who wants to tear down democratic societies "" .
It 's probably too late for Assange to recover his former glory .
But if he could give up his futile struggle against extradition and show a little respect to the Swedish justice system , that would at least be a first , necessary step ."
2011-11-02,
2011-11-02,"Short of cash and running out of legal arguments , the founder of WikiLeaks , Julian Assange , felt the net tighten around him on Wednesday as the high court dismissed his latest appeal against extradition to Sweden to face rape and sexual molestation claims .
The president of the Queen 's Bench Division , Sir John Thomas , sitting with Mr Justice Ouseley , threw out Assange 's four - point appeal against the Swedish prosecutor 's European arrest warrant .
Assange 's lawyers , meanwhile , indicated that the 40-year - old Australian may not have the money to pay his opponents ' costs .
Unless he appeals to the supreme court , and that requires high court approval and yet more legal fees , he could be removed to a Swedish jail by the end of the month to be questioned over claims of rape , sexual molestation and unlawful coercion by two women he met on a visit to Stockholm in August 2010 .
After the ruling , out on the steps of the Royal Courts of Justice , Assange faced the cameras wearing a smart navy suit and a Remembrance Day poppy , but without his usual air of defiance .
Eleven months earlier he had stood on the same spot after being freed from Wandsworth prison on bail .
Back then he declared with a smile that it was "" great to smell the fresh air of London again "" and he pledged "" to continue my work and continue to protest my innocence "" .
This time it was unclear whether he planned to fight on .
He said only : "" We will be considering our next step . ""
"" I have not been charged with any crime in any country , "" he said .
"" The European arrest warrant ( EAW ) is so restrictive that it prevents UK courts from considering the facts of a case , as judges have made clear here today
â€
¦ no doubt there will be many attempts made to try to spin these proceedings as they occurred today but they were merely technical . ""
He directed people to a website set up by supporters "" if you wish to know what is really going on in this case "" , then fought his way through a pavement melee , into a minicab and away .
Court four had been full for the 9.45am case , which took minutes .
Assange was joined by WikiLeaks staff and supporters including campaigning journalist John Pilger and Vaughan Smith , the owner of Ellingham Hall in Norfolk where Assange is living under strict bail conditions which include an ankle tag and evening curfew . ""
This is self - evidently not a case relating to a trivial offence , but to serious sexual offences , "" the judges said , upholding the original magistrates court decision from Assange 's first appeal in February .
They said Assange had argued the rape claim against him dating from his trip to Stockholm in August 2010 did not in fact amount to rape , but "" the allegation that he had sexual intercourse with [ SW ] without a condom would amount to an allegation of rape in England and Wales "" .
They ruled that the two alleged offences of sexual molestation against the woman known as AA on two nights and the allegation of unlawful coercion relating to his alleged use of violence by holding AA 's arms and forcefully spreading her legs while lying on top of her could be considered offences in England and Wales , which is a prerequisite for extradition .
The warrant was "" proportionate "" and they dismissed Assange 's argument that it was not issued by a valid authority .
The court also rejected Assange 's assertion that the descriptions of the offences were not fair and accurate .
Mark Summers , appearing for Assange , said they would take 14 days to decide whether to seek the right to appeal to the supreme court and were likely to resist paying the crown 's Â£19,000 costs , indicating Assange could not pay .
"" If there was a nought on the end , Â£190,000 rather than Â£19,000 , you could say there might be an issue , "" said Sir John Thomas , indicating the fees were not unreasonable .
Summers told the judges there was an issue of jurisprudence to consider "" about awarding costs against people who are not able to meet them "" , adding "" the court is going to have to engage with his means "" .
The judges ordered a further hearing in three weeks on costs and any application for the right to appeal to the supreme court , which will only be granted if Assange can prove there is a wider issue of "" public importance "" at stake in the verdict .
He would probably remain on conditional bail until such a hearing and that is unlikely before next year .
If that fails he could only appeal to the European courts if they believe he is at risk of torture or mistreatment in Sweden .
"" I do n't think they will kill it off at this stage because there are some legal issues at stake , "" said Julian Knowles QC , who has been following the case .
"" But I think he will lose eventually â€ ¦ a key calculation for Assange will be whether to preserve resources for a trial in Sweden or fight to the bitter end here in London . ""
Legal sources suggest his latest appeal fees could be in the order of Â£100,000 and he would face a similar bill again if he went to the supreme court .
He would only recover costs if he won , a case of "" double or quits "" .
Vaughan Smith said "" people are disappointed â€ ¦ but Julian has become pretty robust .
You do n't get a sense of dismay .
It is a case of soldiering on . ""
He said Assange had a legal defence fund for supporters ' donations but it was "" reasonable to assume he is struggling with his legal fees "" .
Smith also said Assange continues to fear that if he goes to Sweden he could be extradited to the US to face charges relating to the leak of hundreds of thousands of US government documents .
He is also worried about the ability of WikiLeaks to function if he is in a Swedish jail .
But even as his legal options for avoiding removal to Sweden narrowed , Assange enjoyed vocal support on the street .
As he left court he was cheered by supporters , including a group of Occupy London protesters . ""
Occupy London support you , "" shouted one through a megaphone .
Assange , who had been blank - faced all morning , smiled and waved his legal papers .
He seemed to recognise a kindred spirit , something he has struggled to find so far in the courts of London ."
2011-11-02,"â€¢
So it 's probably off to the supreme court for Julian Assange , after today 's failed appeal against extradition to Sweden .
Another day , another hearing .
This could take months .
But it ca n't go on for ever â€ “ not least because many now feel his current landlord and benefactor , Vaughan Smith , deserves to have his couch back after nearly a year of hosting the WikiLeaks founder at Ellingham Hall in Norfolk .
Smith deserves a little normality , they say .
He has gone above and beyond and , of course , he has the normal demands of family .
One might assume Assange 's other celebrity backers would have a penthouse or two to offer , but Mr Wiki is famously picky about his associates .
They might fail his "" masculinity test "" , as we all did at the Guardian .
Then , he tends to lose all respect .
â€¢
And on goes the agony at St Paul 's Cathedral , where the anti - capitalism protest endures and the legal action to end it has been suspended , thanks to the bishop of London 's "" reverse ferret "" .
At one point Dr Richard Chartres seemed gung - ho about clearing protesters from the precincts .
Now , with even the archbishop of Canterbury siding with the demonstrators , the bishop is not so sure .
He needs advice â€ “ but one wonders about the sort of counsel he might get at home given the position of his son , Alexander , whose Financial Services Authority registration places him at Ruffer LLP .
He works for the investment fund of Jonathan Ruffer , a titan of the "" wealth management and private client "" industry , whose firm Ruffer , registered offshore in Guernsey , manages Â£12.2bn of private assets .
There are worse types of Mammon .
Earlier this year Ruffer bought 13 historic paintings from the Church of England for Â£15 m and then returned them for the church to put on public display .
He 's a Christian too .
But he 's one reason why the protest tents went up in the first place .
""
Eye of a needle "" , as they say .
â€¢ Spare a thought , meanwhile , for a man who just wanted to help .
Give people reassurance .
Fix things .
But now it seems there might have been mis - selling .
The financial situation is looking sticky .
Maybe it was all PR and greed .
It does sound like the life of Big Dave .
But it could be Richard Harpin , the helicopter - flying millionaire behind Homeserve , the plumbing and heating insurance business .
Harpin has suspended his sales team following worries that they were overselling the firm 's insurance .
The company 's shares fell in the wake of the scandal .
But that does n't mean that Big Dave does n't feature here .
For Harpin and his wife Kate have donated Â£150,000 to the Tories since 2008 â€ “ giving Â£50,000 a year , which entitles them to membership of the "" leaders club "" , including regular dinners with the PM .
Overselling might be a mutually interesting line of conversation .
â€¢ Dinner ?
Did someone mention dinner ?
Then make way for the communities secretary , Eric Pickles .
He likes dinner .
And lunch .
Followed by dinner .
He had a freebie the other day and did n't declare it , because he said it was a private meal rather than one consumed as part of his ministerial responsibilities .
Labour 's Chris Bryant accepts that this presents a difficulty .
"" I suspect that he might , on occasion , have eaten in both capacities on the same evening , "" Bryant told the Commons . ""
And that , like a cow , he has more than one stomach , and is therefore able to ruminate on behalf of several people . ""
Certainly , he can occupy more than one seat .
â€¢
Finally , it is an anniversary few will notice and even fewer will celebrate .
But we take a call from the veteran surrealist George Weiss , who points out that it was 27 years ago today that he first appeared in the Guardian .
And what a 27 years it has been , a period in which he has fought and lost many elections .
Indeed in 2005 he simultaneously stood in a record 12 constituencies , suffering heavy defeat in each .
He has survived many alter egos â€ “ for many years he was Rainbow George , now he is Sterling Silver .
But throughout that time he has never lost his gift for fuzzy - brained philosophy and homespun gibberish .
In that at least , he has been consistent .
We may mention him again in another 27 years ."
2011-11-02,"It 's not looking good for Julian Assange .
The high court 's decision to dismiss his appeal against extradition to Sweden will have come as no surprise to him because his lawyers were sent a draft of the court 's judgment at the end of last week .
That 's normal practice , and it should have enabled his lawyers to have applied immediately for permission to appeal to the supreme court .
Sir John Thomas and Mr Justice Ouseley , the two high court judges who heard Assange 's appeal , seemed rather disappointed that Assange 's lawyers were not ready to do so .
This is not through any lack of ability on the part of his legal team .
Although his QC , Ben Emmerson , is currently tied up with the cricket corruption trial , his junior counsel , Mark Summers , is a leading expert on extradition .
Summers reminded the judges that he had 14 days to lodge his client 's application .
But it would have looked better for Assange if his lawyer could , at least , have come up with a ground for appeal .
Instead , the two high court judges said they would hold a short hearing in open court in about three weeks ' time to decide whether he should have one more bite of the cherry .
Unless a case is of major importance , the lower courts normally refuse permission to appeal to the supreme court .
In civil cases , that 's not a major setback : the appellant can ask the supreme court itself for permission to appeal and this will be granted if it 's a case that the court wants to hear .
But criminal cases are different .
Section 32 of the Extradition Act 2003 makes it clear that leave to appeal must not be granted unless "" the high court has certified that there is a point of law of general public importance involved in the decision "" .
Unless Emmerson and Summers can persuade the two judges that a general point exists , they may find by the end of this month that they have exhausted all their avenues of appeal .
Then , Assange 's only hope of staying in the UK would be to persuade the European Court of Human Rights to take on his case and ask the British government to defer extradition .
Although the court dismissed all the arguments put by Assange 's lawyers , they may take some comfort from a rather interesting passage in paragraph 17 of the judgment .
This offers a new exception to the general principle of mutual recognition underpinning the European arrest warrant - that each European country respects the decisions of each other 's courts without asking too many questions .
Thomas and Ouseley said that public confidence in the European arrest warrant would not be advanced unless the courts of the country that 's being asked to hand over an accused person "" scrutinise requests for surrender under the European arrest warrant with the intensity required by the circumstances of each case "" .
Failure to do so could risk undermining public confidence in the EU 's "" common area for justice , "" the judges stressed .
Having opened the door to a new type of challenge , the judges slammed it firmly in Assange 's face .
One of his argument was that the Swedish prosecutor who had sought his extradition was not a ' judicial authority "" in the sense of a judge or adjudicator - and was therefore not entitled to issue a European arrest warrant .
The high court was prepared to accept that a prosecutor could be a judicial authority .
But , the court continued , a prosecutor was also a party to the proceedings .
A warrant issued by a prosecutor should therefore be subjected to more intense scrutiny than a warrant issued by a judge .
However , the allegations against Assange had already been considered by a Swedish appeal court in Svea .
That court had dismissed his appeal two days before the warrant was issued .
"" In this case , "" said the two high court judges , "" the action of the prosecutor has been subject to independent scrutiny by judges in Sweden which , as judges in another [ EU ] member state , we should accord due respect . ""
Assange 's other grounds of appeal were dismissed with equal firmness , including his claim that he was not accused of an offence in Sweden .
The fact that Swedish criminal procedure allowed him be questioned further before being charged was not decisive , the court said .
You could n't look at a continental system "" through the narrowest of common law eyes "" .
If you viewed it "" through cosmopolitan eyes "" , the court said , you could see that criminal proceedings against Assange had begun .
Assange simply refused to accept this aspect of the judgment in his brief response to reporters .
So whatever other charms he may have , in the judges ' view , he clearly does n't have cosmopolitan eyes ."
2011-11-04,"The two high court judges who dismissed Julian Assange 's appeal against extradition to Sweden seemed rather surprised that his counsel did n't immediately ask for permission to appeal to the supreme court , says Joshua Rozenberg .
But Assange says he may not have the funds to fight on .
The judgment may turn out to be good news for other people fighting extradition , adds Rozenberg : "" A rather interesting passage in paragraph 17 of the judgment ... offers a new exception to the general principle of mutual recognition underpinning the European arrest warrant - that each European country respects the decisions of each other 's courts without asking too many questions .
Thomas and Ouseley said that public confidence in the EAW would not be advanced unless the courts of the country that 's being asked to hand over an accused person "" scrutinise requests for surrender under the European arrest warrant with the intensity required by the circumstances of each case "" .
Failure to do so could risk undermining public confidence in the EU 's "" common area for justice , "" the judges stressed .
In a similar vein , Dominic Grieve told the European court of human rights on Tuesday that national parliaments , not European judges , should decide whether prisoners have the right to vote - the latest move in his bid to increase the UK 's latitude in cases that reach Strasbourg .
But in the EUtopia blog 's first article on Guardian Law , Christopher Brown says talk of repatriating power from Brussels is still unrealistic - though governments should have more than six weeks in which to scrutinise and comment on draft EU law .

Meanwhile , the legal aid and sentencing bill passed the Commons without substantial difficulty .
Labour attacked the Lib Dems for tabling amendments opposing parts of the bill but subsequently voted against near - identical amendments tabled by Labour .

Paul Mendelle QC takes particular exception to the changes to the law on self - defence : "" None of those familiar with the law in action had suggested the law was obscure or unfair or needed reform .
Amending legislation to do no more than change the appearance of the law without affecting its substance distracts attention from a fundamentally objectionable bill that deprives so many of legal aid and radically threatens the quality of the entire justice system .
It is purely cosmetic , like putting lipstick on pig , and just about as useful . ""
As the threat of immediate legal action against the Occupy LSX protesters camped outside St Paul 's receded , Alex Aldridge visited the legal tent there - which is staffed by a lighting engineer who regards law as a "" hobby "" .
He is , however , getting advice from Bindmans and John Cooper QC .
The family justice review , out yesterday , declared that children 's rights should trump those of their parents in the family courts - which went down badly with fathers ' groups unhappy with their access arrangements .
The chair of the review , David Norgrove , put his case in an article for Guardian Law : "" Where the state intervenes in family life to protect children from harm , in child protection cases , it takes on average over a year for an outcome - an age in the life of a child .
The backlog of cases in the public law system means today around 20,000 children are waiting for their futures to be decided .

2011-11-08,"Leaking , we are told , is a man 's business .
Israel Shamir , a strong supporter of Julian Assange , has penned an extraordinary piece in defence of the WikiLeaks founder as he awaits extradition to Sweden .
The decision to extradite Assange for questioning in relation to alleged sexual offences against two women is , Shamir writes , "" a defeat for all the men , and a defeat for mankind "" .
Assange 's situation is not merely the consequence of one man 's sexual liaisons , but part of a wider ploy to feminise men in order to make humanity more compliant to political elites . ""
Strong men are prone to rebellion , ready for sacrifice and primed for action , "" Shamir writes .
"" It is no coincidence that the enemies of Empire are all masculine males , be they Gaddafi , Castro , ChÃ¡vez , Lukashenko , Putin â€ “ or Julian Assange .
It appears the men have been targeted for elimination ; the working ants need no sex . ""
Strong men fight abuses of power , it seems , while women are , presumably , expected to support them from the kitchen â€ “ or in the bedroom .
If Shamir could be dismissed as merely a crank , his article might even be funny .
But his influence over WikiLeaks and beyond is difficult to overestimate , and this relationship make his views more significant â€ “ and disturbing .
Shamir has a years - long friendship with Assange , and was privy to the contents of tens of thousands of US diplomatic cables months before WikiLeaks made public the full cache .
Such was Shamir 's controversial nature that Assange introduced him to WikiLeaks staffers under a false name .
Known for views held by many to be antisemitic , Shamir aroused the suspicion of several WikiLeaks staffers â€ “ myself included â€ “ when he asked for access to all cable material concerning "" the Jews "" , a request which was refused .
When questions were asked about Shamir 's involvement with WikiLeaks , given his controversial background and unorthodox requests , we were told in no uncertain terms that Assange would not condone criticism of his friend .
Instead , a mealy - mouthed statement distancing WikiLeaks from its freelancers was issued .
Still later , when damning evidence emerged that Shamir had handed cables material to the dictator of Belarus â€ “ a man he holds in high esteem â€ “ to assist his persecution of opposition activists , Assange shamefully refused to investigate .
The two remain close .
Shamir reveals in his latest piece that he has spoken ( on friendly terms ) with Assange just days before his hearing .
There is also a strange resonance in the two men 's descriptions of women : Assange has referred to "" timid "" Guardian reporters failing his "" masculinity test "" , and said "" Western culture seems to forge women that are valueless and inane . ""
So , what have "" valueless and inane "" women been doing to compare themselves with such pillars of masculine virtue as Lukaschenko , Castro or Gaddafi ?
One could start by looking within WikiLeaks itself .
While Assange 's moves have driven the organisation to the brink , women within WikiLeaks , such as Brazilian journalist Natalia Viana , have used the material to expose serious corruption across South America .
Naomi Colvin , a UK resident , has been one of the most tireless campaigners for the Bradley Manning Support Network .
Several others , who have chosen not to reveal themselves in public , have worked tirelessly behind the scenes to help keep WikiLeaks going .
Similarly , Bradley Manning himself , the alleged source of 2010 's astonishing WikiLeaks ' revelations , would also likely fall short of the masculinity standards set by Assange and Shamir .
None of these , though , stands accused of leaking material to dictators .
As conversations hosted by the Guardian and elsewhere reveal , the internet is a reactionary world where women 's rights are concerned .
Most high - profile women bloggers have been subjected to threats and personal abuse , and many have received rape threats .
For individuals supposedly on the cutting edge of the information era â€ “ and allegedly fighting for human rights â€ “ to have such limited and insecure outlooks on women is ludicrous and reactionary .
Assange and Shamir may think their proclivity to judge people 's worth by their testosterone level makes them alpha males , but others are far more likely to judge it makes them look like boys .
It 's time to grow up ."
2011-11-09,"There has already been a play , a ( disowned ) autobiography , and some might argue that the real - life extradition drama is quite enough â€ “ but now work has begun on an opera based on the life of Julian Assange in Melbourne .
Opera Australia held â€ “ with Assange 's approval
â€ “ a series of in - house workshops last month , six months after its artistic director Lyndon Terracini came up with the idea and asked composer Jonathan Dreyfus to write the music .
Terracini told the Australian Broadcasting Company ( ABC ) : "" He is an incredible character and it is an exciting idea . ""
He continued : "" What they came up with was really terrific .
What 's great is that it speaks to a younger audience . ""
Eddie Perfect , who played Assange in the initial process , told ABC News , "" It 's got everything that a dramatic musical work needs .
It 's got heroes and villains .
In fact , it 's got a hero and villain combined in one . ""
In 2008 , Perfect played Australian cricketer Shane Warne in another "" biopicera "" .
Comparing the two roles , Perfect told the Independent : "" Assange is a greater challenge because his personality is filtered through the media and we rarely see the ' human ' side .
He 's also more subdued â€ ¦
Warney is all exterior and rarely self - reflective .
Assange is all interior .
"" The company has not yet committed to a full production , but if the opera goes ahead it will be the second time the Wikileaks story has been presented on stage in Assange 's native Australia .

2011-11-13,"When a fellow MP once observed to Ernest Bevin , foreign secretary in the postwar Labour government , that his cabinet colleague Herbert Morrison was "" his own worst enemy "" , Bevin â€ “ who loathed Morrison â€ “ famously replied : "" Not while I 'm alive , he ai n't .
"" I keep thinking of this every time Julian Assange , the founder of WikiLeaks , appears in the news .
The man does indeed appear to be his own worst enemy â€ “ alienating all but the most sycophantic supporters , repudiating his "" authorised "" biography , and so on .
The impression one gets from conversations with people who have worked with him is that , as a colleague , he makes the late Steve Jobs look like St Francis of Assisi .
But the truth is that Assange has far more formidable enemies than himself .
And many of them work for what we might now call "" old media "" .
This was particularly evident when the "" Cablegate "" controversy erupted a year ago .
The US government , impaled on its own windy rhetoric about the importance of a free and open internet as a scourge of authoritarian regimes , suddenly found itself on the sharp end of a spot of networked journalism .
And it responded by launching a ferocious attack on WikiLeaks which has been subsequently dissected by the Harvard legal scholar Yochai Benkler .
In his paper Prof Benkler chronicles how the US government vastly overstated the extent of the actual threat of WikiLeaks .
But , more significantly , he also shows the extent to which mainstream US media connived in this enterprise .
He analysed all the news stories at the time of the embassy cables release and found that in the first fortnight of the controversy about two - thirds of news reports in the US explicitly misstated what WikiLeaks had released â€ “ claiming that hundreds of thousands of cables had been "" dumped "" online at a time when only a few hundred cables had been released , in redacted form , and only after they had already been published by one or more of the traditional newspaper partners in the endeavour ( the Guardian , the New York Times , El PaÃ­s and Der Spiegel ) .
"" The pattern of misreporting in the news media , "" Benkler maintains , "" fit the pattern of overstatement by government actors , both administration officials and senators .
It fed into a description of WikiLeaks as though it was some terrorist organisation as opposed to what it is , which is , in fact , a journalistic enterprise . ""
The US vice - president Joe Biden described Julian Assange as "" like a hi - tech terrorist "" â€ “ a phrase that Benkler characterises as capturing "" the overstated , overheated , irresponsible nature of the public and political response to what was fundamentally a moment of journalistic disclosure "" .
The most depressing thing about old media 's treatment of the controversy was its implicit denial that , in the end , WikiLeaks and traditional news organisations are in the same business â€ “ namely publishing , in the public interest , information that powerful agencies in society wish to keep secret .
The idea that WikiLeaks might be entitled to the same first amendment protection that US news organisations enjoy does n't seem to have occurred to many of the print journalists who gleefully traduced the website and its erratic founder .
And yet , as Benkler puts it , if Bradley Manning ( the whistleblower who allegedly supplied WikiLeaks with the confidential information ) "" had walked off a military base in Oklahoma and handed the disc with the files to the editor of a tiny local newspaper of a small town 100 miles away , we would not conceivably have treated that local newspaper as categorically different from the New York Times .
Indeed , we lionise the local newspaperman as a bulwark against local corruption "" .
Quite .
By conniving in the "" framing "" of WikiLeaks as a terrorist organisation , old media were implicitly rendering it ineligible for constitutional protection .
And , worse , â€ “ this also enabled them to overlook what amounts to legalised torture of Private Manning by the US authorities .
The strangest thing of all is that the New York Times â€ “ which , remember , was a partner in the release of the redacted diplomatic cables â€ “ has been perhaps the sharpest old media critic of WikiLeaks .
Last week its esteemed media columnist , David Carr , returned to the fray with a piece about WikiLeaks 's current financial and other problems and asking "" Is this the WikiEnd ? ""
And yet Carr 's employer is the same newspaper that released the Pentagon papers in 1971 â€ “ and went all the way to the supreme court to defend its right to do so .
I ca n't see much difference between what WikiLeaks did with the cables and the New York Times did with the Pentagon papers .
The lesson for old and new media alike is simple : from now on , we 're all in this together ."
2011-11-15,"The founder of WikiLeaks , Julian Assange , is to apply for a supreme court hearing to appeal against extradition to Sweden to face sex crime allegations .
His solicitor , Gareth Peirce , confirmed he will ask senior judges in London on 5 December to certify that his case should be considered by the highest court in the land .
He must establish that his case raises "" a question of law of general public importance "" .
Assange , 40 , lost a high court battle against removal on 2 November but has announced he wants to fight on against a European arrest warrant that has been outstanding since last December .
A supreme court hearing would be the third stage of the 40-year old Australian 's appeal against extradition to face allegations of rape , sexual molestation and unlawful coercion by two women he met on a visit to Stockholm in August 2010 .
Assange 's decision means a verdict on whether he should be extradited could be delayed until as late as next summer , legal observers said .
If he can persuade the high court that there is a question of law at stake , he must then seek leave to appeal , probably directly from the supreme court .
That could take at least three months .
Only then , if he is successful , could a date be set for a supreme court hearing , possibly around early summer .
If Assange fails to persuade the high court judges there is a question of law at stake on 5 December , then he could be removed in the following days , under the terms of the warrant .
Earlier this month the president of the Queen 's bench division , Sir John Thomas , sitting with Mr Justice Ouseley , threw out Assange 's four - point appeal against the Swedish prosecutor 's European arrest warrant .
In their judgment , they said Assange had argued the rape claim against him dating from his trip to Stockholm did not in fact amount to rape , but they concluded "" the allegation that he had sexual intercourse ... without a condom would amount to an allegation of rape in England and Wales "" .
The judges also ruled the two alleged offences of sexual molestation against the woman known as AA on two nights , and the allegation of unlawful coercion relating to his alleged use of violence by holding AA 's arms and forcefully spreading her legs while lying on top of her , could be considered offences in England and Wales , which is a prerequisite for extradition .
The warrant was "" proportionate "" , they said , dismissing Assange 's argument that it was not issued by a valid authority .
The court also rejected Assange 's assertion that the descriptions of the offences were unfair and inaccurate .
After the hearing Assange said : "" I have not been charged with any crime in any country .
The European arrest warrant ( EAW ) is so restrictive that it prevents UK courts from considering the facts of a case , as judges have made clear here today .
"" No doubt there will be many attempts made to try to spin these proceedings as they occurred today but they were merely technical . ""
Assange remains on bail , living at Ellingham Hall in Norfolk , the home of Vaughan Smith , founder of the Frontline Club for journalists .
The decision to appeal again means it looks likely Assange will be spending a second consecutive Christmas with his host ."
2011-12-01,"A play about Wikileaks founder Julian Assange will have its European premiere in London next year .
First seen at the Seymour Centre in Sydney last summer , when it was originally titled Stainless Steel Rat , Ron Elisha 's play will open at Theatre503 in Battersea in January .
Renamed Man in the Middle , the play has been reworked over the past three months to guarantee its topicality in light of recent events .
Actor Darren Weller will once again bring out the white hair dye for the Assange role , but he will be joined by an as yet unannounced British cast for the new production .
Lucy Skilbeck will direct after she was given the play by its original director Wayne Harrison .
Man in the Middle tells Assange 's story through a narrative about a fictional film director attempting to shoot a biopic film of the Wikileaks founder .
Actors play actors representing real people , including Barack Obama , Russian president Dmitry Medvedev and Australian prime minister Julia Gillard .
The play opens on a sex scene that gets cut mid - filming .
It 's a characteristically swift piece of programming from artistic directors Tim Roseman and Paul Robinson .
The theatre presented a series of theatrical responses to the phone hacking scandal in September .
Robinson says : "" There are some plays that need a reactive response , where others require a little more distance for consideration .
Being nimble and reactive is something that we 're well placed to do .
"" They believe the play functions on two levels : both as the story of an individual and also as an examination of the ideas and beliefs that he holds .
Roseman described Man in the Middle as "" a fascinating insight into idealism and the ways in which it can be compromised and manipulated "" ."

2011-12-05,"Julian Assange has been handed a lifeline in his effort to avoid extradition , after two judges ruled he could approach the supreme court for permission to appeal against his removal to Sweden to face accusations of rape and sexual assault .
Almost exactly a year after he was first arrested in London at the request of the Swedish authorities , the WikiLeaks founder won the first small victory of his lengthy legal battle , delaying his otherwise imminent extradition .
Swedish prosecutors want to question Assange , 40 , after two women accused him of sexual assault during a visit to the country in August 2010 , which he denies .
A judge first ruled in February that Assange should be extradited .
Last month the Australian , who has been living under curfew at a country house in Norfolk since his arrest , lost his appeal against that decision .
Assange 's legal team sought permission to appeal to Britain 's highest court , arguing the prosecutor seeking his extradition was not a valid "" judicial authority "" , and that no decision had yet been taken on whether to prosecute him or not , making the extradition warrant invalid .
Assange has not been charged with any offence .
Surrounded by friends , including the campaigning journalist John Pilger , and a handful of supporters , Assange returned to the high court to hear Sir John Thomas , president of the Queen 's bench division , and Mr Justice Ouseley deliver their ruling .
The two judges refused to grant Assange right of appeal to the supreme court , but "" certified "" that on one specific point of law â€ “ of whether a prosecutor can be an impartial judicial authority â€ “ his case did raise a question of "" general public importance "" which the supreme court might wish to consider .
The ruling permits Assange to petition the supreme court directly within 14 days , to ask it to hear his appeal .
There is no guarantee it will do so , but if the court agrees , a further appeal could see Assange 's legal battle extend well into next year .
Emerging from court to cheers from supporters , Assange said : "" The issue of extradition safeguards is a concern for many people .
There are many aggrieved families in the UK and in many other countries in Europe that are struggling for justice . ""
He described the ruling by the high court to certify one issue arising from his case as "" the correct decision "" , adding : "" I am thankful . ""
The long struggle for justice for me and others continues .
"" Should the supreme court refuse to allow Assange 's appeal , he has an option to approach the European court of human rights , his lawyer Gareth Pierce indicated , though such an move would not stay his extradition ."
2011-12-16,"A panel of seven supreme court justices will hear Julian Assange 's appeal against extradition to Sweden to face accusations of rape and sexual assault .
The large number of judges employed reflects "" the great public importance of the issue "" , according to a statement from the UK 's highest court .
The supreme court said there would be a two - day hearing of the appeal by the Australian - born founder of WikiLeaks beginning on 1 February .
A panel of three supreme court justices â€ “ Lord Hope , Lord Mance and Lord Dyson â€ “ examined Assange 's application on Friday following the high court 's "" certification of a point of law of general public importance "" .
At full strength the supreme court has 12 justices .
The more significant the case , the greater number of judges will hear it .
The central issue to be examined , the court said , is "" whether a prosecutor is a judicial authority . ""
Assange has been detained under a European arrest warrant ( EAW ) issued by a Swedish public prosecutor over allegations that he sexually assaulted two women during a visit to Sweden in August 2010 .
He denies the claims .
At an earlier hearing his barrister , Mark Summers , argued that public prosecutors were not "" judicial authorities "" able to issue warrants under extradition law , and so the warrant was invalid .
If Assange , 40 , loses this appeal he may still be able to appeal against extradition to the European court of human rights in Strasbourg .
Meanwhile , Assange has moved from Ellingham Hall , Norfolk , where he has been staying for more than a year at the home of Vaughan Smith , owner of the Frontline Club for journalists .
Assange and a group of his supporters had been holed up in the country house with Smith and his family including his pregnant wife .
Assange 's bail conditions meant he had to sign in at nearby Bungay police station every day .
There have been times when as many as 20 people from WikiLeaks stayed at the house .
"" I 'd open a cupboard and another one would fall out , "" Smith has joked .
On one occasion Assange reportedly upset the estate 's farm manager when he let out some pigs to make a video about credit card companies that have denied him the means to raise donations .
"" My wife is eight months pregnant and they felt if they stayed longer it would not be right , "" Smith said on Friday .
"" I think Julian thinks a year is a long time to be with anybody . ""
Smith has spoken proudly of his decision to stand by Assange and support him through the legal process of challenging his extradition , but he has also admitted to minor domestic bother ."
2011-12-16,"Eighteen months after his arrest in Iraq for allegedly authoring the largest leak of state secrets in American history , Bradley Manning appeared in court and immediately started to turn the guns against his military accusers .
At the start of a preliminary hearing to establish whether the US soldier should be face a full court martial for allegedly passing more than 250,000 US embassy cables to WikiLeaks , his lawyer issued a dramatic challenge to the military presiding judge implying that the proceedings were biased and rigged .
David Coombs demanded that the judge , known as the investigating officer , Lt Colonel Paul Almanza , recuse himself from the case on the grounds that he works for the US department of justice , which is involved in the American criminal investigation into the founder of the whistleblowing WikiLeaks website , Julian Assange .
Coombs put it to the judge : "" You have been at the department of justice since 2002 ; by your own admission you have prosecuted 20 cases .
And the department has an ongoing investigation in this case . ""
He suggested that the department 's intention was to force Manning into a plea bargain , so that he would give evidence against Assange . ""
If the department of justice got their way , they would get a plea in this case , and get my client to be named as one of the witnesses to go after Julian Assange and WikiLeaks . ""
Manning , aged 23 , was appearing in public for the first time since 25 May 2010 , when he was arrested at Forward Operating Base Hammer outside Baghdad .
He was dressed in military fatigues , wore black - rimmed glasses and had closely cropped hair .
His only comments were to answer questions from the judge confirming that he was aware of the charges against him .
The soldier faces a maximum sentence of life in military custody with no chance of parole - prosecutors have indicated they will not seek the death penalty , contrary to what was later suggested by Coombs to the hearing .
The full charge sheet was released for the first time : a total of 23 counts , the most serious of which is that Manning knowingly gave "" intelligence to the enemy , though indirect means "" .
The idea that WikiLeaks constitutes a conduit to an enemy of the US state will in itself be subject of much debate and legal argument .
A second charge accuses of Manning of causing information to be published "" having knowledge that intelligence published on the internet is accessible to the enemy "" .
He is also charged with passing information from a secure database containing more than 250,000 records belonging to the US government – a reference to the US embassy cables published by WikiLeaks through an international group of newspapers including the Guardian in November 2010 .
Another charge refers to the first act of publication by WikiLeaks in February 2010 , a US embassy cable known as Reykjavik-13 .
Coombs complained at the way his desired list of defence witnesses was whittled down by the judge .
The prosecution , he said , had asked for 20 witnesses and was granted them all .
By contrast , Coombs asked for 48 and had two approved .
"" Two out of 48 ! "" he exclaimed . ""
In a case in which the government has charged [ Manning ] with aiding the enemy , which carries the maximum sentence right now of death ! ""
Manning 's lawyer also protested that he was not allowed to call witnesses who would contest the true nature of the material leaked to WikiLeaks , and query the harm that it allegedly caused the US national interest .
"" Why are we here a year and a half later ? "" Coombs asked . ""
The government has asked for delay after delay after delay . ""
Aside from press and legal council , a few members of the public were allowed inside the courtroom on a first - come , first - served basis .
Those who got in had queued at the military base since "" predawn "" , an officer said .
A vigil in support of Manning was held outside the main gates of Fort Meade , situated inthe state of Maryland .
The army has been criticised for taking so long to bring Manning to trial and faces further questions over how it is conducting the start of deliberations .
The hearing is a preliminary stage , known as an Article 32 , equivalent to a civilian pre - trial hearing , and is designed to assess whether the US soldier should be sent to a full court - martial .
Among the stranger aspects of the case is that it begins on a Friday and will run through the weekend .
The military authorities have indicated that each day could extend late into the night .
Jeff Patterson , of the Bradley Manning support network , said : "" To run the hearing through a weekend right before the Christmas vacation is clearly designed to minimise both media coverage and public protests . """
2011-12-17,"Lawyers acting on behalf of Julian Assange and WikiLeaks are protesting that they have been denied full access to the pre - trial hearing of Bradley Manning , the US soldier accused of passing hundreds of thousands of secret state documents to the whistle - blowing website .
A motion filed with the army appeals court on Thursday asking for legal representatives of the site to be granted full privileges in the court has been rejected , relegating Assange 's lawyer Jennifer Robinson to the public benches .
The lack of access could prove significant should the hearing go into private session over confidential material , to which Assange will be excluded .
Robinson insisted that WikiLeaks should be considered a party to the hearing because of the on - going criminal investigation into the site in which Manning could be called as a witness .
There is a grand jury currently sitting in secret in Virginia looking at a possible criminal pursuit of both Assange and the whistle - blowing network he founded .
Robinson told reporters in the court room at the Manning hearing that the soldier 's own defence team had made it clear that pressure is being put on Manning to implicate Assange in the department of justice investigation .
WikiLeaks stresses that there would be no security risk in allowing it access to confidential private sessions of the court , as it is working with a lawyer with the Centre for Constitutional Rights , Amanda Jacobsen , who carries full security clearance .
Robinson said that Manning 's defence team , led by a civilian lawyer , David Coombs , were aware of WikiLeaks 's presence in the court "" but that 's the extent of the involvement "" .
The motion , filed with the appeal court by the CCR on behalf of WikiLeaks and Assange , says that the charges against Manning are wholly unproven . ""
There is strong evidence that Manning has nonetheless suffered serious human rights violations as a result of these unproven claims , including prolonged isolation and sensory deprivation , and other torture or cruel , inhuman and degrading treatment reminiscent of the worst abuses at Guantánamo Bay . ""
The motion adds that Assange and WikiLeaks have rights under the US constitution to proper access to the hearing because they may have to confront "" allegations against them , particularly as relates to the grand jury investigation in the eastern sistrict of Virginia , which is apparently targeting Assange in connection with matters that will likely be addressed at Manning 's Article 32 hearing . """
2011-12-19,"US army prosecutors claim to have found email correspondence between alleged WikiLeaks source Bradley Manning and Julian Assange , the founder of the whistleblowing website .
Manning is said to have expressed hope in an email to Assange that publishing a file of hundreds of thousands of classified reports on Iraq and Afghanistan would prove "" one of the more significant documents of our time , removing the fog of war and revealing the true nature of 21st century asymmetrical warfare "" .
Prosecutors made the allegation on the fourth day of a hearing at Fort Meade , Maryland , on whether the suspect will face a court - martial for alleging leaking thousands of classified documents while working as an intelligence analyst in Iraq .
The email is said to have been discovered on a memory card found in the soldier 's belongings after they were shipped back to his aunt 's house .
It contained 400,000 records of "" significant activities "" from Iraq and 91,000 from Afghanistan .
The author suggested the recipient might want to "" sit on this information to figure out how best to release such a large amount of data "" .
Other files found on either the memory stick or Manning 's personal laptop contained contact information for Assange and instructions on how to upload data to WikiLeaks , the court was told .
Mark Johnson , a computer forensics expert , testified that his investigations found computers used by Manning had been used to send information to WikiLeaks .
Johnson said he had also found reference on a chat room "" buddy list "" to a contact using the alias "" Press Association "" â€ “ the name of a UK news agency .
This , it was claimed , was an alias for Assange .
As proceedings continued in public and private sessions , two supporters of Manning fell foul of the military authorities .
Daniel Ellsberg , who leaked the Pentagon Papers to the New York Times in 1971 , was escorted out of court when he approached Manning during a recess to introduce himself .
He was later allowed to return .
Daniel Choi , a soldier kicked out of the military for acknowledging his sexuality when it was prohibited under the "" do n't ask , do n't tell "" policy , was ejected from Fort Meade after allegedly ignoring a warning not to heckle military police .
Choi denied heckling , and said he was treated roughly by police .
Hearings continued in public and occasionally private sessions , in a small courtroom with seats for only about 50 .
Seven of the witnesses testified by phone from Hawaii , Germany , Arizona and other locations , their voices coming over a speaker phone on the witness stand .
Computer logs and other documents are projected on a huge screen and two large - screen monitors .
Manning appeared to be taking the proceedings calmly .
During one of several recesses , he leaned back and sat casually in his chair , chatting with a soldier from the defence team .
Until Monday , Manning 's defence attorneys largely focused on painting him as an emotionally troubled , gay solider serving in the US military 's "" do n't ask , do n't tell "" era .
They have have yet to acknowledge or deny his responsibility for the leak of more than 250,000 diplomatic cables , and a classified military video of an American helicopter attack in Iraq that killed 11 people .
But on Monday defence lawyers began to raise the question of whether Manning was responsible for the leaks at all .
Manning 's attorneys questioned Johnson and his boss David Shaver , an agent with the US army 's computer crime investigative unit , about who could have used the soldier 's computers .
Johnson said Manning 's computer was not password protected and that he "" could not put anybody at the keyboard "" .
He acknowledged there was no forensic evidence to show that Manning sent any of the information that ended up being published by Wikileaks .
A further 10,000 cables stored in one file found on Manning 's computer did not match any of those published by Wikileaks .
Shaver said the file was damaged .
"" The file was corrupted and would have needed special tools for anyone to open , "" he said .
The defence has also pointed to a lack of security at the Forward Operating Base Hammer in Iraq where Manning was stationed .
No passwords were required to access the cables and there was no prohibition on downloading cables , Shaver confirmed .
The USB ports on Manning 's computers were blocked as part of army policy so he could not transfer material using a memory stick .
But Manning had downloaded Roxio , a program for burning CDs , on to both of his computers and on Sunday Shaver told the hearing that he found a program on Manning 's computer designed to allow the speedy downloading of files .
According to the prosecution Manning was able to download huge quantity of documents using the program , called Wget .
Manning started using the program in early March 2010 and used it hundreds of times to illegally download classified files , according to the government .
The hearing also heard from Manning 's former roommate in Iraq , Eric Baker , a military police officer .
Baker portrayed manning as a loner computer geek .
"" I would wake up in the middle of the night and he would be using his computer , "" he told the court .
The pair began sharing a room on deployment to Baghdad in October 2009 , but once he suspected Manning was gay , Baker broke off their conversations . ""
The gist of what you said to him was it is best we did not talk ? ""
David Coombs , Manning 's lawyer , asked . ""
Yes , "" the soldier replied .
Baker added that Manning once confided in him a desire to leave the army .
"" I remember him saying this was n't for him , "" he told the court .
Manning is charged with aiding the enemy and violating the Espionage Act .
Aiding the enemy is a capital offence , but army prosecutors have said they will not seek the death penalty .
If convicted , Manning could be sentenced to life in prison .
The hearing is due to end on Friday ."
2011-12-22,"We said last week 's edition of the Bundle would be the last until the New Year , but we had n't counted on this week proving so eventful .
Two new supreme court justices have been appointed - both male , to the disappointment of some , and one a keen viola player - and the court has agreed to hear Julian Assange 's appeal against extradition to Sweden in a panel of seven .
Joshua Rozenberg contributed to a lively discussion about some of the possible candidates : "" I see no reason why Dinah Rose QC , the outstanding lawyer of her generation , could not be fast tracked to the Supreme Court , "" said monkey2 . ""
Dinah Rose is certainly the outstanding lawyer of her generation and it would be better if we had an appointments system that recognised the skills she possesses , "" replied Joshua .
"" But I do n't think that she would want to do a Sumption and I would certainly not recommend that myself . ""
Lord Tebbit weighed into the legal aid debate , arguing that it should be preserved in cases of alleged medical negligence involving children : "" I 'm not in the business of making rich lawyers richer , "" he said .
"" [ But ] in that area [ the bill ] may be going too far .
I want to hear all the arguments .
It 's right that it should be debated . ""
Ken Clarke , on the other hand , described efforts to save legal aid as "" well - intentioned legal paternalism "" .
Sadiq Khan riposted : "" What the legal aid bill amounts to is the stripping away of the ability of the poor and the squeezed middle to take action against large public and private corporations when they are wronged through intent or negligence .
We , and others , have offered suggestions of other ways to save money but these have been arrogantly dismissed . ""
Peter Lodder , the outgoing chairman of the Bar Council , made the case for looking at the creation of a contingent legal aid fund , or Claf - an acronym you may hear more of : "" In simple terms this is a pooled fund to support damages claims , with successful claimants paying a proportion of their awards back to the fund , the lawyers being paid on a noncontingent fee basis .
"" Are Clafs a runner ?

2011-12-23,"For seven days , a makeshift court inside a sprawling military base in Maryland has been hearing evidence in a case that that has raised questions of freedom of speech , the practices of US army intelligence , gender identity and the place of gay personnel in the armed services .
Sitting sometimes in secret , at other times in a kind of pseudo - public forum , this idiosyncratic court has been considering whether a full court martial should be held for Bradley Manning , an army intelligence analyst with a troubled background who is alleged to be the source of the biggest leak of US state secrets in history .
Manning faces a potential life sentence if army investigators can prove he passed the information to WikiLeaks , the whistleblowing website founded by the mercurial Julian Assange .
Overview It has been a curious week .
Faced with damning evidence , Manning 's lawyers played up his confused sexual and gender identities , the extraordinarily chaotic environment at the supposedly top - security base where he worked , and even tried to get the presiding judge to dismiss himself on the grounds that he worked for the Department of Justice , which is pursuing a criminal case against Assange .
The petition , unsurprisingly , was declined .
The army , meanwhile , led evidence to suggest that Manning had been in direct contact with Assange , and that his computer logs were littered with material related to the thousands of US embassy cables that ended up being published by WikiLeaks .
Security was extraordinarily tight .
No electronic devices were allowed in court .
Journalists were not even allowed to file copy from the separate media centre while the hearings were in progress , confined instead to filing only during the gaps in testimony .
Sometimes , testimony was heard in private , with no public disclosure about what was discussed .
On occasion , proceedings would resume far from where they had left off .
It was the longest that Manning has been seen in public since his arrest in May 2010 .
In person he cuts a diminutive figure at 5 ft 2 in .
He seems calm and composed , taking frequent notes and conferring with his lawyers .
His only moment of animation came during the testimony of his nemesis , the former hacker Adrian Lamo , who reported him to the authorities after a chatroom confession .
Warning signs overlooked Even before he was deployed in Iraq in October 2009 , signs of Manning 's erratic behaviour were often noted – but ignored .
Jihrleah Showman , Manning 's immediate supervisor , testified that she advised a superior officer that Manning should not be sent to Iraq , because of his "" psychotic issues "" .
The court heard that Manning was found seen curled up in a ball on the floor of his work unit .
On another occasion he flipped over a table and colleagues worried he might grab a gun off a nearby rack .
In the most serious incident , he punched Showman in the face .
One theory expressed during the proceedings was that nothing was done to control Manning because he was the best computer operator in the unit .
Chaotic work environment Inside Manning 's unit , the Sensitive Compartmentalized Information Facility at Forward Operating Base Hammer , east of Baghdad
, analysts stored movies and computer games on a shared storage portion of a network that also held confidential military files .
They kept passwords to secret material on Post - it notes on their terminals , and were allowed to bring commercial music CDs in to and out of the unit without registering them .
Unmarked CDs , that should have been clearly labelled classified or unclassified , were scattered across the desks .
Manning 's confused sexuality Manning served before the repeal of "" do n't ask , do n't tell "" , the policy that barred US soldiers from being openly gay .
His defence team was keen to argue that Manning 's mental state was compounded by the army 's refusal to acknowledge his struggles with his sexuality .
At the time that more than 250,000 secret documents were alleged to have been passed to WikiLeaks , Manning was said to have been suffering from gender identity disorder .
He created an alter ego called Breanna Manning , who had her own Facebook page and email address .
He also sent an email to the head of security in his unit in which he appended a photo of himself dressed as a woman . ""
It makes my entire life feel like a bad dream that will not end , "" Manning said of his gender issues in a letter to his superior .
Damning evidence Government agents discovered a spreadsheet on one of Manning 's computer referring to 251,287 state department cables – precisely the number of cables released by WikiLeaks .
Military computer experts told the hearing that they had found a computer programme called Wget that is used to speed up the transfer of files , and another called Roxio for burning CDs .
A memory card found among the soldier 's belongings after they were shipped back from Iraq to his aunt 's house in America contained 400,000 records of significant activities from Iraq and 91,000 from Afghanistan .
Forensic examiners said they found Manning had searched the internet using terms unrelated to his work as an analyst specialising in Shia attacks on US forces in Iraq .
He is said to have searched for Julian Assange , Iceland and Reykjavik .
( A document known as Reykjavik-13 was the first US embassy cable released by WikiLeaks in February 2010 . )
Investigators also claimed to have found evidence that Manning had been in contact with Assange , using the alias "" Press Association "" , the name of a UK news agency , in an online chatroom .
Manning 's motivation Evidence was produced that suggested Manning may have been motivated by political conscience .
A text file on a computer used by Manning and allegedly sent to WikiLeaks stated : "" This is possibly one of the more significant documents of our time .
Removing the fog of war and revealing the true nature of 21st century asymmetrical warfare . ""
Involvement of others One of the big questions surrounding the publication of the US embassy cables was whether anyone else was involved in aiding the website .
For the first time , we heard that other people were on the radar of the FBI and other investigating authorities .
The hearing was told about Jason Katz , a government employee at the energy department 's Brook - haven national laboratory .
Adrian Lamo , the hacker who betrayed Manning , told military authorities that Katz had been boasting on the internet that he was trying to decrypt a video of the Grain air strike in Afghanistan .
Katz was sacked by the laboratory , but his fate since then is unknown .
Others were said to have been the subject of FBI investigations , but no details were given .
Bradley Manning 's supporters
A number of Manning 's supporters took up the small number of public places available at the heading , while others held demonstrations outside the base .
Among those present this week were Daniel Ellsberg , the former US military analyst who leaked the Pentagon Papers in 1971 .
In 1973 , espionage charges against Ellsberg were dismissed , with Judge William Byrne concluding that government misconduct in the case went so far as to "" offend a sense of justice "" .
Ellsberg said this week : "" This [ Manning ] process should not have had to take place .
And the proceedings in this case should be ended in the same way that my trial was ended nearly 40 years ago . ""
Another supporter , Daniel Choi , who was discharged from the US army under DADT for openly acknowledging his sexuality , was ejected from Fort Meade after a confrontation with military police .
Manning has a lookalike
A curious feature of the pre - trial hearing is the fact Bradley Manning is being escorted to and from the Fort Meade hearing by a Bradley Manning lookalike .
The clone is taller , and jowlier , but apart from that it 's a good match .
What happens next
The hearing was concluded by investigating officer Lt Col Paul Almanza who told Manning that his recommendation to the convening authority – which will ultimately rule if the soldier is to face a court martial – is not binding .
Almanza now has until 16 January to inform that body of his opinion .
He must wade through a huge bulk of evidence , which includes a full transcript of this week 's hearing and another 300,000 pages of submitted documents .
Meanwhile , Manning will spend the holiday season behind bars , waiting to find out if he is to be prosecuted as the suspect behind the largest leaking of classified US documents in history ."
2012-01-03,"Your coverage of the Iowa Republican primary ( Report , 3 January ) barely mentions Ron Paul or his policies , settling , like most of the US media , for describing him as "" quirky "" or "" marginal "" .
Yet he is neck and neck with Mitt Romney and the reason why is not extreme conservatism but commonsense policies that appeal to many Americans and , I would suggest , to many Guardian readers .
Ron Paul consistently opposed the Iraq war ; opposes funding of Israeli and Arab military that is linked back to purchase of US armaments ; opposed the raid on the Gaza flotilla and the demonisation of democratically elected Hamas ; rejects sanctions against Iran ; wants to end the US embargo against Cuba ; sees the World Trade Organisation as a barrier to free trade and is opposed to protectionism ; called the 9/11 Commission report a "" charade "" that masked a failure of bureaucracy ; would not have assassinated Bin Laden ; seeks the abolition of the Federal Reserve ; opposed Tony Blair receiving a Congressional Gold Medal of Honour ; sponsored the Employee Ownership Act to encourage employee - owned corporations with tax - exempt status ; opposes internet controls ; wants immunity for whistleblowers , including Julian Assange ; opposes the death penalty ; believes all polluters should pay ; opposes subsidies to the gas and oil industry ; favours legalisation of drugs and treatment for abusers as with alcoholics .

2012-01-24,"He has been the subject of thousands of interviews and interrogations by journalists , activists and lawyers .
Now Julian Assange is to reverse the roles in a new TV series featuring "" iconoclasts , visionaries and power insiders "" from across the world .
The WikiLeaks founder is to interview "" key political players , thinkers and revolutionaries "" as part of a 10-part TV series , according to a statement released on the website .
The statement does not include information about which channels the show may actually be broadcast on , or inwhich countries .
But , details aside , who would you like to see appear on Assange 's ambitious new venture ?
Suggest your "" iconoclasts "" below the line .
Here are a few suggestions of our own : Tony Blair The camera - friendly former prime minister has never knowingly turned down a good interview opportunity .
Assange might use the exchange to chew over the Middle East , or penetrate the obscurities of Blair Inc. Rupert Murdoch As a fellow native Australian , Murdoch is sure to greet Assange like a long lost brother .
Right ?
Hillary Clinton
A conversation between Mr Cablegate and the US secretary of state would amount to little more than a 30-minute standoff .
Which makes it a superb idea .
Sir David Frost
We imagine Assange has always wanted to turn the tables on Frost , the great interviewer himself .
Was Frost too soft on Nixon ?
The WikiLeaks man would not shy from the tough questions ."
2012-01-24,"The Press Complaints Commission has rejected a complaint against the New Statesman by Julian Assange of WikiLeaks .
He claimed that the magazine 's review of a book about him contained an inaccuracy by mentioning "" sexual assault charges . ""
Assange told the PCC : "" I have not been charged with any offence and this statement therefore represents a significant and misleading inaccuracy . ""
He added that the review by James Ball of Andrew O'Hagan 's "" unauthorised autobiography "" of Assange contributed to a "" hostile media climate "" .
The PCC , in ruling against Assange , stated : "" It was not in dispute that the complainant had not been formally charged by Swedish authorities . ""
But the article "" alluded to ' charges ' more generally . ""
According the commission , this allusion accurately conveyed to readers that the complainant was being accused by Swedish prosecuting authorities of having committed the offences ( and that prosecutors were seeking his extradition with a view to his potentially being tried for those offences ) .
The PCC wrote to the New Statesman 's editor , Jason Cowley , to inform him that the complaint "" raised no breach of the code of practice and did not require further investigation . ""

2012-01-25,"It 's the television channel that has given voice to a thousand anti - western conspiracy theories , while avoiding criticism of the hand that feeds it .
Now state - run Russia Today , the Kremlin 's English - language propaganda arm , has forged an unlikely partnership â€ “ with the self - proclaimed defender of truth and freedom Julian Assange .
One day after the WikiLeaks founder said he was launching a 10-part series of interviews with "" key political players , thinkers and revolutionaries "" , Russia Today announced it had won exclusive first broadcast rights for the show , titled The World Tomorrow , and was due to begin airing the show in March .
"" Our viewers are open to the discussions that will be presented through Julian 's show on our channel , "" the channel 's editor - in - chief , Kremlin loyalist Margarita Simonyan , said in a statement .
That may well be true , unless the guest comes from Russia .
The channel , launched in December 2005 as part of a government campaign to boost Russia 's lagging global influence , remains slavishly pro - Kremlin , revelling in the antics of Vladimir Putin and avoiding sensitive topics , such as the prime minister 's rumoured wealth and his growing authoritarianism . ""
Shame on you , Mr Assange ! ""
Alexander Lebedev , the Russian owner of the Independent and London Evening Standard , wrote on his Twitter and Facebook accounts . ""
Hard to imagine [ a ] more miserable final[e ] for [ a ] ' world order challenger ' than employee of state - controlled ' Russia Today ' .
"" It 's doubtful that any Russian "" revolutionaries "" will make the show 's guestlist .
While Russia Today , or RT as it prefers to be known , has delved deep into protest movements around the world , with a particular focus on Occupy Wall Street , it has given cursory coverage to the upheavals that have shaken Russia in the wake of disputed parliamentary elections in December .
It has smeared some of the protest leaders , including Alexei Navalny , the opposition activist whose anti - corruption website has been likened to WikiLeaks .
An article on RT 's website attempting to introduce Navalny to western viewers did so by simply comparing him to Emma West , whose racist rant on a London tram went viral in November , in a nod to the Russian activist 's nationalist views .
Assange fits Russia Today 's profile of giving airtime to views and experts it says are avoided by the mainstream media .
But that strategy has meant giving voice to bloggers and self - proclaimed pundits who come appeared on air to proclaim that Freemasons were behind the revolution in Egypt or that repeated showings of the film Deer Hunter in Stockholm were a sign of Sweden being a US pawn .
The channel , like the Russian government , has been very supportive of Assange since his arrest for allegedly sexually assaulting two women in Sweden in August 2010 .
The interviews will be filmed at Ellingham Hall in Norfolk , where Assange has been under house arrest as he awaits a UK supreme court hearing on his extradition to Sweden .
The names of the guests have not yet been disclosed ."
2012-01-30,"As the only court to broadcast proceedings live on television , the supreme court is anticipating a substantial boost to its global audience when Julian Assange appears this week .
The informality of the two - day extradition hearing in Westminster may surprise those tuning in for the first time : none of the barristers or justices â€ “ as the courts ' judges are known â€ “ will be wearing wigs or gowns .
Lawyers may choose whether or not to adopt formal legal dress .
The justices prefer suits , often resting back in their chairs as they debate arcane points of legal precedent .
Unlike virtually every other senior court , the United Kingdom 's highest does not have a raised bench .
Judges are on the same level as counsel , a conscious decision intended to encourage the intimate atmosphere of a learned seminar rather than a confrontation with the authority of the law .
Television audiences have been significant .
By clicking on the "" supreme court live "" link , hearings can be viewed online anywhere around the world via a live stream on the Sky News website .
Figures from the first three months of broadcasting last summer show that it was seen 139,000 times .
The four television cameras , one in each corner of the courtroom , are operated by in - house engineers who work under the court 's guidance .
Their aim is to capture the details of legal arguments rather than the reactions in the public gallery .
Without the presence of a jury , the process of televising the supreme court is easier than it would be for lower courts .
The Ministry of Justice is considering how it can introduce cameras to other courts , starting , probably , with judges ' verdicts in the court of appeal .
The Assange hearing may be a useful test - run for those assessing the impact of televising high - profile court cases on the judicial process and whether , as supporters claim , it boosts public understanding of the law ."
2012-02-01,"The arrest warrant for Julian Assange should not stand and breaches "" a matter of fundamental legal principle "" , the supreme court has heard .
Dinah Rose QC , defending the WikiLeaks founder in his final appeal against extradition to Sweden to face allegations of sex crimes , told the panel of seven senior judges that to consider the Swedish public prosecutor as a judicial authority was "" contrary to a basic , fundamental principle of law "" .
Reaching back as far into European legal history as the Codex Iustinianus , dated 376AD , Rose said the Swedish prosecutor was a party in the Assange case and therefore not independent and impartial , breaching the principle that "" no one should be judge in their own cause "" , which Rose said was one of the pillars of natural justice .
Opening the case for the Swedish judicial authority , Clare Montgomery QC said the arrest warrant was valid because judicial authorities , at least in the preliminary stages of investigations where arrest is being sought , need not be independent and impartial .
She said police officers made decisions to arrest people and were not considered to be independent of the prosecuting authorities .
Judicial , she argued , meant simply associated with the judicial process . ""
The decision whether to arrest somebody might be made by somebody who is partisan , "" she said .
"" That happens throughout Europe . ""
She was repeatedly questioned by the judges about the reasoning behind the assertion .
She ended her opening remarks by referring to historic French definitions of judicial authorities which referred to both courts and prosecutors .
She will resume her case today .
Assange was earlier greeted outside the UK 's highest court by supporters playing protest songs and holding placards demanding his release from bail conditions .
Inside the packed court , Assange listened and took notes as Rose argued that the formation of a European framework decision on crossborder extradition arrangements showed "" decisions with serious implications for personal liberties should only be taken by independent judicial authorities "" .
She said : "" The words ' judicial authority ' can only be understood as meaning an independent judge or a person executing equivalent power . ""
She said to include public prosecutors in the concept of what is a judicial authority was "" contrary to a basic , fundamental principle of law "" .
The Europe - wide agreement on the application of extradition arrangements and subsequent concern about the definition of a judicial authority in the British parliament meant the high court verdict â€ “ that the arrest warrant was valid
â€ “ was wrong , she added .
Assange left court through a scrum of photographers to the sound of more protest songs from supporters .
"" I submit that when one looks not only at the context within which the framework decision was made , but the way it evolved from 1999 to 2002 and 2003 with the UK legislation there is a very strong indication that the intention was that , as a safeguard , the warrant should be issued by a judicial authority acting independently and executing a judicial function , "" she said in summation of a two - and - a - half - hour session of legal argument .
"" We also submit it is clear that issue was a matter of considerable concern to parliament and also one can infer was matter of concern to the Council of Ministers , which explains the rejection of the commission 's original proposal
â€
¦ there was great concern the proposal was too broad .
"" About 60 members of the public , media and supporters of Assange filled the public benches in the supreme court for the start of the two - day hearing which , so far , has not touched on any of the details of the allegations against the 40-year - old Australian in Sweden .
The case continues and is expected to conclude on Thursday afternoon when the judges are expected to reserve judgment ."
2012-02-01,"Wikileaks founder Julian Assange is to enter the final stage of his legal battle to avoid extradition to Sweden to face questioning over sex crime allegations .
After failing to persuade a magistrates and the court of appeal that the cross border warrant issued for his arrest was invalid , the Australian 's legal team will appeal to the supreme court in London to prevent his deportation .
Assange is wanted for questioning in Sweden over claims of rape , sexual molestation and unlawful coercion made by two women he met on a visit to Stockholm in August 2010 .
He denies the claims .
The supreme court 's two - day hearing is unlikely to focus on the detail of the allegations against him , but the legal issue of whether the Swedish prosecutor who issued the European arrest warrant in December 2010 can be considered a valid judicial authority .
Assange 's legal team , which will include Dinah Rose QC , an expert in civil liberties and European Union law , argues that it is n't .
In Britain , as in the United States , only judges can normally approve arrest warrants .
In Assange 's case , the warrant was issued by Sweden 's public prosecutor .
Assange 's lawyers argue that the Swedish system is unfair because it puts the power to issue arrest warrants in the hands of the same people who are prosecuting him .
Seven judges rather than the usual five will hear the case "" given the great public importance of the issues raised "" , the court said .
Their decision is not expected for several weeks .
Legal observers have suggested Assange faces an uphill struggle .
Karen Todner , an extradition specialist at Kaim Todner Solicitors , said Assange 's lawyers were unlikely to overcome the benefit of the doubt usually afforded to other European countries ' judicial systems .
British judges "" absolutely defer "" to their European counterparts ' justice systems , she said , adding that she would be "" very surprised "" if Assange 's team won the day .
"" I do n't think he 'll succeed , "" said Peter Caldwell , an extradition barrister based at Dyers Chambers .
European arrest warrants are difficult to beat , and Caldwell argued that while Assange 's case was "" well - argued ... it does n't get beyond the obligation of the UK to give effect to European law . ""
Julian Knowles QC , a specialist extradition barrister based at Matrix Chambers , has said an Assange win would mean that until the law was rewritten , extradition to Europe would become very difficult if not impossible .
In the background is the US investigation into WikiLeaks , which could potentially see Assange charged with espionage or other offences .
His supporters fear that extradition to Sweden could be a prelude to an extradition to the US ."
2012-02-01,
2012-02-02,"Sweden was right to allow its public prosecutor to demand the arrest of Julian Assange , the Wikileaks founder wanted in connection with allegations including rape , the UK 's supreme court has been told .
The court heard that it was normal in Europe for prosecutors , rather than judges , to issue European arrest warrants .
The claim came on the second day of Assange 's two - day appeal to the highest court in the UK against being sent to Sweden to face allegations relating to sexual encounters he had with two women in Stockholm in August 2010 .
Clare Montgomery QC , appearing for the Swedish Judicial Authority , told the panel of seven senior judges that there was no obligation of impartiality on the authority that requests extradition .
She told them this had never been the case and that Sweden was acting within European law .
She told the judges that to rule otherwise "" would be a remarkable departure as a matter of history from all that had gone before "" .
The day began with Dinah Rose QC , acting for Assange , concluding her case by saying that the warrant was invalid because it breached "" natural justice "" .
She argued that the Swedish prosecutor was a party in the Assange case and therefore not independent and impartial , breaching the principle that "" no one should be judge in their own cause "" .
Montgomery said public prosecutors were allowed to request extradition through European arrest warrants as a "" judicial authority "" .
She mounted a detailed examination of the drafting of the European extradition law and its requirement of an "" authoritÃ © judiciaire "" to issue arrest warrants .
"" It is quite clear that included in the natural , continental meaning [ of authoritÃ © judiciaire is ] public prosecutor , "" she said .
Montgomery attacked "" all this rhetoric "" by Assange 's legal team "" that suggests our construction makes the issuing of an arrest warrant a judge - free zone because in each case there will be an underlying court decision "" .
She said 11 European states had decreed that prosecutors would issue arrest warrants and that nine had said they would only use prosecutors to do so .
She argued that prosecutors were more likely than a court to take into account whether a European arrest warrant was proportional .
Montgomery said it was clear that different countries defined authorities capable of requesting arrest warrants differently .
In Finland it included the ministry of justice , in Denmark "" public prosecution authorities "" , in Germany "" competent judicial authorities "" and in Sweden the "" prosecutor general or any other prosecutor "" .
Montgomery commented that the Europe - wide agreement was "" done at great speed , coming as it did on the heels of 9/11 "" .
The judges asked what human rights protections flowed from her interpretation . ""
Arrest normally starts with a partial decision , "" Montgomery said .
"" The English arrest warrant issued by a court is very much the exception .
The protection [ of human rights ] lies in the requirement thereafter to provide him with an impartial tribunal .
There is nothing to suggest a human rights construct requires you to impose impartiality on anybody seeking arrest . ""
Montgomery insisted that the term judicial authority "" has a wide meaning "" .
"" It requires that because it serves the international purpose of being capable of allowing a system that does not have harmonious practices and procedures . ""
Rose was given just over an hour to make a final response .
She said that far from each country seeing the concept of judicial authority differently , it was a "" core term "" in Europe that had been defined in the convention on human rights and had been tested in the courts .
It had to mean "" independent of the executive "" and independent of parties to the case , she said .
The conclusion of submissions represented the end of a series of legal hearings since Assange was arrested in December 2010 and could be the last time his case is heard in a British court .
The supreme court judges retired to consider their judgment , which will be reserved for what is expected to be several weeks .
If they decide to uphold the high court ruling , Assange could be sent to Sweden for questioning within days ."
2012-02-03,"For two days Dinah Rose QC and Clare Montgomery QC have contradicted one another over the precise meaning of the words "" judicial authority "" , interspersing assertions with curt dismissals of "" my learned friend 's "" argument .
The appearance of two of the most prominent women barristers as leading counsel in such a high - profile case is a reflection of the changing composition of the bar ; more than a third of the profession is now female .
Montgomery , of Matrix chambers , is the longer established , having taken silk in 1996 .
Rose , of Blackstone chambers , who became QC 10 years later , is an authority on human rights and employment law .
Last week she gave evidence to a parliamentary select committee on the government 's controversial green paper of security and justice which proposes introducing secret evidence sessions into civil cases .
This week , Rose drove her submissions through smoothly , with minimal interventions from the judges .
Montgomery has a more abrasive , stacatto delivery .
She dismissed her opponent 's "" rhetoric "" and limited herself to forensic analysis of case law , statute and parliamentary interventions .
Her stab at Dutch drew friendly mockery from Lord Mance .
Montgomery 's focus on detail and continual references to documents gave the judges more opportunity to cross - examine her , which allowed her to display her depth of knowledge of EU extradition law .
It was not the first time the supreme court had heard a case where the leading advocates are both women .
By contrast they appeared before six males judges and the supreme court 's only female judge , Lady Hale ."
2012-02-03,"He upset the FBI and the White House .
Could he be about to overturn the European arrest warrant ?
Julian Assange 's attempt to stop his extradition to Sweden over allegations of rape and sexual coercion reached the UK supreme court this week .
The question for the justices was whether the Swedish prosecutor who issued the warrant is a valid judicial authority .
No , argued Dinah Rose QC , citing the 376AD Codex lustinianus .
Yes , said Clare Montgomery QC . ""
Hard to say which way it will go , "" tweeted Joshua Rozenberg , though "" supreme court judges clearly want to avoid wrecking the system "" .
Julian Knowles QC predicted an Assange win would make extradition to Europe difficult , if not impossible .
( Video highlights from both sides are here . )
This week saw the launch of Guardian Law 's interactive history of the supreme court - a work that 's been a few months in the making and which nonetheless managed to include a picture of a group of lords sitting on the woolsack : and , as one of our erudite contributors pointed out , law lords never sat on the woolsack , even before they left Parliament .
This has now been corrected .
The timeline is very much a work in progress - with a video element still to launch - and next week we 'll be inviting you to tell us what we should n't have left out and what deserved more space .
While Joshua was in Strasbourg last week he interviewed Sir Nicolas Bratza , the British president of the European court of human rights .
"" Why , I ask him , is the human rights court seen in such a toxic way in Britain ? "" "" ' Your guess is as good as mine on this , ' he replied . '
I do find it very puzzling as to why there is this strong feeling .
It 's not just a feeling against the court or against the convention .
It 's a feeling directed more generally against the Human Rights Act . '
Sir Nicolas added that the ' democratic override ' favoured by some Conservatives would be "" totally destructive of the system "" .
Meanwhile , Alison Saunders of the Crown Prosecution Service gave an interview to the Guardian in which she described her "" sleepless night "" before the convictions for Stephen Lawrence 's murder and discussed the problem of juries ' reluctance to convict in rape cases .
Lord Prescott complained the media had been silent on the subject of the legal aid bill .
We tweeted to urge him to bookmark @GdnLaw .
He has n't yet replied .
But , as our legal correspondent Owen Bowcott reported from a conference on legal aid yesterday , Jonathan Djanogly has hinted at some concessions from the government .

2012-02-24,"David Cameron appeared to hint this week that the cabinet battle over the controversial UK - US treaty , which underpins the extradition of the retired businessman Christopher Tappin , is not yet finished .
The future of Britain 's extradition arrangements is no academic matter .
In the next fortnight or so the supreme court will decide whether Wikileaks ' Julian Assange should be sent to Sweden on a European arrest warrant .
While in the next two or three months , the home secretary , Theresa May , will make a final decision on the medical evidence as to whether Gary McKinnon , the computer hacker with Asperger 's syndrome , should be sent to stand trial in the US .
At almost the same time May will formally respond to the review of Britain 's extradition arrangements by Sir Scott Baker , who effectively gave both the UK - US treaty and the European arrest warrant system a clean bill of health .
In opposition , the Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats campaigned strongly against the "" lopsided "" treaty and repeatedly criticised the arrest warrant system .
Indeed , a 2006 move to give British judges in extradition proceedings the power to decide whether a case would be better heard in Britain – the "" forum amendment "" – was backed by every senior member of the current coalition cabinet .
It was anticipated that Scott - Baker would come down firmly behind this change .
But when his review was published last October he did no such thing .
He said the treaties were balanced and fair and argued that prosecutors were far better placed to decide in which country a trial should be held .
In her initial response to Scott - Baker , the home secretary gave every impression that she would leave things as they were , with some minor tinkering as recommended by the judge .
But at prime minister 's question time this week , Cameron seemed to hint that the battle was not yet over .
He told protesting Tory MPs that the Tappin case showed why a "" proper , sober , thoughtful review needs to take place "" .
The prime minister said May was examining Scott - Baker 's findings carefully , but she would "" take into account the views of parliament that have been expressed in recent debates "" .
He appeared to be raising the prospect that fundamental reform may yet be on the agenda .
But the Home Office view is that it is "" highly unlikely "" that May could adopt a "" forum bar "" solution , as that would involve the wholesale rejection of Scott - Baker – whom she herself appointed to review the extradition arrangements .
The Americans have bilateral extradition arrangements with 120 countries .
All but three – France , Ireland and the UK – require evidence to be provided in support of extradition requests .
As at least one legal commentator has pointed out , France is not obliged to extradite its own citizens , Ireland will not despatch anyone whose case can be heard in an Irish court , leaving only Britain .
Look at it as another aspect of the "" special relationship "" ."

2012-04-13,"Julian Assange 's television chatshow , The World Tomorrow , is to broadcast its first episode on state - run news channel Russia Today on 17 April .
According to a statement issued by WikiLeaks on Friday , Assange has completed filming 12 episodes of the chatshow , which will be broadcast online and by the Russian broadcaster .
Russia
Today said the "" notorious "" identity of the show 's first guest would be revealed at a later date .
The first episode will coincide with the 500th day of the financial blockade of WikiLeaks .
Although guests have not been named , WikiLeaks said Assange has interviewed an "" eclectic "" selection , including politicians , revolutionaries , artists and intellectuals .
In a separate pre - show interview on the Russia Today website , Assange took aim at those who questioned the independence of his ambitious chatshow over its links to the state - controlled broadcaster .
A promotional video for Assange 's World Tomorrow programme was published on YouTube on Friday .
"" A lot of the things that we have been trying to report have not been carried accurately in the mainstream press .
There are many , many fine exceptions but when we look at international networks there 's really only two that are worth speaking about , and that 's RT [ Russia Today ] and al - Jazeera , "" Assange said .
The Russia Today editor - in - chief , Margarita Simonyan , added : "" RT is rallying a global audience of open - minded people who question what they see in mainstream media and we are proud to premiere Julian Assange 's new project .
"" We provided Julian a platform to reach the world and gave him total editorial freedom .
He is absolutely the right person to bring alternative opinions to our viewers around the globe . ""
Assange , who is on bail awaiting a British court decision on his appeal against extradition to Sweden , is in discussion with other broadcasters about licensing rights to the show , according to the WikiLeaks statement .

2012-04-20,"High - profile US supporters of WikiLeaks are planning to establish a foundation to break the 500-day "" banking blockade "" that has disrupted donations to the whistleblowing website .
WikiLeaks was forced to suspend many of its publishing operations in October last year after Visa , MasterCard and PayPal refused to process supporters ' donations to the website , reducing its donation income by about 95 % .
The move , which came after the US senator Joe Lieberman called on US companies to cut off services to WikiLeaks , was called a blockade by the organisation 's editor - in - chief , Julian Assange , and came without any legal orders or actions against the site .
Supporters based in the US are now in talks with Assange to establish a US - based foundation aimed at funding organisations cut off by private companies in situations with first amendment implications .
At the forefront of the efforts are Daniel Ellsberg , the man who leaked the Pentagon Papers to the US media , and John Perry Barlow , the former lyricist for the Grateful Dead and co - founder of the US online rights organisation Electronic Frontier Foundation ( EFF ) .
Barlow said : "" The foundation will aim to support WikiLeaks and others , like bloggers , who have been targeted by such blockades .
We hope this will make a moral argument that will change these companies ' minds , but it could also be the basis of legal challenges .
"" A US - based foundation would be in a stronger position to make challenges based around the US first amendment â€ “ which covers , among other provisions , freedom of speech and freedom of the press â€ “ than WikiLeaks ' current major funder , the Wau Holland Foundation , which is based in Germany .
Barlow also warned about the growing power of private organisations in the internet era , saying that protections which restricted governments often did not cover private - sector censorship .
"" We now have organisations with the ability to stifle free expression with no bill of rights that applies to them â€ “ just terms of service , "" he said .
"" The EFF have investigated everything we can think of [ against this ] , and all we can find is anti - trust law , and we 're not nearly rich enough for that kind of action . ""
WikiLeaks says its supporters have initiated legal action against the payment companies in several jurisdictions around the world .
In a statement released on Tuesday to mark 500 days since its online payments were cut off , it said complaints had been lodged with Swedish competition authorities , the European commission , through the Colombian courts system , and the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission .
The company that processed payments for WikiLeaks , the Icelandic firm DataCell , has also filed a lawsuit against Visa in Reykjavik district court .
WikiLeaks strongly condemned the "" extrajudicial "" action . ""
Five hundred days have passed since a cartel of the world 's largest financial players , Bank of America , Visa , MasterCard , PayPal and Western Union instituted a consolidated , extrajudicial financial blockade against WikiLeaks , "" it said .
"" The financial blockade was imposed at a point at which the public wished to express its support unequivocally through millions of dollars in small donations .
The blockade cuts WikiLeaks off from its small donors , the vast majority of our donor base .
The financial cartel has so far acted with impunity in an attempt to censor WikiLeaks and curtail our supporters ' economic rights .
"" All of the payment providers have denied any political involvement in their decision to cut off payments to WikiLeaks and have said in previous statements that their actions were aimed at preventing illegal activity . ""
MasterCard rules prohibit customers from directly or indirectly engaging in or facilitating any action that is illegal , "" said a MasterCard spokesman .
The Visa statement on its action said : "" Visa Europe has taken action to suspend Visa payment acceptance on WikiLeaks ' website pending further investigation into the nature of its business and whether it contravenes Visa operating rules . ""
Through an error , Visa payment was briefly reinstated to WikiLeaks in July 2011 , but this was quickly cut off ."
2012-05-23,"The supreme court will deliver its verdict next Wednesday on whether or not the WikiLeaks founder , Julian Assange , should be deported to Sweden to face allegations of rape and sexual assault .
The short judgment on 30 May will include an explanation of the decision the seven - strong panel of justices reaches .
It is expected to focus on the narrow issue of whether or not a European arrest warrant ( EAW ) issued by a prosecutor is valid .
EU treaty provisions governing extradition specify that a warrant must be drawn up by "" competent judicial authorities "" .
Lawyers for Assange argue that a prosecutor is not a judge or a "" judicial "" official .
Clare Montgomery QC , for the Swedish authorities , maintained that the arrest warrant was valid because judicial authorities , at least in the preliminary stages of investigations where arrest is being sought , need not be independent and impartial .
If the supreme court blocks the Swedish extradition request it will throw the EAW system into turmoil and have significant implications for other extradition cases within Europe .
The seven justices who heard the appeal are Lord Phillips , Lord Walker , Lady Hale , Lord Brown , Lord Mance , Lord Kerr and Lord Dyson .
The fact that so many judges are considering the case suggests that they recognise it is a particularly complex and significant issue .

2012-05-29,"The WikiLeaks founder , Julian Assange , will discover on Wednesday whether he is to be deported to Sweden to face allegations of rape and sexual assault when the supreme court delivers its verdict on his appeal .
The seven - strong panel of justices is expected to focus on the narrow issue of whether or not the European arrest warrant ( EAW ) requesting the 40-year - old Australian 's extradition , which has been issued by the Swedish prosecutor , is valid .
EU treaty provisions governing extradition specify that a warrant must be drawn up by "" competent judicial authorities "" .
Lawyers for Assange argue that a prosecutor is not a judge or a "" judicial "" official .

Clare Montgomery QC , for the Swedish authorities , had argued that the arrest warrant was valid because judicial authorities , at least in the preliminary stages of investigations where arrest is being sought , need not be independent and impartial .

Assange , who denies the allegations against him , can appeal to the European court of human rights if he loses the case .
The ECHR must respond within 14 days to indicate whether or not it will accept the case .
If the court were to decline to take the case then he would be extradited to Sweden "" as soon as arrangements can be made "" , according to the Crown Prosecution Service .
If his case does go to Strasbourg then extradition is likely to be delayed and his current bail conditions continue until that legal process reached a conclusion .
Assange is required to wear an electronic ankle tag and report to the police daily ."
2012-05-30,"Julian Assange has lost his appeal against extradition to Sweden at the supreme court .
By a majority of five to two , the justices decided that a public prosecutor was "" judicial authority "" and that therefore his arrest warrant had been lawfully issued .
But lawyers for the WikiLeaks founder submitted an urgent request to the supreme court asking for permission to challenge one of the points made in the judgment .
Assange , who is facing charges of sexual assault and rape , was not in court .
There was no legal requirement for him to be present .
According to his solicitor , Gareth Peirce , he was stuck in traffic .
The court granted Assange 's lawyers 14 days to present their arguments that crucial issues related to Article 31 of the Vienna convention , on which the majority of the justices based their decision , were not raised during the hearing .
The two judges who found in Assange 's favour were Lord Mance and Lady Hale .
Assange 's lawyers can also , at the same time , begin the process of appealing against the judgment to the European court of human rights in Strasbourg .
According to the supreme court , the Crown Prosecution Service can not start extraditing Assange until 13 June at the earliest . ""
The majority of the judges believe that parliament was seriously misled when it approved the European arrest warrant system , "" said Peirce .
"" Parliament thought a ' judicial authority ' meant a judge or court but the majority of supreme court judges based their decision on what is the practice in Europe and decided it on the basis of the Vienna convention , which was never argued before the court . ""
Even though Lord Brown has retired , at the age of 75 , since the original hearing , he may still be called back to ensure there are an uneven number of justices on the panel when the court considers Assange 's emergency application .
This is the first time the supreme court has agreed to consider an emergency challenge to one of its rulings .
It has happened in the past when the House of Lords was the highest appellate court ."
2012-05-30,
2012-05-30,
2012-05-30,"It was all going so well .
Lord Phillips , soon to retire as president of the supreme court , was explaining the judges ' reasoning in clear English suitable for a world - wide live television audience .
By a majority of five to two , the supreme court had agreed with the lower courts that the Swedish prosecutor qualified as a "" judicial authority "" and could therefore issue an European arrest warrant for Julian Assange .
It looked as if he had lost his final appeal against extradition .
Two burly security guards ensured that not a peep was heard from Assange 's supporters in court .
The judges had been warned that Dinah Rose QC , his fearless counsel , wanted to address the court .
But they were not prepared for what she had to say .
That was largely their own fault .
Normally , draft judgments are circulated to counsel up to a week before delivery .
That enables the lawyers to point out minor errors : a name mistyped , a date wrong and so on .
It 's something of a safeguard for the judges .
But since it was the Wikileaks man whose appeal they were hearing , the supreme court justices were taking no chances .
To avoid leaks , lawyers were not shown the judgments until 8.30 this morning .
That was just enough time for Rose to work out that the court had based its reasoning on a point that had never been argued at the two - day hearing in February .
Assange , who did n't turn up for the judgment , knew nothing of what was being done on his behalf .
It 's not unusual for judges to think up points that were never mentioned during a hearing .
They had done so in this case , on a completely different point , and had asked both sides for written observations after the hearing .
But nobody had ever asked counsel about the issue on which the majority had apparently based their decision .
This was the point raised by Phillips in paragraph 67 of the judgment .
As he explained , the 1969 Vienna convention on the law of treaties permits recourse , as an aid to interpretation , to "" any subsequent practice in the application of the treaty which establishes the agreement of the parties regarding its interpretation "" .
In other words , if countries had subsequently interpreted "" judicial authority "" in the framework direction to include a prosecutor , that must have been what the treaty meant .
That was only one of five reasons given by the supreme court president .
But his colleague Lord Walker said , in paragraph 94 , that the Vienna convention point was "" determinative "" .
Lord Brown , in the next paragraph , said he was inclined to base his conclusion "" principally on the fifth of Lord Phillips 's reasons "" .
In Brown 's view , it was "" ultimately critical "" .
Lord Kerr ( paragraph 108 ) left the point undecided .
And Lord Dyson cited the treaty before saying , in paragraph 131 , that past practice established acquiescence in arrest warrants being issued by prosecutors .
So it 's arguable that at least three judges regarded the point as decisive , a majority of the majority .
But were they entitled to take account of it ?
The judges gave Rose two weeks to make written submissions on this point .
"" If she decides to do so "" , they said later , they would "" then decide whether to re - open the appeal and accept further submissions ( either verbally through a further hearing , or on paper ) on the matter . ""
In the end , the judges may decide that they were entitled to take the Vienna convention into account .
In that event , they would presumably confirm the decision they delivered today .
But given two weeks to prepare her case , Rose could well come up with other arguments .
In the meantime , Assange can stay in the UK .
All this must be very embarrassing for the supreme court .
As far as I know , it has not reopened a case since it opened for business nearly three years ago .
The law lords , from whom the supreme court judges took over in 2009 , reopened only one of their decided cases .
That was in 1998 , on the question of whether Augusto Pinochet could extradited to Spain , where the former Chilean dictator was facing charges of torture and hostage - taking .
Lord Hoffmann , one of the judges , sat while disqualified as a matter of law and Clare Montgomery QC persuaded the law lords that they had the inherent power to reopen their previous decision .
This time round , she is representing the Swedish prosecutor .
Montgomery was working on another case this morning and did not attend the supreme court for what was meant to have been a formal "" hand - down "" judgment .
But she did not go unmentioned .
The normally unflustered president of the supreme court addressed Rose as "" Miss Montgomery "" and was sharply corrected by Assange 's counsel .
It all goes to show that , in the law , things do n't always turn out as you expect .
For reasons that are nothing to do with the sexual assault charges that Assange may face in Sweden , and still less to do with Wikileaks , he lives to fight another day .
This article was corrected at 1.25pm on May 30 .
We said that Julian Assange had been charged in Sweden .
The Swedish Prosecution Authority has not yet charged him , but seeks his extradition after accusations of sexual molestation and rape ."
2012-06-01,"Move over , Robert Jay QC :
the star of the week was Dinah Rose QC , who pulled off the feat of halting Julian Assange 's extradition minutes after Lord Phillips had announced that the Swedish prosecutor was , indeed , a judicial authority for the purposes of the European arrest warrant .
"" To avoid leaks , lawyers were not shown the judgments until 8.30am .
That was just enough time for Rose to work out that the court had based its reasoning on a point that had never been argued at the two - day hearing in February , "" reported Joshua Rozenberg .
"" This was the point raised by Phillips in paragraph 67 of the judgment .
As he explained , the 1969 Vienna convention on the law of treaties permits recourse , as an aid to interpretation , to ' any subsequent practice in the application of the treaty which establishes the agreement of the parties regarding its interpretation ' .
In other words , if countries had subsequently interpreted ' judicial authority ' in the framework direction to include a prosecutor , that must have been what the treaty meant . ""
Not since 1998 and Pinochet 's extradition has the country 's highest court been forced to reopen a case .
It must , says Rozenberg , "" be very embarrassing for the supreme court "" .
Relive the drama on our live blog and watch Gareth Peirce and John Pilger reacting to the judgment .
Ken Clarke thanked the Daily Mail for highlighting some of the deficiencies in the justice and security green paper , which proposed to extend closed material proceedings .
But is the subsequent bill , which gives judges rather than ministers the final say in whether to allow them , much better ?
Not according to Richard Norton - Taylor : "" The bill effectively abolishes - in any case that involves the security and intelligence agencies - the common law Norwich Pharmacal principle , whereby evidence held by other parties , perhaps in different jurisdictions , can be heard .
No ' sensitive information ' - a category defined so broadly as to include ' alleged information ' - could be used in any case involving MI5 and MI6 and their relations with foreign spooks , the CIA in particular .
Under the bill , a judge ' must ' agree to a secretary of state 's demand for secret hearings if the disclosure of information ' would be damaging to the interests of national security ' .
Such a criterion is much narrower than the ' public interest ' , says the government ...
Clarke may be commended for his chutzpah . ""

2012-06-12,"Lawyers for the WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange have formally asked the supreme court to reopen his appeal against extradition to Sweden over alleged sex crimes .
Their 18-page submission states that a majority of justices ruled against him on the basis of a legal point not argued in court .
The highly unusual procedure revolves around the applicability of the Vienna convention on the law of treaties and whether a European arrest warrant can be issued by a prosecutor .
The supreme court confirmed that it had received the application by Dinah Rose QC , Assange 's barrister .
It will now consider the written submission .
It can then either reject the application to reopen the case , call for fresh written arguments , or decide to hold a second oral hearing .
If Assange loses in the UK 's supreme court , he can still take his case to the European court of human rights , further delaying the extradition process for many months ."
2012-06-14,"The supreme court has reaffirmed its rejection of Julian Assange 's appeal against his extradition to Sweden , turning down an unusual , last - minute request to reopen the case .
In a short statement , issued only two days after Dinah Rose QC submitted a written plea for the case to be reheard , the court declared that her application "" is without merit and it is dismissed "" .
The terse phrasing suggests a degree of judicial disapproval of the extended process and leaves Assange 's lawyers with the choice of appealing the decision to the European court of human rights in Strasbourg or agreeing to the extradition requests .
Assange is wanted in connection with accusations of sexual assault and rape in Sweden .
He disputes the allegations .
He is being sought under a European arrest warrant ( EAW ) .
The supreme court case revolved around the question of whether a prosecutor , in this case in Sweden , constituted a "" judicial authority "" as the EAW specifies .
The supreme court found by a majority of five to two against Assange , saying that the warrant was valid .
In its statement refusing to reopen the case , the supreme court said it had agreed unanimously that extradition proceedings should not begin for another two weeks .
It added : "" Had Ms Rose been minded to challenge the applicability of [ the Vienna convention on the law of treaties ] or the applicability of state practice [ on interpreting treaties ]
â€
¦ she had the opportunity to do so .
She made no such challenge . ""
Her submissions were to the effect that caution should be exercised when considering the effect of state practice .
For these reasons the court considers that this application is without merit and it is dismissed . """
2012-06-19,"Britain 's diplomatic relations with Ecuador have historically been low - key but cordial .
However , the 2007 election of a socialist president Rafael Correa , led to a sharp change of direction in the Latin American state 's foreign policy , away from the US and its regional allies and towards a radical bloc led by Venezuela .
In 2009 , Correa closed a US military base , renounced Ecuador 's national debt and joined the Bolivarian Alternative for the Americas ( Alba ) created by the Venezuelan leader Hugo Chavez as a counterweight to western influence in Latin America , alongside Cuba , Nicaragua and Bolivia .
Relations with neighbouring Colombia nosedived in 2008 after a Colombian incursion into Ecuadorean territory , saying it had come under fire from left - wing Farc guerillas operating there .
Ecuador has also given diplomatic support to Iran in its standoff with the west over its nuclear programme .
Correa visited Tehran in 2008 and announced the opening of embassies in each other 's countries , while building up defence cooperation with Iran .
Iran has also provided loans for the construction of hydroelectric power plants .
In 2010 , the US government declared Ecuador as being in violation of international regulations on money - laundering and financing terrorism , further worsening ties with Washington .
However , the shift in foreign policy has not had until now a direct impact on British relations .
The Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall visited Ecuador in March 2009 as part of a regional tour to focus attention on climate change and celebrate the 200th anniversary of the birth of Charles Darwin .
The couple visited the Galapagos islands and met the vice president , Lenin Moreno , and were greeted by a crowd of about 1,000 waving British flags in a central square .
Correa visited London in 2009 and gave a lecture at the London School of Economics on his "" citizens revolution "" in Ecuador , speaking mostly in English .
According to Ecuabrit , a British - based website aimed at promoting good bilateral relations , the UK provided nearly a fifth of the Â£47 m EU aid spent in the country from 2007 to 2010 .
The foreign office last night said it had no comment on the impact of Julian Assange 's actions on relations with Quito .
According to the foreign office website , over 24,000 Britons visited Ecuador last year .
The official travel advice warned visitors about political unrest , saying : "" British nationals should exercise caution , avoid gatherings and carry ID at all times .
Even peaceful demonstrations can turn violent .
Large crowds should be avoided .
Foreigners participating in political demonstrations or protests of any kind may be subject to arrest and deportation under Ecuadorean law . """
2012-06-19,"The decision by the WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange to seek political asylum in the Ecuadorean embassy in London has sparked a fresh legal crisis over his already tortuous extradition case .
The 40 year old Australian walked into the country 's embassy in Knightsbridge , central London , on Tuesday and applied for protection from the European arrest warrant request citing the United Nations Human Rights Declaration .
Last week the UK 's supreme court finally rejected his appeal against extradition to Sweden where he is wanted for questioning in connection with the alleged rape of one woman and sexual assault on another in August 2010 .
He had been given until 28 June to lodge an appeal against the UK court 's decision at the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg .
His lawyers were believed to be considering their next move .
The WikiLeaks founder has been in custody and on bail in this country since autumn 2010 .
His bail conditions have varied over that time much for most of it they stipulated that he must stay at a country house in Suffolk owned by Vaughan Smith , the founder of the Frontline club in west London , report to police daily and wear an electronic tag .
Assange was granted bail on a surety of Â£240,000 raised and pledged by supporters .
His apparent flight from the legal process could now place that money at risk of confiscation by the court .
Assange 's presence will focus attention on the extent of diplomatic immunity for foreign embassies in the UK .
The Ecuadorian embassy issued a statement saying : "" This afternoon Mr Julian Assange arrived at the Ecuadorian embassy seeking political asylum from the Ecuadorian government . ""
As a signatory to the United Nations Universal Declaration for Human Rights , with an obligation to review all applications for asylum , we have immediately passed his application on to the relevant department in Quito . ""
While the department assesses Mr Assange 's application , Mr Assange will remain at the embassy , under the protection of the Ecuadorian Government . ""
The decision to consider Mr Assange 's application for protective asylum should in no way be interpreted as the Government of Ecuador interfering in the judicial processes of either the United Kingdom or Sweden . ""
The Ministry of Justice said that responsibility for handling his extradition rested with the Serious Organised crime Agency ( SOCA ) which deals with European Arrest Warrant requests .
SOCA did not immediately reply to calls .
Assange interviewed the president of Ecuador , Rafael Correa , on the Russia Today TV channel last month .
In their exchange , the Australian explained that he had been under house arrest in England for 500 days and elicited sympathy from the left wing populist leader .
By choosing Ecuador , he has alighted on a country that is clearly in accord with his political views , not closely aligned with the United States and , he will hope , beyond the reach of the European arrest warrant system .
Some legal commentators have doubted whether Assange would have strong grounds to take his appeal to the ECHR in Strasbourg .
He may have decided on his dramatic switch in tactics having been discouraged about his chances of success in Europe 's highest court ."

2012-06-19,"The US diplomatic cables published in December 2010 by WikiLeaks paint an often unflattering portrait of the country in which the site 's founder , Julian Assange , is attempting to claim political asylum .
The diplomats ' missives to the US secretary of state report on worsening situations around press freedom , judicial integrity , and corruption within the police .
According to a statement made by the Ecuadorian foreign ministry and tweets from its minister , Assange directed his plea for asylum personally to the Ecuadorian president , Rafael Correa , whom Assange met during an interview for Russia Today .
A 2009 cable noted with concern a series of moves made by President Correa against commercial media in the country since he came into office . ""
In 2008 , the government took management and editorial control of two national TV stations owned by the Isaias family , "" it said .
"" Over the past year the government has launched three ' public ' media outlets that in theory report on citizens ' business , but in practice mainly report favourably on government actions . ""
The new constitution includes a number of provisions that make commercial media outlets vulnerable to government pressure . ""
Taken together , President Correa 's actions and the provisions of the new constitution present a serious challenge to Ecuadorian media and freedom of the press . ""
Further diplomatic cables detailed warnings from President Obama to Correa about his treatment of the press , subsequently publicly condemned by the Ecuadorian leader .
Elsewhere , the documents warned of weaknesses in Ecuador 's judicial system .
One cable on terrorism warned : "" Ecuador 's judicial institutions remained weak , susceptible to corruption , and heavily backlogged with pending cases . ""
Another cable , which prompted Ecuador to expel the US ambassador to the country , accused Ecuador 's commander of police of using his position "" to extort cash and property , misappropriate public funds , facilitate human trafficking , and obstruct the investigation and prosecution of corrupt colleagues "" , concluding that "" corruption among Ecuadorian national police officers is widespread and well - known "" .
Assange cited a biased judicial process in Sweden , as well as ill - treatment by the country 's media , as factors in his decision to apply for asylum in Ecuador .
The cables also warn of Correa 's conflicted relationship with the US â€ “ a relationship certain to be tested by Assange 's asylum application .
One 2010 document sets out the president 's dilemma . ""
Without question there are GoE officials who do not want a close relationship with the US and are actively working to undermine relations .
There are also many GoE officials who value the relationship and want to preserve and improve upon it . ""
Correa himself , given his background , is likely conflicted .
The balance of power shifts daily between these two groups , and our bilateral relationship is caught up in this power struggle .
""
A power struggle which , a mere two years on , now has the man behind the cable 's publication at its heart ."
2012-06-20,"Q :
If Julian Assange remains inside the Ecuadorean embassy , how long can the standoff last ?
A :
The Foreign Office have confirmed that while he is on diplomatic territory , he is "" beyond the reach of the police "" .
Officers may only enter the building in Knightsbridge if invited inside by embassy officials .
Q :
Is there any way the Ecuadoreans can spirit him out of Britain and ensure he reaches the safety of Quito , their capital ?
A :
If Assange steps out of the embassy , he is liable to be arrested .
Were he to be given a diplomatic passport , that would not alter the situation : immunity from arrest is only conferred on diplomats accredited to the Court of St James 's by the Foreign Office .
Any attempt by the Ecuadoreans to have him accredited would be rebuffed by UK authorities .
Were Assange to accept an Ecuadorean diplomatic passport , some suggest , he would become an Ecuadorean national â€ “ and therefore be unable to seek asylum in what would now be his own country 's embassy .
Diplomacy is a cunning profession â€ “ dangerously double - edged .
Q :
Has there been a similiar act of diplomatic defiance in UK history ?
A :
The Foreign Office could not recall a recent parallel .
Even cases abroad are relatively rare .
In 1956 , the US granted the Catholic Cardinal JÃ³zsef Mindszenty refuge in their Budapest embassy ; he stayed for 15 years .
Seven Pentecostalists who burst into the US embassy in Moscow in 1978 seeking asylum remained in its basement until 1983 .
Six Cubans crashed a bus through the Peruvian embassy gates in Havana in 1980 ; Peru refused to hand them over whereupon Castro removed security guards from the embassy perimeter , allowing more than 10,000 Cubans to flood into the embassy grounds .
Two of the most recent embassy asylum cases involved refugees from China .
In February this year , a police chief entered the US compound but was persuaded to leave after 24 hours .
The Chinese dissident Chen Guangcheng escaped house arrest in his native village and sought sanctuary in the embassy in Beijing .
He later flew to the US .
Q :
Can the Swedish authorities bring any legal challenge against the Ecuadorean government , forcing them to hand over Assange ?
A :
It is difficult to see how that might happen .
Swedish prosecutors have indicated that they do not wish to become further involved until Assange is flown to Stockholm .
The Crown Prosecution Service says that it acts on behalf of the Swedish authorities .
Q :
Why is Sweden seeking to extradite Assange to Stockholm when he has not been charged with any offences ?
A :
In Sweden , it is normal practice for prosecutors to question suspects face - to - face before they are charged .
European arrest warrants issued by Sweden against other suspects have run into similar objections
â€ “ that the suspect being sought has not been charged â€ “ in other European countries .
Q :
Are the Americans also seeking Assange in connection with his WikiLeaks revelations ?
A :
It is not known whether there is a sealed indictment against him in the United States .
A grand jury has been empanelled in Virginia to consider his case .
Any US extradition request , it is assumed , would have to wait until Swedish justice had dealt with Assange ."
2012-06-20,
2012-06-20,"Julian Assange has dramatically sought political asylum at the Ecuadorean embassy in London , days after the supreme court rejected the last of his appeals against extradition to Sweden to face sex crime accusations and after what he called a "" declaration of abandonment "" by his own government in Australia .
In a move that appears to have surprised even some of his closest supporters , the WikiLeaks founder walked into the country 's embassy in Knightsbridge and asked for asylum , citing the UN declaration of human rights .
"" I can confirm I arrived at the Ecuadorean embassy and sought diplomatic sanctuary and political asylum , "" Assange said in a statement .
"" This application has been passed to the ministry of foreign affairs in the capital Quito .
I am grateful to the Ecuadorean ambassador and the government of Ecuador for considering my application . ""
The audacious bid came less than a week after the supreme court finally rejected his appeal against extradition to Sweden , where he is wanted for questioning in connection with accusations of the rape of one woman and sexual assault on another in August 2010 , which he denies .
Assange and his supporters have argued that his removal to Sweden could be followed by a possible onward extradition to the US on potential espionage charges , saying he is at risk of the death penalty .
The US government opened a grand jury investigation in May 2011 into the passing of hundreds of thousands of secret US embassy cables to WikiLeaks , the first stage in a process of deciding whether or not to prosecute Assange .
No request for extradition to the US has been made , however .
In a statement on its site , WikiLeaks said that in a meeting with Assange 's legal adviser in May , the Australian government had issued "" an effective ' declaration of abandonment ' , refusing to protect Mr Assange , or make any requests on his behalf "" .
Assange had been given until 28 June to lodge an appeal against the UK court 's decision at the European court of human rights in Strasbourg .
Some legal commentators have doubted whether Assange would have strong grounds to take his appeal to the court in Strasbourg .
He may have decided on his dramatic switch in tactics having been discouraged about his chances of success in Europe 's highest court .
Assange is currently on Â£240,000 police bail , a sum posted by a number of high - profile friends and supporters .
Last month Assange interviewed the socialist Ecuadorean president Rafael Correa for his TV show The World Tomorrow , broadcast on the Russian state - sponsored channel Russia Today .
The WikiLeaks founder described Correa as "" a leftwing populist who has changed the face of Ecuador "" .
It was unclear whether any explicit or informal offer of asylum had been made by the president during the interview , though the country 's deputy foreign minister said in 2010 that Ecuador would offer him residency without conditions .
Assange 's presence will focus attention on the extent of diplomatic immunity for foreign embassies in the UK .
In a statement , the Ecuadorean embassy said : "" This afternoon Mr Julian Assange arrived at the Ecuadorean embassy seeking political asylum from the Ecuadorean government .
We have immediately passed his application on to the relevant department in Quito .
While the department assesses Mr Assange 's application , Mr Assange will remain at the embassy , under the protection of the Ecuadorean government . ""
"" The decision to consider Mr Assange 's application for protective asylum should in no way be interpreted as Ecuador interfering in the judicial processes of either the United Kingdom or Sweden . ""
"" As Mr Assange is in the Ecuadorean embassy he is on diplomatic territory and beyond the reach of the police , "" the Foreign Office said .
"" We will seek to work with the Ecuadorean authorities to resolve this situation as soon as possible . ""
Ecuador 's justice system and record on free speech have been called into question by a number of campaigning organisations including Reporters Without Borders , the Committee to Protect Journalists , and Amnesty International .
"" I think this is ironic that you have a journalist , or an activist , seeking political asylum from a government that has â€ “ after Cuba â€ “ the poorest record of free speech in the region , and the practice of persecuting local journalists when the government is upset by their opinions or their research , "" said JosÃ © Miguel Vivanco , director of Human Rights Watch 's Americas division .
In April 2011 , Ecuador expelled the US ambassador Heather Hodges following the publication of diplomatic cables by WikiLeaks alleging widespread corruption within the Ecuadorean police .
The WikiLeaks founder has been in custody and on bail in the UK since autumn 2010 .
The activist Jemima Khan confirmed on Twitter that she had put up bail for Assange , saying : "" I had expected him to face the allegations .
I am as surprised as anyone by this . ""
The Australian journalist Phillip Knightley , said he had also offered Â£20,000 in surety for Assange , but he had no regrets about putting his money at stake .
"" I 'm not worried about my commitment .
I would do it again .
He 's an Australian and he deserves my compatriot 's support .
He 's been treated terribly by the British and Swedish justice systems and I think he 's the victim of a conspiracy . ""
Assange , he said , had sought asylum only "" after exhausting every other possible remedy "" .
Vaughan Smith , the founder of the Frontline Club in whose Norfolk mansion Assange spent much of his period on bail , said : "" I certainly did n't expect this to happen . ""
"" One deduces from it that he does n't feel he 's going to get justice by going to Sweden .
I feel sure that Julian will have gone to the embassy feeling that he was n't going to get justice otherwise .
I do feel he 's been painted unfavourably . ""
Assange has not been charged with any crime in Sweden , and vehemently denies any wrongdoing in relation to the two women .
Joakim Nergelius , a professor of jurisprudence and law at Ã – rebro University , told the Swedish paper Dagens Nyheter that since the basis of Sweden 's extradition request is the European arrest warrant , it was "" quite impossible to assess the possible legal implications "" should he be granted asylum .
The Ministry of Justice said that responsibility for handling his extradition rested with the Serious Organised Crime Agency ( Soca ) which deals with European arrest warrant requests .
Neither Soca , the Metropolitan police , whose extradition unit arrested Assange in December 2010 , nor the Crown Prosecution Service would comment ."
2012-06-20,"Julian Assange 's decision to seek political asylum in Ecuador shows how desperate he must feel .
We may infer from it that he sees little chance that the European court of human rights would even ask the UK to delay sending him to Sweden , let alone declare that he would face a breach of his human rights in a state bound by the human rights convention .
That should come as little surprise .
The Strasbourg court has regularly made it clear that it will issue what are called interim measures under rule 39 only if "" the applicant faces a real risk of serious , irreversible harm "" .
Assange apparently fears that Sweden would send him to the United States .
He is said to believe he might face a trial there for espionage , although the US has made no announcement to this effect .
Sweden is seeking Assange 's extradition from the UK in connection with alleged offences of sexual molestation and rape .
If it turned out that this was simply a pretext for handing him over to the Americans , Sweden would risk breaching article 28 of the EU framework decision that forms the basis of the European arrest warrant .
The home secretary 's consent would be required under section 58 of the Extradition Act 2003 before Sweden could order Assange 's extradition to a third state .
That said , Assange can be less sure about what would happen to him after all legal proceedings in Sweden are concluded .
But even if the Americans ask for his extradition at that stage , Sweden would not agree to extradite him unless the US undertook that he would not face the death penalty on conviction .
Assange was granted bail in December 2010 on condition that he lodged Â£200,000 at court and provided two sureties of Â£20,000 each .
He was also required to remain at a specified address between 10 pm and 8 am .
The Metropolitan police have said they were notified at 10.20 pm yesterday that he had breached his bail conditions .
Although Baroness Kennedy QC pointed out on Wednesday 's Today programme on BBC Radio 4 that the purpose of bail was to ensure that the police would always know where Assange was , his well - meaning supporters now face the prospect of losing some or all of the money they provided .
It is for the Ecuadoreans to decide whether they want to annoy the UK , the EU and , no doubt , the US by offering Assange asylum .
But to do so might be something of an empty gesture .
The police will not enter a foreign embassy to make an arrest .
But short of giving Assange Ecuadoran diplomatic status or hiding him in a rather large diplomatic bag , there seems no way in which he can get to Heathrow , let alone Ecuador , without being arrested for breach of his bail conditions .
Meanwhile , the UK supreme court made it clear on Wednesday morning that an extradition request can not be trumped by the right to respect for a person 's family life .
It dismissed an appeal from Scotland by a couple with six children facing serious drugs charges in the US .
The best interests of the children , coupled with the mother 's rights under article 8 of the human rights convention , were not strong enough to overcome the overwhelming public interest in giving effect to the US extradition request , the court decided .
A similar conclusion was reached by the supreme court on Wednesday in an Italian case .
But in a third case , involving an extradition request from Poland , the court found that the public interest in extraditing a mother did not justify the inevitable harm that it would cause to the lives of her children .
What these rulings teach us is that extradition cases involving families are fact - specific : you have to weigh up the seriousness of the charge against the potential harm to the children .
This seems entirely appropriate and today 's test cases should guide the lower courts when they have to take similar decisions in future .
They will be rather more useful to the judges than yesterday 's declaration by MPs that "" the right to respect for family or private life in article 8 of the European convention on human rights is a qualified right "" and that "" conditions for migrants to enter or remain in the UK on the basis of their family or private life should be those contained in the immigration rules "" .
Stating the obvious is little use to anybody ."

2012-06-20,"Some of Julian Assange 's most prominent supporters stand to lose up to Â£240,000 in bail money , provided to secure the WikiLeaks founder 's freedom when he first faced extradition proceedings .
A leading criminal lawyer said that following Assange 's decision to seek asylum in the Ecuadorean embassy in London and breach the terms of his bail , they would have to persuade the courts why they should not forfeit their money and prove they had done all they could to prevent him breaking the court order .
A group of celebrities and activists , including the socialite Jemima Khan , film director Ken Loach and publisher Felix Dennis , posted cash security of Â£200,000 to Westminster magistrates court with a further Â£40,000 as promised sureties when Assange was freed in December 2010 . ""
The people who have posted the money would have to go to court and plead their case as to why they should n't lose their money , "" said Oliver Lewis , partner at solicitors Powell Spencer and Partners .
"" There would have to be a pretty good reason why the money should n't be forfeited .
Usually the court says ' thank you very much , you have lost your money ' .
You have to show that you have been vigilant and put every effort in to stop it happening . ""
Vaughan Smith , the founder of the Frontline Club for journalists , hosted Assange at his Norfolk home for over a year and stands to lose Â£20,000 .
"" It is not clear to me whether I have a liability but either way I am concerned , "" he said .
"" I do believe Julian genuinely feels he will be sent to America â€ “ and of course I think the money is important because it relates to the welfare of my wife and children , but they do n't feel they are at risk of being sent to America .
"" I remain a supporter and it is important we recognise he is a western dissident .
There are a lot of people who believe the work he did at WikiLeaks was in the public interest . ""
Khan confirmed on Twitter that she had also posted bail money for Assange .
"" I had expected him to face the allegations , "" she said .
"" I am as surprised as anyone by this . ""
Tracy Worcester , the model and actress turned environmental campaigner , confirmed that she had put up a surety for Assange but said she had not yet been able to speak to his legal team about the latest developments and declined to comment further .
The human rights activist Bianca Jagger denied reports that she had contributed to the bail money , tweeting : "" I would like to set the record straight .
I did n't post bail for Julian Assange . ""
A spokeswoman for the courts service said it was normal for breaches of bail to be considered at the court that set the bail conditions in the first place , in this case Westminster magistrates court .
"" What happens to the money will be decided by a judge if and when he is brought back before the court , "" she said .
"" It depends on what the police say about what they think a person has done and what should follow on from that . """
2012-06-20,"In taking refuge in the Ecuadorian embassy in London , Julian Assange joins a long list of people who have sought asylum in foreign embassies .
Recent examples include Chongqing police chief Wang Lijun in the US consulate in Chengdu , and blind Chinese dissident Chen Guangcheng in the US embassy in Beijing .
However , although embassy premises are legally inviolable , general international law does not recognise a right of diplomatic asylum .
Even if Ecuador does grant Assange asylum , the UK will not be obliged to grant him safe passage out of the country .
In 1949 , Victor RaÃºl Haya de la Torre , leader of the Peruvian APRA movement , sought refuge in the Colombian embassy in Lima .
The dispute between Colombia and Peru as to whether he could be granted diplomatic asylum went twice to the international court of justice in The Hague .
The court ruled that no general rule in international law existed permitting states to grant diplomatic asylum ; a legal basis had to be established in each particular case .
Dissatisfied with the results of the litigation , American countries joined together to adopt a convention on diplomatic asylum .
This Latin American tradition might , at least partly , explain the attitude taken by Ecuador .
No such treaty , however , exists elsewhere .
No general right of states to grant diplomatic asylum consequently exists , except , possibly , in cases where it is temporarily granted to preserve human life and in situations of civil and political unrest .
Despite the hyperbolic claims made by some of his supporters , such an exception would not appear to cover Julian Assange 's case .
International law is clear that diplomatic premises are inviolable , so Assange remains outside the reach of the UK authorities so long as he remains within the Ecuadorian embassy .
In the past , some such stays have lasted years .
Haya de La Torre remained in the Colombian embassy in Lima for five years ; whilst Cardinal Mindszenty , who took refuge in the US embassy in Budapest following the suppression of the Hungarian uprising in 1956 , was only permitted to leave the country in 1971 .
Once he leaves the embassy , however , Assange can be arrested and detained by the UK authorities under UK law , regardless of how Ecuador may have determined his request for asylum .
In addition , it may be that Ecuador is legally obliged , if requested , to surrender Assange to the UK authorities .
According to the international court of justice , ( although contrary to Ecuador 's contentions ) the granting of diplomatic asylum is an intervention in a state 's internal affairs , and diplomats are not obliged to assist in the course of justice in their host state .
However , the 1961 Vienna convention on diplomatic relations , to which both Ecuador and the UK are parties , requires that diplomats respect their host state 's laws and regulations .
The convention also provides that diplomatic premises should not be used in any manner incompatible with the functions of the mission as laid down in the convention ( which does not include harbouring fugitives from justice ) or general international law ( which , as shown , does not recognise a general right to grant diplomatic asylum ) .
The current law would thus seem to argue that a person seeking diplomatic asylum should be surrendered if he is accused of a criminal offence and a warrant for his arrest has been issued by the competent authorities .
This would appear to be the case , at least potentially , with Assange .
Even excluding the outstanding Swedish request for his extradition , the police have stated that he is in breach of his bail conditions and thus liable to arrest .
It does not appear , however , that the UK authorities have made a formal request for his surrender to Ecuador .
How matters will develop remains to be seen .
It may be that the UK government will simply play a waiting game .
One thing seems certain , however : Julian Assange is unlikely to be visiting Ecuador any time in the near future .

2012-06-20,"Julian Assange sought political asylum because he believed he would not "" see the light of day for 40 years "" if he was extradited to Sweden , according to his New York - based lawyer .
Michael Ratner of the Center for Constitutional Rights , which represents the WikiLeaks founder in the US , said Assange and his legal team considered it highly likely that he would face an onward extradition to the US if he were sent to Sweden .
"" The concrete reality [ is ] that he was facing a political prosecution in the US , he was facing the death penalty or certainly life in jail .
Faced with that , he had extremely limited choices .
"" Barring a last - ditch appeal to the European court of human rights , Assange could have expected to be extradited imminently , after the supreme court rejected the last of his attempts to resist removal to Sweden over accusations of sex assaults made by two women in August 2010 .
The Assange team believes the US is likely to seek to prosecute him on espionage charges , which carries a potential death penalty , and that his chances of resisting any such extradition warrant would be more difficult in Sweden , where he would not receive bail during investigations into the alleged sex crimes and where his lawyers believe political and public opposition to a US extradition claim would be weaker .
The US empanelled a secret grand jury investigation into WikiLeaks and Assange in May 2011 , but has not issued any requests for his extradition to the UK or Sweden .
However , Ratner said both he and Assange believed it was "" more likely than not "" that a sealed indictment had been drawn up .
Assange 's legal adviser Jennifer Robinson said in February that she and Assange had discussed the possibility of his seeking political asylum .
Ratner said he had had no warning of the plan , however .
Ecuador 's foreign minister , Ricardo PatiÃ±o , said on Tuesday the Wikileaks founder had written to the country 's president , Rafael Correa , to ask for asylum .
Assange interviewed Correa last month for his TV show The World Tomorrow , broadcast on the Russian state - sponsored channel Russia Today .
It was during this interview that an offer of asylum was made , the Associated Press reported , quoting a woman who had been present during the interview but had spoken on condition of anonymity .
It did not say whether the offer was personally made by Correa .
It is not at all clear what the Australian 's next move can be , even if Ecuador does grant his request .
The Foreign Office has confirmed the embassy is diplomatic territory , and that while Assange remains there he is "" beyond the reach of police "" .
However , he will be subject to immediate arrest if he attempts to leave , the Metropolitan police have said , after confirming he had breached his bail conditions .
Assange 's passport is understood to have been surrendered to British authorities , and even were he to be given a diplomatic passport , this would not confer automatic immunity , the British authorities indicated .
Anna Alban , the Ecuadorian ambassador , had a "" cordial and constructive "" meeting with Foreign Office officials on Wednesday morning to discuss the case , she said in a statement .
"" I welcome the statement from the UK government last night in which they stated that they ( the UK government ) would work with the Ecuadorian government to find a resolution . ""
I also took the opportunity to explain that the decision on Mr Assange 's application would be assessed by the department of foreign affairs in Quito and would take into account Ecuador 's long and well - established tradition in supporting human rights .
She said it was not Ecuador 's intention "" to interfere with the processes of either the UK or Swedish governments "" , adding that she would make herself available to British government officials at any time "" so that we can find a just and fair solution to this situation "" ."
2012-06-20,"With its stand - off at the tiny Ecuadorean embassy in London , the Assange melodrama has entered its third act .
But despite the drama , we do n't yet know for sure what kind of story it is .
The first possibility is political thriller : Assange is right , his critics wrong .
The US is indeed trying to extradite Assange via Sweden , using a method which avoids due process and involves political interference .
There 's been no evidence to support this theory , despite it being the basis of Assange 's bid for asylum , but it would be a problematic one for the US : a backdoor extradition would bring a lot of disillusioned WikiLeaks supporters back into the fold , likely prompt a ( grudging ) defence of Assange from the New York Times and others , and give Obama serious first amendment and human rights challenges in an election year .
Tactically , it would be the worst possible way for the US to seek extradition .
The second option is Greek tragedy : a world in which Assange has spent so long conflating allegations centred around his private life on a few days in Sweden with WikiLeaks ' wider battles he 's come to believe his own spin .
Instead of seeing a Swedish prosecution , Assange 's belief it comes wider has led him to breach his bail , lose his supporters their bail money , and cause an diplomatic ruckus .
The third is soap opera : time and again during his Swedish sex case , Assange has escalated the situation â€ “ refusing to take an STD test , leading to the prosecution .
Leaving the country and refusing to attend a face - to - face interview ( offering only Skype or through the embassy ) , leading to extradition .
Fighting the extradition through every court to the highest in the UK .
And now , prompting a stand - off outside an embassy â€ “ always moving in the direction of increasing drama and public attention .
To those supporters still fanatically loyal to Assange , which of the three is happening matters a great deal .
To others , it 's already a tragedy .
WikiLeaks ' alleged source Bradley Manning faces trial in the US and the possibility of spending the rest of his life in prison .
Sixteen supporters who allegedly took part in attacks on PayPal , Mastercard and Visa , the online equivalent of sit - in protests , for their boycott of WikiLeaks each face up to 15 years in prison and await their day in court .
A group of alleged UK hackers belonging to the Lulzsec group will each face their trials next week .
And the WikiLeaks submission system remains down , as it has for nearly two years .
But we 're not looking at any of that .
We 're looking at the Ecuadorean embassy

He spent his first full day confined to the small Ecuadorean embassy in Knightsbridge on Monday , unable to move as his lawyers , diplomats and government officials grappled with the implications of his request for political asylum to avoid extradition to Sweden .
His surprise move on Tuesday evening has left some of Assange 's most prominent supporters facing the loss of up to Â£240,000 in bail money provided to secure his freedom when he first faced extradition proceedings .
Supporters including the activist Jemima Khan , film director Ken Loach and publisher Felix Dennis posted cash security of Â£200,000 with Westminster magistrates court with a further Â£40,000 as promised sureties when Assange was freed in December 2010 .
Assange 's gambit came after he lost the last of his many appeals against removal to Sweden to be questioned over sex crime accusations , for which he has been on police bail since December 2010 .
He had been driven by what he called "" really terrible choices "" to make the last - ditch move , his New - York - based lawyer told the Guardian , believing it highly likely that the US intends to seek his onward extradition from Sweden on espionage charges over the WikiLeaks cable releases .
"" What he was facing was never seeing the light of day for the next 40 years , "" said Michael Ratner , of the Centre for Constitutional Rights , which represents the WikiLeaks founder in the US .
The Swedish lawyer representing the Australian 's two alleged victims said the latest attempt to avoid extradition was "" a tragedy for the women "" .
Claes BorgstrÃ¶m said the women were "" frustrated "" and "" disappointed "" . ""
The tragedy is that he does n't take his responsibility .
He should have come to Sweden , "" BorgstrÃ¶m added .
Assange has not been charged in Sweden and denies the allegations .
The Foreign Office has confirmed that the first - floor embassy â€ “ consisting of the ambassador 's office and some other small rooms , one of which Assange is said to be occupying â€ “ is diplomatic territory and that while there Assange is "" beyond the reach of police "" .
But officials are adamant that even if Ecuador grants him asylum or a diplomatic passport , he faces immediate arrest the moment he steps out of the front door for breaching his bail conditions .
Even taking Ecuadorean nationality would not help , officials stressed , as he could not claim asylum in what would be then his own embassy .
He is understood to have surrendered his own Australian passport to British authorities .
Metropolitan police officers attended the embassy , after confirming that an arrest warrant had been issued for breach of the Bail Act .
Anna Alban , the Ecuadorean ambassador , said she had met Foreign Office officials , and she explained "" that the decision on Mr Assange 's application would be assessed by the department of foreign affairs in Quito and would take into account Ecuador 's long and well established tradition in supporting human rights . ""
Her government would be seeking "" a just and fair solution to this situation "" , she said .
Ricardo Patino , Ecuador 's foreign minister , said on Tuesday that the WikiLeaks founder had written to the country 's president , Rafael Correa , to ask for asylum .
Assange interviewed him last month for his TV show The World Tomorrow , broadcast on the Russian state - sponsored channel Russia Today , in which the president told him : "" Welcome to the club of the persecuted . ""
Ecuador is the only country to have expelled its US ambassador over the WikiLeaks cable revelations .
It was during the filming of this interview that an offer of asylum was made , the Associated Press reported , quoting a woman who had been present during the interview but had spoken on condition of anonymity .
It did not say whether the offer was personally made by Correa .
Ratner said Assange 's move had been prompted purely by his fears of future prosecution in the US rwhere a secret grand jury has been empanelled into the WikiLeaks founder , ather than a desire to avoid the Swedish accusations . ""
Had the US come forward and said , ' We will not prosecute Julian Assange , I think he would be in Sweden tomorrow to deal with the allegations of the sex crimes .
It was not about that at all .
It was only about the US . ""
Marianne Ny , the Swedish prosecutor who had secured Assange 's extradition in the supreme court in London , is following developments closely , said her spokeswoman , Britta von Schoultz .
Ny will not comment on Assange 's decision to seek asylum at the Ecuadorean embassy until he is returned to Sweden .
"" It is solely a case for the British authorities to handle , "" Von Schoultz said .
"" When it becomes a case for the Swedish prosecutor , she will comment on the case . ""
A leading criminal lawyer said those supporters who had stood bail for Assange would have to persuade the courts why they should not forfeit their money .
Oliver Lewis , partner at Powell Spencer and Partners Solicitors , said : "" There would have to be a pretty good reason
â€
¦
Usually the court says thank you very much , you have lost your money . ""
Vaughan Smith , the founder of the Frontline Club , was asked to offer surety of Â£20,000 , and was unclear whether he would forfeit it . ""
The money is important because it relates to the welfare of my wife and children , but they do n't feel they are at risk of being sent to America , "" he said .
"" I remain a supporter and it is important we recognise [ Assange ] is a western dissident .
There are a lot of people who believe the work he did at Wikileaks was in the public interest . ""
"" Khan confirmed on Twitter that she had also posted bail money for Assange .
"" I had expected him to face the allegations , "" she said .
"" I am as surprised as anyone by this.""In his asylum request , Assange accused the Australian government of making an "" effective declaration of abandonment "" , refusing to make interventions on his behalf to the Swedish or US authorities .
At a press conference , Julia Gillard , the Australian prime minister , said : "" Mr Assange 's decisions and choices are a matter for Mr Assange We , our officials , our consular officials , will be in contact with him and also with Ecuador in London about this , but his decisions in relation to this matter are for him to make ..
""But the Australian Green party attacked its government 's response as "" feeble "" , saying it amounted to "" malign indifference"".During Correa 's six years in office , his administration has continued to welcome foreign refugees , of which more than 95 % have fled the protracted civil war in Colombia .
On Monday , AntÃ³nio Guterres , the UN high commissioner for refugees , commended Ecuador for being an "" example of solidarity "" by receiving Latin America 's largest refugee population ."
2012-06-21,"The Foreign Office says it expects a decision by Ecuador on Thursday on the fate of Julian Assange , who has taken refuge in the country 's embassy in London and asked for political asylum to avoid extradition to Sweden .
A spokesman said British officials had had an "" amicable "" conversation with the Ecuadorean ambassador , Anna Alban , when she visited the Foreign Office on Wednesday to discuss the situation .
"" She got an understanding of our legal position and we gained an understanding of theirs , "" the spokesman said .
"" It is our understanding overnight that they are minded to reach a view in Quito today [ on the asylum request ] , or in the very near future .
There is no reason to believe that all this was anything other than a surprise to them , and they are dealing with an unprecedented set of circumstances . ""
In a television interview in Rio on Wednesday , however , the Ecuadorean president , Rafael Correa , said : "" We 'll take the time necessary because this is a very serious matter that we treat with full responsibility . ""
Talking to a Latin American satellite channel , teleSUR , he said that Assange needed somewhere "" to continue his mission "" to fight for freedom of expression , and that it was fully within Ecuador 's sovereign rights to consider his asylum request .
Foreign Office diplomats said that as far as they were aware it was the first time in British history that someone had taken refuge in an embassy in London to ask for political asylum in another country .
They said the decision of what to do in case the Ecuadorean government does grant asylum would be a matter for the London Metropolitan police and the Home Office .
A spokeswoman at the Ecuadorean embassy in Knightsbridge said Assange was in good spirits in anticipation of the decision , which is expected to be announced either in Quito or in Rio , where Correa , is attending the Rio+20 conference on sustainable development . ""
He is OK , fine .
We are all here waiting for what the decision is going to be , "" she said .
Alban described her discussions with the Foreign Office as "" cordial and constructive "" , and welcomed British readiness to co - operate with her government in the search for a solution .
In a statement on the embassy website she said her foreign ministry in Quito would "" take into account Ecuador 's long and well - established tradition in supporting human rights "" .
But Alban added : "" I also emphasised to the UK government that it was not the intention of the Ecuadorean government to interfere with the processes of either the UK or Swedish governments . ""
Britain 's supreme court last month upheld a high court ruling from last year that Assange could be extradited to Sweden , where he faces accusations of raping a woman and sexually molesting and coercing another in Stockholm while on a visit to give a lecture in August 2010 .
Assange says the sex was consensual and the allegations against him are politically motivated .
His WikiLeaks website has published a huge quantity of US diplomatic and military cables , and his lawyers say that if he goes to Sweden he risks extradition to the US on espionage charges for which the penalty can be death .
Assange , an Australian national , has until 28 June to take his case to a European court of in Strasbourg if he wishes to argue he did not receive a fair trial in Britain .
Ecuador 's foreign minister , Ricardo Patino , said on his Twitter account : "" We are now studying the risk claimed by Assange that he would be face a politically motivated trial and could be sentenced to death . ""
In a tweet this afternoon Patino reported : "" Representatives of civil society at Rio+20 are waiting outside President Correa 's hotel to demand that he gives Julian Assange asylum . """

2012-06-21,"If Ecuador grants Julian Assange asylum at its London embassy , he could be confined far longer than if he went to Sweden to face questioning and possible charges there .
South American countries have had a long history of granting political asylum at their embassies .
For much of the continent 's history , coup or revolution was the usual path for political change .
New rulers preserved their future exit options by allowing safe passage into exile for any ousted leader who made it to a brotherly South American embassy .
Outside South America , there is no similar tradition .
Cardinal Mindszenty took refuge at the US legation in Budapest during the 1956 uprising and stayed 15 years in a cramped apartment before being allowed to go into exile .
UK authorities are unlikely to allow Assange leave the Ecuadorean Embassy , lest the London embassies become a magnet for would - be fugitives .
Scandinavian prisons have a reputation for humaneness â€ “ no bars , nice rooms , furloughs and conjugal visits â€ “ and Assange might find a short incarceration there preferable to an indefinite stay in what I presume is a relatively cramped Ecuadorian embassy .
Julian Assange 's lawyer has said his client is concerned not by the prospect of sex offence charges in Sweden , but that Sweden might extradite him to the United States .
There , his lawyer says , he could face the death penalty for espionage and treason .
While I am no expert on Swedish and British extradition law , I have never understood why Sweden â€ “ a neutral country with a long tradition of harboring American draft dodgers and deserters
â€ “ would be more likely to extradite Assange than the United Kingdom , a staunch US ally whose laws authorize prosecution of journalists for official secrets violations in a way that is not possible in either the US or Sweden .
In the United States , constitutional protections of freedom of the press are nearly absolute and this makes it almost impossible to prosecute the publisher of classified information .
Earlier this month , the New York Times ran articles detailing ongoing US covert operations , including cyber attacks on Iran 's nuclear program and targeted killing of al - Qaida operatives .
These revelations clearly compromised US national security â€ “ presumably , both Iran and al - Qaida will now take defensive measures â€ “ but no one is calling for the prosecution of the reporter , David Sanger , or the newspaper .
Indeed , Sanger is now feted on national television and his book , based on what he learned of US intelligence activities , is certain to be a bestseller .
Strategic leaking â€ “ even of the nation 's most sensitive secrets
â€ “ is a Washington tradition .
While Republicans allege these latest leaks were done to make President Obama look good ( and indeed , he appears far more aggressive than his predecessor both on Iran and in combating terrorism ) , the Bush administration was often reckless in its use of intelligence for partisan purposes .
To its credit , the Obama administration has been serious about prosecuting leakers .
In addition to prosecuting Private Bradley Manning ( Assange 's alleged source ) , the administration has launched a criminal investigation of these latest leaks and has been willing to force journalists to testify about their sources .
While the volume of material WikiLeaks released is staggering â€ “ millions of pages of classified State Department cables
â€ “
it contains no intelligence reporting , and very little of what is truly sensitive .
( Full disclosure : cables I wrote as ambassador to Croatia were among those leaked . )
Ambassadors generally use special channels for policy recommendations , discussion of intelligence activities and for accounts of sensitive meetings with top officials .
Private Bradley Manning had no access to cables in these channels , nor to intelligence reporting .
Washington 's reaction to WikiLeaks was wildly disproportionate to the actual sensitivity of the material released .
While one Republican congressman did call for the death penalty ( Republicans have , over the years , proposed the death penalty for almost everything except overdue library books ) , prosecutions proceed on the basis of the law .
Publishing secret documents is not against the law and other suggested criminal charges â€ “ such as conspiracy to steal US government property â€ “ have never been used against media organizations and would almost certainly fail in a prosecution of Assange .
The WikiLeaks cables cut short several ambassadorial tenures and forced some embarrassing apologies to foreign leaders .
The cables also showed American diplomats to be acute observers of the foreign scene , who do not suffer autocrats or kleptocrats gladly ( even when from friendly countries ) .
In Tunisia , cables describing corruption in the Ben Ali regime helped fuel the uprising in the country that kicked off the Arab Spring .
Julian Assange may stay in the Ecuadorian embassy or go to Sweden to answer the allegations there .
He will not end up in the United States .
Much as US officials might want him in jail , the legal and constitutional barriers to a successful prosecution are insurmountable .
There is no basis for extradition .
The State Department does , however , have discretion as to who can get a visa .
Assange is not likely to get one .
â€¢
This article was amended on 28 June 2012 to make clear that Julian Assange has not had charges brought against him in Sweden"
2012-06-22,"Julian Assange is in the Ecuadorian embassy and has asked for political asylum ( Assange trapped in embassy deadlock , 21 June ) .
How should Ecuador respond ?
Assange is wanted in Sweden for questioning , although there are no criminal charges against him as of now .
Yet , when he offered to be questioned in the UK by Swedish officials , they did not take him up on it .
UK judges twisted and stretched the law to permit extradition , even without an order from a Swedish judge .
Reportedly Sweden has an arrangement with the US whereby it would hand him over to the US on a mere request .
That would lead to his prosecution for helping inform the world public .
It is no surprise therefore that Assange would prefer to be captive in the Ecuadorian embassy .
It would be improper for Ecuador to shield Assange from possible sex charges .
I suggest that Ecuador invite Swedish officials to question Assange in the embassy ( or in Ecuador ) .
If he is subsequently charged in Sweden , Ecuador could approve his extradition to Sweden on the condition that Sweden not hand him over to the US , but rather let him return to Ecuador if acquitted , or at the end of his sentence , if he is found guilty .
Richard Stallman Cambridge , Massachusetts , USA â€¢ Julian Assange 's request for asylum in Ecuador is shrewd , given the country 's determination to free itself from US influence .
But there is much more to Ecuador than playing a bit part in political gamesmanship .
And , equally , far more to it than the allegations of corruption ( Report , 20 June ) .
I spent a month there recently travelling alone and met many Ecuadorians from all walks of life .
The Correa government is not popular with rich landowners and the rightwing "" free "" press .
But it is popular with the vast majority of the people .
It has torn up inherited and extortionate deals with the World Bank , is investing hugely in roads , provides free university education , improved access to healthcare , begun to implement the Moreno disability action plan ( named after the wheelchair - using vice - president ) â€ “ which is a flagship in South America ; granted language and parliamentary rights to indigenous groups and is working with the EU and others to preserve rainforest biodiversity .
It was clear to me that it had a model of social democracy that many other countries could aspire to .
No wonder it 's not the darling of the neoliberals .
Phil Madden Abergavenny , Monmouthshire â€¢ Hands up those who think Assange will spend about two days in Sweden before being deported to the US ?
Bill Thompson Frankby , Wirral"
2012-06-22,"Julian Assange has admitted that he has no idea whether his bid for political asylum in Ecuador to avoid extradition to Sweden will be successful .
The WikiLeaks founder , who has sought refuge at the Ecuadorean embassy in London , told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation that he did not know when a decision on his asylum request would be made .
His comments came as one of his most prominent supporters , Jemima Khan , said she would like to see him confront the rape allegations made against him by two Swedish women .
Khan , who faces losing the Â£20,000 she put towards his bail , said on Twitter that the two women "" have a right to a response "" .
But Assange said his asylum bid had highlighted what he insists are attempts by the US government to draw up charges against him for leaking hundreds of thousands of secret military and diplomatic documents via WikiLeaks . ""
The department of justice in the United States has been playing a little game , and that little game is that they refuse to confirm or deny the existence of a grand jury , "" Assange said in a phone interview with ABC radio .
"" We are hoping what I am doing now will draw attention to the underlying issues .
"" A Virginia grand jury is studying evidence that might link Assange to US soldier Bradley Manning , who has been charged with aiding the enemy by passing the secret files to WikiLeaks and is awaiting trial .
No action has yet been taken against Assange and the Australian government has said there is no indication an indictment is pending .
Assange agreed but said a case was being built against him , claiming there was now a 48,135 page FBI file on him and WikiLeaks . ""
Of course not , at the moment the matter is before the grand jury , "" he said .
"" Until it comes out of the grand jury there will not be such evidence afforded . ""
Explaining the reasoning behind his asylum bid , Assange said : "" We had heard that the Ecuadoreans were sympathetic in relation to my struggles and the struggles of [ WikiLeaks ] with the United States .
Ecuador 's embassy has said a decision on the case was expected soon .
WikiLeaks spokesman Kristinn Hrafnsson said "" it could take hours , it could take days "" before a decision was made .
Assange would stay at the embassy until the matter was settled , she added .
"" I assume that if asylum is not granted , he will leave . ""
Per Samuelson , one of the WikiLeaks founder 's two Swedish lawyers , said Assange was camping out "" in an office that has been prepared with overnight sleeping facilities . ""
"" I do n't get the feeling that they [ embassy staff ] are in a hurry to get rid of him .
He 's welcome there , "" he added .
Britain 's supreme court last month upheld a high court ruling from last year that Assange could be extradited to Sweden , where he faces accusations of raping a woman and sexually molesting and coercing another in Stockholm while on a visit to give a lecture in August 2010 .
Assange says the sex was consensual and the allegations against him are politically motivated ."
2012-06-22,"Ecuador 's president has acknowledged the diplomatic and political minefield created by Julian Assange 's application for asylum , and indicated that a decision on the WikiLeaks founder 's appeal is likely to take longer than first thought .
Speaking to reporters in Quito , Rafael Correa said : "" We are going to have to discuss with and seek the opinions of other countries .
We do n't wish to offend anyone , least of all a country we hold in such deep regard as the United Kingdom . ""
Once a decision is made , Correa said , "" we can talk about safe passage and such things"".The WikiLeaks founder requested asylum at the country 's embassy in London on Tuesday , citing the UN declaration on human rights .
He is on bail after losing the last of his appeals against extradition to Sweden to face allegations of sexual offences , but insists such a move could place him at greater risk of possible future prosecution by the United States over the WikiLeaks cable releases in 2010 .
Ecuador 's deputy foreign minister , Marco Albuja , said on Wednesday that the country would make a decision within 24 hours , but Correa said : "" He [ Assange ] presented his reasons .
We are going to verify them .
We will take the time necessary .
Ecuador is a country which defends the right to life .
We have to see whether there is a threat to Julian Assange 's life . ""
The president 's comments are an acknowledgement of the scale of the problem with which lawyers , diplomats and government officials are grappling .
While discussions between the country 's ambassador , Ana Alban Mora , and Foreign Office officials on Wednesday were described as "" cordial and constructive "" , British government sources have stressed that Assange , who is now in breach of his bail conditions , will be liable for immediate arrest should he step out of the front door of the embassy ; they know of no such protocols for negotiating "" safe passage "" .
It has raised the prospect of a lengthy stay at the embassy for the Australian if he is offered asylum .
Assange may for now have escaped a prison cell in Sweden ( where , though he has not been charged , he can expect to be held on remand while under investigation over the alleged sex assaults ) , but for the time being , his home is a small office with makeshift sleeping facilities .
Ecuador 's embassy consists only of the ambassador 's office and a handful of other small rooms , according to those familiar with the layout .
The WikiLeaks founder has supplied an approved list of associates who can visit him , according to the embassy ; asked about his access to showers and food , a spokeswoman said : "" We have everything for him here . ""
He is still wearing his electronic ankle tag . ""
He will stay until this matter is settled , "" said Kristinn Hrafnsson , WikiLeaks 's spokesman , downplaying suggestions of an imminent judgment .
"" I do n't get the feeling that they [ embassy staff ] are in a hurry to get rid of him , "" said Assange 's Swedish lawyer , Per E Samuelsson .
"" He 's welcome there .
"" Both men have visited Assange , along with the journalist John Pilger and others .
In his interview on Thursday Assange told the Australian broadcaster ABC that he had sought asylum in London , rather than fighting any possible future extradition bid by the US from Sweden , because his remand status there would mean "" my ability to exercise an asylum right would be at an end "" .
No such application has been made or indicated by the US to date .
He accused the Crown Prosecution Service of "" trying to cancel "" the period of 14 days he understood he was entitled to , after the 28 June deadline for his extradition under British law , in which to appeal to the European court of human rights .
The CPS , which has acted on behalf of the Swedish prosecutor in the extradition proceedings , denied this .
Vaughan Smith , Assange 's former host and one of the suretors of his Â£240,000 bail payment , said even given the threat of arrest , there could be a way forward , with sufficient political pressure : "" I believe that if he was to get political asylum there 's a way out .
We have to accept that we would then have a dissident .
Assange is a western dissident . """
2012-06-22,"Let no one say that Julian Assange acts predictably .
Just when you thought that the supreme court 's decision meant that the Wikileaks founder would shortly be on his way to Sweden , barring Strasbourg - or divine - intervention , the news arrives that he has arrived at the Ecuadoran embassy in London , demanding political asylum .
So what now ?
Joshua Rozenberg was not surprised that Assange did not store much hope in the ECtHR , but is not sure that an offer of asylum would be much help : It is for the Ecuadoreans to decide whether they want to annoy the UK , the EU and , no doubt , the US by offering Assange asylum .
But to do so might be something of an empty gesture .
The police will not enter a foreign embassy to make an arrest .
But short of giving Assange Ecuadoran diplomatic status or hiding him in a rather large diplomatic bag , there seems no way in which he can get to Heathrow , let alone Ecuador , without being arrested for breach of his bail conditions .
According to the Foreign Office , even a diplomatic passport would not enable Assange to leave without being arrested for breaching his bail conditions , Owen Bowcott reports .
However , Tim Dowling has some suggestions for escape routes .
Swapping lives with a pizza delivery boy may not be what Gareth Peirce would advise , but it may be that or bedding down for a long stay at the embassy .
In other extradition news , the supreme court gave judgment in five appeals involving Polish , Italian and British citizens on Wednesday .
It followed a motion drafted by Theresa May and passed by MPs the night before calling on the judiciary not to reject deportations of foreign - born criminals on the grounds that they are entitled to a family life in the UK under article 8 of the ECHR .
Dismissing 4 out of the 5 appeals , the judges held that that extradition cases involving families are fact - specific .
Meanwhile , in Libya , hopes of an early release for the ICC officials that have been detained were dashed .
Richard Goldstone , South African judge and former chief prosecutor at UN tribunals for Rwanda and the former Yugoslavia , writes : The current arrest in Libya of four officials of the international criminal court is quite clearly a violation of international law .
What is effectively an act of kidnapping also regrettably demonstrates that there is as yet no rule of law in Libya domestically .
Ultimately , what has happened has justified the insistence by the ICC that Saif should be tried in The Hague .
In the UK , plans for secret courts contained in the justice and security bill were criticised by the independent reviewer of terrorism legislation , David Anderson QC .
His comments came on the same day that the bill had its second reading in the House of Lords and the civil rights organisation Liberty staged a protest outside the supreme court in Westminster .

2012-06-23,"In his superb essay The Paranoid Style in American Politics , Richard Hofstadter took care not to tie paranoia to a particular ideology .
He was writing after the red scare of McCarthyism had driven thousands of allegedly "" subversive "" Americans from their jobs .
In that cold climate , it felt natural to investigate conservative - led outbreaks of hysteria .
Throughout American history , rightwing movements had raged against masonic , Catholics and Jewish conspiracies .
In Hofstadter 's day , they had led demented campaigns against gun control and fluoride in the water supply .
If Hofstadter were alive today , he would doubtless write about the birther movement , or cast a scornful eye at the gibbering career of Glenn Beck , formerly of Fox News , who has all the traditional anxieties about secret societies and Jews .
But although Hoftstadter investigated the manias of conservatives , he refused to call them conservative manias .
Rather than use the language of right and left he explained that he preferred to talk of the paranoid style , "" simply because no other word adequately evokes the sense of heated exaggeration , suspiciousness , and conspiratorial fantasy that I have in mind .
"" The right does not have a monopoly on paranoia , as the conspiratorial fantasies of supporters of Julian Assange show .
Glenn Greenwald , Glenn Beck 's namesake and mirror image on the American left , made it embarrassingly obvious in the Guardian last week that a paranoid "" leftist "" defence of an alleged rapist was the order of the day .
Greenwald argued that Assange was not a coward who dare not face his Swedish accusers but a true dissident , who was camping out in the Ecuadorean embassy because he had a genuine fear of persecution .
America "" would be able to coerce Sweden into handing him over far more easily than if he were in Britain "" , he explained .
It was a small country "" generally more susceptible to American pressure and bullying "" .
The poor man did not know that Britain has a notoriously lax extradition treaty with the United States , which the liberal - minded have condemned for almost a decade .
Nor did he blink at what must be the crankiest request for refugee status ever .
Assange is the first asylum seeker to claim persecution at three removes .
He wants to renounce his Australian citizenship and become an Ecuadorean because ( and you may have to bear with me )
the Australian government failed to help him fight an attempt by the British government to extradite to him to Sweden , whose government may , at some undefined point , extradite him to the United States â€ “ or maybe not , because there is no extradition request .
More pertinently , Greenwald and the rest of Assange 's supporters do not tell us how the Americans could prosecute the incontinent leaker .
American democracy is guilty of many crimes and corruptions .
But the First Amendment to the US constitution is the finest defence of freedom of speech yet written .
The American Civil Liberties Union thinks it would be unconstitutional for a judge to punish Assange .
The authorities can threaten the wretched Bradley Manning and hold him in solitary confinement because he was a serving soldier when he passed information to Assange .
But WikiLeaks was in effect a newspaper .
From the 1970s , when the New York Times printed the Pentagon Papers , to today 's accounts of secret prisons and the bugging of US citizens , the American courts "" have made clear that the First Amendment protects independent third parties who publish classified information "" .
Maybe the authorities could prosecute Assange for alleged links with hackers .
I do n't know â€ “ unlike Assange , I can not see the future .
But why would they bother to imprison him when he is making such a good job of discrediting himself ?
Reasonable doubt can not stay the tongues of Ken Loach , Tariq Ali , Jemima Khan , Naomi Wolf , John Pilger and their comrades .
They lament western wickedness with the reliability of professional mourners .
For them , America is a demonic empire with supernatural power and reach .
The constraints that bind ordinary nations can not contain it .
I refuse to call their conspiracy theories "" leftwing , "" and not only because most of the British liberal left behaved honourably during the WikiLeaks affair .
Hofstadter 's caution needs to be remembered too â€ “ paranoia turns everything it touches to dirt .
The professed principles of sufferers are no exception .
The American right 's hatred of immigrants makes a nonsense of its belief in free markets , which require the free movement of labour .
Its opposition to gun control makes its claims to be tough on crime equally ridiculous .
Mutatis mutandis , the leftwing defenders of Assange are equally willing to destroy their own beliefs .
Conservatives throw around the phrase "" leftwing feminist "" .
They do not understand that although most feminists are on the left , it is far from clear that all leftwingers are feminist .
If the indulgence of Islamists who believe that divine law mandates the subjugation of women did not convince you on this point , the treatment of Assange 's alleged victims ought to make you think again .
Some of Assange 's supporters say that the women have no right to put allegations of sexual abuse before a competent court .
Instead , they denounce them as "" feminazis "" in language so extreme that the women 's lawyer said his clients were "" the victims of a crime , but they are looked upon as the perpetrators "" .
I doubt that posterity will recall much that Assange said .
But it ought to remember his assertion that "" Sweden is the Saudi Arabia of feminism "" .
In one sentence , Assange encapsulated the special pleading and misogyny of a rotten "" progressive "" culture .
The left also has a taboo against naming names that , coincidentally , dates back to McCarthyism .
Yet WikiLeaks ' supporters continue to defend Assange after he published the names of dissidents opposed to every vile movement and regime from the Taliban to the Belarusian KGB .
Secret police forces and punishment squads across the world now have evidence they can use to imprison and torture .
Activists , who claim they are the enemies of patriarchy , dismiss allegations of sexual abuse as a CIA conspiracy .
Comfortable and ignorant men and women , who claim to be on the side of the "" resistance "" in its struggles against hegemonic power , grass up real resisters against authentic dictatorship .
In 1964 , Hofstadter noted the tendency for the paranoid to emulate the enemy they claim to oppose .
His words read as well today : "" It is hard to resist the conclusion that this enemy is on many counts the projection of the self ; both the ideal and the unacceptable aspects of the self are attributed to him . """
2012-06-25,"Cyril Tuschi , the director of an acclaimed documentary about imprisoned Russian oligarch Mikhail Khodorkovsky , is to make a fictional film imagining a trio of romantic assignations involving Julian Assange .
Alongside British screenwriter Michael Gaster , whose credits include the 2010 short Underdogs , Tuschi is working on an English - language script entitled Leaks â€ “ Three Dates With Harry Harrison .
Co - producer Jan KrÃ¼ger told Screen International : "" Cyril came up with the fact that Assange had been involved in internet dating using the screen name of Harry Harrison .
So , the film recounts three dates with Harry Harrison taking place in 2010 .
One date is in Iceland when he was establishing a organisation that would change journalism , democracy and the internet .
Then we jump to the second date with a fan in Sweden where he is the man of the moment and feted like a popstar â€ ¦
Finally , there is an internet date in a manor house in London , with ' Harrison ' all by himself wearing an electronic tag , third date being with a woman journalist who reflects on where he has ended up .
The film will chart the rise and fall of someone who pits themselves against authority , a Robin Hood of the digital age who stumbles over his own personality .
"" The film is set to start shooting next summer , largely in Germany .
Schloss Beesenstedt will stand in for Ellingham Hall , the Norfolk estate in which Assange took refuge .
No casting decisions have yet been taken ."
2012-06-26,"Dear President Correa , We are writing to urge you to grant political asylum to Julian Assange .
As you know , British courts recently struck down Mr Assange 's appeal against extradition to Sweden , where he is not wanted on criminal charges , but merely for questioning .
Mr Assange has repeatedly made clear he is willing to answer questions relating to accusations against him , but in the United Kingdom .
But the Swedish government insists that he be brought to Sweden for questioning .
This by itself , as Swedish legal expert and former Chief District Prosecutor for Stockholm
Sven - Erik Alhem testified , is "" unreasonable and unprofessional , as well as unfair and disproportionate "" .
We believe Mr Assange has good reason to fear extradition to Sweden , as there is a strong likelihood that once in Sweden , he would be imprisoned , and then likely extradited to the United States .
As US legal expert and commentator Glenn Greenwald recently noted , were Assange to be charged in Sweden , he would be imprisoned under "" very oppressive conditions , where he could be held incommunicado "" , rather than released on bail .
Pre - trial hearings for such a case in Sweden are held in secret , and so the media and wider public , Greenwald notes , would not know how the judicial decisions against Mr Assange would be made and what information would be considered .
The Washington Post has reported that the US Justice Department and Pentagon conducted a criminal investigation into "" whether WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange violated criminal laws in the group 's release of government documents , including possible charges under the Espionage Act "" .
Many fear , based on documents released by WikiLeaks , that the US government has already prepared an indictment and is waiting for the opportunity to extradite Assange from Sweden .
The US Justice Department has compelled other members of WikiLeaks to testify before a grand jury in order to determine what charges might be brought against Mr Assange .
The US government has made clear its open hostility to WikiLeaks , with high - level officials even referring to Mr Assange as a "" high - tech terrorist "" , and seeking access to the Twitter account of Icelandic legislator Birgitta JÃ³nsdÃ³ttir due to her past ties to WikiLeaks .
Were he charged , and found guilty under the Espionage Act , Assange could face the death penalty .
Prior to that , the case of Pfc Bradley Manning , the USsoldier accused of providing US government documents to WikiLeaks , provides an illustration of the treatment that Assange might expect while in custody .
Manning has been subjected to repeated and prolonged solitary confinement , harassment by guards , and humiliating treatment such as being forced to strip naked and stand at attention outside his cell .
These are additional reasons that your government should grant Mr Assange political asylum .
We also call on you to grant Mr Assange political asylum because the "" crime "" that he has committed is that of practicing journalism .
He has revealed important crimes against humanity committed by the US government , most notably in releasing video footage from an Apache helicopter of a 2007 incident in which the US military appears to have deliberately killed civilians , including two Reuters employees .
WikiLeaks ' release of thousands of US State Department cables revealed important cases of US officials acting to undermine democracy and human rights around the world .
Because this is a clear case of an attack on press freedom and on the public 's right to know important truths about US foreign policy , and because the threat to his health and well - being is serious , we urge you to grant Mr Assange political asylum .
Thank you for your consideration of our request .

2012-06-28,"WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange has been served with a police letter saying he has to present himself to a London police station on Friday , according to sources .
Assange has been seeking political asylum inside Ecuador 's embassy in London since last week as he tries to avoid extradition to Sweden , where he is wanted for questioning about alleged sex offences .
A spokesman for the Metropolitan police service said : "" The MPS have this morning , Thursday 28 June , served a surrender notice upon a 40-year - old man that requires him to attend a police station at a date and time of our choosing .
This is standard practice in extradition cases and is the first step in the removal process . ""
He said Assange remained in breach of his bail conditions , adding : "" Failing to surrender would be a further breach of conditions and he is liable to arrest .
"" It is understood Assange has been ordered to present himself at Belgravia police station at 11.30am on Friday .
On Sunday , Ecuador 's ambassador to the UK left London to return home for talks on Assange 's application for asylum .
Ecuador says Assange is under the country 's protection while it considers the application .
Assange , 40 , faces arrest for breaching the terms of his bail if he leaves the embassy .
The Foreign Office confirmed in a statement that the Australian was "" beyond the reach of the police "" while he remained in the building .
Assange was set to be extradited to Sweden , where he faces accusations of raping a woman and sexually molesting and coercing another in Stockholm in August 2010 while on a visit to give a lecture .
Assange , whose WikiLeaks website published a mass of leaked diplomatic cables that embarrassed governments and international businesses , denies all allegations , saying the sex was consensual and the allegations against him are politically motivated .
Earlier this week , a letter signed by leading US figures in support of Assange 's application for political asylum in Ecuador was delivered to the country 's London embassy .
Among its signatories were Michael Moore , Oliver Stone , Noam Chomsky and Danny Glover .

Robert Naiman , policy director at the Just Foreign Policy campaign group , delivered the letter to the embassy on Monday , along with a petition signed by more than 4,000 Americans urging President Rafael Correa to approve Assange 's request for asylum .
The letter , which has been posted online , states that its signatories believe Assange has good reason to fear extradition from the UK to Sweden , "" as there is a strong likelihood that once in Sweden , he would be imprisoned , and then likely extradited to the United States "" .

â€¢ This article was amended on 29 June 2012 to make clear that Julian Assange has not had charges brought against him in Sweden ."
2012-06-29,"Julian Assange , the founder of the WikiLeaks website , remains at the Ecuadorean embassy in London after failing to present himself at a police station to begin the process of extradition to Sweden over allegations of rape and indecency .
Assange , who said he would remain at the embassy because he feared the US had secret plans to extradite him to Washington , remains in breach of his bail conditions , and by failing to report to a police station he is now liable for arrest .
He had been ordered to present himself at Belgravia police station at 11.30am on Friday .
A spokesman for the Metropolitan police confirmed that he had not appeared .
In a telephone interview on BBC2 's Newsnight , Assange said he had been advised that he was within his rights to ignore an extradition notice presented to him at the Ecuadorean embassy on Thursday .
Asked if he intended to give himself up , he said : "" Our advice is that asylum law both domestically and internationally in the UK takes precedence to extradition law , so the answer is almost certainly not . ""
He said he had evidence that the US had secret plans to force him to face trial in America . ""
In the US , since at least the beginning of 2011 , a US grand jury has been empanelled in Washington .
It has been pulling in witnesses , forced testimony from those witnesses , subpoenaed records from Google , from Twitter , "" he said .
He gave the BBC a list of American politicians and talkshow hosts calling for his death as evidence of the prejudice against him .
When asked if he had anything to say to the women who have accused him of rape and indecency , he replied : "" I am simply not charged .
That 's all .
That 's all that is important in this matter .
What has been said to date is sufficient . ""
Before the Newsnight interview , a police spokesman said : "" The Metropolitan police have this morning , Thursday 28 June , served a surrender notice upon a 40-year - old man that requires him to attend a police station at a date and time of our choosing .
This is standard practice in extradition cases and is the first step in the removal process . ""
He said Assange remained in breach of his bail conditions .
"" Failing to surrender would be a further breach of conditions and he is liable to arrest . ""
Assange will continue to take refuge in the embassy , where he sought asylum last week after British courts upheld Sweden 's right to request his extradition to answer the accusations made by two women he met while on a trip to Sweden .
He faces accusations of raping a woman and sexually molesting and coercing another into sex in Stockholm in August 2010 , while on a visit to give a lecture .
Assange left Sweden before he could be questioned by police and has said all allegations against him are politically motivated .
Assange is likely to face a long stay at the embassy while the Ecuadorean government decides whether to accept his request for asylum as he will be unable to leave without being arrested .
Assange 's supporters see the extradition as a cover for a subsequent extradition to the US to face charges over the release of diplomatic cables by WikiLeaks .
A succession of British courts have found that Sweden has followed the correct procedure in issuing a European arrest warrant for Assange and ruled that Britain must comply with it .
This week , a letter signed by leading US figures in support of Assange 's application for political asylum in Ecuador was delivered to the embassy .
Among its signatories were film - makers Michael Moore and Oliver Stone , actor Danny Glover , authors Naomi Wolf and Noam Chomsky , comedian Bill Maher , and Daniel Ellsberg , the former US military analyst turned whistleblower , who leaked the Pentagon Papers in 1971 .
Robert Naiman , policy director at the Just Foreign Policy campaign group , delivered the letter to the embassy on Monday , along with a petition signed by more than 4,000 Americans urging Ecuador 's president , Rafael Correa , to approve Assange 's request for asylum .

2012-06-29,"The diplomatic standoff over Julian Assange is to lengthen after he refused to co - operate with a police request to surrender himself to a central London police station .
Unable to leave the Ecuadorean embassy for fear of being arrested and deported , the WikiLeaks founder had a statement read out on his behalf by a supporter outside the building in Knightsbridge , central London .
Assange is wanted for questioning by the Swedish authorities in connection with accusations of sexual assault and rape in Stockholm in 2010 .
He fears that once there he would be extradited to the US in connection with his organisation 's publication of leaked US diplomatic cables .
Susan Benn , of the Julian Assange Defence Fund , said the 40-year - old was in "" good spirits "" and would remain in Ecuador 's embassy while evidence for his application for his political asylum was processed .
He has been there for more than a week .
Assange , an Australian citizen , had been served with a letter from the Metropolitan police requesting that he surrender himself to Belgravia police station at 11.30am on Friday .
The statement read out by Benn said Assange had been advised that he should decline to comply with the police request , adding : "" This should not be considered any sign of disrespect .
Under both international and domestic UK law , asylum assessments take priority over extradition claims .
"" The issues faced by Mr Assange are serious .
His life and liberty and the life and liberty of his organisation and those associated with it are at stake .
"" The US government has instigated a grand jury against Julian Assange and other founders or managers of WikiLeaks . ""
There is irrefutable evidence in the public record of subpoenas being issued and witnesses being compelled to testify against Mr Assange .
US officials have said in open court that the FBI file about the investigation has now reached 42,135 pages .
"" It is only a matter of time before US authorities begin extradition proceedings against Julian and other leading members of WikiLeaks on various charges including conspiracy to commit espionage . ""
It is clear that there is a legal process in place which will result in taking Julian to the US , which if allowed to succeed would violate his basic rights . ""
Although it is normal procedure , Swedish authorities have refused , without reason , to make the three hour trip to London and to interview Julian causing him to be trapped in the UK under virtual house arrest for 561 days and an additional 10 days in solitary confinement â€ “ all without charge .
Instead they have issued an Interpol red notice and extradition requests .
"" The Swedish executive publicly announced on 14 June that it would detain Mr Assange in prison without charge .
Once in Sweden under such grave restrictions it would be impossible for Mr Assange to exercise his asylum rights . ""
Mr Assange did not feel safe from US extradition in the UK .
We are all too aware of the abuses of the US - UK extradition treaty .
Although Mr Assange has been trapped in the UK , under dangerous circumstances , he at least has had the freedom to apply for political asylum .
"" Julian will remain in the embassy under the protection of the Ecuadorean government while evidence for his application is being assembled and processed . ""
Assange maintains the sexual relations in Stockholm were consensual and that the allegations against him are politically motivated .
He was on bail of Â£240,000 .
The UK supreme court upheld a ruling that his extradition to Sweden was legal ."
2012-06-30,
2012-07-02,"The Julian Assange case has sparked international criticism of the Swedish legal system .
Many Swedish citizens view this criticism as an attack on their country , and rally to the defence of their legal system .
But it is about time that someone with experience of Swedish procedural law tells it like it is : Sweden routinely imposes severe restrictions on suspects held on remand .
Pre - trial , suspects are often held in detention , or even in isolation .
This treatment is unnecessary and humiliating and thwarts the defendant 's ability to prepare their case .
Detaining and isolating a suspect is appropriate where the crime is sufficiently grave and the indication of guilt clear .
Treating Anders Breivik in this way is the right thing to do , for instance .
The allegations against Assange , in contrast , are not nearly so serious , but a case of "" he said , she said "" .
Let us also not forget that Assange has not been charged with any crime , and that the allegations against him were at first dismissed by a Swedish prosecutor .
In August 2010 , Assange was interviewed by the police for the first time , then released .
A month later , the prosecutor requested an additional police interrogation be held , insisting this time that it be done with Assange behind bars .
She called for Assange 's arrest , issued a European arrest warrant and ordered that he be deported from the UK .
Stockholm district court and the Svea court of appeal upheld her request and arrested Assange in absentia .
Neither Assange nor I can understand the motivation .
Why could n't the second police interview be conducted with Assange at liberty ?
Assange is not a Swedish citizen .
He does not reside in Sweden .
His work has worldwide impact and he must be able to travel freely to accomplish this .
He would happily have presented himself for interrogation and , had the case gone to trial , willingly returned to Sweden to face charges .
All this could have been done while he remained at liberty .
Had Sweden handled the case in this way , the issue would have been resolved a long time ago .
Instead , Sweden insists on Assange 's forcible removal to Sweden .
Once there , he will immediately be seized by police and put in jail .
He will be taken to the detention hearing in handcuffs , and will almost certainly be detained .
He will remain in custody for the duration of the proceedings .
This is unnecessary .
The prosecutor is at liberty to withdraw the arrest warrant and lift the detention order , and a hearing in Sweden could be arranged very quickly .
The prosecutor could also arrange a hearing in the UK or at the Swedish embassy in London .
This treatment is degrading .
No one should be treated as guilty until proven innocent .
There has been no trial , let alone conviction .
Assange has not even been charged with any crime .
And the situation makes it difficult for him to prepare his defence .
If a defendant is placed in isolation they are allowed contact only with their defence lawyer .
The prosecutor and complainants , however , can confer at length with witnesses and work out their strategies .
Is there any acceptable reason why one of the parties be deprived of that opportunity ?
Sweden has been criticised for its overuse of detention and isolation â€ “ and not only by Assange and his supporters .
The UN committee against torture in 2008 strongly criticised conditions in Sweden 's remand prisons , and Swedish courts , for the fact that prison restrictions , such as isolation , are imposed on 42 % of detained suspects .
The chief prosecutor has said that Assange will not be held in isolation .
However , even without that being imposed , prison restrictions have become much harsher and more widespread in recent years .
In reality the rules in the remand prisons make it impossible for a suspect to have proper contact with the outside world : there are not enough landline telephones , mobile phones are banned , letters are often censored , and to meet people you have to fill in application forms that can take weeks to process .
The treatment that the Swedish legal system has inflicted , and would be likely to inflict on Assange would mark him out as guilty and prevent him from preparing a proper defence and , for that reason , having a fair trial ."
2012-07-09,"There comes a point during many a serious argument where the wisest thing to do is walk away .
It 's a truth recognised by everyone but carried out by almost no one .
It 's also a principle which probably should have been invoked by a huge number of people involved in the interminable arguments around the rights and wrongs of WikiLeaks , Julian Assange and the mainstream media .
The subjects involved are serious : transparency , extradition , fair justice , international law .
But the debates themselves are trivial : after 18 months of wrangling in blogs , on social media , and at times in print , only a small rump remain â€ “ and their minds are made up .
The neutrals moved on long ago .
All that remains is sound and fury â€ “ shouting across the barricades .
And when you step back , it looks ridiculous .
It took both the mainstream media and WikiLeaks to publish the string of revelations that came out through 2010 : teams of experienced journalists pored through the Afghanistan and Iraq war logs .
Newsrooms did extensive , systematic analysis â€ “ at one point the Bureau of Investigative Journalism alone had about 20 staff working six or seven day weeks to get as much as possible from the documents .
Crews and reporters were sent to the affected countries .
Expert reporters were brought to bear , and editors received dire warnings of the potential legal consequences on themselves and their publications for their planned actions .
Similarly , though , WikiLeaks played a vital role
â€ “ not least as the holder of the information .
But a coalition of publishers was not important just for impact
â€ “
it mattered to make any attempts to injunct or otherwise restrict publication ineffective .
All this makes subsequent mudslinging â€ “ based on far more than personality clashes , despite this characterisation â€ “ more ridiculous still .
The reasons for disagreement were serious .
When people 's views were n't set , the arguments were worth having .
But by now , this is almost certainly no longer the case .
To work at its best , WikiLeaks needs the mainstream media , and the mainstream media can benefit from organisations like WikiLeaks : uncensorable publishers of last resort .
On the important issues , WikiLeaks and the publishing organisations it worked with are in agreement : the co - ordinated ( and partially redacted ) release of material from the Afghan war logs to Guantanamo files was important , and in the public interest â€ “ and the editors of most ( if not all ) of the mainstream organisations , including the Guardian , have said they would vigorously oppose the prosecutions of anyone , including Julian Assange , for those actions .
From the perspective of someone who worked on such releases from both sides of the divide , seeing some of the journalists who worked long and hard to get stories out of the material denigrated was at first aggravating .
After 18 months , it 's just sad .
As far as Assange is concerned , people 's minds are made up , and almost no one is likely to shift from what they think right now .
Repeating the arguments benefits only those who wish to see the whole cause WikiLeaks has come to symbolise fade away .
A better idea , then , is to draw a line and move the discussions on â€ “ and there are important conversations to have .
One of these is how best to protect whistleblowers .
The act of submission to WikiLeaks , a similar site , or even a journalist is but one link in a long chain .
A whistleblower 's own work and home computer will leave traces , as might his or her behaviour , as might social or legal pressures .
Secure submission alone â€ “ and even this has been non - existent for almost two years â€ “ does n't come close to solving these issues .
There is undoubtedly more that can be done .
Another is looking at how to beat actions like WikiLeaks ' banking blockade
â€ “ the refusal by Visa , Mastercard and others to process payments to WikiLeaks â€
“ and how to prevent repeats of such extrajudicial ( and potentially politically motivated ) actions .
What happened to WikiLeaks could conceivably happen to other activist , and even publishing , organisations .
A third is how to make organisations like WikiLeaks more transparent and more accountable , while protecting their staff .
There 's no doubt the operational arm of anything like WikiLeaks will need a good degree of secrecy and anonymity .
But there 's also a danger in calling for governments and others who can use the same excuse to open up while refusing to do so yourself .
One solution may be high - profile trustees , or similar , with the power to investigate the operational / editorial side , but who have no advance knowledge of its actions : they could hold an editor accountable , endorsing or criticising his actions , calling for improvement ( or even in extremis remove him ) , without becoming legally responsible for publication .
Given control of the purse strings too , this would add transparency and accountability without clipping a whistleblowing site 's wings .
These are just three of the debates we could , and should be having around WikiLeaks , whistleblowing and the new media ecosystem .
Do n't they seem more important â€ “ and more fruitful â€ “ than another round of the soap opera ?
A final question : which debate do you think governments or corporations with something to hide would rather we were having ?

2012-07-12,"WikiLeaks has claimed a "" significant victory "" in its struggle with the US government to allow people to make donations to it through the Visa payment scheme , after an Icelandic court ruled that a payment processor there had broken contract laws by blocking credit card donations to Julian Assange 's whistleblowing site .
But Visa International said that the ruling , against a Reykjavik - based company called Valitor â€ “ formerly
Visa Iceland â€
“ might not have any broader application and may not change the current position , in which payments can not be made to WikiLeaks using Visa cards and other US - owned credit cards .
That has choked off the vast majority of donations to WikiLeaks , which said it had lost about $ 20 m in funding as a result .
US financial institutions including Visa , Bank of America , Mastercard , PayPal and Western Union , stopped accepting or handling payments intended for WikiLeaks in December 2010 , after the site began leaking US diplomatic cables from a cache of nearly 250,000 it had acquired .
MasterCard and Visa both said at the time that they were cutting the links because WikiLeaks was "" engaging in or facilititating "" illegal activity .
A PayPal vice - president said that he had come under pressure from the US state department to cut payment links with the site .
Until Visa cut its links , the only way to pay a donation was via a web page hosted by Iceland - based Datacell , which acted as WikiLeaks 's payment processor .
Attorney Sveinn Andri Sveinsson told Reuters that an Icelandic court has ordered Valitor to resume processing donations to WikiLeaks within two weeks or face Kr800,000 ( about Â£3,000 ) in daily fines .
Assange said in a statement : "" This is a significant victory against Washington 's attempt to silence WikiLeaks .
We will not be silenced .
Economic censorship is censorship .
It is wrong .
When it 's done outside of the rule of law its doubly wrong .
One by one those involved in the attempted censorship of WikiLeaks will find themselves on the wrong side of history . ""
Sveinsson claims that Thursday 's judgment means credit card donations could soon be flowing to DataCell .
The court ruled that Valitor had broken its contract by refusing to pass donations to WikiLeaks .
But even if Valitor does resume passing payments to WikiLeaks accounts in Iceland , it is not clear that it would have any to process .
The Visa and Mastercard system works in a "" four - party "" model , where the customer holding a credit card effectively has a contract with an "" issuing bank "" .
At the receiving end is the "" accepting bank "" â€ “ in this case Valitor â€ “ and its "" merchant "" ( here , WikiLeaks ) .
Visa and Mastercard effect the transfer of funds between the issuing bank and the accepting bank .
While the court may have restored the tie between Valitor and WikiLeaks , it is unclear whether that means that Visa is obliged to pass on money transferred to an issuing bank from a cardholder .
WikiLeaks says that the European Commission is conducting an investigation into what it calls the "" banking blockade "" imposed by the US financial organisations .
It filed a complaint in July 2011 with the competition arm of the EC , saying that Visa and MasterCard had breached antitrust provisions .
In October 2011 , Assange said that the site needed $ 3.5 m over the next year in order to continue operating because of the restrictions on funding , and that he expected the EC to decide on whether to carry out a full antitrust investigation into Visa and MasterCard by mid - November .
On Thursday , he said he expected an EC decision on whether to carry out the investigation "" before the end of August "" ."
2012-07-21,"Julian Assange , the founder of WikiLeaks , remains trapped in the Ecuadorean embassy in London since 19 June , as he awaits the government of Ecuador 's decision on whether to grant him political asylum .
It is interesting , if rather aggravating , to see how people who are supposed to be concerned with human rights and freedom of expression have reacted to this story .
Although Assange has not been charged with any crime , the Swedish government has requested his extradition to Sweden for questioning .
For more than 19 months now , the Swedish government has refused to explain why he could not be questioned in the UK .
Former Stockholm chief district prosecutor Sven - Erik Alhem testified that the decision of the Swedish government to extradite Assange is "" unreasonable and unprofessional , as well as unfair and disproportionate "" , because he can be easily questioned in the UK .
Of course , it 's not hard to figure out why Assange 's enemies want him in Sweden : he would be thrown in jail and would have limited access to the media , and judicial proceedings would be conducted in secret .
But most importantly , it would be much easier to get him extradited to the United States .
Here in the US , there is an ongoing criminal investigation of WikiLeaks ; and according to leaked emails from the private intelligence agency Stratfor , a criminal indictment for Assange has already been prepared .
Powerful political figures such as Dianne Feinstein , Democratic chair of the US Senate intelligence committee , have called for his prosecution under the Espionage Act , which carries the death penalty .
For these reasons and many more , it is quite likely that the government of Ecuador will decide that Assange has a well - founded fear of political persecution , and grant him political asylum .
Yet , surprisingly and shamefully , organizations whose profession it is to defend human rights and press freedoms have not only remained silent on the question of Assange 's right to asylum , or Sweden 's political persecution of a journalist , but have , instead , attacked Ecuador .
For example , JosÃ © Miguel Vivanco , director the Americas Watch division of Human Rights Watch ( HRW ) , has stated : "" I think this is ironic that you have a journalist , or an activist , seeking political asylum from a government that has â€ “ after Cuba â€ “ the poorest record of free speech in the region , and the practice of persecuting local journalists when the government is upset by their opinions or their research . ""
Much of the media ran with this , perhaps not knowing a great deal about the media in Ecuador , and not realizing that any of the other independent democracies in South America would also grant asylum to Assange .
When Assange was first arrested in 2010 , then President Lula da Silva of Brazil denounced the arrest as "" an attack on freedom of expression "" .
And he criticized other governments for not defending Assange .
If it was clear to Lula and other independent governments that Assange was politically persecuted then , it is even more obvious now .
The problem is that Sweden does not have an independent foreign policy from the United States , which is why the Swedish government wo n't accept Assange 's offer to come to Sweden if they would promise not to extradite him to the US .
Sweden collaborated with the US in turning over two Egyptians to the CIA 's "" rendition "" program , by which they were taken to Egypt and tortured .
The UN found Sweden to have violated the global ban on torture for its role in this crime .
One would expect better from a human rights organization that is supposed to be independent of any government 's political agenda .
But Vivanco 's attack on Ecuador is inexcusable .
As anyone who is familiar with the Ecuadoran media knows , it is uncensored and more oppositional with respect to the government than the US media is .
The Committee to Protect Journalists ( CPJ ) has mounted a similar political campaign against Ecuador , falsely charging : "" Correa 's administration has led Ecuador into an era of widespread repression by systematically filing defamation lawsuits and smearing critics .
"" What HRW and CPJ are doing is taking advantage of the fact that few people outside of Ecuador have any idea what goes on there .
They then seize upon certain events to convey a completely false impression of the state of press freedom there .
To offer an analogy , it so happens that France and Germany have laws that make it a crime , punishable by fines and imprisonment , to lie about the Holocaust , and have recently prosecuted people under these laws .
Personally , I agree with a number of scholars who see these laws as an infringement on freedom of expression and believe they should be repealed .
But I would not try to pretend that the people who have been prosecuted under these laws â€ “ like the extreme rightwing leader Jean - Marie Le Pen of France â€ “ are themselves champions of free speech .
Nor would I try to create the impression that such laws , or their enforcement , are part of a generalized "" crackdown "" on political opposition ; or that France and Germany are countries where the freedom of expression is under attack from the government .
If I were stupid enough to do so , nobody would believe me â€ “ because France and Germany are big , rich countries that are much better known to the world than Ecuador .
Let 's look at one of the major cases that groups like Americas Watch and CPJ have complained most about .
Last February , the nation 's highest court upheld a criminal libel conviction against the daily El Universo , with three directors and an opinion editor sentenced to three years in prison , and $ 40 m in damages .
President Correa announced a pardon for the convictions 13 days later â€ “ so no one was punished .
As noted above , I am against criminal libel laws and would agree with criticism advocating the repeal of such laws .
But to say that this case represents a "" crackdown "" on freedom of expression is more than an exaggeration .
These people were convicted of libel because they told very big lies in print , falsely accusing Correa of crimes against humanity .
Under Ecuadorian law , he can â€ “ like any other citizen â€ “ sue them for libel , and the court can and did find them guilty .
Just as Le Pen in France was found guilty of having "" denied a crime against humanity and was complicit in justifying war crimes . ''
Groups like Americas Watch and CPJ are seriously misrepresenting what is going on in Ecuador .
Rather than being a heroic battle for freedom of expression against a government that is trying to "" silence critics "" , it is a struggle between two political actors .
One political actor is the major media , whose unelected owners and their allies use their control of information to advance the interests of the wealth and power that used to rule the country ; on the other side is a democratic government that is seeking to carry out its reform program , for which it was elected .
In this context , it is difficult to take seriously these groups ' complaints that President Correa 's public criticism of the media is a human rights violation .
While I would not defend all of the government 's actions in its battle against a hostile , politicized media , I think human rights organizations that grossly exaggerate and misrepresent what is going on in Ecuador undermine their own credibility â€ “ even if they can get away with it in the mainstream US media .
It is equally disturbing that they can not find the courage â€ “ as more independent human rights defenders , such as the Center for Constitutional Rights , have done â€ “ to defend a journalist who is currently being persecuted by the government of the United States and its allies ."
2012-07-24,"Julian Assange , the man Guardian editor Alan Rusbridger once described as "" a compelling character who goes beyond what any Hollywood scriptwriter would dare to invent "" , may be played by Jeremy Renner in DreamWorks ' planned movie version about the inside story of WikiLeaks .
Renner , who is gearing up for the release of The Bourne Legacy â€ “ the latest instalment in the spy franchise made famous by Matt Damon â€ “ is "" looking hard "" at playing the outspoken activist , according to the Deadline blog .
Bill Condon , the man behind Twilight Saga :
Breaking Dawn parts one and two , is rumoured to be lined up as director .
DreamWorks ' WikiLeaks movie will span the events covered by Guardian journalists David Leigh and Luke Harding 's book , WikiLeaks :
Inside Julian Assange 's War on Secrecy , as well as Daniel Domscheit - Berg 's exposÃ © Inside WikiLeaks :
My Time with Julian Assange at the World 's Most Dangerous Website .
Both books were optioned by the studio last year .
Assange , who lost the last of his appeals against extradition to Sweden to face sex crime accusations last month , has requested political asylum at the Ecuadorian embassy in London .
His lawyer has argued that his client would not receive a fair trial if forced to return to Sweden .
The WikiLeaks film is thought to be pitched somewhere between The Social Network and All the President 's Men , and is one of a number of mooted projects about Assange doing the rounds .
Others include a TV movie , in which Anthony LaPaglia plays a cop tracking the young Assange as he embarks on his early career as a hacker in Melbourne , and a fictional account of the activist 's adventures in internet dating , by Khodorkovsky director Cyril Tuschi ."
2012-07-25,"The celebrated and controversial Spanish human rights investigator Baltasar GarzÃ³n is to lead the defence of WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange as he fights extradition from Britain to Sweden where he is wanted for questioning over rape allegations .
GarzÃ³n , who was disbarred as a judge in Spain in February , said he would lend Assange the weight of his knowledge of international human rights and extradition law in a case that he denounced as "" arbitrary and baseless "" .
He travelled to London to meet Assange , who has been taking refuge in the Ecuadorean embassy since 19 June .
GarzÃ³n , who was the investigating magistrate when the former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet was arrested in London on an extradition warrant to face genocide charges in Spain , said he believed Assange was the victim of obscure international political manoeuvring .
"" There is clear political intentionality behind this affair , which explains his current situation , "" added GarzÃ³n on Wednesday .
"" Obviously this is not just about his future but his physical and psychological stability
and It is only right that Assange should be protected by the same rights as those of any other citizen . ""
"" Assange has not rebelled against any jurisdiction , given that he respects the action of the law , but he â€ “ and we â€ “ are seriously worried about what will happen to him because his situation is becoming political as a result of the great work done by his organisation when it comes to denouncing corruption , "" he added .
"" That can not be the reason for a judicial process that appears , and which I believe we can show , is arbitrary and totally baseless , "" he stated , according to the Cadena SER radio station .
"" It does not seem right that a single person should be under such pressure from governments , "" referring to both Sweden and Britain . ""
I believe that Assange â€ ¦ is in a situation that is an attack on his human rights . ""
A statement posted on the Support Julian Assange website http://www.support-julian-assange.com/tag/baltasar-garzon in the names of both GarzÃ³n and Assange confirmed the news . ""
The Spanish judge , lawyer , and international jurist , Baltasar GarzÃ³n , will lead the legal team representing Julian Assange and WikiLeaks , "" it said .
The two men had discussed a new legal strategy to defend Assange and WikiLeaks from "" the existing abuse of process "" .
Its aim included showing "" how the secret US processes against Julian Assange and WikiLeaks have compromised and contaminated other legal processes , including the extradition process . ""
"" The judge has expressed serious concerns regarding the lack of safeguards and transparency with which actions are being taken against Julian Assange , and the harassment he is being subjected to which has irreparable effects on his physical and mental wellbeing , "" the statement added .
"" The threats against his person are further aggravated by the complicit behaviour of the Swedish and UK governments , who are wrongfully abrogating his rights . ""
GarzÃ³n 's career as an investigating magistrate in Madrid in effect came to an end five months ago when the supreme court disbarred him for wiretapping conversations between defence lawyers and their clients in a corruption investigation involving the Spanish prime minister Mariano Rajoy 's People 's party .
He was given an 11-year suspension as supporters claimed he was the victim of a conspiracy to bring down one of the world 's best - known human rights investigators , who had successfully pursued henchmen working for Argentina 's military juntas ."
2012-07-26,"The Ecuadorean government is seeking to avert the "" evil "" of the extradition of Julian Assange to the US , according to a senior legal adviser to the country 's embassy in London , where the WikiLeaks founder has sought sanctuary with a view to claiming asylum .
Diplomats for the small Latin American country said they had been seeking assurances from the UK that Assange would not be extradited to the US after the completion of legal proceedings in Sweden , where he is wanted for questioning over allegations of sexual assault .
Lawyers for Assange , who has been living in the Ecuadorean embassy for five weeks , believe there are secret plans to extradite him to the US to face trial , possibly for conspiracy to commit espionage .
If found guilty , the 40-year - old could face life imprisonment .
Two officials at the Ecuadorean embassy said it had been seeking assurances from both the UK and Sweden that Assange would not be eventually sent to the US , but had received no answer .
They said Ecuador would now formally ask the US if there were any legal proceedings against Assange or "" an investigation which has identified him as a target and which may result in a later extradition request "" .
The senior legal adviser said : "" In legal terms â€ ¦ the evil that Ecuador wishes to prevent is the extradition [ of Assange ] to the US .
Now if there are ways and means of that being tied down , I think that would be a just solution . ""
Assange first sought refuge in the Ecuadorean embassy , citing the UN declaration on human rights , on 19 June .
Ever since , he has been living in the ground - floor embassy in a small , square room , which friends who have recently visited estimate is around 15 ft wide .
The embassy , near the Harrods department store in Knightsbridge , has no courtyard , so Assange has been given exercise equipment .
But he remains confined to the small room and adjoining corridor , with a window that barely opens .
Meanwhile , diplomats at the embassy have spent recent weeks seeking to negotiate a solution to the legal impasse .
Assange remains on bail after losing his last supreme court appeal against extradition to Sweden , where he is wanted for questioning in connection with accusations of sexual assault and rape in Stockholm in 2010 .
If he leaves the premises , he is liable to immediate arrest by the Metropolitan police , which has stationed two officers outside the building .
A political adviser to the Ecuadorean government said Assange 's asylum claim had presented the country with "" an absolutely extraordinary case "" that placed it at the centre of a global controversy involving four other countries : the UK , Sweden , the US and Australia , where Assange was born and remains a citizen .
Ecuador was seeking to be an "" honest broker "" , he said , while meeting its international obligations .
He said that on Wednesday , Ecuador formally offered the Swedish prosecutor the opportunity to interview Assange inside the London embassy .
Sweden had not responded to the proposal .
Most of the discussions have focused on seeking to establish whether , once Swedish legal proceedings against Assange are resolved , there will be any attempts to extradite him to the US .
He said Ecuador was "" deeply concerned "" at the prospect of Assange 's extradition to a country which has the death penalty . ""
Ecuador has also raised the point â€ “ and is very much concerned about â€ “ life sentence , "" he said .
"" According to our law , life sentence may be equally inhumane , in the sense that any person that has no prospect of leaving confinement is , in fact , as we see it , condemned to a death sentence [ for ] life .
For us , that is equally inhumane . ""
Assange 's US lawyer , Michael Ratner , said he was certain Assange had already either been secretly indicted by a grand jury in Washington or would face extradition with a view to prosecution .
He believed the death penalty remained a possibility .
"" I have no doubt there is a serious investigation , which has gone on , and is continuing , into Julian Assange and WikiLeaks , "" he said .
However , Ratner said it was highly unlikely the US would confirm to Ecuador or any other party that it intended to prosecute Assange .
Ever since Assange unexpectedly sought refuge at the embassy five weeks ago , diplomats have been in regular discussions with both the Swedish and UK governments .
The two officials estimated there had been more than 20 meetings â€ “ including video conferences â€ “ with the UK Foreign Office .
There had also been around 10 meetings arranged between Ecuadorean and Swedish diplomats , they said .
Diplomatic discussions were said to have been "" friendly and polite "" .
The Ecuadoreans said discussions had focused on what was likely to happen to Assange once legal proceedings in Sweden were completed .
The senior legal adviser said that under extradition law , the concept of "" specialty "" ensures an individual can only be extradited to one country â€ “ in the case of Assange , Sweden .
Once legal proceedings in that country have been completed , the individual is given a 45-day leave , during which they are free to go where they want .
Assange should , therefore , be free to travel to any other state â€ “ including the UK , Ecuador or Australia â€ “ once legal proceedings against him are completed in Sweden .
However , specialty can be waived by the country granting the initial extradition request â€ “ in this case the UK â€ “ thereby allowing an individual to be extradited to a third country .
The senior legal adviser to the Ecuadoreans said that the home secretary , Theresa May , would need to waive specialty under section 58 of the Extradition Act 2003 , before Assange could be extradited from Sweden to the US .
Despite repeated requests from Ecuador , the Foreign Office has not said whether or not May intends to exercise her powers to allow for any potential future extradition to the US . ""
The concerns that Ecuador has in relation to that whole process is that some states â€ “ not least of which the US â€ “ have been known to hold back on their extradition requests , to a timely moment , when they can serve the process with greatest impact , "" the senior legal adviser said .
"" And so the concern would be that the US has in mind a request for extradition on the basis of WikiLeaks charges . ""
The officials said they did not expect a decision to be made on Assange 's asylum claim until after the Olympics .
A spokesman for the Foreign Office said : "" Since Mr Assange first entered the Ecuadorean embassy five weeks ago , we have repeatedly made clear to the Ecuadorean government that the UK has a binding legal obligation to extradite Mr Assange to Sweden to face questioning over allegations of sexual offences .
We have been seeking a diplomatic solution and expect Ecuador to resolve this issue in accordance with its international obligations . ""
The UK courts , including the supreme court , have confirmed that Mr Assange 's extradition to Sweden complies with all the requirements of the UK 's Extradition Act , including as regards the protection of his human rights .
We have gone to great lengths to explain to Ecuador the human rights protections inherent in our law . """
2012-07-29,"WikiLeaks , the whistleblowing site set up by Julian Assange , has claimed that it was behind the fake opinion piece circulating on the internet under the name of Bill Keller , columnist and former executive editor of the New York Times .
In a tweet , WikiLeaks said : The organisation implied that it – or its "" great supporters "" , whomsoever they might be – had carried out the stunt in a bid to embarrass the Times into covering the financial blockade of WikiLeaks by US companies : Firms such as PayPal , Visa and Mastercard have refused to channel donations to WikiLeaks , saying they can not support illegal activity .
The ban has caused WikiLeaks huge financial problems .
That WikiLeaks should have masterminded the hoax – assuming the group is telling the truth – is not entirely surprising .
Assange had a falling out with the New York Times , and its then editor Bill Keller , after the paper published a profile of him that he deemed unflattering ( Disclosure : the Guardian also had a falling out with Assange , a while later . )
So there seems to be an element here of old score - settling .
The hoax circulated on Saturday night , and on Sunday morning Keller broke his normal temperate tone and tweeted all in caps to his 40,000 Twitter followers : The fake in question was a cod Keller op - ed entitled ' WikiLeaks , a Post Postscript ' .
Visually , it was immaculate – replicating perfectly the typographic style of his column down to the author 's photograph , tool kit and Times adverts .
Despite the impressive visuals , Keller himself ( the real one ) was not impressed .
He told the Guardian : "" I see this in the realm of childish prank rather than crime against humanity .
It 's a lame satire .
I 'd take it a little more seriously if it were actually funny . ""
Like the topography , the way the column is written was also constructed in such a way as to make it look , at least at first glance , as though it were genuine Keller .
In the cod article , "" Keller "" writes : "" I 've said repeatedly , in print and in a variety of public forums , that I would regard an attempt to criminalize WikiLeaks ' publication of these documents as an attack on all of us . ""
The sentence is a direct lift from an email that the real Keller sent Mathew Ingram of GigaOM .
Having hooked the reader with genuine Kellerisms , the article then goes on to portray the Times columnist in an unflattering light .
It has him say that "" journalism should work in unison with government "" and opine that had the Times had the WikiLeaks cables to itself ( rather than sharing them with the Guardian and other papers ) , he would have granted the US government the right to review all of the documents before publication . ""
My views on WikiLeaks are widely misrepresented , "" a rather tired ( real ) Keller said .
"" This falls ham - handedly in the realm of misrepresentation . ""
The fake article was distributed through Twitter using a couple of routes .
One appeared to be via Keller 's own official Twitter feed with the handle @nytkeIler .
A closer look at that feed , though , reveals that the handle @nytkeIler was subtly misspelt to confuse the reader .
The apparent two Ls in the middle were in fact spelled with a capital i and a lower case L as in @nytkeiler .
The same ruse was used to post a fake tweet under Keller 's name saying "" I am now a world expert in dressage .
Ask me anything . ""
The second route was through Keller 's genuine Twitter feed .
A reference to the fake article by @journalismfest was retweeted under Keller 's official name , suggesting that his Twitter feed may have been hacked .
Between the design , the retweeting and the plagiarism , there was enough in the fake article to fool many .
Those taken in include New York Times lead tech writer Nick Bilton , who called it an "" important piece "" in a tweet that he later deleted : Among many others who fell into the trap were Dan Gillmor , who writes an online column for the Guardian :
Those duped seemed to include the hacker group Anonymous , though it is a moot point whether or not this endorsement of the fake was innocent : Whoever carried out the hoax appears to have spent quite a while finessing it .
The fake Times domain was registered on 30 March .
The New York Times is investigating the scam to see whether its web systems had been compromised and whether there were any legal issues resulting from the copying of its domain format ."
2012-07-31,"On a rain - speckled street just behind Harrods stands a line of low metal barriers .
Tethered to their frame are numerous homemade placards supporting freedom of speech , felt - tipped tributes to democracy , and several pictures of Julian Assange .
The reason for this impressive craft display is that the building opposite is the Ecuadorian embassy â€ “ the bolthole for the past seven weeks of Wikileaks founder Assange since he sought political asylum to avoid extradition to Sweden , where he is wanted for questioning about sexual assault .
This week Assange 's mother , Christine , expressed concern for her son 's welfare . ""
He 's under a lot of stress , "" she told the Washington Post .
While she was heartened to learn that he has access to a treadmill , and that his friends "" turn the music on and encourage him to dance with them "" she was dismayed by her son 's lack of access to natural light , and expressed her intention to send him "" things like a sunlamp "" .
Poor Julian .
It ca n't be easy to be confined to one building , no matter how prestigious the postcode .
This is no slight to Ecuadorian culture
â€ “ this is , after all , the great nation that gave us sanjuanito dancing , ceviche and Christina Aguilera , but every once in a while a person might crave a little variety .
And so we decided to assemble a collection of items that Assange might be missing , and deliver them .
There is surprisingly little in the public domain that illustrates Assange 's private tastes and passions â€ “ beyond , of course , that famous OKCupid profile , in which he spoke of his desire to find a "" spirited , erotic , non - conformist "" woman with "" innate perceptiveness and spunk "" â€ “ and really there are limits to my dedication to investigative journalism .
So instead we packed our hamper with a selection of edible items not native to Ecuador â€
“ Kellogg 's cornflakes fortified with vitamin D to compensate for the lack of sunlight in Assange 's life , a jar of Vegemite ( as an antipodean , Julian was likely to spurn Marmite ) , a packet of chocolate - chip cookies , and a punnet of clementines .
Recalling that Bill Keller , editor of the New York Times , once remarked upon Assange 's questionable hygiene and the fact he wore "" filthy white socks "" we added three pairs of crisp , white sports socks and a shower gel in the "" feelgood fragrance of eucalyptus and citrus oils "" that promised to be both "" revitalizing "" and "" refreshing . ""
And for those times when Assange tires of the hurly - burly of activism , the Penguin Pocket Sudoku , and the Lonely Planet guide to Ecuador , and a copy of the Guardian .
Last but not least , a chocolate Olympic gold medal , to help him join in the fun . ""
No you ca n't see him , "" the police officer on the steps of the embassy says flatly as I stand in the rain with our magnificent hamper .
I look crestfallen . ""
But you can hand that over at the reception , "" he relents , and so I trot up the steps and through the broad glass doors , to where a second police officer and two men in grey suits stand looking faintly baffled . ""
Hallo ! ""
I say cheerfully .
"" We 've heard that Mr Assange is missing the outside world , and so we 've brought him this special hamper ! ""
The sterner of the two suits â€ “ picture an Ecuadorian Danny DeVito â€
“ looks me up and down and then frowns .
He rings a bell to a side door and while we wait for someone to answer he stares fixedly at the hamper .
Though his face suggests suspicion and perhaps derision , it may mask a secret awe at the dazzling array of socks and sudoku .
The woman who answers the door is a little more enthusiastic .
"" We will have to check this , "" she says .
She takes the hamper and assesses each item in turn â€ ” the cornflakes , the cookies , the chocolate gold medal . ""
OK , "" she nods finally .
"" We will pass it on . ""
I beam at her . ""
Thank you ! ""
I say .
"" We hope he enjoys it .
And that the socks fit . """
2012-07-31,"Julian Assange has lost another of his dwindling band of loyal supporters .
David House , one of very few people to have met both Assange and the WikiLeaks suspect Bradley Manning , has denounced the WikiLeaks founder in a blaze of excoriating tweets .
House , a computer scientist based at MIT in Cambridge , Massachusetts , launched his attack on Assange out of the blue on Tuesday morning from his twitter account @VoxVictoria : The Twitter attack from House continued with a comment that as long as WikiLeaks is controlled by Assange , the shortcomings of his leadership would "" continue to put WikiLeaks ' supporters at risk "" .
The implicit reference to Manning â€ “ the US soldier facing 22 charges as the alleged source of the massive WikiLeaks publication of state secrets
â€ “ was made explicit in House 's next tweet : House 's criticisms come two days after WikiLeaks claimed credit for a hoax article under the name former New York Times editor Bill Keller which was circulated widely on the internet .
The organisation 's involvement in the hoax drew criticism that it had undermined its credibility for a publicity stunt .
House 's decision to publicly call for Assange 's removal is significant because until now he has been assumed to be a firm supporter of the Wikileaks founder .
He took a defiant stance after he was called before a grand jury in Virginia investigating the possibility of bringing criminal charges against Assange for the WikiLeaks publication of the Iraq and Afghanistan war logs and hundreds of thousands of confidential US diplomatic cables .
Not only did House refuse to answer any questions in front of the grand jury , pleading the Fifth Amendment , he recently took the legally risky step of publishing his notes of the proceedings â€ “ a rare breach of grand jury secrecy .
House used to be one of the few people allowed to visit Bradley Manning in more than two years in military custody .
House is still regularly referred to as a "" close friend of Manning "" .
However , Manning cut him off from his small list of approved visitors several months ago , for unknown reasons , and the description is no longer appropriate .
It is true , though , that House has the distinction of being in a very select â€ “ perhaps even unique â€ “ class of having met both Manning and Assange .
Apart from his visits to Manning , he also met Assange in London on a few occasions .
These meetings took place after Manning was arrested in May 2010 .
Assange remains in sanctuary in the Ecuadorean embassy in London seeking to avoid extradition on sexual misconduct allegations to Sweden .
His inner circle of supporters and WikiLeaks staff has already withered to about five or six people .
House describes himself as an "" open - government advocate and information economics researcher with the MIT Center for Digital Business "" .
In his tweets on Tuesday House encouraged his followers to donate to the Bradley Manning defense fund and accused Assange of deviating from the core values he held for what he called "" open government whistleblowers and activists "" : House declined to comment to the Guardian .
His Twitter onslaught provoked a robust response from several people who still see Assange as a free information hero .
Typical was the tweet from Elizabeth Ferrari : "" Attacking Assange is counter - productive to the defense of all whistleblowers being persecuted by the American gov . """
2012-08-02,"As the drama unfolds over Julian Assange 's bid for political asylum in Ecuador , a troubling irony has emerged : the besieged founder of WikiLeaks is seeking refuge in this small Andean nation because he fears persecution from the United States , a nation whose laws famously grant asylum to people in precisely Assange 's situation .
Indeed , the US has demonstrated its commitment to be a safe haven for those being persecuted for their political beliefs by recognising that journalists punished for expressing political opinions in places like China meet the criteria for asylum under the US 's own laws .
The journalistic function and legacy of WikiLeaks can not be disputed .
The site has published 251,287 leaked US diplomatic cables and military documents that revealed the inner workings â€ “ warts and all â€ “ of US foreign policy .
These publications illuminated state - sponsored human rights abuses in Iraq and Afghanistan , exposed a secret war in Yemen , and revealed the Obama administration 's interference with independent efforts to prosecute Bush officials for torture and other war crimes .
So why is Assange so concerned ?
Are his fears of persecution due to his political beliefs and expression reasonable ?
There are several unambiguous signs that the US is on track to prosecute Assange for his work as a journalist .
A grand jury in Alexandria , Virginia , empanelled to investigate violations of the Espionage Act â€ “ a statute that by its very nature targets speech â€ “ has subpoenaed Twitter feeds regarding Assange and WikiLeaks .
An FBI agent , testifying at whistleblower Bradley Manning 's trial , said that "" founders , owners and managers "" of WikiLeaks are being investigated .
And then there is Assange 's 42,135-page FBI file
â€ “ a compilation of curious heft if the government is "" not interested "" in investigating its subject .
In this context , Assange 's fears of extradition to and persecution in the US , and therefore his plea for asylum , are eminently reasonable .
What 's more , Assange is rightly concerned about how he will be treated if he is extradited to the US .
One need only consider how the US treated Bradley Manning , the army private who allegedly leaked the cables to WikiLeaks to see why .
Manning spent close to a year in pre - trial solitary confinement for 23 hours a day , and then eight months under conditions designed to pressure him into providing evidence to incriminate Assange .
During this time , Manning was stripped of his clothing and made to stand nude for inspection .
Thousands of people , including scores of legal scholars and the United Nations special rapporteur on torture , have condemned Manning 's treatment as inhumane , and state that it may constitute torture .
There is no reason for Assange to expect he will be treated any better .
Most disturbingly , the US government is more concerned with investigating a journalist and publisher than the high - level government officials whose alleged war crimes and misdeeds Assange and his cohorts brought to light .
Why ?
To send a message to others who might dare to expose government misconduct , who believe that transparency , exposing abuses , and dissembling hypocrisy strengthen democracy â€ “ and who act on those beliefs .
In short , the US is intent on persecuting a crusading journalist and publisher for his political expression .
These are the circumstances under which Ecuador is considering whether it will grant Assange the asylum he is entitled to under law .
If it does , and should the UK or the US retaliate against Ecuador , that would be a violation of the law .
Granting asylum is a peaceful and humanitarian act and can not be regarded with hostility .
The US claims to lead the world in freedom of the press , freedom of speech , and the role these play as the foundations of democratic government .
These freedoms do not die when governments feel threatened or are embarrassed by the publication of information .
As Justices Stewart and White famously said , "" the only effective restraint upon executive policy and power in the areas of national defence and international affairs may lie in an enlightened citizenry â€ “ in an informed and critical public opinion which alone can here protect the values of democratic government "" .
Indeed , it is precisely those who challenge the powerful , including government , who most require the protection afforded by fundamental free speech rights .
If our current administration chooses to abandon them , it may fall to Ecuador to uphold the best of American principles .

2012-08-15,"Ecuador 's president , Rafael Correa , has agreed to grant Julian Assange asylum , officials within Ecuador 's government have said .
The WikiLeaks founder has been holed up at Ecuador 's London embassy since 19 June , when he officially requested political asylum .
"" Ecuador will grant asylum to Julian Assange , "" said an official in the Ecuadorean capital , Quito , who is familiar with the government discussions .
On Monday , Correa told state - run ECTV that he would decide this week whether to grant asylum to Assange .
Correa said a large amount of material about international law had to be examined to make a responsible , informed decision .
Ecuador 's foreign minister , Ricardo PatiÃ±o , indicated that the president would reveal his answer once the Olympic Games were over .
But it remains unclear if Assange will be allowed to leave Britain and fly to Ecuador , or the move amounts to little more than a symbolic gesture .
At the moment he faces arrest as soon as he leaves the embassy for breaching his bail conditions . ""
For Mr Assange to leave England , he should have a safe pass from the British [ government ] .
Will that be possible ?
That 's an issue we have to take into account , "" PatiÃ±o told Reuters on Tuesday .
Government sources in Quito confirmed that despite the outstanding legal issues , Correa would grant Assange asylum â€ “ a move that would annoy Britain , the US and Sweden .
They added that the offer was made to Assange several months ago , well before he sought refuge in the embassy , and following confidential negotiations with senior London embassy staff .
An official with knowledge of the discussions said the embassy had discussed Assange 's request .
The British government , however , "" discouraged the idea "" , the official said .
He described the Swedish government as "" not very collaborative "" .
The official added : "" We see Assange 's request as a humanitarian issue .
The contact between the Ecuadorean government and WikiLeaks goes back to May 2011 , when we became the first country to see the leaked US embassy cables completely declassified ...
It is clear that when Julian entered the embassy there was already some sort of deal .
We see in his work a parallel with our struggle for national sovereignty and the democratisation of international relations . ""
However , on Tuesday night after the Guardian broke the story Correa wrote on Twitter : "" Rumour of asylum for Assange is false .
There is still no decision on the subject .
I await report from [ Ecuadorian ] foreign office . ""
Assange retweeted the message .
Assange took refuge in the embassy to avoid extradition to Sweden , where he is wanted for questioning over allegations of sexual misconduct .
He is said to be living in one room of the diplomatic building , where he has an internet connection .
Ecuadorian diplomats believe Assange is at risk of being extradited from Sweden to the US , where he could face the death penalty .
Assange 's supporters claim the US has already secretly indicted him following WikiLeaks ' release in 2010 of US diplomatic cables , as well as classified Afghan and Iraq war logs .
Correa and PatiÃ±o have both said that Ecuador will take a sovereign decision regarding Assange .
They say they are seeking to protect Assange 's right to life and freedom .
On Monday the state - run newspaper El TelÃ © grafo confirmed that a decision had been made , although it did not specify what that decision was .
It said senior officials had been meeting to iron out the last legal details .
Two weeks ago Assange 's mother , Christine , paid Ecuador an official visit , following an invitation from the foreign affairs ministry .
She met with Correa and PatiÃ±o , as well as with other top politicians , including Fernando Cordero , head of Ecuador 's legislature .
Both PatiÃ±o and Ms Assange appeared visibly touched during a press conference , which had to be briefly suspended when Ms Assange started crying .
Ms Assange held several public meetings in government buildings , and in one instance she was accompanied by the head of her son 's defence team , Baltasar GarzÃ³n , the former Spanish judge who ordered the London arrest of Chile 's General Pinochet .
Other top political figures in Ecuador have been vocal about the government 's support of Assange 's bid .
"" Our comrade the president , who leads our international policy , will grant Julian Assange asylum , "" said MarÃ­a Augusta Calle , a congresswoman of the president 's party , and former head of the Sovereignty , Foreign Affairs and Latin American Integration Commission during the 2008 Constitutional Assembly , during a meeting with Ms Assange .
Over the past year and a half , Assange has remained in touch with Ecuador 's embassy in London .
In April , he interviewed President Correa for his TV show on Russia Today , the English - language channel funded by the Russian government .
The interview , which lasted 75 minutes , included a pally exchange in which Assange and Correa bonded over freedom of speech and the negative role of the US in Latin America .
At one point Correa joked : "" Are you having a lot of fun with the interview , Julian ? ""
Assange replied : "" I 'm enjoying your jokes a great deal , yes . ""
Correa has made international headlines this year for what critics have called a government crackdown on private media .
Analysts say that granting the WikiLeaks founder asylum could be a way for him to depict himself as a champion of freedom of speech ahead of the February 2013 presidential elections , in which he is expected to run again ."
2012-08-15,"Julian Assange is headed to Ecuador , having been awarded asylum as reported in The Guardian .
Assuming he makes it out of the Ecuadorean embassy in London , onto a plane and out of Britain without arrest , what kind of a life does he face on landing in Quito ?

2012-08-15,"Remember Wikileaks - the phenomenon that was going to change journalism as we know it ?
Well , two years on , it 's way off the media radar now , what with its founder , Julian Assange , holed up in London 's Ecuadorian embassy ( and looking likely to win asylum ) .
Even concerned governments , notably the US administration , appear untroubled by its 2010 revelations .
They survived after all .
But Charlie Beckett , director of Polis at the London School of Economics , believes Wikileaks remains of "" profound significance "" for journalism .
And I 'm sure he is n't just saying that just because he has a book to plug : WikiLeaks : news in the networked era .
* Beckett thinks "" WikiLeaks is the greatest challenge to journalism in the digital era "" while conceding that "" this communications comet might just burn out , torn apart by the combined strain of personal - legal problems , financial crisis , external assaults and internal inertia . ""
But he argues that "" we should be taking notice rather than taking sides over Julian Assange 's remarkable project . ""
To that end , he lists three of WikiLeaks ' lessons : First , the "" embassy cables "" of 2010 continue to have an impact in the political life of several countries .
Even if not ground - breaking , they have "" had the effect of confirming widely held suspicions . ""
Second , WikiLeaks was a breakthrough as an act of journalism because its "" scale and immunity "" was unprecedented .
And it worked , and is working .
"" It was effectively immune from censorship , "" writes Beckett .
"" A barrage of financial and infrastructural assaults ... have not stopped it publishing . ""
Third , by collaborating with mainstream media WikiLeaks ensured that its information got the attention it deserved .
That 's powerful networked journalism in action .
Beckett continues by looking forward to a "" new journalism landscape "" in which refurbished journalism organisations will operate "" within the wider context of much more distributed social communications networks populated by individuals and a whole range of governmental , corporate and civic groups .
"" Read on .
There 's much more in Beckett 's article to appreciate .
Most importantly , he sees beyond the current transitory situation that beggars so many discussions about the future of journalism .

2012-08-15,"Britain has told the Ecuadorean authorities it believes officials can enter its embassy in London and arrest Julian Assange , the founder of WikiLeaks , according to Ecuador 's minister for foreign affairs , Ricardo Patino .
The development came two months after Assange walked into the embassy in a bid to avoid being extradited to Sweden where he faces allegations of sexual assault .
At a news conference on Wednesday , Patino said Ecuador would announce its decision regarding Assange 's asylum request at 7 am ( noon GMT ) on Thursday .
Patino also released details of a letter he said was delivered through a British embassy official in Quito , the capital of Ecuador .
The letter said : "" You need to be aware that there is a legal base in the UK , the Diplomatic and Consular Premises Act 1987 , that would allow us to take actions in order to arrest Mr Assange in the current premises of the Embassy . ""
The letter added : "" We need to reiterate that we consider the continued use of the diplomatic premises in this way incompatible with the Vienna Convention and unsustainable and we have made clear the serious implications that this has for our diplomatic relations . ""
An Ecuadorean government spokesman said : "" We are deeply shocked by the British government 's threats against the sovereignty of the Ecuadorean embassy and their suggestion that they may forcibly enter the embassy . ""
This a clear breach of international law and the protocols set out in the Vienna Convention . ""
Throughout out the last 56 days Mr Julian Assange has been in the Embassy , the Ecuadorean government has acted honourably in all our attempts to seek a resolution to the situation . ""
This stands in stark contrast to the escalation of the British government today with their threats to break down the door of the Ecuadorean embassy . ""
Instead of threatening violence against the Ecuadorean embassy , the British government should use its energy to find a peaceful resolution to this situation which we are aiming to achieve . ""
A Foreign Office spokeswoman said : "" We have consistently made our position clear in our discussions with the government of Ecuador . ""
The UK has a legal obligation to extradite Mr Assange to Sweden to face questioning over allegations of sexual offences and we remain determined to fulfil this obligation .
"" We have an obligation to extradite Mr Assange and it is only right that we give Ecuador the full picture . ""
Throughout this process we have drawn the Ecuadoreans ' attention to relevant provisions of our law , whether , for example , the extensive human rights safeguards in our extradition procedures , or the legal status of diplomatic premises in the UK .
"" We are still committed to reaching a mutually acceptable solution . ""
Assange denies the allegations against him , but fears he will be sent to the United States if he goes to Sweden .
An offer to the Swedish authorities by Ecuador for investigators to interview Assange inside the London embassy was rejected ."

2012-08-16,"The diplomatic and political minefield that is the fate of Julian Assange is expected to come a step closer to being traversed when Ecuador 's president , Rafael Correa , gives his decision on whether his country will grant the WikiLeaks ' founder asylum around lunchtime on Thursday .
The decision â€ “ if it comes â€ “ will mark the end of a turbulent process that on Wednesday night saw Ecuador 's foreign minister , Ricardo PatiÃ±o , raging against perceived threats from Britain to "" storm "" the embassy and warning that such a "" dangerous precedent "" would be met with "" appropriate responses in accordance with international law "" .
The dramatic development came two months after Assange suddenly walked into the embassy in a bid to avoid being extradited to Sweden , where he faces allegations of sexual assault .
At a press conference on Wednesday , PatiÃ±o released details of a letter he said was delivered through a British embassy official in Quito , the capital of the South American country .
The letter said : "" You need to be aware that there is a legal base in the UK , the Diplomatic and Consular Premises Act 1987 , that would allow us to take actions in order to arrest Mr Assange in the current premises of the embassy . ""
It added : "" We need to reiterate that we consider the continued use of the diplomatic premises in this way incompatible with the Vienna convention and unsustainable and we have made clear the serious implications that this has for our diplomatic relations . ""
On Wednesday night appeals were tweeted for Assange supporters to occupy the embassy to prevent British police from arresting him , and while there was a police presence outside the embassy , Scotland Yard insisted that officers were simply there to "" police the embassy like any other embassy "" .
PatiÃ±o said he was "" deeply shocked "" by the diplomatic letter .
Speaking to reporters later , he said : "" The government of Ecuador is considering a request for asylum and has carried out diplomatic talks with the governments of the United Kingdom and Sweden .
However , today we received from the United Kingdom a written threat that they could attack our embassy in London if Ecuador does not give up Julian Assange .
"" Ecuador , as a state that respects rights and justice and is a democratic and peaceful nation state , rejects in the strongest possible terms the explicit threat of the British official communication . ""
This is unbecoming of a democratic , civilised and law - abiding state .
If this conduct persists , Ecuador will take appropriate responses in accordance with international law .
"" If the measures announced in the British official communication materialise they will be interpreted by Ecuador as a hostile and intolerable act and also as an attack on our sovereignty , which would require us to respond with greater diplomatic force . ""
Such actions would be a blatant disregard of the Vienna convention on diplomatic relations and of the rules of international law of the past four centuries .
"" It would be a dangerous precedent because it would open the door to the violation of embassies as a declared sovereign space . ""
Under international law , diplomatic posts are considered the territory of the foreign nation .
The Foreign Office was quick to downplay the drama .
A spokesman said Britain had merely sought to "" clarify its position "" , according to international law .
"" Throughout this process we have drawn the Ecuadoreans ' attention to relevant provisions of our law â€ “ for example , the extensive human rights safeguards in our extradition procedures , or the legal status of diplomatic premises in the UK , "" a spokesman said .
"" We are still committed to reaching a mutually acceptable solution . ""
Ecuador revealed that it would announce its decision regarding Assange 's asylum request on Thursday at 1 pm .
A Foreign Office spokeswoman said : "" We have consistently made our position clear in our discussions with the government of Ecuador .
The UK has a legal obligation to extradite Mr Assange to Sweden to face questioning over allegations of sexual offences and we remain determined to fulfil this obligation .
"" We have an obligation to extradite Mr Assange and it is only right that we give Ecuador the full picture .
Correa has said Assange could face the death penalty in the US , and for that reason he considers the asylum request a question of political persecution .
Analysts in Ecuador expressed doubts that Britain would raid the embassy .
Professor Julio Echeverria of Quito 's Flasco University said Britain "" has a long - established tradition in Europe of respecting diplomatic missions "" , which under international law are considered sovereign territory .
A former Ecuadorean ambassador to London , Mauricio Gandara , told the Associated Press : "" I refuse to believe in this threat because if asylum is granted the British government will not grant safe passage and Mr Assange could be in the embassy for a long time . ""
Assange denies the allegations against him , but fears he will be sent to the United States if he goes to Sweden .
An offer to the Swedish authorities by Ecuador for investigators to interview Assange inside the London embassy was rejected .
A former computer hacker , Assange enraged Washington in 2010 when WikiLeaks published secret US diplomatic cables , has been taking refuge in the Ecuadorian embassy since 19 June .
If Ecuador does give Assange asylum , it is difficult to see how the WikiLeaks boss could physically leave the closely watched embassy and head to an airport without being arrested by British police ."

2012-08-16,"As defined by the United Nations convention on refugees , a refugee is a person who "" owing to well founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race , religion , nationality , membership of a particular social group or political opinion , is outside the country of his nationality and is unable or , owing to such fear , is unwilling to avail himself of the protection of that country "" .
A little later on , the text of the convention specifically states that refugee status "" shall not apply to any person with respect to whom there are serious reasons for considering that â€ ¦
he has committed a serious non - political crime outside the country of refuge "" .
Whatever views one may have about Julian Assange as a WikiLeaks activist , it is clear that in legal and moral terms he can not properly be described as a refugee .
To be a refugee is to be in need of very specific protection , desperately won and deservedly cherished .
Refugee protection does not apply to Mr Assange and it is wrong of him to claim it .
As Charlie Chaplin said when a Nazi newspaper reporter once asked him in Berlin if he were Jewish , he does not have that honour .
But the inappropriate nature of the claim goes further .
Since Mr Assange is wanted by the courts in Sweden for the specific and proper purpose of answering two allegations of sexual assault , which is in anyone 's language a serious non - political crime , it is also clear that he is specifically disbarred from being treated as a refugee .
None of this fundamental aspect of Mr Assange 's status was discussed in any serious way on Thursday by the Ecuadorian foreign minister , Ricardo PatiÃ±o , in his long statement on the case in Quito .
Mr PatiÃ±o made plenty of other points before confirming Ecuador 's decision to grant asylum to Mr Assange .
Most of these were based on the claim that the United States wants to get its hands on Mr Assange because of WikiLeaks , that it may torture him , that his deportation to Sweden by the UK would bring this closer , and that Ecuador has a right to protect him .
No one should be naÃ¯ve about the US , but this is a fallacious chain of reasoning .
The US has not said whether it wants to detain Mr Assange , though it has had plenty of time to do so .
If it wanted his extradition , the US might logically be more likely to make use of Britain 's excessively generous extradition treaty with the US â€ “ which has not happened â€ “ rather than wait until he was in Sweden , when both Sweden and the UK would have to sign off on any extradition application .
And neither Sweden nor the UK would in any case deport someone who might face torture or the death penalty .
Ecuador 's own human rights record is also far from exemplary , as Human Rights Watch has made clear .
Yet two wrongs do not make a right .
Just as Ecuador is wrong to pretend that Mr Assange is a refugee , so Britain is wrong to threaten to enter Ecuador 's London embassy .
The Foreign Office may have been factually entitled to remind Ecuador this week that a 1987 act allows it , if permissible under international law , to enter the premises .
But the reminder is more trouble than it is worth , and risks being massively counterproductive to this country 's interests in places where fewer scruples apply .
The threat was a mistake , allowing Ecuador to shift the argument away from the Swedish criminal charges .
Our diplomats in hostile or failing states would be put at unacceptable risk if this threat were carried out .
Thursday 's events do not change the realities of the Assange extradition case .
Mr Assange remains in this country .
He is the subject of an extradition order that has been issued under due process .
He can not leave the embassy without being arrested â€ “ an embassy car is not diplomatically protected .
Ecuador has found a way to tweak the tail of the imperialist lion , but the law is not on Ecuador 's side and , in the end , the law should be upheld .
Mr Assange should be extradited to answer Sweden 's criminal allegations .
In the meantime , Britain should concentrate on being patient and doing the right thing ."
2012-08-16,"While Ecuador might be surprised by the UK 's reaction over the Ecuadorean embassy situation in London , it is one that is likely to be used politically by president Rafael Correa , who is likely to run for election again next February .
Earlier this year , Correa boycotted the Summit of the Americas , a meeting of heads of state from across the Americas , because of the refusal by the United States and Canada to allow a declaration of support for Argentina 's claim to the Falkland Islands .
He called the United Kingdom a colonial power and also suggested imposing sanctions against the country for not wanting to negotiate with Argentina over the islands .
On Thursday , foreign affairs minister Ricardo PatiÃ±o said the UK 's reaction amounted to a strong threat : "" It is basically saying , ' We are going to beat you savagely if you do n't behave â€
¦
but if you behave , we may not beat you savagely , "" he said .
PatiÃ±o has been foreign affairs minister since 2010 .
He represents one of the hardliners within Correa 's government , who is pushing for a Venezuela - like line .
PatiÃ±o was involved in a scandal at the beginning of Correa 's administration in 2007 , and had to resign from his post as finance and economy minister at the time .
Some videos showed him meeting investment bankers discussing how the bankers and Ecuador could profit from threatening to default on debt â€ “ a decision that Ecuador took in 2008 .
Since Correa came to power , Ecuador has become an increasingly polarised country and this is reflected in the reaction to the decision .
For many supporters of Correa , granting Assange asylum was positive and gave the government strength vis - a - vis foreign governments .
"" This is the decision of a country that does not ask for permission to the Brits to react , of a country that does not care about fear or intimidation that the foreigners are trying to impose on us about this decision , "" Rosanna Alvarado , a congresswoman from Correa 's party , told state - run paper El Ciudadano .
Some hardliners protested outside the UK embassy in Quito on Wednesday night and many cheered outside the foreign affairs ministry when PatiÃ±o made the announcement .
Even people that are somewhat critical of Correa were in favour of Ecuador 's position . ""
The United Kingdom and other developed countries do n't usually allow small countries like Ecuador to challenge their decisions , "" said Marcelo RomÃ¡n from his home in northern Quito .
"" Ecuador 's decision is a sovereign decision and foreign governments have to respect it . ""
RomÃ¡n said that even if Correa uses the situation to garner more political support at home , it is important for Ecuador to assert itself internationally .
But others in the country are worried .
Business people are worried about the possible reaction that could come from the United States in light of a trade agreement that is up for renewal between the two countries .
Bernardo Acosta , professor of economics at Quito 's San Francisco University and former vice - president of the Ecuadorean Chamber of Industries , said this decision might affect Ecuador 's trade relations with both the European Union and the United States .
Ecuador is currently negotiating a new agreement with the EU and a trade pact with the US is also up for review .
Ecuador 's main exports are oil , shrimp and bananas and the US and the EU are Ecuador 's main trade partners .
"" This might be the last straw , "" said Acosta .
"" Ecuador is a small country with a small internal market and it needs a strong export policy .
But such decisions can lead to more isolation and close off more markets , "" he told the Guardian .
There are also worries within diplomatic corps .
There has been a spat between Correa 's political appointees and career diplomats within the foreign affairs ministry .
The latter feel that PatiÃ±o is pushing a political line without taking into account the rules of diplomacy .
In an editorial for El Comercio newspaper , former foreign affairs minister and former head of the UN High Commission for Human Rights , JosÃ © Ayala Lasso , said there would be "" political effects "" if Ecuador were to grant Assange asylum ."
2012-08-16,"Ecuador has granted the WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange political asylum â€ “ but he can not leave the country 's embassy in London without risking arrest .
So what happens next ?
Could Ecuador give Assange a diplomatic passport ?
Such passports are supposed to facilitate travel but do not confer immunity from the laws of other states .
Could Ecuador grant Assange diplomatic status ?
This would be a bold move by Ecuador , and would ratchet up the crisis .
Article 29 of the Vienna Convention states that those with diplomatic status are immune from prosecution .
It reads : "" The person of a diplomatic agent shall be inviolable .
He shall not be liable to any form of arrest or detention .
The receiving state shall treat him with due respect and shall take all appropriate steps to prevent any attack on his person , freedom or dignity . ""
But there is a countervailing obligation on Ecuador to respect the laws of the UK and not to interfere in Britain 's internal affairs .
Joanne Foakes , a former Foreign Office lawyer now based at the international think tank Chatham House , said : "" In principle , a state can freely appoint anyone as a member of its mission , apart from its head of mission .
But if they were to seek to do so now , it would be an obvious device to evade the laws of the receiving state , the UK .
In these circumstances the UK may feel justified in repudiating such an appointment . ""
Could embassy officials put Assange in a diplomatic vehicle and drive him to the airport ?
Diplomatic vehicles are immune from searches from the receiving country , in this case the UK .
But even if Assange managed to get into an embassy car without being arrested , he would at some stage have to get out to board a plane .
At that point he will have lost the protection conferred by being technically on Ecuadorean soil , and would be back under UK jurisdiction and liable for arrest .
Could he be smuggled out â€ “ or placed in a crate or bag that has diplomatic protection ?
As far - fetched as this sounds , it has been tried before in the UK .
In 1984 an attempt was made to abduct a Nigerian politician , Umaru Dikko , from Britain by placing him in a crate and attempting to ship him back to Nigeria .
Those involved tried , but failed , to label the crate correctly as a diplomatic package or bag .
The Vienna Convention says : "" The diplomatic bag shall not be opened or detained . ""
But such a package is not immune from scanning , or from thermal imaging , which would pick up body heat from inside any such package .
In such circumstances , UK authorities may be entitled to open the package and seize the concealed Assange ."
2012-08-16,
2012-08-16,"Ecuador has now made its decision : to grant political asylum to Julian Assange .
This comes in the wake of an incident that should dispel remaining doubts about the motives behind the UK / Swedish attempts to extradite WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange .
On Wednesday , the UK government made an unprecedented threat to invade Ecuador 's embassy if Assange is not handed over .
Such an assault would be so extreme in violating international law and diplomatic conventions that it is difficult to even find an example of a democratic government even making such a threat , let alone carrying it out .
When Ecuadorian foreign minister Ricardo PatiÃ±o , in an angry and defiant response , released the written threats to the public , the UK government tried to backtrack and say it was n't a threat to invade the embassy ( which is another country 's sovereign territory ) .
But what else can we possibly make of this wording from a letter delivered by a British official ? ""
You need to be aware that there is a legal base in the UK , the Diplomatic and Consular Premises Act 1987 , that would allow us to take actions in order to arrest Mr Assange in the current premises of the embassy .
We sincerely hope that we do not reach that point , but if you are not capable of resolving this matter of Mr Assange 's presence in your premises , this is an open option for us . ""
Is there anyone in their right mind who believes that the UK government would make such an unprecedented threat if this were just about an ordinary foreign citizen wanted for questioning â€ “ not criminal charges or a trial â€ “ by a foreign government ?
Ecuador 's decision to grant political asylum to Assange was both predictable and reasonable .
But it is also a ground - breaking case that has considerable historic significance .
First , the merits of the case : Assange clearly has a well - founded fear of persecution if he were to be extradited to Sweden .
It is pretty much acknowledged that he would be immediately thrown in jail .
Since he is not charged with any crime , and the Swedish government has no legitimate reason to bring him to Sweden , this by itself is a form of persecution .
We can infer that the Swedes have no legitimate reason for the extradition , since they were repeatedly offered the opportunity to question him in the UK , but rejected it , and have also refused to even put forth a reason for this refusal .
A few weeks ago the Ecuadorian government offered to allow Assange to be questioned in its London embassy , where Assange has been residing since 19 June , but the Swedish government refused â€ “ again without offering a reason .
This was an act of bad faith in the negotiating process that has taken place between governments to resolve the situation .
Former Stockholm chief district prosecutor Sven - Erik Alhem also made it clear that the Swedish government had no legitimate reason to seek Assange 's extradition when he testified that the decision of the Swedish government to extradite Assange is "" unreasonable and unprofessional , as well as unfair and disproportionate "" , because he could be easily questioned in the UK .
But , most importantly , the government of Ecuador agreed with Assange that he had a reasonable fear of a second extradition to the United States , and persecution here for his activities as a journalist .
The evidence for this was strong .
Some examples : an ongoing investigation of Assange and WikiLeaks in the US ; evidence that an indictment had already been prepared ; statements by important public officials such as Democratic senator Diane Feinstein that he should be prosecuted for espionage , which carries a potential death penalty or life imprisonment .
Why is this case so significant ?
It is probably the first time that a citizen fleeing political persecution by the US has been granted political asylum by a democratic government seeking to uphold international human rights conventions .
This is a pretty big deal , because for more than 60 years the US has portrayed itself as a proponent of human rights internationally â€ “ especially during the cold war .
And many people have sought and received asylum in the US .
The idea of the US government as a human rights defender , which was believed mostly in the US and allied countries , was premised on a disregard for the human rights of the victims of US wars and foreign policy , such as the 3 million Vietnamese or more than one million Iraqis who were killed , and millions of others displaced , wounded , or abused because of US actions .
That idea â€ “ that the US should be judged only on what it does within its borders
â€ “ is losing support as the world grows more multipolar economically and politically , Washington loses power and influence , and its wars , invasions , and occupations are seen by fewer people as legitimate .
At the same time , over the past decade , the US 's own human rights situation has deteriorated .
Of course prior to the civil rights legislation of the 1960s , millions of African - Americans in the southern states did n't have the right to vote , and lacked other civil rights â€ “ and the consequent international embarrassment was part of what allowed the civil rights movement to succeed .
But at least by the end of that decade , the US could be seen as a positive example internally in terms of the rule of law , due process and the protection of civil rights and liberties .
Today , the US claims the legal right to indefinitely detain its citizens ; the president can order the assassination of a citizen without so much as even a hearing ; the government can spy on its citizens without a court order ; and its officials are immune from prosecution for war crimes .
It does n't help that the US has less than 5 % of the world 's population but almost a quarter of its prison inmates , many of them victims of a "" war on drugs "" that is rapidly losing legitimacy in the rest of the world .
Assange 's successful pursuit of asylum from the US is another blow to Washington 's international reputation .
At the same time , it shows how important it is to have democratic governments that are independent of the US and â€ “ unlike Sweden and the UK
â€ “ will not collaborate in the persecution of a journalist for the sake of expediency .
Hopefully other governments will let the UK know that threats to invade another country 's embassy put them outside the bounds of law - abiding nations .
It is interesting to watch pro - Washington journalists and their sources look for self - serving reasons that they can attribute to the government of Ecuador for granting asylum .
Correa wants to portray himself as a champion of free speech , they say ; or he wants to strike a blow to the US , or put himself forward as an international leader .
But this is ridiculous .
Correa did n't want this mess and it has been a lose - lose situation for him from the beginning .
He has suffered increased tension with three countries that are diplomatically important to Ecuador â€ “ the US , UK and Sweden .
The US is Ecuador 's largest trading partner and has several times threatened to cut off trade preferences that support thousands of Ecuadorian jobs .
And since most of the major international media has been hostile to Assange from the beginning , they have used the asylum request to attack Ecuador , accusing the government of a "" crackdown "" on the media at home .
As I have noted elsewhere , this is a gross exaggeration and misrepresentation of Ecuador , which has an uncensored media that is mostly opposed to the government .
And for most of the world , these misleading news reports are all that they will hear or read about Ecuador for a long time .
Correa made this decision because it was the only ethical thing to do .
And any of the independent , democratic governments of South America would have done the same .
If only the world 's biggest media organisations had the same ethics and commitment to freedom of speech and the press .
Now we will see if the UK government will respect international law and human rights conventions and allow Assange safe passage to Ecuador ."
2012-08-16,"The latest twist in the Julian Assange case , as we await Ecuador 's decision on granting him asylum ( a decision which would not , as I 've written before , in itself allow protection from arrest if he steps outside the embassy ) , is that people are wondering whether the UK can simply strip the embassy of its diplomatic status , so allowing police officers to enter it .
It seems the British embassy in Quito has written to the Ecuadorian government ( hat tip to @JasonLeopold ) saying : "" You need to be aware that there is a legal base in the UK , the Diplomatic and Consular Premises Act 1987 , that would allow us to take actions in order to arrest Mr Assange in the current premises of the embassy .
"" We sincerely hope that we do not reach that point , but if you are not capable of resolving this matter of Mr Assange 's presence in your premises , this is an open option for us . ""
The 1987 Act does indeed give ministers a power to withdraw recognition from diplomatic premises .
Section 1(3 ) says : "" In no case is land to be regarded as a state 's diplomatic or consular premises for the purposes of any enactment or rule of law unless it has been so accepted or the secretary of state has given that state consent under this section in relation to it ; and if â€ ” ( a ) a state ceases to use land for the purposes of its mission or exclusively for the purposes of a consular post ; or ( b ) the secretary of state withdraws his acceptance or consent in relation to land , it thereupon ceases to be diplomatic or consular premises for the purposes of all enactments and rules of law . ""
On the face of it , then , the secretary of state ( in practice a foreign office minister ) could now simply withdraw consent , and with one bound , police would be free to make an arrest .
But it 's not quite as simple as that .
You 'll note that section 1(4 ) says "" The secretary of state shall only give or withdraw consent or withdraw acceptance if he is satisfied that to do so is permissible under international law , "" and that according to section 1(5 ) , in deciding whether to withdraw consent , the minister : "" â€ ¦ shall have regard to all material considerations , and in particular , but without prejudice to the generality of this subsection â€ ” ( a ) to the safety of the public ; ( b ) to national security ; and ( c ) to town and country planning . ""
The "" compliance with international law "" requirement may present a problem , since article 21 of the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations requires the UK to facilitate the acquisition by Ecuador of premises necessary for its mission , or assist it in obtaining accommodation .
It 's not obvious this allows the UK to just de - recognise the current premises without helping arrange something new .
Section 1(5 ) is interesting because , in spite of the way the drafting clearly intends to preserve ministers ' ability to take account of anything they think relevant , I 've no doubt lawyers for Ecuador could argue that the list of three particular concerns colours the scope of ministers ' considerations , the result being that only some particular difficulty relating to safety or to the premises themselves could justify withdrawal .
More importantly , they could argue that Assange 's presence in the embassy and Ecuador 's conduct in sheltering him is not a material consideration ; and that since that clearly lay behind the withdrawal , ministers would in deciding to withdraw consent , have taken into account an irrelevant factor .
In addition , there 'd be a potentially strong argument to be made that ministers had exercised their power for an improper purpose not intended by parliament when it enacted the 1987 legislation â€ “ their desire to arrest Julian Assange .
Ecuador could judicially review any proposed withdrawal : I think the effect on Assange means this is the type of case in which , as Lord Sumption explained in a recent speech , the courts would consider intervening in a foreign policy decision .
Perhaps Assange could obtain an injunction on judicial review , preventing any arrest pending the outcome of proceedings .
Of course , if the government successfully fought off that judicial review , the arrest could go ahead .
But I do n't think a defence would be easy , and at the very least , a judicial review would create further delay â€ “ which probably suits Assange fairly well .
I 'm not sure giving him a hook to hang one on would be the best tactical move for the government .
The Quito letter from the UK to Ecuador went on apparently to say : "" We need to reiterate that we consider the continued use of the diplomatic premises in this way incompatible with the Vienna Convention and unsustainable and we have made clear the serious implications that this has for our diplomatic relations .
"" If I were advising the government , I think I 'd say that , if ministers are determined to allow the arrest of Assange , it might be better simply to cut off diplomatic relations with Ecuador , send the ambassador home , close the embassy and arrest Assange after that .
Ending diplomatic relations is the major sort of foreign affairs decision I doubt the courts would interfere with .
But that 'd be a major diplomatic call .

2012-08-16,"As refugees from General Pinochet 's Chile in 1973 , when many friends sought refuge in the Swedish embassy in Santiago , with the active help of the then Swedish ambassador , Harald Edelstam , we are horrified that the British government is threatening to use force to enter the Ecuadorian embassy in London to arrest Julian Assange ( Assange 's fate in the balance as Ecuador claims UK threatened to storm embassy , 16 August ) .
Even Pinochet and his military gave safe conduct for the thousands of Chilean refugees in the Swedish and other embassies in September 1973 , after the military coup against Chile 's legitimate President , Salvador Allende .
They respected the inviolability of a country 's embassy and thousands of Chileans were allowed to leave and start new lives in the country whose embassy they had fled to .
Now Sweden is apparently prepared , together with the UK , meekly to do the bidding of the US .
If the British government is allowed to get away with this , it will be the end of the universally accepted principle of the inviolability of a nation 's embassy on foreign soil .

In the tussle over the fate of Julian Assange , the precise scope of the European arrest warrant is yet again in danger of being forgotten .
The warrant is an essential crime - fighting instrument in its correct application , which is "" for the purposes of conducting a criminal prosecution "" .
This must mean an imminent charge .
But the suggestion that it can be used at an earlier , investigative , stage of proceedings keeps coming back .
You quote a Foreign Office spokeswoman as saying that "" the UK has a legal obligation to extradite Mr Assange to Sweden to face questioning over allegations of sexual offences "" â€ “ whether or not this was a slip of the tongue , it is still an unfortunate mistake .
Eurosceptics who oppose the European warrant on illusory grounds of sovereignty are giving a free "" never get into jail "" card to gangsters and traffickers .
But misuse of the warrant feeds anti - EU prejudice .
It is therefore vital that the national authorities in the EU avoid mission - creep , by using the proper instruments for investigation and evidence - gathering , and reserving the warrent for when matters are ready for prosecution .
Sarah Ludford MEP Liberal Democrat European justice and human rights spokeswoman â€¢ I am alarmed at the suggestion that the UK may use force to enter the embassy of Ecuador .
The clarification by the Foreign Office , "" drawing the Ecuadoreans ' attention to relevant provisions of our law "" , is far from reassuring .
The consequences of such an action would open the way for similar action to be taken against our own embassies â€ “ an enormous backward step in international relations .
We do not always extradite where we consider that the individual concerned has some legitimate fears and the Ecuadoreans have made the very reasonable suggestion that the Swedish authorities could interview Mr Assange in their embassy .
Acting as impartial observers , the Ecuadoreans could surely judge whether the evidence warranted that Mr Assange should be returned to Sweden .
Francis Westoby Hitchin , Hertfordshire â€¢
It is impossible to believe that the government would threaten the Ecuadorian embassy without massive pressure from the US .
In the UK we have the Public Interest Disclosure Act 1998 to protect whistleblowers .
To storm the embassy to arrest Julian Assange would be to act in the manner of the worst dictatorship and would shame us all .
As , indeed , does the threat to do so .
Jim McCluskey Twickenham , Middlesex â€¢ Britain should stop bullying Ecuador and grant Mr Assange safe passage to Quito , where he should stand trial on any legitimate Swedish criminal charge .
Dominic Shelmerdine London â€¢
The government must be appalled by Ecuador 's support for the rights of the individual in the face of demands from a powerful bully .
That 's not how things are done in this country .

2012-08-17,"Ecuador is still willing to negotiate with the British government over the fate of Julian Assange , despite the Foreign Office 's "" threat "" to arrest the WikiLeaks founder inside its embassy and the "" intimidating "" police presence in and around the building , according to a senior Ecuadorean diplomatic source .
The South American country 's decision to grant political asylum to the 41-year - old Australian , who faces allegations of sexual assault in Sweden , has provoked a bitter political row between Quito and London .
The source complained that the UK government 's written warning that it could use the Diplomatic and Consular Premises Act 1987 to arrest Assange inside the embassy had been accompanied by a large increase in the number of police officers at the Knightsbridge building .
The police presence , it added , had risen from two or three to around 50 , with officers on the embassy 's fire escape and at every window .
This was described as "" an absolutely intimidating and unprecedented use of police "" designed to show the British government 's desire to "" go in with a strong hand "" .
However , the source said that Quito had been encouraged by a phone call made by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office to the Ecuadorean ambassador on Thursday .
"" The FCO called the ambassador yesterday to confirm that it still had the will to talk and negotiate , so we 'll keep talking , "" it added .
"" The fact that they called the ambassador makes us think that the letter with the threat of using domestic legislation to make an incursion into the embassy and arrest somebody inside was a mistake â€ “ as was the intimidating increase in the number of police surrounding the embassy on the same day the letter was delivered . ""
It stressed that Ecuador was willing to co - operate with the British and Swedish authorities over the matter of Assange 's extradition to Sweden . ""
In the negotiations with the FCO , Ecuador has been proposing that we would be prepared to accept an undertaking from the UK and Sweden that , once Julian Assange has faced the Swedish investigation , he will not be extradited to a third country : specifically the US .
That might be a way out of it and Ecuador has always said it does not want to interfere with the Swedish judicial process ; we could facilitate it . ""
The source said the Ecuadorean government had been bolstered by the support it had received since deciding to grant asylum to Assange , adding : "" We are moved by the overwhelming level of solidarity that Ecuador now has in the [ Latin American ] region . ""
Asked how Assange was coping with the pressure of life in the small embassy , where he has been living for 55 days , the source said : "" He 's fine .
He 's not stressed out .
Given the fact that he has been under pressure for so long and that his legal fight has gone through so many different levels , I think that for his safety he always had a last resort . ""
Scotland Yard declined to comment on the policing operation at the embassy , while an FCO source said the letter sent to the Ecuadorean authorities on Wednesday was not menacing and that the rights of the country 's officials would continue to be respected by the government . ""
The letter was not a threat , "" said the source .
"" There had already been many meetings with the Ecuador government .
It was just that it was quite clear that they were close to making a decision
and we wanted them to know the law .
It was merely signposting the fact .
"" The foreign secretary , William Hague , was informed about diplomatic developments on the Assange case , although a spokeswoman declined to divulge further details , saying : "" We are not providing a running commentary . ""
At a press conference on Wednesday , Ecuador 's foreign minister , Ricardo PatiÃ±o , released details of the contentious letter , which he said was delivered through a British embassy official in Quito .
The letter said : "" You need to be aware that there is a legal base in the UK , the Diplomatic and Consular Premises Act 1987 , that would allow us to take actions in order to arrest Mr Assange in the current premises of the embassy . ""

2012-08-17,"The WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange spent a comfortable night in the Ecuadorean embassy in London after the South American country 's decision to offer him asylum , and is said to be "" doing all right "" , according to a diplomatic source .
More than a dozen Metropolitan police officers stood guard outside the redbrick Knightsbridge mansion block on Friday morning , accompanied by a handful of his supporters who are understood to be planning a show of solidarity and direct action tonight in protest at the British government 's treatment of Assange .
A strong international media presence remained behind barriers outside , where gutters were full of beer cans and coffee cups .
One supporter , Tristan Woodwards , said he had spent the night camped out opposite the embassy to show sympathy .
"" I 'm here to support Julian Assange and WikiLeaks and to show my disgust at the British government 's threat to a sovereign nation 's embassy , "" he said .
"" It 's completely wrong .
People talk about the [ assault ] allegations , but [ the UK government 's reaction ] seems over the top for someone who 's supposed to have committed a crime . ""
Another supporter , Tammy Samede , said she had decided to keep watch on the embassy to make sure the government acted in accordance with international law .
"" To be honest , I 'm not a fan of the British government for a lot reasons , "" she said .
"" But they 're using the need to question him to get him out of here and get him to Sweden , who will extradite him to the US , who will probably imprison him forever or execute him . ""
Samede said that while the women who had made the assault allegations had every right to due process , the case should be dealt with "" in the proper manner and not in the political manner "" .
She said Assange had offered to answer questions by videolink , but British authorities seemed unwilling to let him .
Asked how long she would keep vigil , she said : "" It 's not the most comfortable place , but standing up for what 's right is never comfortable .
That 's why [ Assange ] is stuck in a room without a window in the embassy . """

2012-08-17,"A major diplomatic row over the fate of the fugitive Julian Assange erupted after the WikiLeaks founder was offered political asylum by Ecuador to escape extradition from Britain over allegations of serious sexual assaults .
The foreign secretary , William Hague , responded by warning the Ecuadorean government that diplomatic immunity should not be used to harbour alleged criminals .
He said Assange would be arrested if he leaves the embassy in London where he has lived for nearly two months .
Ecuador 's decision has also angered the Swedish authorities , who wish to question Assange and the two women who claim he assaulted them during a trip to the country in 2010 .
Assange denies the assault claims and says he fears being sent on to the United States where he could face political persecution for releasing thousands of secret US cables .
The standoff will escalate tensions between the two countries over the fate of Assange , who has skipped bail while awaiting removal from the UK .
It follows allegations from Ecuador that the British government has threatened to storm the embassy to seize Assange .
Diplomatic posts are often considered the territory of the foreign nation .
After a day of dramatic developments and protests , Assange watched the asylum decision from a room in the embassy in Knightsbridge , central London , via a live link to a press conference from the Ecuadorean capital , Quito .
Hague responded by saying Assange would not be allowed safe passage out of the UK , and that it was a "" matter of regret "" that the Ecuadorean government decided to grant the WikiLeaks founder political asylum .
But Hague said that did not change the fundamentals of the case .
Speaking at the Foreign Office , he added the case could go on for a considerable time .
"" We will not allow Mr Assange safe passage out of the United Kingdom , nor is there any legal basis for us to do so . ""
On Wednesday , British government officials sent a letter to Ecuadorean officials in Quito outlining the powers of the Diplomatic and Consular Premises Act 1987 , which allows revocation of a building 's diplomatic status if the foreign power occupying it "" ceases to use land for the purposes of its mission or exclusively for the purposes of a consular post "" .
Hague dismissed Ecuadorean claims that the letter was a threat to "" attack "" their embassy . ""
There is no threat here to storm an embassy .
We are talking about an act of parliament in this country which stresses that it must be used in full conformity with international law , "" he said .
Officials said use of the act has not been ruled out .
Hague also denied claims by Assange and his supporters that there was a deal that would see him extradited to the US .
The country 's foreign affairs minister , Ricardo PatiÃ±o , said Assange was clear that he is being persecuted for political reasons because of the disclosure of documents by WikiLeaks .
"" Ecuador is sure that there is a real threat of him being extradited to a third country , without any guarantees .
He would be subject to cruel treatment , "" Patino said in his press conference in Quito .
The Ecuadorean government has conducted lengthy diplomatic talks with the UK , Swedish and US governments , PatiÃ±o said .
He said that the UK 's reaction amounted to a strong threat : "" It is basically saying , ' We are going to beat you savagely if you do n't behave â€
¦
but if you behave , we may not beat you savagely . ""
An official said Ecuador had acted within international and diplomatic law ever since Assange took refuge inside the building .
The Swedish foreign ministry said it had summoned Ecuador 's ambassador over the Latin American country 's "" unacceptable "" decision to grant asylum .
Assange will give a statement outside the embassy on Sunday afternoon , according to tweets posted on the WikiLeaks Twitter feed , prompting speculation that he could be arrested because the property might be outside the embassy .
The lawyer of two Swedish women who made allegations of sexual assault against Assange denounced Ecuador 's move as "" absurd "" .
Claes Borgstrom told reporters that the move was an abuse of the asylum instrument , the purpose of which is to protect people from persecution and torture if sent back to one 's country of origin . ""
He does n't risk being handed over to the United States for torture or the death penalty .
He should be brought to justice in Sweden , "" she said .
The Union of South American Nations ( UNASUR ) has convened an "" extraordinary meeting "" in Ecuador on Sunday to discuss the situation at the embassy .
A statement released on the website of the foreign ministry of Peru , which currently holds the rotating presidency of the intergovernmental union , said : "" The Foreign Ministry of Peru lets public opinion know that , in concordance with the statutory responsibilities of the temporary presidency of UNASUR , at the behest of the Republic of Ecuador and after consulting member states , an extraordinary meeting of the Counsel of Foreign Ministers of the Union has been convened on Sunday August 19 in the city of Guayaquil , Ecuador . ""
The meeting has been requested with the intention of considering the situation raised at the embassy of Ecuador in the United Kingdom . """
2012-08-17,"Thus far , much of the coverage of Julian Assange 's successful political asylum application to Ecuador has focused on the international legal and diplomatic aspects and implications of the case .
In fact , domestic Ecuadorian politics have played a vital role in the decision - making process for the administration of Ecuadorian President Rafael Correa .
The backdrop to the Assange case has been the upcoming presidential election in Ecuador , slated to be held just six months from now in February 2013 .
President Correa , who was first elected in 2007 , will be seeking a second term under Ecuador 's 2008 constitution .
Opinion polls published in the Ecuadorian media in 2012 have shown Correa with a commanding lead over his prospective opponents , largely because there is no consensus challenger .
Polling from CMS in March showed Correa with just under 49 % of the vote , more than 40 points ahead of the five included challengers , who polled between 1 % and 9 % each .
Thiry percent of voters , however , said that they had not chosen a candidate to support .
More recent polling has shown the emergence of Guillermo Lasso as the closest prospective candidate with 17 % of the vote , while undecided voters fell to 17 % .
Correa held fast with 50 % of the vote .
With a split field , Correa is practically guaranteed a win .
Ecuadorian electoral law does not require the winning candidate to garner a majority of the popular vote ; if a candidate receives at least 40 % of the vote and is at least 10 points ahead of the next finisher , he or she wins in the first round .
Election observers , including the Correa campaign , view Guillermo Lasso as the candidate most capable of forcing a runoff and , indeed , possibly winning the election .
Despite being the former head of a major bank ( the Bank of Guayaquil ) and an economic adviser to former President Lucio Gutierrez , Lasso began the campaign unknown to most voters ( he pulled just 4.6 % in the March 2012 poll ) .
However , Lasso and his team have launched aggressive efforts to promote him in television and print media .
Thus far , with a focus on domestic issues and image cultivation , Lasso in particular has been able to start to close the gap with Correa , hoping to push out the other prospective opposition candidates and turn the contest into a two - horse race .
This brings us back to the Julian Assange case , which has been used to great political effect by President Correa to redirect the nation 's focus from the presidential campaign to a riveting legal and diplomatic affair of international significance .
Each day that Assange and the asylum case dominates the airwaves is one fewer day for Lasso to introduce himself to voters and work to find a consensus platform for the opposition .
The forceful anti - imperialist and anti - colonial rhetoric of Correa and Foreign Minister PatiÃ±o in the context of the UK 's threat to remove diplomatic protections from the Ecuador Embassy in London have been couched in nationalistic terms for the Ecuadorian population .
Essentially , Correa has wrapped himself in the flag â€ “ in a such a way that his conservative opponents are not able to criticize him effectively , lest they seem unpatriotic .
This is a familiar approach for Correa .
He used similar tactics back in 2010 when he declared that the police riot and strike represented an attempted coup d'etat .
Stirring nationalist and populist furor , he shut down both a brewing internal rebellion among leftists within his party and efforts from the opposition on the right to slow down his left - leaning reform agenda .
Though the six months until February 's vote is a long time in electoral politics , Ecuador 's new elections law make the current period particularly important .
According to the reforms passed in January , political speech in the media , such as campaign advertising , is severely restricted for the final 90 days before election day .
In effect , it means that Guillermo Lasso and the opposition have only until November to make a serious dent in Correa 's lead by way of campaign advertising .
Therefore , the longer and more dramatic the Assange case is , and the longer Ecuador 's diplomatic dispute with the UK and Sweden continues , the more the Ecuadorian election campaign will dwell on international affairs â€ “ a sphere
the incumbent Correa dominates in relation to his opponents .
With far fewer risks than the major electoral benefits it delivers , the diplomatic spat is clearly in Correa 's political favor ."
2012-08-17,"On Thursday afternoon , the atmosphere outside the Ecuadorean embassy was vibrant .
Inside was Julian Assange , granted asylum by President Rafael Correa , presumably doing whatever it is he 's been doing since he sought refuge there in June .
An anonymous supporter said : "" He 's got his computer , so he 's bound to be all right . ""
For the embassy staff , it must be like having a teenage stepson , the price of a much desired union but maybe a bit of a pain in the neck .
But the critical question now is not how to live with him , but how to arrange it so they can go back to living without him .
Assange can not stay indefinitely in the embassy , and ca n't be bundled into a car , but he could , said Farhan , 42 , "" be put into a crate , and taken to an airport .
You ca n't open diplomatic luggage "" .
Farhan had come as a "" legal watcher "" , so that , if the British government does intend to breach article 31 of the Vienna Convention ( which states that a host country ca n't enter consular premises ) , at least people will be watching .
Phil , 29 , another legal watcher , said : "" What 's the health and safety angle on that ?
You could give him airholes , I suppose .
"" Alex Cole , a bystander , said : "" It 's like SchrÃ¶dinger 's cat , he only exists for as long as you 're not allowed to check
he 's in there .
""
Kris , a friend of Farhan 's , was arguing with Sophie Harman , 31 , a doctor of international politics , with a variety of fields of expertise , including feminist political economy ; at one point , he left and returned with some Starbursts .
On social media , the Assange case has become a cantankerous troll - fest , with one side vaunting that anybody with any anxiety at all about the possibility that Assange will be extradited from Sweden to the US must therefore be pro - rape , while the other side maintains the alleged rape victims must be lying , because the US is evil .
People who can be bothered to turn up outside an embassy have a different approach , one in which they talk to each rather than try to shut each other down .
Shaun , 47 , believes Assange would be in "" very grave danger "" if he went willingly to Sweden , but Harman counters : "" I do n't know why Sweden would unilaterally try to build this relationship with the US . ""
She continued : "" The way that sexual violence is treated in international relations is despicable .
In DRC [ Democratic Republic of Congo ] , rape is an act of war .
Here , it 's a conspiracy against Assange . ""
With Dominique Strauss - Kahn , he was just a bit iffy .
It 's always the case with rape charges that the women are dismissed . ""
There were supporters of Assange who would n't talk to the Guardian , because of the paper 's poor relationship with the WikiLeaks founder .
"" It 's written by toads "" , one woman told me .
"" Not you , "" she amended politely .
"" I do n't know what you write about . ""
In general , it was discursive , heated , friendly , and alive .
The police were 50 - 50 , some cheerful , some issuing instructions with that insufferable jobsworthy passive sentence structure : "" I need you to be making it safe for others to use the pavement .
"" It 's possible they were playing good cop / bad cop .
On Friday morning , the standoff continued but the crowds had dissipated : or rather , the crowds of media , who 'd always made up the majority , were still there , all in their professional semi - circles round a neat , groomed presenter , occasionally scowled at by a shopper in difficult shoes trying to get to Harrods .
Telesur and TeleAmazonas led the interest but the Beeb was there as well .
Two drunks and someone ( who wanted to be nameless ) from Occupy were the only others , by mid - morning .
He said : "" I think there 's a massive protest outside the Russian embassy about Pussy Riot .
So everyone 's gone there . ""
He smiled , as if to say : "" What are we waiting for ? ""
Certainly , anyone waiting for Assange 's case to go one way or the other could be here for some time ."
2012-08-17,"I am taking a summer break in sun - kissed Ireland from today .
Back on 3 September .
Meanwhile , in the unlikely possibility of Julian Assange getting from London 's Ecuador embassy to a Quito - bound plane without being lifted by the British police , I leave you with this imagined scenario after his arrival in Ecuador .
He will be greeted by President Rafael Correa at the airport and feted for a couple of weeks .
He will gradually come to realise that left - wing anti - press actions are just as inimical to freedom as their right - wing equivalent .
Then , depend upon it , he will speak out , annoy his host and find himself needing to seek sanctuary .
But where ?"
2012-08-17,"Compared with what 's going on in other people 's courts , Britain 's domestic judicial problems , our ghoulish fascination with the 50-year - old Moors murders and even Julian Assange 's extradition fight , are relatively small beer .
Across the former Soviet bloc and into nominally communist China we are witnessing dramatic battles to separate justice from politics .
That fight is never over as disparate supporters of the WikiLeaks founder and countless other self - styled politicals have insisted down the years , sometimes rightly .
Tony Blair felt persecuted by the Metropolitan police even in Downing Street , and this month Standard Chartered bank felt ill - used by what it sees as quasi - political regulatory threats in New York .
But the principle that judges should be independent â€ “ "" as long as they behave themselves "" â€ “ was entrenched in English statute law as long ago as 1702 .
"" Be ye ever so mighty , the law is above you "" , as someone put it a few years later .
That precept should protect Assange from the wrath of the White House , though it has mostly failed over GuantÃ¡namo Bay .
The rules are not so secure in China or Russia ; shaky , too , in not - so - different cases which mingle politics and the courtroom in Hungary , Romania , Bulgaria and Ukraine â€ “ all former Soviet satellites and neighbours , three of them EU members , all struggling to establish proper boundaries or ( it depends who 's talking ) to undermine them .
They command fewer headlines than Gu Kailai , confessed murderer of Neil Heywood in a Chinese hotel room , or Moscow 's punk band trio , but are hugely important to their citizens , who question whether we can rely on the law to protect us from the powerful ?
Is it a gloomy no - win situation ?
Of course not .
Greater transparency is always painful and can mislead people into thinking things are getting worse , because crimes or scandals are being exposed when previously they were covered up .
So the glamorous Pussy Riot defenders are surely wrong historically when they say their trial for anti - Putin "" hooliganism "" in a cathedral is a Stalinist show trial .
Under Stalin most such trials took place in secrecy , unbeknown to foreign correspondents working a few streets away , imperious to criticism or rebuttal .
Pussy Riot are on much stronger ground when they assert that â€ “ despite today 's inevitable guilty verdict
â€ “ they have beaten the politically manipulated judicial machine by the force of their arguments and their personalities . ""
Now the whole world sees that the criminal case against us has been fabricated , "" they asserted in court .
It has all happened in public â€ “ too hard to hide in the wired world of today â€ “ and a host of global rock royalty whom Vladimir Putin can not harm is on their side .
It might be prudent for Madonna and Macca to check their tea for polonium , all the same , because Russia seems to be slipping back into lawless ways which will do it no good .
Is China inching slowly in the opposite direction ?
Whatever has been going on in the closed - but - not - quite - secret Hefei intermediate people 's court in China these past few weeks
â€ “ the trial of disgraced politician Bo Xilai 's wife for murder â€
“ it is all but impossible to establish at this time and distance what the real story is .
In terms of the facts of the case and its wider meaning for the political direction of China there is only speculation .
The official verdict is expected next week .
Was the Harrow - educated expat and middleman facilitator , Heywood , a greedy blackmailer , who threatened Gu 's only son ( he had earlier helped get him into Harrow ) when a lucrative business deal went wrong , as the official narrative states .
Or was he someone disposed of because he threatened to expose high - level corruption ?
Would the case have come to court at all â€ “ the British embassy did not over - exert itself after Heywood was found dead of a "" heart attack "" â€ “ had not Wang Lijun , the local police chief , taken Assange - style refuge in a US consulate , claiming his life was at risk as a whistleblower ?
And is the decision to prosecute Gu in this high - profile way simply a byproduct of high politics and the urgent need to kill off the challenge to the Beijing leadership of Mr Gu , aka Bo Xilai , the ambitious mega - city boss in Chongqing and Mao - era revivalist , who had been using populist policies ( curbing mafia gangs and promoting equality ) to advance his claims for promotion to the politburo 's standing committee ?
Bo 's name has not been mentioned in court , but it is corruption charges he faces , not promotion , if it suits the party to press home its advantage .
A handful of Maoist supporters are reported to have been demonstrating outside the court ( do they have public school leftists in China now ? ) , which may tell us more about the authorities ' wish to have their notoriously opaque legal system look "" normal "" to outsiders than anything else .
British diplomats , but no reporters , have been allowed in .
So the Chinese trial is more akin to the running dramas in Ukraine â€ “ where jailed former prime minister , Yulia Tymoshenko , faces fresh charges of corruption and even complicity in murder â€ “ and in Romania 's standoff between the conservative president , ex - oil - tanker captain , Traian Basescu , and the young ( 39 ) prime minister , Victor Ponta , a Blair - ish moderniser in a country where that label is not a stigma .
As in Hungary , where the reforming prime minister , Viktor OrbÃ¡n , has frightened a lot of voters with his sweeping constitutional reforms ( Paul Krugman calls it an "" authoritarian slide "" in the New York Times ) since 2010 , and neighbouring Bulgaria , where there is a crisis of authority in the court system , the EU has leverage here because all three are members , though not of the single currency zone .
Each case is different .
OrbÃ¡n 's Fidesz party won a 68 % mandate from voters in 2010 and used to make what were widely seen as extreme changes to the system , most notably by rigging the constitutional court , packing its membership , making it harder to bring cases and excluding a host of legislation from its remit .
When we consider that reform of the eurozone will stand or fall on the ruling â€ “ is it legal ?
â€
“ of the German constitutional court
the comparison is painful .
Media control and rigged elections are also on the Hungarian menu .
In Bulgaria a judge was dismissed for unreasonable delays in court proceedings , though actually for criticising the supreme court and the interior minister , critics say .
The EU is on the case here too .
But all this takes place at a time when the credit - fuelled boom years are over ( sounds familiar ? ) and the former eastern bloc states are under pressure â€ “ also from the EU â€ “ to retrench economically and get their budgets under control .
Times are hard and feelings run high .
So in Romania , still under the shadow of the brutal and stupid Ceausescu regime , which ended in a hail of bullets in 1989 , the standoff between Basescu and Ponta is also about a pro - austerity president whose party lost power after cuts in 2009 and a pro - growth social democrat who says the president should be politically neutral .
The EU has been pressing for reform on Romania 's notoriously corrupt politics since long before the country was allowed to join Nato in 2004 and the EU in 2007 .
A referendum to depose Basescu was overwhelmingly carried by austerity - weary voters in July , but the supreme court has to rule on 31 August whether the necessary 50 % of the electorate took part to validate it .
Basescu 's supporters say he is a genuine reformer who has backed the national anti - corruption department , which is why so many of the political elite want him out .
The former prime minister Adrian Nastase , Ponta 's mentor , has been jailed for corruption .
In London this week Ponta told the Guardian 's Julian
Borger the worst was over and the pair might yet "" cohabit "" if Basescu behaves .
Tricky , is n't it ?
In countries which for the most part lack settled traditions of respect for courts and constitutions , both sides stand accused of manipulating the system for political gain .
It is a huge distraction from urgent economic tasks and threatens to deepen voter disillusion .
Even in seemingly all - powerful Beijing , party bosses know ordinary Chinese are angry with elite corruption and the frailty of its justice .
But the outside world knows more about these proceedings than we would have done in past times .
That 's progress .
Our legal battles nearer home show there is no room to be smug â€
“ but also that we are luckier than we sometimes remember to remember .
The rule of law is the anchor for most of what we have ."
2012-08-18,"The diplomatic row between Britain and Ecuador over the WikiLeaks founder , Julian Assange , is to be discussed by foreign ministers from across the Americas next week .
The Organisation of American States ( OAS ) has voted to hold a meeting next Friday following Ecuador 's decision to grant political asylum to Assange , who is currently taking refuge in the country 's embassy in London .
Assange has described the move as a "" historic victory "" but the British foreign secretary , William Hague , made it clear that the Australian would not be allowed safe passage out of the country .
The permanent council of the OAS decided that a meeting would be held in Washington DC after members voted on the issue .
The US , Canada and Trinidad and Tobago opposed the resolution , but 23 members voted in favour of the meeting .
There were five abstentions and three members were absent .
The OAS secretary general , JosÃ © Miguel Insulza , said the meeting would not be about Assange but the "" the problem posed by the threat or warning made to Ecuador by the possibility of an intervention into its embassy in London .
The issue that concerns us is the inviolability of diplomatic missions of all members of this organisation , something that is of interest to all of us . ""
Assange has been in the Ecuadorean embassy for the past two months after facing extradition to Sweden accused of sexual assault .
He denies the claims and fears being sent to the United States if he goes to Sweden .
Ecuador 's president , Rafael Correa , said in a radio interview on Friday that his nation was not trying to undermine Sweden 's attempts to question Assange .
He said : "" The main reason why Julian Assange was given diplomatic asylum was because his extradition to a third country was not guaranteed , in no way was it done to interrupt the investigations of Swedish justice over an alleged crime .
In no way . ""
Hague has said that diplomatic immunity should not be used to harbour alleged criminals .
Hague said it is a "" matter of regret "" that the Ecuadorean government granted the WikiLeaks founder political asylum .
"" We will not allow Mr Assange safe passage out of the United Kingdom , nor is there any legal basis for us to do so , "" he said .
Ecuadorean ministers have accused the UK of threatening to attack the embassy to seize Assange , after it emerged that the Diplomatic and Consular Premises Act 1987 could allow revocation of a building 's diplomatic status if the foreign power occupying it "" ceases to use land for the purposes of its mission or exclusively for the purposes of a consular post "" .
Under international law , diplomatic posts are considered the territory of the foreign nation .
The foreign secretary said there was no threat to storm the embassy .
"" We are talking about an act of parliament in this country which stresses that it must be used in full conformity with international law , "" he said .
The Swedish foreign ministry said it has summoned Ecuador 's ambassador over the South American country 's "" unacceptable "" decision to grant asylum ."
2012-08-19,"Your editorial ( 17 August ) states categorically that "" an embassy car is not diplomatically protected "" , although I do n't know how you square that with Article 22(3 ) of the Vienna convention ( "" The premises of the mission , their furnishings and other property thereon and the means of transport of the mission shall be immune from search , requisition , attachment or execution "" ) .
This , however , seems unlikely to help Mr Assange to get himself to Ecuador without being arrested when he leaves the embassy to get into the car or at the port or airport when he gets out of it .
A safer way might be for Ecuador to appoint him to the diplomatic staff of their embassy in London , for which the UK government 's agreement would not be required .
Mr Hague would then expel him , after the Ecuadoreans had refused to waive his diplomatic immunity .
But Assange would retain his diplomatic immunity from arrest until he had left the UK , presumably on his way to Ecuador and political asylum .
Such diplomatic chicanery to enable Assange to escape British and Swedish due process would lay Ecuador open to retaliation â€
“
Britain could expel its ambassador or even break off diplomatic relations â€ “ but the Ecuadoreans might think it worthwhile .
No doubt Mr Assange would !
Brian Barder London â€¢â€ˆYour leader was an oasis of sense amid the myopic tone of most of the letters concerning Mr Assange on the opposite page .
One wonders what the Ecuadorean government would have done had British diplomats in Quito given refuge to a man wanted in Ecuador and other countries , and London had then given him sanctuary in Britain : most probably smoked him out of the legation one way or another .
However , Britain must keep its temper over Mr Assange .
Much better to let this wanted man stew in the embassy until sense prevails and he leaves to face the allegations that the Swedish women have made .
Sweden is a democratic country and , incidentally , one that is far less beholden to America than is Britain .
John Webster London â€¢â€ˆYou are right that Julian Assange is not exactly a total hero , and he 's probably safer against US extradition if he 's in Sweden than in Britain .
But the sheer vengefulness and ugliness of the noises coming from much of the US has to be a cause for concern .
They want to try him for treason ( despite not being an American ) and espionage ( though every member of every non - US intelligence service in the world could be accused in the same way ) .
This should not be dismissed as just the manic extremes sounding off , if only because these people might be in power in a few months ' time .
Given this and the gleefully harsh treatment of Bradley Manning even under the present regime , and the noticeably cool and proviso - ridden Swedish response about guarantees against further extradition , it is probably best if some way is found to pack him off to Ecuador .
Roger Schafir London â€¢â€ˆThe left and radical movement have often been associated with well - known figures who have been less than ideal despite their undoubted qualities .
Henry Hunt who spoke at Peterloo in 1819 was involved in doubtful business deals , while William Cobbett was prone to voicing antisemitic views .
Yet the ruling order of the day hated them not for this
but because they were a thorn in the side of the establishment .
Fast forward almost 200 years and Julian Assange fits the model .
Certainly he needs to address allegations of sexual assault and rape which he appears to take rather less seriously than is warranted .
But he is the focus for so much attention not for this reason â€ “ after all , western governments regularly welcome and deal with people who are guilty of far greater crimes
â€ “
but because he blew the whistle on the debacle of the Iraq war .
Keith Flett London â€¢â€ˆIf the UK government is unwilling to accept the view of Ecuador that Julian Assange deserves political asylum because he fears for his freedom to continue as a journalist , why did they not insist that Swedish prosecutors interview him in the Ecuadorean embassy before the decision to grant asylum was reached ?
As that has not been done , how can we even consider extradition to Sweden ?
The solution should be similar to the recent Chinese action when a dissident sought asylum in an American embassy .
The dissident and his family were assisted to leave the embassy , escorted to an airport and flown to the country which had offered asylum .
Owen Ephraim Chelmsford , Essex â€¢â€ˆI seem to recall that when General Pinochet was being detained in London on a Spanish arrest warrant the British government was unable to fulfil its extradition obligations and he was allowed to escape back to his Chilean bolthole .
It seems that in Britain you stand a better chance of avoiding extradition if you are a murderous fascist dictator than if you are a champion of free speech and open government .
But of course we must dismiss from our minds any suspicion that in both cases it was and is Washington that has reminded London where its real obligations ( and best interests ) lie .
Perish the thought .
Adrian Marlowe The Hague , Netherlands â€¢â€ˆWilliam Hague says the UK does not recognise diplomatic asylum .
Strange .
The UK did recognise the concept of diplomatic asylum when the Hungarian Cardinal Mindszenty was sentenced to death by the communist authorities for supporting the anti - communist uprising in Hungary in 1956 .
Mindszenty spent 15 years in diplomatic asylum in the American embassy in Budapest .
Strange that the UK authorities did not protest then .
But maybe Hague is too young to actually know of this precedent .
Jan Culik University of Glasgow"
2012-08-19,"Amid the estimated 100 protesters , 50 police , a noisy helicopter and rained - on press corps gathered in Knightsbridge on Sunday afternoon , two women were missing .
They are referred to as Miss A and Miss W â€ “ that is , when they are mentioned at all in the hullabaloo over Julian Assange .
Yet Miss A and Miss W are at the heart of this story , however convenient it may be for Mr Assange 's supporters to elide them .
After all , it is their allegations that Mr Assange sexually assaulted them two years ago that are the reason why the WikiLeaks founder faces extradition to Sweden .
It is to avoid questioning by Swedish prosecutors that Mr Assange battled extradition orders for almost 18 months with the best legal representation money can buy â€ “ before finally jumping bail two months ago .
It is to avoid being confronted with accusations of rape and sexual assault that Mr Assange is now holed up in the Ecuadorean embassy â€ “ and was forced to say his piece from a diplomat 's first - floor balcony , for fear of otherwise being collared by the police .
Yet to listen to the speechifying from his supporters , you would never have guessed at any of this ; their remarks concerned western Europe 's "" neocon juntas "" or the political change sweeping Latin America .
And when it was Mr Assange 's turn to speak , he allied his struggle with Russian punk protesters Pussy Riot , with the New York Times , and indeed "" the revolutionary values "" upon which America was founded .
This is his traditional method of argument : to conflate a number of causes â€ “ big and small , international and individual â€ “ into one , so that Mr Assange is WikiLeaks , which is freedom of speech , which holds powerful states to account ; and so on , ever upwards .
Yet Mr Assange is not facing a show trial over the journalism of WikiLeaks ; he is dodging allegations of rape .
To confuse the two does no favours to the organisation he created , which has done so much excellent work .
It is commonly accepted that such allegations take a huge toll , with those making them forced to divulge intimate details .
In the case of Miss A and Miss W , it is worse .
Mr Assange 's legal team has referred to the case as a "" honeytrap "" ; and their own lives have been smeared across the web by self - styled followers of WikiLeaks .
Imagine enduring nearly two years of that and then watching the man you believe assaulted you addressing an adoring throng on the subject of oppression .
His one point that did deserve amplifying was about Bradley Manning .
Accused of giving classified material to WikiLeaks , the US private has been locked up without a trial , and subjected to treatment that Hillary Clinton 's own spokesman , PJ Crowley termed "" counterproductive and stupid "" ( before being forced to resign ) .
But there is much else that does n't stack up in Mr Assange 's presentation of his case .
This champion of radical transparency has n't helped Swedish prosecutors with their inquiries .
There was his remark about people being jailed for exercising freedom of speech , "" There is unity in the oppression .
There must be absolute unity and determination in the response "" , and yet taking shelter in a country that , according to Reporters Without Borders , shut down six radio stations and two TV stations in just one fortnight this June .
And ultimately there is the repeated suggestion from Mr Assange 's supporters that if he goes to Sweden he will face extradition to the US to be prosecuted for treason .
Yet there is no serious evidence that Washington plans to start such proceedings ; and if it ever did , the political and public opposition in Sweden as well as Britain and across the world would be massive .
But that is precisely the point : the valuable service performed by Mr Assange at WikiLeaks is a different issue from the serious accusations facing him in Sweden .
Conflating the two may provide a rhetorical rush , as it did in Knightsbridge on Sunday ; but over the longer term it badly damages the reputation of WikiLeaks and does Mr Assange 's case no practical good .
â€¢
This article will be opened to comments on Monday morning ."
2012-08-19,"The balcony of Ecuador 's London embassy is a mere 10 ft above street level .
Theoretically speaking , it might have been possible for a tall Metropolitan police officer to have leapt up and grabbed Julian Assange by the leg .
Or possibly his foot .
Certainly , there were plenty of men in blue to be seen around the embassy on Sunday .
Scotland Yard was taking no chances .
Before Assange appeared at the balcony â€ “ in scenes that might have sprung from Monty Python 's Life of Brian â€ “ officers had comprehensively sealed off the area .
Several were lurking at the side of the red brick building .
Others stood grim - faced in front of a scrum of media and WikiLeaks supporters packing the Knightsbridge pavement .
There was even a police helicopter .
It circled noisily overhead .
If Assange had planned to escape by hot - air balloon
â€ “
well , the Met had that one covered .
At around 2.30pm Assange emerged on to the balcony , a pallid figure dressed in a business - blue shirt and maroon tie .
There was an enormous roar .
Assange managed a thumbs - up , then tapped the microphone and inquired : "" Can you hear me ? ""
This , perhaps , was the moment for someone to shout : "" ' E 's not the Messiah ! '
E 's a very naughty boy ! ""
But from the Met officers there was a gloomy silence .
As part of his asylum deal with Ecuador , Assange had agreed not to make any political statements from the embassy â€ “ the cramped ground and first floors of an SW1 townhouse , right next to Harrods .
In reality , the manner of his balcony appearance â€ “ just feet away from the police , next to a large Ecuadorean flag â€ “ amounted to a giant , taunting raspberry blown in the face of William Hague .
In a carefully crafted 10-minute speech , the WikiLeaks founder thanked those who had made his escape from a Swedish extradition warrant possible : Ecuador 's president , Rafael Correa ( who is having a good Assange crisis ) ; the country 's foreign minister , Ricardo PatiÃ±o , and the freedom - loving nations of South America .
He mentioned many of them by name , Argentina twice .
Unsurprisingly , Assange reserved his harshest words for the US .
He called on President Obama to stop its "" witch - hunt against WikiLeaks "" .
And he said the FBI should "" dissolve "" its investigation against him .
He also called for Bradley Manning , the alleged source of classified material from US war logs and diplomatic missions passed to WikiLeaks , to be released from military jail .
Assange 's supporters loved it .
So did his celebrity backers .
Earlier , Craig Murray , the UK 's former ambassador in Tashkent , denounced Hague in front of the embassy for his "" threat "" last week to enter the building and seize Assange .
Murray said "" neo - conservative juntas "" now ran western Europe and said that he too had sheltered dissidents inside the British embassy in Uzbekistan .
Tariq Ali , meanwhile , said Europe had much to learn from South America .
We should "" change "" our "" gaze "" .
Someone shouted back : "" So should you , mate . ""
But for Assange sceptics this was more of the same : an attempt to yoke the principles of free speech and justice ( good ) with a criminal case in Sweden ( a matter for the courts ) .
Assange said nothing about the allegations of sexual misconduct that have got him into this mess â€ “ allegations separate from any theoretical attempt to indict him in the US .
Assange also called for the release of the Russian punk band Pussy Riot .
His appeal might have had more credibility had Assange not worked for Russia Today , the TV channel owned by the same Kremlin that put the band in jail .
Nonetheless , the balcony drama was another PR triumph for Assange , now recast as a South American revolutionary hero akin to SimÃ³n BolÃ­var .
Filming from the balcony was a crew from Ecuador state TV .
This is all good news for Correa , who has written up this latest episode in the Assange soap opera as one small nation 's plucky battle against the evils of Anglo - American imperialism .
Still , one senses Scotland Yard may get the last laugh .
Ecuador is a long way away . ""
He 's not going anywhere , "" one police officer said of Assange , as the crowds melted away in the rain ."
2012-08-19,"UK - Ecuador relations "" Inside this embassy after dark I could hear teams of police swarming up into the building through its internal fire escape
but I knew there would be witnesses and that is because of you , "" said the WikiLeaks founder , addressing supporters who have been turning out to maintain vigils outside the building .
"" If the UK did not throw away the Vienna conventions the other night it is because the world was watching and the world was watching because you were watching . ""
Julian Assange 's reference relates to the second stairwell inside the building in Knightsbridge , west London , that houses the Ecuadorean embassy and other occupants .
This stairwell , which would be used to exit the building in an emergency , splits off to the front and back doors and leads to each of the occupants .
It is not diplomatic territory .
A source who was in the embassy on Wednesday night agreed with Assange 's use of the word "" swarming "" , adding : "" The kitchen of the embassy leads to the stairwell and the truth is that there was such a hullabaloo at around 9 pm that we opened the door from it to look out . ""
Once we saw them we just closed the door again
and obviously they could n't come over the threshold .
""
The source added that the police presence at that time of the night was "" remarkable "" because about five supporters were in the "" pen "" opposite the embassy , but about 20 police officers were outside the building , along with units from the Metropolitan police territorial support group .
The Ecuadorean embassy consists of a ground floor apartment , some 10 rooms in all , inside an imposing redbrick apartment block in London 's Knightsbridge area .
Other occupants are reported to include members of the Saudi royal family .
Bradley Manning "" Bradley Manning must be released .
If Bradley Manning did as he is accused , he is a hero , an example to all of us and one of the world 's foremost political prisoners , "" said Assange .
The 24-year - old is currently detained at an army base awaiting military trial .
He has been indicted on 22 counts relating to the leaks , including charges of aiding the enemy .
The crime carries a maximum penalty of death , although prosecutors have indicated that they will not seek the ultimate punishment .
Assange noted that Manning has spent more than 800 days behind bars without trial .
For a large chunk of that time he was kept in conditions that the UN 's special rapporteur on torture , Juan Mendez , has described as cruel and inhuman .
The young soldier 's lawyers are currently seeking to have the charges against Manning dismissed , citing the US army 's "" flagrant violation "" of his right not to be punished prior to trial .
Manning 's civilian lawyer , David Coombs , has said : "" If the department of justice got their way , they would get a plea in this case , and get my client to be named as one of the witnesses to go after Julian Assange and WikiLeaks . ""
FBI and WikiLeaks
The US must "" renounce its witch - hunt against WikiLeaks "" , Assange demanded .
It is thought a grand jury in Virginia has been investigating the Australian citizen with a view to conducting a criminal prosecution based on FBI evidence against him .
Assange called on President Barack Obama to "" dissolve "" the investigation , adding : "" The US must vow that it will not seek to prosecute our staff or our supporters .
The US must pledge before the world that it will not prosecute journalists for shining a light on the secret crimes of the powerful . ""
There must be no more "" foolish talk "" about seeking to put on trial organisations such as WikiLeaks and the New York Times , he said .
That newspaper â€ “ along with the Guardian â€
“ was one of the media outlets that first published documents put out by WikiLeaks .
Pussy Riot Assange 's attempt to draw parallels between himself and the jailed Russian punk band Pussy Riot was met with praise and criticism , in the latter case primarily because of his partnership with Russia Today , the Kremlin 's English - language propaganda arm .
"" On Friday , a Russian band was sentenced to two years in jail for a political performance , "" he said .
"" There is unity in the oppression .
There must be absolute unity and determination in the response . ""
Some observers pointed out that Assange avoided any reference to dissidents or free speech campaigners in Russia while carrying out interviews with international figures as part of a series broadcast exclusively by Russia Today .
Evgeny Morozov , the author of the Net Delusion :
The Dark Side of Internet Freedom , tweeted sarcastically : "" Great that Assange supports Pussy Riot .
Perhaps , he can have them on his TV show .
Oh wait .... ""
He later tweeted : "" Another idea for a great Assange show on RT : interview the Belarusian whistleblower Alexander Barankov about to be extradited from Ecuador . ""
Others appeared to see the comparison differently .
Journalist David Hershkovits asked on Twitter : "" Is # Assange the west 's # pussyriot .
Calling attention to injustice . ""
His family Assange 's mention of his family was a rare reference to his personal background .
He said : "" To my family and my children who have been denied their father .
Forgive me .
We will be reunited soon . ""
Associated Press said he was father to two children .
His own parents have been vocal in their support for him .
His biological father , John Shipton , who said his son did not get to know him until his mid-20s , described his son as a "" great dissident "" .
His mother , Christine Assange , met Ecuador 's president , Rafael Correa , in Quito this month to discuss the fate of her son .
Sweden
The nearest Assange came to mentioning the Swedish authorities , who want to question him about sexual assault allegations , was in thanking "" the people "" of Sweden , who he said had supported him .
After name - checking a range of Latin American states , he expressed gratitude "" to the people of the United States , the United Kingdom , Sweden and Australia who have supported me in strength even when their governments have not "" ."
2012-08-19,"The WikiLeaks founder , Julian Assange , has urged the United States to end its "" war on whistleblowers "" as he used a dramatic appearance on the balcony of the Ecuadorean embassy to thank supporters for backing his fight against extradition .
Assange thanked the nation of Ecuador for taking a "" stand for justice "" in giving him political asylum , while warning that the United States risked shunting the world into an era of journalistic oppression .
He appeared on the balcony of the South American country 's embassy in London , where he has been taking refuge for two months as he seeks to avoid extradition to Sweden to face questioning on sexual assault allegations .
Assange thanked the leaders and people of Ecuador for supporting him and also staff at the London embassy "" who have shown me hospitality and kindness , despite the threats we all received "" .
He thanked the governments and people of Argentina , Brazil and other Latin American countries who defended the right to asylum and people in the US , UK , Sweden and Australia who supported him in strength even when their governments did not . ""
As WikiLeaks stands under threat , so does the freedom of expression and the health of all our societies .
We must use this moment to articulate the choice that is before the government of the United States of America , "" he said .
"" Will it return to and reaffirm the revolutionary values it was founded on or will it lurch off the precipice , dragging us all into a dangerous and oppressive world in which journalists fall silent under the fear of prosecution and citizens must whisper in the dark ? ""
I say it must turn back .
I ask President Obama to do the right thing : the United States must renounce its witch - hunt against WikiLeaks . ""
There must be no "" foolish talk "" of prosecuting media organisations , be it WikiLeaks or be it the New York Times newspaper .
Assange also called on the US to end its "" war on whistleblowers "" , and demanded that Bradley Manning , the US army intelligence analyst suspected of leaking the information , be released .
He has been charged with transferring classified data and delivering national defence information to an unauthorised source and faces up to 52 years in jail .
Assange described Manning as a hero and "" an example to all of us "" , which drew cheers from scores of supporters . ""
On Wednesday , Bradley Manning spent his 815th day of detention without trial , "" said Assange .
"" The legal maximum is 120 days . ""
Assange referred to recent jailings of people for exercising their freedom of speech and called for enthusiastic opposition to such oppressive actions .
"" There is unity in the oppression .
There must be absolute unity and determination in the response . ""
The Australian also thanked other helpful South American nations and supporters around the world , plus his family , including his children , "" who have been denied their father "" .
He said : "" Forgive me , we will be reunited soon . ""
Assange emerged at the balcony at the embassy in Knightsbridge to loud cheers from his supporters .
He told them : "" I am here today because I can not be there with you today .
But thankyou for coming , thankyou for your resolve , your generosity of spirit . ""
On Wednesday night , after a threat was sent to this embassy , the police descended on this building .
You came out in the middle of the night to watch over it , and you brought the world 's eyes with you . ""
Inside this embassy in the dark , I could hear teams of police swarming up inside the building through its internal fire escape . ""
But I knew there would be witnesses , and that is because of you .
"" If the UK did not throw away the Vienna Conventions the other night , it is because the world was watching .
And the world was watching because you were watching . ""
So the next time that somebody tells you that it is pointless to defend those rights that we hold dear , remind them of your vigil in the dark before the embassy of Ecuador .
Remind them how , in the morning , the sun came up on a different world , and a courageous Latin American nation took a stand for justice . ""
Earlier Assange 's legal adviser , Baltasar GarzÃ³n , said Assange had instructed his lawyers "" to carry out a legal action "" to protect his rights .
He told media representatives outside the embassy : "" Julian Assange has always fought for truth and justice and has defended human rights and continues to do so . ""
He demands that WikiLeaks and his own rights be respected . ""
Julian Assange has instructed his lawyers to carry out a legal action in order to protect the rights of WikiLeaks , Julian himself and all those currently being investigated . ""
Assange entered the building seeking asylum on 19 June and has been inside since .
Last week it was announced he had been granted political asylum , prompting a major diplomatic row between Ecuador , Sweden and the British government , which insists it is legally obliged to hand him over .
The foreign secretary , William Hague , has made it clear that Assange will not be allowed safe passage out of the country .
Assange denies the allegations he faces in Sweden and fears being transferred to America if he travels to contest them .
He enraged the US government in 2010 when his WikiLeaks website published tranches of secret US diplomatic cables ."
2012-08-19,"Julian Assange has challenged the US to end its "" witch - hunt "" of WikiLeaks and release the army private accused of feeding a trove of classified information to the whistleblowing website .
In a defiant message delivered from the balcony of the Ecuadorian embassy in London , Assange , who Swedish prosecutors want extradited over claims of sexual assault , said America must dissolve its investigation into his organisation .
Urging President Barack Obama to "" do the right thing "" , he also called for the immediate release of Bradley Manning , the young soldier accused of being behind the biggest leak of state secrets in US history .
The 24-year - old is currently being detained at an army base awaiting military trial .
He has been indicted on 22 counts relating to the leaks , including charges of aiding the enemy .
The crime carries a maximum penalty of death , although prosecutors have indicated that they will not seek the ultimate punishment .
In his address on Sunday , Assange noted that Manning has now spent more than 800 days behind bars without trial .
For a large chunk of that time Manning was kept in conditions that the UN 's special rapporteur on torture , Juan Mendez , has described as cruel and inhuman .
The young soldier 's lawyers are current seeking to have the charges against Manning dismissed , citing the US army 's "" flagrant violation "" of his right not to be punished prior to trial .
His civilian lawyer David Coombs has lodged legal documents detailing his treatment at the Quantico marine base in Virginia , where Manning was kept before being transferred to a softer prison under huge pressure from human rights activists .
The so - called Article 13 motion revealed that for months after his arrest in May 2010 , the soldier was held in a 6 foot by 8 foot cell for 23 or 24 hours a day .
In addition , when not sleeping , the suspect was banned from lying down , or even using a wall to support him .
It also claimed that Manning was punished through "" degradation and humiliation "" , notably by forcing him to stand outside his cell naked during a morning inspection .
This , his lawyer claims , was "" retaliatory punishment "" for speaking out over his treatment .
It has been suggested that the harsh treatment was used to intimidate Manning into a plea deal with US prosecutors , under which he would testify against Assange at a future date .
At a lengthy pre - trial hearing in December , Coombs said : "" If the department of justice got their way , they would get a plea in this case , and get my client to be named as one of the witnesses to go after Julian Assange and WikiLeaks . ""
In Sunday 's statement , Assange made an impassioned appeal for Manning to be freed . ""
Bradley Manning must be released .
If Bradley Manning did as he is accused , he is a hero , an example to all of us and one of the world 's foremost political prisoners , "" he said .
The US must also "" renounce its witch - hunt against WikiLeaks "" , Assange demanded from the Ecuadorian embassy .
It is thought that a grand jury in Virginia has been investigating the Australian citizen with a view to conducting a criminal prosecution based on FBI evidence against him .
Assange called on President Obama to "" dissolve "" that federal probe on Saturday , adding : "" The US must vow that it will not seek to prosecute our staff or our supporters . ""
He continued : "" The US must pledge before the world that it will not prosecute journalists for shining a light on the secret crimes of the powerful . ""
As such , there must be no more "" foolish talk "" about seeking a to put on trial organisations such as WikiLeaks and the New York Times , Assange said .
The newspaper â€ “ along with the Guardian â€
“ was one of the media outlets that first published documents put out by the whistleblowing website ."

2012-08-19,"While Julian Assange was not a household name in Ecuador before this week , figures from across the political spectrum have rallied round the government of Rafael Correa over the perceived threat from the Foreign Office against the country 's embassy in London .
For many , granting asylum to the WikiLeaks founder has became a matter of principle in order to defend the country 's sovereignty .
Correa dedicated a large part of his regular Saturday television and radio broadcast to the subject , saying that if Ecuador had threatened to enter a foreign embassy , other countries would have accused him of being a dictator .
"" They have n't found out that the Americas are free and sovereign and that we do n't accept meddling and colonialism of any kind , "" he said .
"" They do n't know who they are dealing with . ""
Sweden had not given enough guarantees that it would not be extraditing Assange to a third country , he said , and the Ecuadorean government wanted to give him protection .
With his country suddenly playing a key role in a high - profile diplomatic standoff , many analysts believe Correa is likely to use the case to build capital at home ahead of next year 's presidential election , when he is expected to run again .
But writing in the opposition newspaper El Comercio , columnist Marco Arauz suggested that in the long term the row may count against Correa . ""
By drawing the world 's attention with this superhuman effort in Assange 's favour , the government will revive the debate over its own intolerance against the independent press , "" he wrote .
El Comercio , openly hostile to Correa , is one of several privately owned media organisations that have born the brunt of the president 's hostility .

Ricaurte , the executive director of the Quito - based media watchdog Fundamedios , said that his organisation has registered 533 attacks on journalists in Ecuador since 2008 , 100 of them this year .
Twenty radio and television stations have been shut .
Ricaurte said the panorama for journalists in Ecuador is "" increasingly asphyxiating "" .
"" We 've suffered five years of constant harassment and persecution which begins with the president 's own hostile discourse , "" said Ricaurte .
Human rights groups say only Cuba has a worse record in the Americas on press freedom .
One of the latest incidents reported to Fundamedios involved the editor of the local newspaper La Hora , who had written critical editorials about the granting of asylum to Assange .
Orlando Gomez , also a correspondent for the Colombian magazine Semana , said a man stepped off the back of a motorcycle at a road junction , asked if he was Mr Gomez then smashed his car window with an iron bar ."
2012-08-20,"As Occupy London activists demonstrate in support of Julian Assange outside the Ecuadorean embassy , an argument has broken out within and around the movement over whether it should be backing the fugitive Wikileaks founder at all . ""
Occupy London has still not come to a collective decision about the Assange issue .
Some object to his extradition to Sweden , some do n't , "" tweeted Occupy London 's Twitter account , which has been attempting to rally support for Assange .
Activists have stood with placards outside the embassy and live - streamed coverage of events on the internet .
A tweet sent later on Sunday evening insisted : "" Once again , to avoid any confusion
â€
“
There is currently no universal agreement that Occupy London does in fact support Julian Assange . ""
Some activists , including a number of those who supported the long - running occupation outside St Paul 's cathedral and have been waiting for what could emerge as Occupy 's next big initiative , have expressed disappointment . ""
Unbelievable that a crowd turned up to SUPPORT # assange .
Very sad sight and a shame that these rape apologists have poisoned # occupy london "" said one Twitter user .
She added : "" I feel sorry for the people who I know are excellent who put a lot of time and effort into occupy . ""
However , some of the activists associated with Occupy who have turned up outside the embassy have stressed their presence is about showing solidarity with Wikileaks rather than necessarily endorsing Assange .
Naomi Colvin , a London - based writer and activist who has acted as a spokeswoman for Occupy , said she believed the global movement would never have happened without the whistleblowing website .
"" The energy that Wikileaks produced and sense of purpose was certainly responsible in a large part for Occupy and a lot of people around the world realising themselves politically and that certainly happened to me "" said Colvin , who said she was speaking in an individual capacity .
"" On top of that , Wikileaks and Julian Assange has been very supportive of Occupy in London , so there is a sense that people want to support him for that reason .
What he and that organisation have done is genuinely important , while what the British government has done in the past week is clearly out of order and clearly disproportionate .
People have a right to be annoyed about that . ""
Colvin agreed that a debate was taking place among supporters of Occupy but added that the movement had always been able to encompass differing view points .
She added : "" Of course , to be supportive of Wikileaks is not to downplay questions about violence against a person or rape . """
2012-08-20,"Downing Street has said Britain is still committed to seeking a diplomatic solution with Ecuador in the standoff over the proposed extradition to Sweden of Julian Assange .
But British diplomats in the Ecuadorean capital , Quito , and in other regional capitals have communicated the message that David Cameron is adamant Assange will not be granted safe passage .
They say Britain is under a legal obligation to extradite Assange to Sweden to face allegations of sexual misconduct .
The government 's thinking was outlined by the prime minister 's spokesman at the weekly Downing Street lobby briefing .
The spokesman said : "" Our hope is that we can reach a diplomatic solution and we are doing what we can to achieve that .
"" We will not grant safe passage for Mr Assange .
Under our law , having exhausted all the options of appeal , we are obliged to extradite him to Sweden .
It is our intention to carry out that obligation .
We will continue talking to the Ecuadorean government and others to try and find a diplomatic solution here . ""
On Sunday , Assange appeared on the first - floor balcony of the Ecuadorean embassy in Knightsbridge to declare he was facing a "" witch - hunt "" led by the US .
Assange was granted political asylum last week by Rafael Correa , Ecuador 's president , two months after the WikiLeaks founder sought refuge in the embassy .
Ecuador tried to maintain diplomatic pressure on Britain , which warned last week it could revoke the diplomatic status of its embassy , by convening a meeting of foreign ministers from the 12-strong Unasur South American union in Guayaquil , Ecuador 's largest city .
The ministers condemned the British warning over the status of Ecuador 's embassy but declined to endorse Correa 's decision to grant asylum to Assange .
Downing Street said British diplomats had been explaining to members of Unasur why Britain was determined to extradite Assange .
The prime minister 's spokesman said : "" We are obliged to extradite this man .
He faces some very serious allegations in Sweden .
The extradition case has been heard in our courts .
We have been through the process .
We now have to proceed with our obligation , which is to extradite him to Sweden . ""
He [ the prime minister ] thinks we need to meet our obligations and that means extraditing him to Sweden .
We will be making our position clear to the Ecuadorean government , to others in that region , to explain why this is the process and why we have to follow this process under the law . ""
The spokesman defended the Foreign Office 's decision to write to Ecuadorean officials last week pointing out that Britain could , under the Diplomatic and Consular Premises Act 1987 , revoke the diplomatic status of its embassy if it "" ceases to use land for the purposes of its mission or exclusively for the purposes of a consular post "" .
William Hague , the foreign secretary , denied Ecuadorean claims that this amounted to a threat to storm the embassy .
The prime minister 's spokesman said : "" All we were doing last week was setting out the position as it stands .
We were simply clarifying the legal position , no more than that .
We will continue to talk to the Ecuadoreans to try to find a way forward here . """
2012-08-20,"The diplomatic standoff between Britain and Ecuador deepened on Sunday after WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange used an extraordinary appearance on the first - floor balcony of Ecuador 's London embassy to berate the United States .
With Metropolitan police officers watching from metres away , Assange called on President Obama to abandon what he called a "" witch - hunt "" against WikiLeaks .
He said an alleged "" FBI investigation "" against his whistleblowing website should be "" dissolved "" and that the US should go back to its original "" revolutionary "" values . ""
As WikiLeaks stands under threat , so does the freedom of expression and the health of our societies , "" Assange said , standing on a white balcony just above the pavement , and flanked by Ecuador 's yellow , blue and red flag .
He added : "" I ask President Obama to do the right thing : the United States must renounce its witch - hunt against WikiLeaks . ""
Assange also thanked Ecuador 's social democrat president , Rafael Correa , for granting him political asylum .
Correa 's decision , announced last Thursday , has set off a growing international row .
Assange also thanked several other Latin American countries for their support â€ “ implicitly warning Britain that any dispute with Ecuador could rapidly snowball into a conflict with the entire region .
More than 50 police officers surrounded the embassy in Knightsbridge , south - west London , on Sunday , with a police helicopter in the skies above , but they were clearly under orders not to try to arrest the WikiLeaks founder .
Assange addressed around 100 well - wishers , with supporters including Tariq Ali and former British ambassador Craig Murray making speeches from the street .
Assange spoke for 10 minutes .
He appeared cheerful , if unsurprisingly pale .
This was his first public appearance since he slipped into the embassy two months ago and the latest surreal episode in a soap opera that has seen him go from the High Court to house arrest in Norfolk and now to an embassy camp - bed in genteel Kensington and Chelsea , less than 50 m from Harrods .
The 41-year - old Australian took refuge in the embassy after the supreme court ordered his extradition to Sweden , where he faces allegations of serious sexual misconduct .
Assange pointedly did not mention those allegations on Sunday , instead casting his predicament as a universal one of free speech struggling to survive in a "" dangerous and oppressive world "" .
Britain says it is obliged to implement EU extradition law and will arrest Assange the second he leaves the building .
Speaking from the balcony in SW1 , Assange claimed that the Met had come close to storming the embassy late last Wednesday .
Britain sent a letter to Ecuador last week stating that it believes it is entitled to arrest Assange inside the building under the Diplomatic and Consular Premises Act 1987 .
The claim has enraged the government in Quito , which says the 1961 Vienna convention protects its â€ “ and others ' â€ “ diplomatic territory .
Assange said : "" Inside this embassy in the dark , I could hear teams of police swarming up inside the building through its internal fire escape . ""
He said the only reason the UK "" did not throw away the Vienna convention the other night "" was because "" the world is watching "" .
He also thanked embassy staff , "" who have shown me hospitality and kindness , despite the threats we all received "" .
Despite the heavy police presence on Sunday , the Foreign Office is clearly trying to find a diplomatic solution to the row with Ecuador .
Foreign secretary William Hague has made it clear there is no suggestion that police would "" storm "" the embassy .
But Assange 's provocative balcony appearance , in which he praised "" courageous Ecuador "" while disparaging Britain , his long - suffering host country , will have won him few new friends in Downing Street .
Assange 's supporters claim that if he is sent to Sweden he is in danger of being extradited to the US to be charged with espionage .
Sweden has vehemently denied this .
On Sunday Assange said : "" Will it [ the US ] return to and reaffirm the revolutionary values it was founded on , or will it lurch off the precipice , dragging us all into a dangerous and oppressive world ? ""
He said there should be no "" foolish talk "" about prosecuting media organisations , mentioning not only WikiLeaks but also the New York Times , a paper Assange has previously bitterly criticised .
He also called on the US to end its "" war on whistleblowers "" , and demanded that Bradley Manning , the US army intelligence analyst suspected of leaking information , be released .
Manning has been charged with transferring classified data and delivering national defence information to an unauthorised source .
He faces up to 52 years in jail .
Assange called him a hero and "" an example to all of us "" â€ “ drawing cheers from WikiLeaks fans packing the Knightsbridge pavement . ""
On Wednesday , Bradley Manning spent his 815th day of detention without trial , "" Assange said .
"" The legal maximum is 120 days . ""
Assange also made a rare mention of his children , "" who have been denied their father "" .
He said he hoped soon to be back with them and the rest of his family , adding : "" Forgive me , we will be reunited soon . """
2012-08-20,"Anti - rape campaigners have accused George Galloway of a "" deeply disturbing and disappointing "" attitude towards sexual violence after he claimed a rape allegation levelled at the WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange had no basis because having sex with a woman when she is asleep is not rape .
In an extraordinary and graphic speech made through a weekly online video broadcast called Good Night with George Galloway , the Respect party MP for Bradford West addressed allegations of rape , sexual molestation and unlawful coercion made by two women â€ “ known as woman A and woman B â€ “ Assange met on a visit to Stockholm in August 2010 , including having sex with one of them while she was asleep .
Assange strongly denies the allegations .
"" Even taken at its worst , if the allegations made by these two women were true , 100 % true , and even if a camera in the room captured them , they do n't constitute rape , "" Galloway said .
"" At least not rape as anyone with any sense can possibly recognise it .
And somebody has to say this . ""
Woman A met Julian Assange , invited him back to her flat , gave him dinner , went to bed with him , had consensual sex with him , claims that she woke up to him having sex with her again .
This is something which can happen , you know .
I mean , not everybody needs to be asked prior to each insertion .
"" Lawyers and anti - rape campaigners said Galloway was wrong and the law is clear that consent is required every time someone has sex .
Galloway said he was speaking out because "" a reign of intellectual terror has descended in Britain "" on this issue and he believed the sexual assault claims were part of a "" setup "" intended to deliver Assange into the hands of the US authorities angered at his publication of state secrets .
"" It is staggering just how ignorant , factually and morally incorrect George Galloway can be , "" said Katie Russell , spokeswoman for Rape Crisis England and Wales .
"" It is very concerning that an elected MP should display such ignorance of the law for all the women and men he represents .
It sends a negative message to all the women and girls who have experienced sexual violence and a disturbing message to perpetrators .
He says he does n't believe these women or these allegations and that is a very powerful statement because every woman or girl who has made an allegation of sexual violence deserves to have that treated fairly . ""
A magistrates court has already ruled that : "" What is alleged here is that Mr Assange ' deliberately consummated sexual intercourse with her by improperly exploiting that she , due to sleep , was in a helpless state ' .
In this country that would amount to rape . ""
The high court also ruled : "" It is clear that the allegation is that he had sexual intercourse with her [ woman A ] when she was not in a position to consent
and so he could not have had any reasonable belief that she did .
"" In his broadcast Galloway said : "" Some people believe that when you go to bed with somebody , take off your clothes , and have sex with them and then fall asleep , you 're already in the sex game with them .
It might be really bad manners not to have tapped her on the shoulder and said : ' Do you mind if I do it again ? . '
It might be really sordid and bad sexual etiquette , but whatever else it is , it is not rape or you bankrupt the term rape of all meaning . ""
Sandy Brindley , national co - ordinator for Rape Crisis Scotland said Galloway 's comments were "" very unhelpful "" and supported an enduring but false notion of "" real "" or "" serious "" rape . ""
It can be just as devastating to be raped asleep by someone you know as it is to be raped by a stranger in the street , "" she said .
Assange remains holed up in the Ecuadorean embassy in Knightsbridge , as he attempts to avoid extradition to Sweden where he is wanted for questioning over sexual assault claims .
The lawfulness of a European arrest warrant issued by the Swedish authorities was confirmed in May by the UK 's supreme court .
Assange and his supporters believe that if he travels to Stockholm he may be rendered to the United States and charged with espionage for publishing leaked military logs from Iraq and Afghanistan and highly classified diplomatic cables from US embassies around the world .
They fear he faces life in prison , or even the death penalty in the US .
On Twitter , Galloway reacted dismissively to the uproar surrounding his remarks . ""
Oh how this ' liberal ' chorus of Pavlovian reaction must delight the Pentagon !
"" he tweeted . ""
Oh my , what a lot of ' liberal ' useful idiots the Empire can count on .
It 's about WIKILEAKS stupid ... ! ""
In a characteristically hectoring broadcast , Galloway also addressed allegations made by the second woman against Assange , over which he is wanted for questioning . ""
She claimed that while she did have consensual sex with him , the condom ripped and yet he continued to do it , "" he said .
"" Now you would n't just need to be in the room with the two of them to know the truth of this allegation .
I do n't want to take the biology too far , but you would actually need to be somewhere located inside the woman to know if that allegation were true .
And if it were true , is it rape ? ""
The Respect MP concluded by declaring : "" I think the whole thing is a setup .
I do n't understand how so many of you ca n't see that .
If he did these things , he 's a rat .
But the United States empire , the British empire , the imperial system that around the world is slaughtering human beings by the million , cutting their throats , starving them to death , leaving them to die of poverty and avoidable disease in their millions , is a much bigger rat , no ?
Imperialism is a much bigger rat than Julian Assange , no ?
So why would you want Assange to be delivered to the United States and silenced for ever , unless you were on the side of empire . """
2012-08-20,"â€¢ So were the police , as Julian Assange , claimed at the weekend , preparing to storm the Ecuadorean embassy in London â€ “ an act that would have turned international drama into international crisis and might well have resulted in the resignation of the foreign secretary , not to mention the commissioner ?
Scotland Yard , confronted , deals fully with this scenario .
Its statement , considered , nuanced , is : "" No . ""
Still we do know that they fret about the possibility that Assange might escape .
And one need only turn to the book WikiLeaks :
Inside Julian Assange 's War on Secrecy , written by Guardian colleagues David Leigh and Luke Harding , to be alive to the possibilities .
For chapter one tells of a two - hour journey from London to Norfolk taken by a woman with a crooked frame , a big coat and features obscured by a makeshift hairpiece .
She / he was Assange , escaping to a bolthole without detection , for he / she is notably resourceful .
Might be too foxy for William Hague .
â€¢
But if he slips away â€ “ whether disguised as Jessie J or smuggled out with the washing â€
“
we know that police will be stretching every sinew to catch up with him .
Officers are on a state of high alert , pursuing every possibility .
And it was , no doubt as part of this effort , that recently a fellow of our acquaintance â€ “ of high profession , fine character and high repute â€ “ was approached by two officers on a train which set out from London Paddington .
Excuse us , sir , but we believe there is a warrant out for your arrest , they said .
No there is n't , he replied , but who is it that you think I am ?
Julian Assange , they said , flashing warrant cards and accompanying him from the train to establish his bona fides .
All ended amicably , but there 'll be worse in days to come .
They 'll be pulling on noses , opening coats , lifting wigs .
â€¢ Much joy , meanwhile , as campaigners for gay marriage gain another high profile recruit , the mayor of London , Boris Johnson .
I see no reason why the happy state of marriage should be denied anyone , he says in a supportive message posted on YouTube , which never mentions the words gay or lesbian .
"" That 's why I 'm supporting Out4Marriage . ""
And this is good , very good ; much better than his previous position , that "" if gay marriage was OK â€ “ and I was uncertain on the issue â€ “
then I saw no reason in principle why a union should not be consecrated between three men , as well as two men ; or indeed three men and a dog "" .
Shows maturity .
Do n't knock it .
â€¢
The exam results are out .
The school playing fields row is raging .
But there have not been as many televised sightings of the education secretary / hero of the Tory right Michael Gove as one might expect .
This is a pity .
Panto is n't panto without the villain .
We should see more of him , and the wicked word in Whitehall is that we would but for the fact that the endless round of official dinners and similar sacrifices have caused him to become a bit pudgy and a little self - conscious .
Perhaps the cabinet should make PE compulsory .
â€¢
Finally , we recall what made us fond of David Mellor â€ “ former minister of fun , more recently the PR voice for the head - crackers of Bahrain .
His wiles are described in the new memoir by the former home secretary David Waddington .
Mellor was a junior minister under Waddington at the time of a reshuffle .
Thatcher decided that John Patten , another junior minister , should become minister for the arts .
But Patten neither knew or cared for the arts , and anyway , Waddington needed him .
So Waddington suggested Mellor .
He became "" quite apoplectic "" , writes Waddington .
"" It was an insult to offer him such a dead - end job . ""
The home secretary went into a meeting , only to be called from it to speak to Mellor again . ""
He was still waxing indignant and saying he was not prepared to take the job .
I got cross and went back to my meeting . ""
Half an hour later , however , Waddington turned on the TV .
"" There was David before the cameras , saying what a great honour had been bestowed on him â€ “
that minister for the arts was the job he had always wanted and he was the happiest man alive .
I thought it very sporting of him in the circumstances and proved what a grand trooper he was . ""
Then , as now , flexible , quick witted .

2012-08-21,"The hacking group Anonymous claims to have brought down British government websites in protest at the handling of Julian Assange 's bid to avoid extradition to Sweden .
The self - styled hacktivist group targeted the websites of No 10 and the Home Office early on Tuesday under what it called "" Operation Free Assange "" .
Hackers said they had also brought down websites belonging to the justice department and Department for Work and Pensions in the attack .
Anonymous vowed to continue targeting government websites as the diplomatic temperature around the WikiLeaks founder continued to rise .
The online DDOS ( distributed denial of service ) attacks , which also hit sites in Sweden , came as the Ecuadorian president Rafael Correa warned Britain that attempting to enter his country 's embassy in London would be an act of diplomatic suicide .
Speaking on state television as the standoff continued , Correa said : "" I think it would be suicidal for the United Kingdom .
After that , the diplomatic premises of [ the UK ] in other territories could be violated all over the world . ""
Downing Street has said it is committed to seeking a diplomatic solution with Ecuador over the standoff .
William Hague , the foreign secretary , has made it clear Britain is obliged to extradite Assange to Sweden to face questioning over allegations of sexual misconduct , which he denies .
Assange fears being transferred to the United States if he travels to contest the allegations .
The WikiLeaks founder has been in the embassy in Knightsbridge since mid - June and on Sunday addressed crowds of supporters from the balcony .
The speech , in which Assange took aim at the US and UK governments , has proved to be a rallying cry for Assange 's online supporters .
One Twitter account with 145,200 followers which is linked to the loose - knit group on Tuesday tweeted a picture of a man wearing an Anonymous mask , holding aloft a "" Free Assange "" poster outside what appeared to be the Ecuadorian embassy in London .
Another Anonymous Twitter account , which has 281,000 followers , tweeted during the Free Assange attacks : "" We 're living in oppressive times .
Sadly there 's no other option than fighting even if that means being outlawed . ""
Anonymous first came to prominence through its online attacks in support of Assange in December 2010 , after WikiLeaks released part of a huge cache of diplomatic cables .
The hacking collective subsequently targeted global finance websites including Visa and PayPal after those companies severed links with the whistleblowers ' website .
A Home Office spokeswoman said : "" The Home Office website was not hacked .
It was targeted by protesters on Monday night but only experienced very minor interruption to the service .
"" We had measures in place to protect the site and no other Home Office systems were affected . """

2012-08-21,"The Ecuadorean president has warned Britain not to attempt to enter his country 's embassy in London to seize Julian Assange , claiming that to do so would be an act of political suicide that would leave the UK 's diplomatic premises vulnerable the world over .
Speaking on state television days after his government announced it had decided to grant the WikiLeaks founder political asylum , Rafael Correa showed little sign of seeking to ease tensions with Britain , which threatened last week to use an obscure piece of legislation to enter the Ecuadorean embassy and arrest the Australian .
"" I think it would be suicidal for the United Kingdom , "" he said , according to the Spanish news agency Efe . ""
After that , the diplomatic premises of [ the UK ] in other territories could be violated all over the world . ""
Such a move , he added , would be "" disastrous "" for all countries , but especially for Britain .
Downing Street has said Britain is committed to seeking a diplomatic solution with Ecuador in the standoff over Assange , whom it insists it is obliged to extradite to Sweden to face questioning over allegations of sexual misconduct , which he denies .
But last week , as Ecuador prepared to announce its decision to grant Assange asylum , Foreign Office officials in Quito delivered a letter to the Ecuadorean government in which they claimed a legal right under the Diplomatic and Consular Premises Act 1987 to revoke an embassy 's diplomatic status .
The threat provoked an angry response from Correa .
Asked on Monday night whether he thought there was any chance the British authorities would carry out its threat , the BBC reported that the president said : "" While the United Kingdom has n't retracted or apologised , the danger still exists . ""
Assange has been in the embassy in Knightsbridge since mid - June , and , despite Quito 's offer , can not leave for the airport as Britain is refusing to give him safe passage .
The interview with Correa opened with a brief report from inside the embassy , showing the 41-year - old Assange embracing his lawyer Baltasar GarzÃ³n , minutes before he addressed supporters from the balcony outside on Sunday .
Speaking in advance of a meeting of the Organisation of American States on Friday , Correa said he hoped the gathering would provide him with strong backing from regional allies . ""
Remember that David beat Goliath .
And with many Davids it 's easier to bring down a number of Goliaths , "" he said .
"" So we 're hoping for clear and coherent backing because this violates all inter - American law , all international law , the Vienna convention and all diplomatic traditions of the last , at least , 300 years on a global scale . """
2012-08-21,"Hi there !
Was n't the weekend lovely ?
So warm and sunny with just a light breeze on which you could hear the gentle whisper "" Rape ... rape ... rape â€
¦ "" Rape does seem to be in the air these days , what with the Republican party in the US , certain devotees of Julian Assange around the world , and lazy comedians in Edinburgh , all talking quite a lot about it without apparently having a clue what it is .
So let 's clear things up .
Welcome to Rape :
The Idiot 's Primer .
Rape is rape is rape
It is testament to the determination of some folk to bend reality to their preferred viewpoint that there are so many intriguing words around these days for rape to make it seem , I do n't know , less rapey .
Two years ago "" sex by surprise "" , nobody 's favourite pudding ( "" Would madam prefer the apple pie Ã la mode , the tiramisu or the sex by surprise ? "" ) , was the hot new coinage in reference to Assange but now there 's a whole slew in the mix .
The scientifically challenged Republican politician Todd Akin referred in a now - infamous interview to something called "" legitimate rape "" which , strangely , Akin seemed to use to refer to a particularly nasty rape because in those extreme circumstances "" the female body has ways of shutting [ their reproductive organs ] down . ""
Now , leaving aside the question of how on earth a 65-year - old man with six children can be so clueless about female biology , this kind of differentiation between what 's a Proper Rape and what 's merely a Fake Rape is very popular in certain circles .
The term Akin was groping for was not the contradictory "" legitimate rape "" but
the tautological "" forcible rape "" , the term employed in HR3 , the No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act , which Akin co - sponsored , to refer to rapes that involve the woman being violently assaulted , as those are the only rapes that count , apparently .
So if you 're drugged and do n't put up a fight resulting in you getting a black eye or something similar , good news !
Your rape did n't count .
Bad news !
You wo n't get help paying for an abortion â€ “ not that you 'll need one , mind , because pregnancies through rape do n't happen , of course .
Eventually , the term was dropped from the bill â€ “ which then passed â€ “
but it just so happens that Akin 's co - sponsor on that measure was current GOP VP nominee Paul Ryan .
Akin later apologised for having "" misspoke "" about "" legitimate rape "" but the truth is all he had done was articulate the biological ignorance and misogyny that is rife in his party , the kind of thinking that lies behind so many of their policies and ambitions , as well as the even more common belief that some rapes count and some are acts sluts bring upon themselves .
It 's not just politicians .
Whoopi Goldberg notoriously once said Roman Polanski had n't committed "" rape - rape "" back in 1977 , although seeing that a 13-year - old child told how he drugged and sodomised her , I 'd hate to know what Goldberg considers actual rape .
This week George Galloway took to his video blog , the apparently unironically named Good Night with George Galloway , to defend Assange , insisting what he is accused of "" is n't rape "" ( it is ) , that all he is guilty of is "" bad sexual etiquette "" ( George Galloway : today 's Emily Post ) and adding for good measure "" not everybody needs to be asked prior to each insertion "" , especially if you 're "" already in the sex game with them "" .
That 's right , he used the word "" insertion "" .
Sweet dreams .
Rape is not
WikiLeaks
This is just a little reminder to all of the Assange fans out there ( Assolytes ?
Assheads ? )
that Assange is not being charged for anything to do with WikiLeaks .
Despite what he insinuated in his amazingly Evita - like balcony speech on Sunday from the Ecuadorean embassy , Assange is dodging rape accusations from two women .
Not WikiLeaks .
Women .
Same first letter .
Different things .
Also , while you can â€ “ contrary to other certain beliefs â€ “ become pregnant if you are raped , you can not become pregnant from WikiLeaks .
Just to clarify .
Next !
It 's not funny
Every year in Britain , 400,000 women are sexually assaulted .
More hard figures : 99.99 % of all rape jokes are n't funny
( we 'll get to the .01 % that are in a tick ) ; 100 % of attention - seeking , imagination - deficient comedians will make at least one rape joke in their lives .
Numbers are fun !
As Tanya Gold wrote in this paper , rape jokes are
quite la mode de la saison up at the Edinburgh festival right now , but they have never been out of fashion on comedy circuits .
The reliably unfunny "" comedian ""
Daniel Tosh got in a bit of trouble earlier this summer for making one at the expense of an audience member ( "" Would n't it be funny if that girl got raped by , like , five guys right now ? "" ) and the only amazing thing about that incident was that he was reprimanded for it .
If edgy comedy is supposed to provide an enlightening perspective on a horrible aspect of life then nearly all rape jokes fail , not least because they are often at the expense of the rape victim .
The only funny rape - ish joke I 've ever heard was from US comedian John Mulaney , who mused on how women see him as a threat late at night , "" and it 's weird because , like , I 'm still afraid of being kidnapped "" .
Personally , I find that a lot more enlightening and , crucially , funnier than Jimmy Carr 's "" What do nine out of 10 people enjoy ?
A gang rape .
"" It also â€ “ unlike anything said by Akin , Ryan , Galloway , Carr or Assange 's fans â€ “ shows awareness of the victim as opposed to focusing on the alleged ( or , in this case , imagined ) attacker .
That 's how you talk about rape , see ?
You remember that the victim is an actual person .
Man , can you imagine the hilarity that would ensue if Carr and Galloway were ever to share a room ?
I honestly think my reproductive organs just shut down ."
2012-08-22,"( updated below - Update II )
Earlier this week , British lawyer and legal correspondent for the New Statesman David Allen Green generated a fair amount of attention by announcing that he would use his objective legal expertise to bust what he called "" legal myths about the Assange extradition . ""
These myths , he said , are being irresponsibly spread by Assange defenders and "" are like ' zombie facts ' which stagger on even when shot down . ""
In addition to his other credentials , Green â€ “ like virtually the entire British press â€ “ is a long - time and deeply devoted Assange - basher , and his purported myth - busting was predictably regurgitated by those who reflexively grasp onto anything that reflects poorly on western establishmentarians ' public enemy No1 .
It 's really worth examining what Green argued to understand the behavior in which Assange detractors engage to advance this collective vendetta , and also to see how frequently blatant ideological agendas masquerade as high - minded , objective legal expertise .
But before getting to that , let us pause to reflect on a truly amazing and revealing fact , one that calls for formal study in several academic fields of discipline .
Is it not remarkable that one of the very few individuals over the past decade to risk his welfare , liberty and even life to meaningfully challenge the secrecy regime on which the American national security state ( and those of its obedient allies ) depends just so happens to have become â€ “ long before he sought asylum from Ecuador â€ “ the most intensely and personally despised figure among the American and British media class and the British "" liberal "" intelligentsia ?
In 2008 â€ “ two years before the release of the "" collateral murder "" video , the Iraq and Afghanistan war logs , and the diplomatic cables â€ “ the Pentagon prepared a secret report which proclaimed WikiLeaks to be an enemy of the state and plotted ways to destroy its credibility and reputation .
But in a stroke of amazing luck , Pentagon operatives never needed to do any of that , because the establishment media in the US and Britain harbor at least as much intense personal loathing for the group 's founder as the US government does , and eagerly took the lead in targeting him .
Many people like to posit the US national security state and western media outlets as adversarial forces , but here â€ “ as is so often the case
â€ “ they have so harmoniously joined in common cause .
Whatever else is true , establishment media outlets show unlimited personal animus toward the person who , as a panel of judges put it when they awarded him the the 2011 Martha Gellhorn prize for journalism , "" has given the public more scoops than most journalists can imagine . ""
Similarly , when the Australian version of the Pulitzers â€ “ the Walkley Foundation â€ “ awarded its highest distinction ( for "" Most Outstanding Contribution to Journalism "" ) to WikiLeaks in 2011 , it cited the group 's "" courageous and controversial commitment to the finest traditions of journalism : justice through transparency , "" and observed : "" So many eagerly took advantage of the secret cables to create more scoops in a year than most journalists could imagine in a lifetime .
"" When it comes to the American media , I 've long noted this revealing paradox .
The person who ( along with whomever is the heroic leaker ) enabled "" more scoops in a year than most journalists could imagine in a lifetime "" â€ “ and who was quickly branded an enemy by the Pentagon and a terrorist by high U.S. officials â€ “ is the most hated figure among establishment journalists , even though they are ostensibly devoted to precisely these values of transparency and exposing serious government wrongdoing .
( This transparency was imposed not only on the US and its allies , but also some of the most oppressive regimes in the Arab world ) .
But the contempt is far more intense , and bizarrely personal , from the British press , much of which behaves with staggering levels of mutually - reinforcing vindictiveness and groupthink when it 's time to scorn an outsider like Assange .
On Tuesday , Guardian columnist Seumas Milne wrote a superb analysis of British media coverage of Assange , and observed that "" the virulence of British media hostility towards the WikiLeaks founder is now unrelenting . ""
Milne noted that to the British press , Assange "" is nothing but a ' monstrous narcissist ' , a bail - jumping ' sex pest ' and an exhibitionist maniac "" â€ “ venom spewed at someone "" who has yet to be charged , let alone convicted , of anything . ""
Indeed , the personalized nature of this contempt from self - styled sober journalists often borders on the creepy ( when it 's not wildly transgressing that border ) .
Former New York Times ' executive editor Bill Keller infamously quoted an email from a Times reporter claiming that Assange wore "" filthy white socks that collapsed around his ankles "" and "" smelled as if he had n't bathed in days .
"" On the very same day WikiLeaks released over 400,000 classified documents showing genuinely horrific facts about massive civilian deaths in the Iraq war and US complicity in torture by Iraqi forces , the New York Times front - paged an article purporting to diagnose Assange with a variety of psychological afflictions and concealed , malicious motives , based on its own pop - psychology observations and those of Assange 's enemies ( "" erratic and imperious behavior "" , "" a nearly delusional grandeur "" , "" he is not in his right mind "" , "" pursuing a vendetta against the United States "" ) .
A columnist for the Independent , Joan Smith , recently watched Assange 's interview of Ecuadorean president Rafeal Correa and offered up this wisdom :
"" He 's put on weight , his face is puffy and he did n't bother to shave before his interview with Correa . ""
And perhaps most psychologically twisted of all : a team of New York Times reporters and editors last week , in its lead article about Ecuador 's decision to grant asylum , decided it would be appropriate to include a quote from one of Assange 's most dedicated enemies claiming that when the WikiLeaks founder was a visitor in his apartment , he "" refused to flush the toilet during his entire stay "" ( faced with a barrage of mockery and disgust over their reporting on Assange 's alleged toilet habits , the NYT sheepishly deleted that passage without comment ) .
It is difficult to think of anyone this side of Saddam Hussein who triggers this level of personalized , deeply ingrained hatred from establishment journalists .
Few who spew this vitriol would dare speak with the type of personalized scorn toward , say , George Bush or Tony Blair â€ “ who actually launched an aggressive war that resulted in the deaths of at least 100,000 innocent people and kidnapped people from around the globe with no due process and sent them to be tortured .
The reaction Assange inspires among establishment media figures is really sui generis .
It is vital to note , as was just demonstrated , that this media contempt long pre - dates , and exists wholly independent of , the controversy surrounding the sex assault allegations in Sweden , and certainly long pre - dates his seeking of asylum from Ecuador .
Indeed , given that he has not been convicted of anything , to assume Assange 's guilt would be reprehensible â€ “ every bit as reprehensible as concluding that the allegations are a CIA ruse or that the complainants ' allegations should be dismissed as frivolous or inherently untrustworthy .
It would be genuinely nice to think that the same British government that refused to extradite the mass rapist Augusto Pinochet has suddenly developed a devoted passion for ensuring that alleged sex assault offenders are brought to justice
â€ “ just as it would be nice to believe that the sudden interest in denouncing Ecuador 's press freedom record was driven by some newly discovered and authentic concern in the west for civil liberties protections in South America .
But as Milne put it last night with great understatement : "" such posturing looks increasingly specious .
"" As he rhetorically asked : "" Can anyone seriously believe the dispute would have gone global , or that the British government would have made its asinine threat to suspend the Ecuadorean embassy 's diplomatic status and enter it by force , or that scores of police would have surrounded the building , swarming up and down the fire escape and guarding every window , if it was all about one man wanted for questioning over sex crime allegations in Stockholm ? ""
Like those who suddenly discover the imperatives of feminism when it comes time to justify the war in Afghanistan , or those who become overnight advocates of gay rights when it comes time to demonize the regime in Tehran , or those who took a very recent interest in Ecuadorean press freedoms , these sex assault allegations -- as serious and deserving of legal resolution as they are -- are being cynically exploited as a political weapon by many who have long despised Assange for reasons entirely independent of this case .
*
*
*
*
* There are several obvious reasons why Assange provokes such unhinged media contempt .
The most obvious among them is competition : the resentment generated by watching someone outside their profession generate more critical scoops in a year than all other media outlets combined ( see this brilliant 2008 post , in the context of the Clintons , about how professional and ego - based competition produces personal hatred like nothing else can ) .
Other causes are more subtle though substantive .
Many journalists ( and liberals ) like to wear the costume of outsider - insurgent , but are , at their core , devoted institutionalists , faithful believers in the goodness of their society 's power centers , and thus resent those ( like Assange ) who actually and deliberately place themselves outside of it .
By putting his own liberty and security at risk to oppose the world 's most powerful factions , Assange has clearly demonstrated what happens to real adversarial dissidents and insurgents â€ “ they 're persecuted , demonized , and threatened , not befriended by and invited to parties within the halls of imperial power â€ “ and he thus causes many journalists to stand revealed as posers , servants to power , and courtiers .
Then there 's the ideological cause .
As one long - time British journalist told me this week when discussing the vitriol of the British press toward Assange : "" Nothing delights British former lefties more than an opportunity to defend power while pretending it is a brave stance in defence of a left liberal principle . ""
That 's the warped mindset that led to so many of these self - styled liberal journalists to support the attack on Iraq and other acts of Western aggression in the name of liberal values .
And it 's why nothing triggers their rage like fundamental critiques of , and especially meaningful opposition to , the institutions of power to which they are unfailingly loyal .
*
*
*
*
* With that context established , let us return to David Allen Green .
The attacks on those who have defended Assange 's extradition and asylum arguments has depended on the disgusting slander that such advocates are indifferent to the allegations of sexual assault made against him or , worse , are "" rape apologists .
"" The reality is exactly the opposite .
I have spoken to countless Assange defenders over the last couple of years and not a single one â€ “ literally
not one â€ “ is dismissive of the need for those allegations in Sweden to be taken seriously and to be legally and fairly resolved .
Typifying this view is Milne 's column last night , which in the midst of scorning the attacks on Assange , embraced "" the seriousness of the rape allegations made against Assange , for which he should clearly answer and , if charges are brought , stand trial . ""
That is the view of every Assange defender with a platform that I know of , including me ( one can certainly find anonymous internet commenters , or the occasional named one , making actual , horrific rape apologist claims , but one can find stray advocates saying anything ; imputing those views to Assange defenders generally would be like claiming that all Assange critics want to see him illegally shot in the head or encaged for life because some prominent American and other commentators have called for this ) .
Not only Assange defenders , but also his own lawyers and the Ecuadorean government , have worked relentlessly to ensure that he faces those allegations in Sweden .
They have merely sought to do so in a way that protects him from extradition to the US to face espionage charges for his journalism â€ “ a threat that could send him to prison for life ( likely in a torturous super - max facility ) , and a threat only the wilfuly blind could deny is serious and real .
In their New York Times op - ed this week , Michael Moore and Oliver Stone correctly argue that it is "" the British and Swedish governments that stand in the way of [ the sex assault ] investigation , not Mr Assange . ""
That 's because , they note , Assange has repeatedly offered to be questioned by Swedish authorities in London , or to travel today to Sweden to face those allegations if he could be assured that his doing so would not result in his extradition to the US to face espionage charges .
Time and again , "" Correa said Ecuador never intended to stop Assange from facing justice in Sweden . '
What we 've asked for is guarantees that he wo n't be extradited to a third country , ' he said .
"" Both Britain and Sweden have steadfastly refused even to discuss any agreement that could safeguard both the rights of the complainants and Assange 's rights not to be imprisoned for basic journalism .
These facts â€ “ and they are facts â€ “ pose a lethal threat to the key false narrative that Assange and his defenders are motivated by a desire to evade his facing the sex assault allegations in Sweden .
So these facts need to be impugned , and that 's where David Allen Green and his "" myth - busting "" legal expertise comes into play .
One myth Green purports to debunk is the notion that "" the Swedes should interview Assange in London .
"" This can not be , Green argues , because "" Assange is not wanted merely for questioning .
He is wanted for arrest . ""
He also echoes numerous other Assange critics by arguing that the "" he - has - not - yet - been - charged "" claim is a mere technical irrelevancy : the only reason this is true , he says , is because he must be in Sweden for that to happen .
But back in early 2011 , Assange critics were telling a much different story .
Back then , they were arguing that Assange was wildly overstating the danger he faced from extradition to Sweden because the investigation there was at such a preliminary stage and he was merely wanted for questioning .
Indeed , here 's what the very same David Allen Green wrote on 28 February 2011 when explaining the status of the investigation to his readers [ my emphasis ] : "" This extradition order does not necessarily mean , of course , that he will be extradited , still less that he will be charged , tried , or convicted .
Assange may win an appeal of the extradition order , or Sweden may decide either not to continue or to interview him while he remains in England .
However , unless some such external event intervenes , Assange will be shortly extradited to Sweden to be questioned about an allegation of rape , two allegations of sexual molestation , and an allegation of unlawful coercion . ""
Back when it suited Green , he emphasized that Assange has not been charged with any crime , that there is far from any certainty that he would be , and that extradition to Sweden is merely for him "" to be questioned "" on these allegations : exactly the "" myths "" and "" zombie facts "" which he now purports to bust .
Moreover , Swedish law professor Marten Schultz , who strongly supports Assange 's extradition to Sweden , has said the same [ my emphasis ] : "" The UK supreme court 's decision means only that Assange will be transferred to Sweden for interrogation .
It does not mean that he will be tried , or even charged .
It is entirely possible that he will be transferred to Sweden , questioned , and released if the Swedish authorities find that there are insufficient grounds for prosecution .
It is impossible â€ “ as it should be â€ “ to predict how the case will unfold . ""
Clearly , as Green himself used to acknowledge , Assange at this point is wanted for questioning in this case , and has not been charged .
Once he 's questioned , he might be charged , or the case might be dropped .
That is what has made the Swedes ' steadfast refusal to question him in England so mystifying , of such concern to Assange , and is the real reason that the investigation has thus far been obstructed .
Indeed , Swedish legal expert Ove Bring has made clear , in the context of discussing Assange , that "" under Swedish law it is possible to interrogate people abroad , "" but that Sweden is refusing to do so simply for reasons of "" prestige "" ( he added : "" If he goes to Sweden , is interrogated , then I expect the case would be dropped , as the evidence is not enough to charge him with a crime "" ) .
Then there 's the very strange argument Green makes about why extradition to the US would be more easily accomplished if he 's in Britain rather than Sweden .
I 've previously set out the reasons and supporting evidence showing the reverse is true and wo n't repeat those here , but let 's look at what Green says to support his claim : One can add that there is no evidence whatsoever that the United Kingdom would not swiftly comply with any extradition request from the United States ; quite the reverse .
Ask Gary McKinnon , or Richard O'Dwyer , or the NatWest Three .
The US has been seeking McKinnon 's extradition from Britain for a full seven years and counting ; O'Dwyer also remains in England and is the subject of a popular campaign to block his shipment to the U.S. ; the NatWest Three were able to resist extradition to the US for four full years .
These cases disprove , rather than prove , that an extradition demand from the US would be "" swiftly complied with "" in Britain .
In contrast to the secretive Swedish judicial system , there is substantial public debate along with transparent ( and protracted ) judicial proceedings in Britain over extradition .
It is true , as Green notes , that the Swedish government can not provide an iron - clad "" guarantee "" that Assange would not be extradited to the US .
That 's because it is Swedish courts , and not the government , that make the ultimate decision on extradition .
But both the British and Swedish governments play an important role in any extradition proceeding : they take influential positions on whether extradition is legally warranted .
Under Britain 's extradition treaty , it must consent to the subsequent extradition of any individual it extradites ( meaning its consent would be needed for Sweden to send Assange to the U.S. ) , while in Sweden , the government must formally opine on whether extradition should take place ( some Swedes have made the case that the government 's position would be dispositive ) .
At the very least , there is ample room for negotiation .
Both the British and Swedish governments could â€ “ and should â€ “ take the position that to prosecute Assange under espionage statutes for acts of journalism would be political crimes that are not subject to their extradition treaties with the U.S. or are otherwise not cognizable extradition offenses .
Rather than explore any of those possible grounds for agreement , both governments have simply refused to negotiate either with Assange 's lawyers or the Ecuadorean government over any proposals to safeguard his rights .
That refusal on the part of those governments â€ “ and not any desire to obstruct the investigation or evade facing those allegations â€ “ is what led the Ecuadoreans to conclude that asylum was necessary to protect Assange from political persecution .
The complainants in Sweden have the absolute right to have their serious allegations against Assange investigated and legally resolved .
But Assange has the equally compelling right under international law and treaties to be free of political persecution : which is exactly what prosecuting him ( and perhaps imprisoning him for life ) in the US for WikiLeaks ' disclosures would be .
It is vital that both sets of rights be safeguarded , not just one .
The only just solution is one that protects both .
Assange 's lawyers and the Ecuadorians have repeatedly pursued arrangements to vindicate all substantial rights at stake so that he can travel to Sweden â€
“
today â€ “ to face those allegations while being protected against unjust extradition to the US .
It is the refusal of the British and Swedish authorities even to consider any such proposals that have brought this situation to the unfortunate standstill it is in .
It is incredibly telling that media attacks on Assange do not even pay lip service to , let alone evince any actual interest in , the profound threats to press freedom that would come if he were extradited to and tried in the United States .
In lieu of being informed about any of this , readers and viewers are bombarded with disturbing , and often quite disturbed , rants driven by unrestrained personal contempt .
That contempt not only drowns out every important value at stake in this case , but also any regard for the basic facts .
*
* * UPDATE :
Numerous people objected that I too readily conceded the point that Swedish courts , rather than the Swedish government , are the ultimate decision - makers on extradition requests , and the Swedish government therefore can not provide Assange with a guarantee that he will not be extradited to the U.S.
This article by a lawyer -- who fervently believes that Assange should be extradited to Sweden -- makes the case very compellingly that the Swedish government most certainly can provide such a guarantee if it chose to [ my emphasis ] : Extradition procedures are typically of a mixed nature , where courts and governments share the final decision â€ “ it is not unknown for governments to reject an extradition request in spite of court verdict allowing it . . . .
Article 12 [ of Sweden 's extradition law ] adds that the government may put conditions on its decision to accept an extradition request .
The deciding body is thus the government , with an input by the Prosecutor general and a veto right given to the Supreme Court in case where the requested person does n't accept to be extradited .
The article goes on to cite the Swedish extradition law to outline two possible outcomes where the target of an extradition request challenges its validity : ( 1 ) the Swedish supreme court rules that extradition is not legally permissible , in which case the Swedish government is not free to extradite ; ( 2 ) the Swedish supreme court rules that extradition is legally permissible , in which case the Swedish government is free to decide that it will not extradite for policy or other prudential reasons .
In other words , the Swedish judiciary has the right to block an extradition request on legal grounds , but it lacks the power to compel extradition ; if the courts approve of the legal basis , the Swedish government still retains the authority to decide if extradition should take place .
As indicated , even if it were true that Swedish government was an unable to offer Assange a so - called "" iron - clad guarantee "" against extradition , there is still grounds to negotiate in order to have him travel to Sweden to face these allegations ; given that the Swedish government clearly has , at the very least , a significant role to play in the process , its advanced position against Assange 's extradition to the U.S. on the basis of WikiLeaks ' journalistic disclosures would be significant .
But there is at least a strong argument to make , if not an irrefutable one , that the Swedish government is able to offer precisely the guarantee that both Assange and Ecuadorean authorities have sought in order to enable him immediately to travel to Sweden to face the sex assault allegations against him .
Independently , the British government is also clearly in a position to contribute to those assurances , given the need for its consent if extradition to the U.S. from Sweden is to take place .
If one wants to find a culprit for why these sex assault allegations are not being resolved the way they should be , the refusal of these two governments even to negotiate to secure Assange 's clear rights against unjust extradition is the place to begin .
*
* * UPDATE II : For even more compelling evidence that the Swedish government is the final decision - maker in extradition matters and does indeed have the power to guarantee Assange that he would not be extradited to the U.S. based on his journalism , see the citations in Point 3 of this excellent reply to Green ."
2012-08-22,
2012-08-22,"Ecuador 's president , Rafael Correa , has said Julian Assange should respond to the sexual assault allegations made against him by two Swedish women , even though the case would not in his view constitute criminal behaviour in Latin America .
His remarks are likely to add to the controversy surrounding the WikiLeaks founder but they also hint at a possible avenue for a compromise in the diplomatic row caused by Ecuador 's recent decision to grant asylum to Assange at its London embassy .
In the latest in a series of strident comments , Correa accused the British government of hypocrisy and said he was prepared for the standoff to last indefinitely even if it risked a loss of UK business and public support . ""
If the UK distances itself from Ecuador as a result of this decision to grant asylum that would make us very sorry because we appreciate the United Kingdom â€ “ especially its people â€ “ but that will not make us go back on our position . ""
Despite the attitude of the United Kingdom , we as a country are obliged to act responsibly , "" he told a gathering of international press in Guayaquil . ""
As we have previously said , now that he has asylum , Mr Assange is entitled to remain in the embassy for as long as he wants .
"" He spelled out three possibilities for the standoff to be broken : for the UK to promise safe conduct to the airport without the threat of arrest ; for Assange to leave asylum of his own accord ; or for the government in Ecuador to change its mind , which he said would not happen .
The British government has insisted on an investigation into the rape and sexual assault accusations .
It wants to comply with a court request that Assange should be sent to Sweden for questioning .
Assange 's supporters have tried to discredit the allegations , saying they are part of a plot to extradite him to the US .
Senior politicians in Ecuador have implied much the same .
Correas added his voice but said the case needed to be answered .
"" I do n't want to judge allegations that have not been proven and would not , in any case , be considered a felony in Latin American , too , "" he said .
"" It has never been the intention of the Ecuadorean government for Julian Assange not to respond to those allegations . ""
Ecuador has proposed interrogations by Swedish investigators on embassy property and has said it would support Assange going to Sweden if it could get reassurances from the UK government that he would not then be extradited to the US .
Critics say this is grandstanding for domestic political reasons .
Correa â€ “ already Ecuador 's longest serving president for a century
â€ “ will contest an election early next year .
Although his support rates are high , one of his least popular moves has been to assert greater control over the media through lawsuits , referenda and closures of radio stations .
Providing a haven for Assage â€ “ a champion of whistleblowers â€ “ may be designed to offset these negative perceptions .
During the Q&amp;A on Tuesday Correa addressed this issue and defending an offensive against TV , radio and print . ""
Do n't let yourself be fooled by what 's going .
There is this image of the media as being about Woodward and Bernstein and Watergate and the struggle for freedom of expression .
But that is n't the case here .
"" The reality , he said , was more like the the novel PantanleÃ³n y las Visitadoras by Mario Vargas Llosa . ""
Instead of grabbing the news they are blackmailing people .
The press in Latin America is totally corrupt , "" he said ."
2012-08-22,"George Galloway has been sacked as a columnist on the Scottish political magazine Holyrood after he refused to retract his widely condemned remarks about the rape charges facing Julian Assange .
Mandy Rhodes , the editor of Holyrood , said the Respect party MP 's remarks that Assange was guilty of just "" bad manners "" by failing to ask permission to have sex with a sleeping woman , had left her "" frankly gobsmacked "" .
Rhodes said she had not always agreed with Galloway 's views in the past but had respected his integrity , his role as an "" effective thorn in the side of the establishment "" , and his stance on Iraq .
However , she said it was impossible for him to continue his column following his remark that having sex with a sleeping woman was "" not rape as anyone with any sense can possibly recognise it "" if she had already had sex with that man .
"" There is no excuse , ever , for sex without consent , and regardless of the details of the Assange case , Galloway 's comments and inappropriate language about rape per se are alarming , "" Rhodes said in a statement on the magazine 's website .
She added : "" I had hoped he might have taken the last 24 hours to reflect on his judgment and perhaps make some kind of public apology â€ “ but that has not been apparent , far from it .
So , it is with some very genuine regret that I have asked him to no longer write his column for the magazine . ""
Already a weekly columnist for the Record newspaper , Galloway , the MP for Bradford West , had been hired recently to write regular columns for Holyrood , a fortnightly magazine covering the devolved parliament in Edinburgh and mainstream Scottish politics .
He took up the role after the former Scottish National party MP Jim Sillars stood down as a columnist on health grounds .
He had written five columns before Rhodes emailed him and his press adviser , Ron McKay , on Wednesday morning to say he had been sacked .
McKay said Galloway was in Indonesia and might be unaware of this latest development .
After reading Rhodes 's statement , McKay said : "" There 's not much to say really , is there ? ""
Galloway has been roundly condemned by senior figures in his own party , by rape crisis groups and other MPs , after saying in a video blog posted last week : "" Some people believe that when you go to bed with somebody , take off your clothes , and have sex with them and then fall asleep , you 're already in the sex game with them .
"" It might be really bad manners not to have tapped her on the shoulder and said , ' do you mind if I do it again ? '
"" It might be really sordid and bad sexual etiquette , but whatever else it is , it is not rape , or you bankrupt the term rape of all meaning . """
2012-08-23,"Ecuadorean officials have said that Britain should renounce its "" threat "" to storm the country 's London embassy , and that WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange could remain inside the building for as long as he wanted â€ “ "" two centuries "" if necessary .
The officials said there had been no contact with the Foreign Office since last Thursday , when Ecuador 's president Rafael Correa announced he was granting Assange asylum .
Ecuador was keen to resume negotiations with the UK , the officials said , but added that William Hague should now take back a threat to enter the embassy as "" an indication of good faith "" .
Ecuadorean diplomatic sources also insisted there had been no secret deal to grant Assange asylum .
They said Assange simply turned up at the front door two months ago at midday and rang the bell .
The Ecuadorean ambassador , Ana Alban , was forced to dash home to fetch a blow - up mattress for Assange to sleep on .
Since he took up residence , the embassy had got a bigger fridge , the sources said .
The UK last week gave a written warning to Quito saying that it could invoke the Diplomatic and Consular Premises Act 1987 to arrest Assange inside the Knightsbridge embassy .
This prompted a furious response from Quito .
Hague later clarified that the FCO was not threatening to "" storm an embassy "" .
On Thursday , however , an Ecuadorean diplomatic source said : "" The threat has n't been withdrawn . ""
The source suggested that the police presence around the building was excessive , with the embassy under siege at one point last week and still surrounded by dozens of policemen now .
"" It was amazing .
There used to be four or six policemen since Mr Assange got here .
Suddenly there were three trucks of police surrounding us .
There were police on the interior stairs .
There was even one in the window of the toilet .
It was clearly a message . ""
Ecuadorean officials said they still believed a compromise over the Assange case was possible .
They said Sweden and the UK should give political assurances that the WikiLeaks founder , who faces allegations of sexual misconduct in Sweden , would not be re - extradited from there to the US .
Failing that , they said Britain should grant him safe passage so he could fly to Ecuador .
There seems little prospect that the UK will agree to this .
The Foreign Office says it is legally obliged to extradite Assange to Sweden .
Both sides now appear to be settling in for the long haul .
Asked how long Assange might remain at the embassy , an Ecuadorean official said : "" However long it takes .
Eight years .
Two centuries .
"" The official said it was ridiculous to suggest diplomats would try to smuggle him out .
On Thursday the FCO said in a statement : "" We have made clear we are committed to a diplomatic solution .
"" We will be sending a formal communication today to the Ecuadorean embassy .
We will not go into the detail of private discussions . ""
On Wednesday the news agency Reuters , citing US government sources , said Washington had issued no criminal charges against Assange .
His supporters claim the US is plotting to extradite and to execute him .
Obama administration officials remain divided over the wisdom of prosecuting Assange , Reuters said , and the likelihood of US criminal charges against him is probably receding rather than growing .
On Friday foreign ministers from across Latin America will meet in Washington to discuss the Assange case .
A draft resolution from the Organisation of American States calls on the UK to comply with the 1961 Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations and to respect the "" inviolability "" of the Ecuadorean embassy .
The Foreign Office has been lobbying South American states to abstain .
On Thursday , however , one Ecuadorean official predicted the FCO 's efforts were doomed , adding : "" Most Latin American countries are working as one [ on this ] . ""
On Sunday Assange made his first public appearance since walking into the embassy in June , addressing crowds of journalists and supporters from a first - floor balcony window , with Metropolitan police officers a few feet below him on the pavement .
He called on President Obama to abandon his alleged "" witch - hunt "" against WikiLeaks .
Assange also thanked several other Latin American countries for their support â€ “ implicitly warning Britain that any dispute with Ecuador could rapidly snowball into a conflict with the entire region .
He said nothing about allegations by two Swedish women that he sexually assaulted them .
TodayOn
Thursday Ecuadorean officials denied that it had been a provocative move to allow Assange to use embassy property to berate the United States .
"" It was the balcony or a window , "" one said .
"" He had to deliver a message .
A lot of people were wanting to know what he looked like .
They wanted an image .
It had political value .
"" The officials also shrugged off criticism of Ecuador 's record on press freedom , which has come under increasing scrutiny since Assange sought asylum . ""
Walk around the streets of Quito , hear the radio and watch TV , and see what some journalists say about the government .
There is a lot of freedom , "" one source said .
Scotland Yard has declined to comment on the policing operation at the embassy , while the FCO has said the letter sent to Ecuadorean authorities on Wednesday of last week was not menacing and that the rights of the country 's officials would continue to be respected by the government .

2012-08-23,"When Julian Assange was first arrested , we were struck by the unusual zeal with which he was being pursued for rape allegations .
It seems even clearer now , that the allegations against him are a smokescreen behind which a number of governments are trying to clamp down on WikiLeaks for having audaciously revealed to the public their secret planning of wars and occupations with their attendant rape , murder and destruction .
Justice for an accused rapist does not deny justice for his accusers .
But in this case justice is being denied both to accusers and accused .
The judicial process has been corrupted .
On the one hand , the names of the women have been circulated on the internet ; they have been trashed , accused of setting a "" honey trap "" , and seen their allegations dismissed as "" not real rape "" .
On the other hand , Assange is dealt with by much of the media as if he were guilty , though he has not even been charged .
It is not for us to decide whether or not the allegations are true and whether what happened amounts to rape or sexual violence
â€ “
we do n't have all the facts and
what has been said so far has not been tested .
But we do know that rape victims ' right to anonymity and defendants ' right to be presumed innocent until proven guilty are both crucial to a just judicial process .
Swedish and British courts are responsible for how the women 's allegations have been handled .
As with every rape case , the women are not in charge of the case , the state is .
Whether or not Assange is guilty of sexual violence , we do not believe that is why he is being pursued .
Once again women 's fury and frustration at the prevalence of rape and other violence , is being used by politicians to advance their own purposes .
The authorities care so little about violence against women that they manipulate rape allegations at will , usually to increase their powers , this time to facilitate Assange 's extradition or even rendition to the US .
That the US has not presented a demand for his extradition at this stage is no guarantee that they wo n't do so once he is in Sweden , and that he will not be tortured as Bradley Manning and many others , women and men , have .
Women Against Rape can not ignore this threat .
In over 30 years working with thousands of rape victims who are seeking asylum from rape and other forms of torture , we have met nothing but obstruction from British governments .
Time after time , they have accused women of lying and deported them with no concern for their safety .
We are currently working with three women who were raped again after having been deported â€ “ one of them is now destitute , struggling to survive with the child she conceived from the rape ; the other managed to return to Britain and won the right to stay , and one of them won compensation .
Assange has made it clear for months that he is available for questioning by the Swedish authorities , in Britain or via Skype .
Why are they refusing this essential step to their investigation ?
What are they afraid of ?
In 1998 Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet was arrested in London following an extradition request from Spain .
His responsibility for the murder and disappearance of at least 3,000 people , and the torture of 30,000 people , including the rape and sexual abuse of more than 3,000 women often with the use of dogs , was never in doubt .
Despite a lengthy legal action and a daily picket outside parliament called by Chilean refugees , including women who had been tortured under Pinochet , the British government reneged on its obligation to Spain 's criminal justice system and Pinochet was allowed to return to Chile .
Assange has not even been charged ; yet the determination to have him extradited is much greater than ever it was with Pinochet .
( Baltasar GarzÃ³n , whose request for extradition of Pinochet was denied , is representing Assange . )
And there is a history of Sweden ( and Britain ) rendering asylum seekers at risk of torture at the behest of the US .
Like women in Sweden and everywhere , we want rapists caught , charged and convicted .
We have campaigned for that for more than 35 years , with limited success .
We are even having to campaign to prevent rape victims being accused of making false allegations and imprisoned for it .
Two women who reported visibly violent attacks by strangers were given two and three year prison sentences .
But does anyone really believe that extraditing Julian Assange will strengthen women against rape ?
And do those supporting his extradition to Sweden care if he is then extradited to the US and tortured for telling the public what we need to know about those who govern us ?"
2012-08-24,"Plans to seize Julian Assange "" under all circumstances "" the moment he leaves the Ecuadorean embassy in London have accidentally been revealed by a police officer displaying restricted documents outside the embassy .
The document , pictured under the officer 's arm by a Press Association photographer , appears to advocate arresting the WikiLeaks founder whether he leaves the building in a diplomatic bag or in a diplomatic car .
The handwritten plan was recorded at a police briefing and only partially covered by the officer 's arm as he arrived at the embassy in Knightsbridge on Friday .
The brief begins : "" BRIEF â€ “ EQ .
Embassy brief â€ “ Summary of current position Re Assange .
Action required â€ “ Assange to be arrested under all circumstances .
"" It then makes reference to a "" dip bag "" and a "" dip vehicle "" .
A Scotland Yard spokesman said : "" The document is one officer 's notes from a briefing .
Our objective is to arrest Julian Assange for breach of bail .
Under no circumstances would any arrest be made which was in breach of diplomatic immunity . ""
Assange , who has been in the building for two months , is wanted for questioning in Sweden over claims of sexual assault .
He is refusing to travel to Scandinavia amid fears he will be extradited to the United States over his controversial website .
Ecuador granted the Australian political asylum last week .
The UK government has made it clear Assange , who denies the allegations , will be arrested if he steps outside the embassy after jumping bail .
Speculation has been rife about possible escape routes , and Assange 's legal team and the Ecuadorean government have talked about the possibility of safe passage to Ecuador .
Ambassadors from several South American countries went to the embassy on Friday to show their solidarity with Ecuador .
The British government has threatened , under a 1987 Act , to enter the embassy and arrest the 41-year - old , but foreign secretary William Hague has said there is no intention to "" storm "" the building .
Ecuador 's president has said the diplomatic row "" could be ended tomorrow "" if Britain gave the activist safe passage to South America ."
2012-08-24,"It is the "" restricted "" official document that sums up the Metropolitan police 's tactics towards Julian Assange . ""
Action required : Assange to be arrested under all circumstances , "" says the handwritten note that was photographed under a policeman 's arm on Friday detailing a "" summary of the current position "" on Assange 's exile inside the Ecuadorean embassy in Knightsbridge .
It is no surprise that a fugitive from a European arrest warrant that demands removal to Sweden to face allegations of rape and sexual assault should face such a fate .
Police officers are stationed right up against the front and back of the embassy where Assange has sought sanctuary and he recently claimed to have heard them "" swarming "" behind the fire escape .
There should be no escape , the note suggests , ordering that Assange is arrested if "" he comes out with dip [ presumably a diplomat ] ... as dip bag [ which allows immunity from search for diplomatic communications , and which could be as large as a suitcase , crate or even a shipping container ] , in dip car .... in dip vehicle . ""
The note mentions "" SS10 to liaise "" .
The Met police press office said it had no idea what this might mean .
Could it be a misspelling of SO10 , the colloquial name for the Met 's covert operations group ?
The later mention of SO20 suggests what Assange and his supporters have always feared : that the western powers that WikiLeaks has done so much to embarrass might consider him some sort of terrorist .
SO20 is the Met 's counter - terrorism protective security command .
However , on Friday night the Met said the reference to SO20 was not connected to the Assange case and were notes from a briefing on another matter ."

2012-08-24,"The president of Ecuador , Rafael Correa , has hit back at critics who accuse him of hypocrisy for granting asylum to Julian Assange while launching lawsuits and verbal attacks on his country 's own media .
In an interview with the Guardian , Correa defended his approach towards free speech , saying it was necessary to rein in private newspaper , radio and TV owners who had enjoyed too much power for too long , and comparing his campaign to the investigations into Rupert Murdoch 's newspapers in the UK .
"" We wo n't tolerate abuses and crimes made every day in the name of freedom of speech .
That is freedom of extortion and blackmail , "" he said in response to concerns about recent crackdowns on private news organisations .
Days before the Ecuadorean government granted asylum to the WikiLeaks founder and promoted itself as a guardian of freedom of expression , riot police in Quito raided the offices of one of the country 's leading magazines , Vanguardia .
They confiscated journalists ' computers and prevented publication for a week , ostensibly as a punishment for labour law violations .
It was the second time in less than two years that Vanguardia had been raided .
Its journalists are also getting death threats after being denounced by the president during his weekly TV show , and the magazine 's editorial director was recently sued by Correa for $ 10 m in "" moral damages "" for suggesting the president knew his brother was making millions of dollars from state contracts .
After a public outcry , the president withdrew one suit and issued a pardon in the other , but he defended his right to take such action : "" Do we have an unwritten law that we ca n't sue a journalist ?
Since when ?
So nobody should sue Murdoch and his partners in crime in Britain ? ""
The editorial director of Vanguardia , Juan Carlos CalderÃ³n , had earlier told the Guardian he was being targeted for criticising the administration , and accused Correa of double standards . ""
The government said it has granted asylum to Assange because he is politically persecuted for defending freedom of expression .
But the same thing happens to us , "" he said .
"" This is not a country with the free press described by Correa . ""
He is not alone .
The domestic press watchdog Fundamedios describes the situation in Ecuador as a low - intensity war on journalists that appears to be escalating .
Last year , it recorded 151 cases of physical aggression against reporters , up from 101 in 2009 .
It says this increase is largely the result of the constant abuse directed at journalists by Correa during his weekly TV broadcast , which is carried by almost every channel .
It also notes that 17 radio stations have been shut down this year for transgressing regulations and that the government has recently issued new rules that will oblige internet service providers to provide the IP addresses of their users to the authorities , even without a court order .
"" There is a huge gap between what Correa says about press freedom and reality , "" said CÃ
©
sar Ricaurte , head of Fundamedios .
"" If Assange were Ecuadorean , I dare say he would already be in jail . ""
International free press campaigners , including the Committee to Protect Journalists ( CPJ ) and Reporters
Without Borders , have also accused Correa of trying to discredit and intimidate critics .
Correa said such judgments were misguided .
"" The Ecuadorean and Latin American press is not like the European or North American press , which has some professional ethics .
They are used to being above the law , to blackmail , to extort .
I am sorry about good people on an international level who defend this kind of press . ""
He denied that radio station closures were politically motivated , saying some were simply music channels that failed to conform to broadcasting rules .
This will open up space for more public channels .
An insight into Correa 's strategy was given by his chief communications adviser , Fernando Alvarado who described the media as "" weeds that need to be cleaned "" and replaced by flowers ( public and community media outlets ) in a recent interview with the Mexican publication Gatopardo .
Since Correa â€ “ a US - educated economist who describes himself as a moderate leftist â€ “ came to power in 2007 , there has been a wider range of state and private ownership of newspapers and TV stations .
There is more scope for critical non - governmental organisations and greater access to senior officials .
The interviews given by Correa on Thursday were carefully staged in terms of lighting and camera work , but unscripted .
Media watchers said Correa 's approach -â€
“ particularly in his weekly live broadcasts
â€ “ was as confrontational as that adopted by Hugo ChÃ¡vez in Venezuela , but less destructive . ""
In some regards , it is like ChÃ¡vez .
But ChÃ¡vez went too far .
Though there is confrontation here , no TV stations have been closed , which was the case in Venezuela , "" said Maurice Cerbino , a professor at Andina Simon Bolivar University .
The confrontation , he said , was understandable given the previous situation in Ecuador in which the private media colluded with the government .
Correa 's supporters say the administration is carrying out an overdue rebalancing of the media , which was previously skewed too heavily towards private ownership by a handful of families .
When Correa came to power in 2007 , there was only one public media organisation , Radio Nacional .
Those who work in public media say this has created a far healthier media environment because advertisers have less influence . ""
The reports by the Committee to Protect Journalists and Amnesty are not false , but a lot of them are exaggerated , "" said Orlando PÃ
© rez , the editorial director of El TelÃ © grafo .
"" Ecuador is going through a golden age for media freedom .
Citizens now have so much space for expression , through social networks , public media , community media as well as blogs and websites . ""
To demonstrate his editorial independence , he pointed to a front - page story in his public newspaper exposing a corruption in the state - owned oil company PetroEcuador .
PÃ © rez claims to have set the stage for Assange 's first interview with Correa , which later lead to asylum .
He denies that this has anything to do with a government strategy .
"" We did n't choose Assange .
Assange chose us , "" he said .
Correa said he was trying to support an individual threatened by a powerful state .
"" I do n't agree with everything Mr Assange did .
I never said that .
But I believe he is entitled to a just legal process , "" the president said .
"" Assange never stole the information .
It was handed to him by Bradley Manning .
He just distributed it .
So why did n't the newspapers that published it also get sanctioned ?
That is an international double standard .
The answer is that the newspapers have power , whereas Mr Assange is just a citizen .
That is why certain countries want to crush him with all their weight . ""
His motives are widely disputed .
Some accept the president 's idealistic claims .
Cynics say he is trying to distract attention from the criticism of his heavy handling of the domestic media .
Another theory is that he is a political opportunist who understands the benefits of picking high - profile fights , in this case , with the UK .
Having gone further than any other Latin American leader outside of Argentina in criticising Britain over the Falklands earlier this year , he has now found a new cause .
William Hague 's threat to remove the diplomatic status of the Ecuadorean embassy simply played into his hands . ""
The UK foreign minister has given him the perfect excuse to unite the left in a confrontation with imperialists , "" CalderÃ³n observes .
"" People on the left have an anti - imperialist gland .
All you have to do it touch it to secrete anthems ( of solidarity ) . ""
But the decision to grant asylum has made waves inside Ecuador 's government .
Career bureaucrats are uneasy at a decision made by political appointees .
Some feel it is of dubious legality and could backfire in terms of trade with the European Union .
On the streets , however , the move appears to have widespread public backing .
There were demonstrations of support in Quito this week .
Women 's groups have even seconded Correa 's claim that the accusations against Assange would not constitute felonies in Latin America .
"" I totally agree with the decision to grant asylum to Assange , "" said Virginia GÃ³mez , former director of the Attention and Help Centre for Women .
"" The allegations against Assange would not be crimes here .
Women are empowered , but not to the point that if a condom breaks it is a sex crime .
That is beyond our imagination . ""
Quito is no place for the politically half - hearted .
Local people are proud of their radicalism and burn effigies of politicians â€ “ including the current president â€ “ at raucous New Year 's Eve parades .
Many feel it is their duty to kick out poorly performing leaders , something they have done with remarkable regularity .
After just five years in power , Correa is the longest - serving president in a century .
US embassy cables leaked by WikiLeaks described him as the most popular president the country had ever had .
Without exception , everyone interviewed for this story said Correa had been good for Ecuador .
Even the fiercest critics of his media policies praised the president 's work on health and education .
As his cavalcade drove up to the interview venue , girls leaned out of the window and screamed as if they had seen a rock star .
The question now is whether the Assange case will consolidate or erode this popularity if it drags on until the presidential elections next February .
Correa was unwilling to speculate .
"" I am an economist , not an astrologer .
I ca n't say how long it will take .
It could be solved tomorrow .
It depends on the UK .
Or it could take a long time .
What is the next step ?
Keep talking .
We have never closed the door to conversation .
From the beginning , we have been talking to Britain , Sweden and even the USA to solve this situation .
But we will never lower our principles or risk the life or rights of Assange . """
2012-08-27,"After being widely condemned for his remarks about the rape allegations facing Julian Assange , George Galloway was under fire again at the weekend after calling someone a "" window - licker "" ( a derogatory term for a disabled person ) in a conversation on Twitter .
Galloway made the comment during a conversation on Sunday .
He tweeted to @Hawfa : "" you badly need medical help son .

Hate crime and bullying are a daily reality for many disabled people and the use of language like this only furthers hostility and violence .

Galloway is in Indonesia and could not be immediately contacted .
Galloway 's tweet comes in the runup to the Paralympic Games and days after the MP was roundly condemned by senior figures in his own party , rape crisis groups and other MPs , after saying in a video blog last week : "" Some people believe that when you go to bed with somebody , take off your clothes , and have sex with them and then fall asleep , you 're already in the sex game with them .
"" It might be really bad manners not to have tapped her on the shoulder and said , ' do you mind if I do it again ? '

Galloway defended his rape remarks , saying : "" No never means yes and non - consensual sex is rape .

2012-08-28,"Another day , another George Galloway rumpus .
The cat impersonator - cum - MP has signed up to present a fortnightly show for al - Mayadeen , a new Arab television channel said to be linked to Syrian dictator Bashar al - Assad .
It comes a week after he belittled alleged victims of rape , and a day after he used terms offensive to disabled people .
Beirut - based al - Mayadeen means "" the public squares "" in Arabic .
Critics claim it is either funded by Iran , or by Assad 's cousin â€ “ though its management denies both charges , and has at least occasionally given a platform to members of the Syrian opposition .
But certainly , its head of news is married to Assad 's sometime PR adviser , while the station 's director quit a rival channel ( Qatar - backed al - Jazeera ) because he felt it was too critical of the Syrian government . ""
Given that they 're in such a dire situation , it 's unlikely that the Syrian regime has put money into the station , "" explains professor Joe Khalil , an expert in Arab TV at the Qatar branch of Northwestern university , "" but they 're definitely getting [ the station 's ] support .
Al - Mayadeen does not shy away from saying that they stand with anyone who is against Israel .
"" This is n't the first time Galloway has taken a controversial shilling ( he also has a show with the Iran - backed Press TV ) , and nor is he alone among British politicos .
Ken Livingstone had a regular slot with Press TV , as did â€ “ amusingly
â€ “
his arch - critic Andrew Gilligan ; his putative rival for the mayoralty , Nick Ferrari ; and disgraced Tory MP Derek Conway , who had a show about books .
In January 2012 , Ofcom banned the channel from operating in the UK after it was judged to have broadcast an interview made under duress .
Meanwhile , Julian Assange â€ “ scourge of authoritarians ; fan of Pussy Riot â€ “ fronted up for the Kremlin 's Russia Today earlier this year .
Assange interviewed controversial figures such as Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah â€ “ but was criticised for his stilted delivery , and for failing to delve into Russian human rights abuses .
Why do the stations want them ?
Different channels have different reasons , says Khalil .
"" Press TV was based in the UK , and directed towards a British audience , "" he says , "" so it had to fit inside that environment . ""
Hence their range of politicians from across the political spectrum , all fairly familiar to British audiences .
Al - Mayadeen , on the other hand , is Arab - based , and only wants to recruit Westerners who are both well - known in the Middle East , and who support their anti - Western politics . ""
Galloway is the perfect fit for al - Mayadeen , "" says Khalil .
"" He was on Arab television during every single uprising , war , and he came out very forcefully against Israel .
Al - Mayadeen treats him like a superstar . ""
And what 's in it for Galloway ?
Attention , for one thing .
"" I do n't want to be mean , "" says Khalil , "" but he 's constantly looking for a platform . ""
The money 's not bad , either .
Galloway will earn Â£3,000 an episode â€ “ or nearly Â£80,000 a year â€ “ for his new project .
Other lesser - known MPs turn to Press TV because they ca n't get heard otherwise .

2012-08-29,"An investigation has been launched after a group that supports the WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange claimed to have hacked Cambridge University computer systems .
The group named NullCrew , linked to the computer hacking network Anonymous , said it had targeted several university departments and broken into databases .
The group published details of what appear to be usernames and passwords online and in a statement to the Guardian passed through their Twitter account said : "" We 'd like to say that we are n't finished with the operation , and we are n't the only Hacktivist group to be fighting . ""
Julian Assange has been fought against for speaking his voice .

A spokesman for the university said : "" A group calling itself NullCrew claims to have obtained login details for some web - based resources hosted on university systems . ""

2012-09-04,"Celebrity backers of Julian Assange have lost Â£200,000 in bail money they put up for the WikiLeaks founder , it has been confirmed .
At a hearing at Westminster magistrates court on Tuesday , district judge Howard Riddle adjourned a further hearing until October to decide whether nine other backers should also lose their money , after Assange fled an attempt to extradite him to Sweden last June .
At Tuesday 's proceedings , a court clerk told reporters that a Â£200,000 security pot given to the court before Assange was bailed â€ “ and believed to have been paid into by high - profile backers , including Jemima Khan , film directors Ken Loach and Michael Moore , and millionaire publisher Felix Dennis â€ “ had been forfeited at an earlier hearing in July .
Assange skipped bail in June and took refuge in the Ecuadorean embassy in Knightsbridge , London , in defiance of an order to have him extradited to Sweden to face allegations of rape .
He has claimed the Swedish extradition request is a ruse to facilitate his onward extradition the US , where he could face the death penalty .
Last month Ecuador 's president , Rafael Correa , granted him asylum and said the 41-year - old Australian could remain at its London embassy indefinitely .
Journalist Phillip Knightley , Caroline Evans â€ “ the wife of former Labour minister Lord Evans
â€
“ Nobel prize - winning biologist Sir John Sulston and Frontline Club founder Vaughan Smith , who also allowed Assange to stay with him at his Norfolk mansion during extradition proceedings , were among those who pledged sureties â€ “ a promise to pay the court â€ “ of Â£20,000 each .
All nine of those listed in Tuesday 's hearing had pledged a total of Â£140,000 .
All in all , Assange 's backers could lose Â£340,000 .
Adjourning the hearing until 3 October , Riddle said those guaranteeing bail had a month to persuade Assange to surrender to police if they wanted their money back . ""
At the moment I 'm not persuaded that any reasonable surety would not be using every effort , publicly and privately , to persuade Mr Assange to surrender himself to UK authorities , "" he said .
He said it found it "" absolutely striking "" that none of the nine had attended court in person .
Henry Blaxland QC , representing four of the sureties , said Vaughan Smith was making a documentary with the British army in Afghanistan , while Evans is on holiday in Italy .
The judge noted that "" we have no explanation from others and no particular reason to believe that they want to be here "" .
Blaxland argued there was "" no evidence that any of the sureties are to blame for Mr Assange 's failure to surrender "" adding that the event could not have been predicted by those putting up bail money .
"" It was an extraordinary thing to do .
Nobody could reasonably have foreseen
that 's what he would do , "" he said and urged that the hearing be postponed indefinitely .
"" Given the drama at the Ecuadorean embassy has not yet reached the final act , perhaps one should wait to see what does happen , "" Blaxland said .
Blaxland also argued that since Ecuador had granted him asylum the court should "" consider in deciding whether his failure to surrender to police is wholly unreasonable "" .
Riddle initially refused the adjournment but later allowed a further three weeks so the sureties had a chance to fight for their money ."
2012-09-05,"Julian Assange 's defence team is hoping for a solution to allow the WikiLeaks founder to be questioned over sexual misconduct allegations facing him in Sweden , without risking extradition to the US .
"" We are trying to find a way to make the obligation of the United Kingdom in terms of judicial cooperation to hand over
Mr Assange â€ ¦ compatible with the fundamental right of asylum of Julian Assange to diplomatic immunity , "" said Spanish jurist Baltasar Garzon , who is coordinating Assange 's defence team .
Assange remains in the Ecuadorian embassy in London where he has been since June when Quito granted him diplomatic asylum .
"" The problem is that that depends heavily on the different wills of the governments involved : Ecuador , UK and Sweden . ""
Speaking to reporters in Madrid , Garzon said Assange 's lawyers were not involved in any diplomatic talks to break the stand - off between the UK and Ecuador and dismissed the guarantees given publicly so far .
On Tuesday , the foreign secretary William Hague said Assange would not face extradition from Sweden to the US if he were to face the death penalty or have his human rights breached . ""
( Assange ) would be prepared to go to Sweden today if he received a guarantee that he wo n't be subject to an extradition process to the United States over Wikileaks .
It is as simple as that , "" said Garzon .
The jurist said he thought it would be wrong for those who had put up bail for Assange to lose the money they had paid to the UK court .
"" They ( the backers ) are not responsible for a decision by Julian Assange which has ended up in the recognition of a fundamental right , Â¨said Garzon . ""
In no country should that result in third parties losing their bail .
He is protected by the right to asylum .
He continues to be in British territory in the widest sense . ""
Celebrity backers of Assange â€ “ believed to include Jemima Khan , film directors Ken Loach and Michael Moore , and millionaire publisher Felix Dennis â€ “ have already lost Â£200,000 in bail money they put up for the WikiLeaks founder .
At a hearing at Westminster magistrates court on Tuesday , district judge Howard Riddle adjourned a further hearing until October to decide whether nine other backers should also lose their money , after Assange fled an attempt to extradite him to Sweden in June .
The Spanish jurist , best - known internationally for his attempt to have former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet extradited from the UK , also said there was no contradiction between his defence of Assange and his own use of international extradition agreements in the past .
"" I asked for the extradiction of Pinochet , who had been investigated and charged with â€ ¦ genocide , torture , serious breaches of human rights , "" said Garzon . ""
Assange is having a fundamental right breached too â€ ” freedom of expression â€ ” and that is why he has been granted political asylum .
"" Assange'sc defence team have said the Australian offered to be questioned in Sweden when the allegations were first made , was given permission by prosecuting lawyers to leave the country and has subsequently repeatedly offered to be questioned in the UK .
"" We are in a position to demonstration that no criminal act has been committed and the allegations are inconsistent , "" Garzon said , adding that it was unusual for countries to use a European Arrest Warrant to bring someone in for questioning when no charges had been brought .
Garzon said the defence team intended to make an explicit request to the US to say whether any case was open against Assange or WikiLeaks .
"" I can tell you that they wo n't reply .
If they do , terrific â€ “
we want to show that the US is hiding what is happening to Julian Assange . """
2012-09-06,"So Andy and Tracey Ferrie , the couple held by police for three days after using a shotgun against burglars at their rural home , are not to be prosecuted .
The tabloids rejoice and Chris Grayling , the new justice secretary , must be quietly relieved not to be drawn into a divisive ( and tempting ) controversy so early in his cabinet career .
Newspapers like the Guardian and their readers tend not to get agitated by such cases , preferring to engage with those where more abstract features of the justice system are at stake â€ “ the rights of asylum seekers ( not just a famous Julian Assange ) , or police abuse of procedure , including the use of firearms , against vulnerable people or suspected criminals .
And rightly so .
After PC Simon Harwood was acquitted of manslaughter in the case of Ian Tomlinson , the newspaper vendor killed during the G20 protests in 2009 , it emerged there had been a series of complaints about his behaviour ( though most were found unproven ) .
The Crown Prosecution Service ( CPS ) had initially declined to prosecute him until the findings of the pathologist Freddy Patel â€ “ who also has past form
â€ “ were discredited .
Harwood is still a police officer .
A thoroughly disquieting case .
But , if it is right for the Guardian to be tenacious in such cases , is it wrong for the Daily Mail to be fierce in standing up for people who defend their homes against intruders , often at night in frightening circumstances ?
I think so .
Indeed , I suspect that more people get excited about the unfairness of the Ferries ' detention than do about , say , the rights of the Islamist cleric Abu Qatada not to be deported home to Jordan .
The Ferries , who live in an isolated 200-year - old cottage at Welby outside Melton Mowbray in Leicestershire , had been burgled several times before .
No wonder the vigilante lobby stirs at times like this with complaints that the police are useless and the law biased against the law - abiding .
It can feel like that when the cops appear to pick off easy targets to keep up their conviction rates and the CPS seems sloppy or supine .
So when masked men burst in last weekend , Andrew Ferrie fired the shotgun , legally owned by his wife and kept in their bedroom , and injured one of the intruders in the hand .
At Loughborough magistrates court on Wednesday , the injured man , Daniel Mansell , 33 , pleaded guilty to burglary .
He too has form for burglary , robbery and witness intimidation â€ “ he was released under probationary supervision last year after serving two years of a six - year sentence for a violent attack .
Three other men were arrested .
So far I am with the Ferries on this one , relieved only that the use of a weapon was effective , rather than being a prelude to a familiar tragedy in which the victims of a robbery who resist their assailants end up injured or dead .
But it 's a fine line .
Tony Martin , the Norfolk farmer who fatally shot an intruder in the back as he fled , was jailed for murder , later reduced ( rightly ) to manslaughter , with five years in jail .
Munir Hussain , the Buckinghamshire businessman who chased a burglar who had tied up his family and threatened them with a knife , caught him down the road and beat him with a cricket bat and metal pole .
Hussain clearly overdid it .
He must have been frightened and angry , but the intruder was no longer in his home .
He got two and a half years , later reduced to a one - year suspended sentence .
The burglar was not jailed either .
David Cameron then promised a review of the law and routinely repeats that pledge .
Last year the CPS decided that a Manchester man who fatally stabbed a machete - wielding burglar would not be prosecuted .
The tabloids were pleased .
But those such as the Mail 's fiery pundit Simon Heffer who argue that the government should clarify the law through legislation have a point .
It 's tricky and risky for government .
Grayling must be tempted to make his name in tough law - and - order posturing , unlike his predecessor , Ken Clarke , who sensibly wondered why the prison population had almost doubled since he was last home secretary in 1993 .
It 's very expensive , complained Ken , who is also an ex - chancellor .
Alas , it doubled because Michael Howard , Tony Blair , David Blunkett and co engaged in a law and order bidding war .
Crime has gone down , they all say .
And it has , but for more complex reasons than locking up people , many of whom should not be there .
It 's not a message the tabloids want their readers to understand .
Today 's lurid reporting of the judge who said it must take a desperate kind of courage to burgle a stranger 's house illustrates the problem .
All the usual media suspects picked up the story with glee and outrage .
The Mail 's account included comments from outraged victims of burglary .
But even that account gives enough information to explain why Judge Peter Bowers said what he said when he gave Richard Rochford a 12-month suspended sentence ( plus 200 hours ' community service and drug rehabilitation ) at Teeside crown court .
The accused was an amateur with a drug habit and robbed two unlocked homes while their occupants slept .
He had co - operated with police and stopped using drugs , the court heard .
"" I think prison rarely does anyone any good , "" said the judge , though the papers note that he is not wholly consistent on this point .
Well , that 's human nature too , but he 's more right than wrong about prison , where rehabilitation programmes become harder the more crowded the system is .
Whether he was right to give Rochford a second chance , only time will tell .
And we will probably only get to hear about it if he 's proved wrong and the law and order tabloids have a chance to get excited all over again .
Perhaps the election of police and crime commissioners across England and Wales on 15 November will enhance the quality of debate on this subject .
Let 's hope so , because respect for the police , their competence and commitment , is currently low in neglected rural areas as well as in some big cities .
As French police struggle to solve the murders near smart Annecy in the Alps in the coming days we will get a useful comparator .
Here 's one analysis which reminds us how different the procedures are in otherwise similar countries .
I hope the vigilante lobby is watching because I 'm pretty sure our record in solving such murders is better than theirs ."
2012-09-10,"WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange 's complaint about a More4 documentary he claimed was unfair and violated his privacy has not been upheld by Ofcom , the media regulator .
Ofcom ruled that the More4 documentary , True Stories :
WikiLeaks â€ “ Secrets and Lies , was fair and did give Assange appropriate opportunity to respond before the programme was aired on 29 November 2011 .
The media regulator rejected Assange 's complaint that More4 had violated his privacy by showing footage of him dancing in a nightclub in Iceland .
Assange , founder of the whistleblowers ' website , has complained about negative media coverage of his legal battle to avoid extradition to Sweden , where he faces sexual assault allegations .
He is currently taking refuge in the Ecuadorian embassy in Knightsbridge , London , in defiance of the extradition order .
The documentary was part of the Channel 4 digital service 's True Stories strand and featured contributions from the Guardian 's investigations editor , David Leigh , and special correspondent Nick Davies , who worked closely with Assange on the publication of leaked US diplomatic cables from November 2010 .
The programme also featured interviews with several people who had worked closely with Assange , including a former WikiLeaks employee .
Assange said More4 had not obtained his informed consent to appear in the programme , claiming they had misrepresented to him what the documentary would focus on and he had not been told who else would appear .
However , Ofcom ruled that Assange had provided his informed consent and that his assistant had exchanged emails over several weeks with the programme makers over what it would contain .
The WikiLeaks founder also complained about the use of grainy footage of him dancing in a nightclub in Iceland , which had been taken by a member of the public and then uploaded to the video - sharing website , YouTube .
Ofcom noted that Assange had given permission to the person to film him dancing on the condition it was for this video maker 's personal use only .
The regulator ruled : "" The footage was filmed in a nightclub , which is a public place , and Mr Assange was not shown engaged in an activity which would reasonably be considered to be private or in circumstances which could normally give rise to a legitimate expectation of privacy .
"" Ofcom also took into account that Mr Assange has been in the public eye since the launch of WikiLeaks .
Further , the footage had been made available to the public in a number of items on the internet months before the programme was broadcast .
"" It added : "" Accordingly , Ofcom 's decision is that Mr Assange 's complaints of unjust or unfair treatment and of unwarranted infringement of privacy in the programme as broadcast should not be upheld "" .
Assange wrote to the Leveson inquiry into press standards in April , claiming he had "" suffered extensive libels "" comparable to Gerry and Kate McCann , who received significant damages from a number of national newspapers over coverage of the search for their missing daughter Madeleine .
He had previously lost a complaint to the Press Complaints Commission about 45 articles , in publications including the Guardian and the Independent , which he said were inaccurate and unfair .

2012-09-11,"Salma Yaqoob has quit as leader of the Respect party following what she said had been an extremely difficult few weeks and a breakdown in "" relations of trust and collaborative working "" .
Three weeks ago , Yaqoob , a former Birmingham city councillor , criticised Respect 's sole MP , George Galloway , for his suggestion that the rape allegations against the WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange amounted to little more than "" really bad manners "" and "" bad sexual etiquette "" .
In a statement posted on Respect 's website on Tuesday , Yaqoob said : "" It is with deep regret that I have decided to resign from Respect .
The last few weeks have been extremely difficult for everyone in the party .
I feel necessary relations of trust and collaborative working have unfortunately broken down .
I have no wish to prolong those difficulties , and indeed hope that they may now be drawn to a close . ""
The loss of Yaqoob , a passionate advocate for the leftwing anti - war party , will be regarded as a major blow to Respect , but it does not come as a surprise .
In a posting on her own website last month , Yaqoob emphatically distanced herself from Galloway , the MP for Bradford West , who had claimed that even if the complaints against Assange by two women in Sweden were "" 100 % true "" , they still could not be considered rape .
Assange denies the allegations .
At the time , Yaqoob described Galloway 's comments as "" deeply disappointing and wrong "" and said the "" political issues "" surrounding Assange 's case should not be used to lessen the gravity of the accusations against him .
In her statement on Tuesday night , she added : "" I remain committed to the principles and values that led me to help found Respect .
The policies we have fought for need to be voiced as loud as ever in opposition to a political establishment that remains out of touch with working people . ""
"" I would like to thank everyone in the party for their support over the years ; I wish everyone the very best for the future and in those common struggles for peace , justice and equality that I am sure we will all continue to be involved in . ""
Chris Chilvers , the party 's national secretary , said : "" While we are obviously very sorry that Salma has decided to leave Respect , we would like to thank her for the great contribution she has made to Respect over the last decade .
We look forward to working with Salma in the future in pursuit of our shared values and objectives .
"" Yaqoob was elected as a Birmingham city councillor in 2006 , having won 49 % of the vote in an inner - city council ward , and has remained as Respect 's best known figure after Galloway .
A qualified psychotherapist , she took her first steps into politics in the aftermath of 9/11 and and has described herself as being part of the labour movement , with political values based on social justice and opposition to war ."
2012-09-12,"Respect 's sole MP , George Galloway , has refused to apologise to his Bradford constituents for comments on rape that have caused widespread offence and led to the departure of his party leader , Salma Yaqoob .
The maverick politician confronted members of the Muslim Women 's Circle in his Bradford West constituency with repeated assertions that the WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange , who is wanted for questioning about alleged sexual assault in Sweden , had been "" set up "" by agents of the United States government .
He began a session with an unusually depleted audience at the normally packed meetings , which have recently included debates with Labour leader Ed Miliband and the former Conservative party co - chair Lady Sayeeda Warsi , by saying : "" No means no , no never means yes "" , but refused to withdraw any of the comments he made in a podcast last month .
These included references to "" really bad manners "" and "" bad sexual etiquette "" , which have appalled campaigners against the sexual abuse of women .
Galloway told the meeting : "" I can not and will not apologise for what I said .
Every word in my podcast , I stand by .
I do not talk loosely about matters such as these . ""
He argued that the context of Assange being targeted by a vengeful Washington administration for exposing the brutality of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan was the all - important context to his remarks that critics had overlooked .
"" Rape is a vile crime .
Mass murder is worse , "" he said .
"" The invasion and occupation of one Muslim country after another by the United States is even worse .
Julian Assange has been set up by a government which is determined to see him serving 50 years of penal servitude in solitary confinement â€ “ conditions which amount to mental torture .
I am speaking out against that and will continue to do so . ""
Galloway did apologise for using the word "" window - licker "" about a critic on Twitter , claiming that he was unaware that it had become a term of abuse of the disabled since he left Scotland , where it had previously been a synonym for "" moron "" .
He said : "" This man was a moron .
No one who knows me would ever believe for a moment that I would say anything which hurt the feelings of disabled people .
I have already helped many of them in Bradford . ""
Galloway met with a mixed reception , some women openly hostile , others loyal to his record as the man who broke the city 's male - dominated "" braderi "" , or clan politics , at the by - election five months ago .
A third group , probably the largest , was startled by his truculence â€ “ including telling questioners several times that they need not vote for him â€ “ and simplistic references to the main political parties supporting "" the bombing of Muslim women and children . ""
Galloway also showed little concern about the departure of Yaqoob , whose gentle style won her supporters even on BBC Radio 's Any Questions and unpromising , largely white and comfortably - off territory .
He described her departure as "" a great loss "" for Respect but said that it was up to her to explain it .
He said : "" I have no doubt that we 'll see her back in politics soon , wearing a different cap , and that might explain some things .
We 'll see if I am right about that . """
2012-09-13,"WikiLeaks has been accused of crass self - centredness after it intimated that its founder Julian Assange 's current refuge inside the Ecuadorean embassy in London in part explained or even justified Wednesday 's attack on the US diplomatic mission in Benghazi which killed the ambassador , Chris Stevens , and three other Americans .
A post on the official WikiLeaks Twitter feed , which is generally presumed to be operated by Assange , read : "" By the US accepting the UK siege on the Ecuadorian embassy in London it gave tacit approval for attacks on embassies around the world . ""
As a series of other Twitter users objected to the language â€ “ one early response read : "" @wikileaks you are losing supporters fast with comments like that . ""
â€ “ the initial tweet was deleted , though not before some Twitter users saved images of it .
The tweet was then re - sent in two slightly amended forms , firstly : "" By the US accepting the UK threat to storm the Ecuadorian embassy in London it helped to normalize attacks on embassies , "" and later : ""
By the UK threatening to breach the Ecuadorian embassy in London it helped to normalize attacks on embassies , in general .
It must retract . ""
Yet another tweet attempted to explain the change , arguing that people had misunderstood the initial tweet because of the use of the "" rare "" term tacit .
It read : "" We have deleted and rephrased a previous tweet with the word ' tacit ' in it , since the word is rare and was being misinterpreted . ""
Assange sought refuge in the London embassy in June so as to avoid extradition from the UK to Sweden , where he faces accusations of sexual misconduct .
WikiLeaks supporters argue that Assange could then face further extradition to the US for trial over his role in publishing hundreds of thousands of leaked US government documents .
Assange argues that in the US he could face the death penalty .
The UK says he could not face extradition to America if execution were a possibility .
The matter remains at an impasse .
The government of Ecuador has offered Assange permanent refuge in its country , but it remains unclear how he could get there .
The embassy is guarded by a small number of UK police officers , something Twitter critics pointed out fell some way short of a "" siege "" ."
2012-09-21,"Salma Yaqoob resigned as leader of the Respect party in part because of personal abuse she suffered after George Galloway 's comment concerning Julian Assange , she has told the Guardian in her first interview since she left the party .
Galloway , who became Respect 's sole MP when he was elected in March to represent Bradford West , said some of the allegations brought against Assange by two Swedish women did not constitute rape "" as most people understand it "" .
He was simply guilty of "" bad sexual etiquette "" .
Yaqoob , a former councillor in Birmingham and a part - time psychotherapist , revealed that she was assumed to share Galloway 's sentiments .
"" Under the guise of different names there were personal attacks , "" she said .
Yaqoob said that she published a statement setting out her own position , but that the damage was done .
Galloway has not been in direct contact with Yaqoob since her resignation on 11 September
but she said the MP 's comments let down the women of Bradford , whose votes helped him gain the seat from Labour , particularly women from traditional backgrounds who had in the past been expected to vote the way their husbands or fathers or brothers voted .
"" That 's why it 's been deeply disappointing , because I do feel that those women have been let down , "" she said .
"" [ Comments like that ] open the door to women being treated in a certain way ; you are just dismissed , your views are not taken seriously and a certain reactionary attitude is encouraged rather than challenged . ""
Yaqoob also refused to quell rumours that her resignation had tipped the party over into crisis .
Kate Hudson withdrew her candidacy as Respect 's MP for Manchester Central a week before Yaqoob 's resignation .
There have been reports that since the former leader left , others have followed her .
Accounts of crisis meetings being held in Bradford have appeared in the Pakistani press , as well as predictions of a mass exit of party members .
"" Only time will tell , "" she said .
"" George has to deal with that in the way that he sees fit .
And reflect on that .
"" Yaqoob did not deny the possibility that she will join another party .
All three main parties have approached her .
"" It 's no secret that people have made approaches , "" she said .
"" Right now , although I 'm very flattered and honoured , I 'm taking stock . ""
She also claimed that it was a "" deep sadness "" to Galloway that Labour had expelled him from the party . ""
George is also very keen to be in Labour , and this is the irony â€ “ he 's always said to me if you have an approach [ from Labour ] just make sure that I can come back in , "" she said .
"" Ironically , that has not been on the cards .
I think it 's a great sadness to him , understandably , that he was expelled [ for his vocal opposition to the Iraq war ] . ""
Yaqoob also revealed that she has had death threats over her political stance .
"" I 've had death threats that my children are haraam to me , that anyone who beheads me will go straight to heaven . """
2012-09-27,"The WikiLeaks founder , Julian Assange , has accused President Obama of seeking to exploit the Arab spring revolutions for political gain , claiming Obama 's vocal support for freedom of expression had not been translated into action .
Assange was speaking to a gathering of diplomats at the UN general assembly through a satellite videolink from the Ecuadorean embassy in London , where he sought refuge three months ago from extradition to Sweden , where he is wanted for questioning on allegations of sex offences .
The meeting was hosted by the Ecuadorean foreign minister , Ricardo PatiÃ±o , who said he would once more demand the UK grant Assange safe passage to Ecuador when he meets his British counterpart , William Hague , later on Thursday .
He accused the British government of violating Assange 's human rights , saying he could be stuck in the embassy in London for 10 years , which would have a severe impact on his health .
Assange , dressed in a shirt and half - knotted tie , appeared tired and unwell on the video .
He had dark rings under his eyes and sniffed frequently during a prepared presentation .
Assange focused largely on Barack 's Obama address to the UN on Tuesday in which the president gave a staunch defence of freedom of speech , and voiced American support for the revolutions in the Arab world .
Assange said that it was "" audacious "" for the US government "" to take credit for the last two years of progress "" , given past American support for the ousted Arab dictators .
He said Mohammed Bouazizi , a Tunisian street pedlar whose suicide from despair over his life in January last year sparked the revolt , "" did not set himself on fire so that Barack Obama could get re - elected "" .
He added that it was "" disrespect to the dead to claim that the United States supported the forces of change "" .
Instead , Assange claimed that it was the leak of classified US diplomatic cables to WikiLeaks , allegedly by a US soldier in military intelligence , Bradley Manning , that "" went on to help trigger the Arab spring "" .
Referring to Obama 's UN defence of the freedom of expression , Assange pointed to the treatment of Manning in US prison , where he was held in isolation , stripped and left naked for hours in his cell , and to the denunciation of WikiLeaks by American leaders . ""
The time for words has run out .
It is time to cease the persecution of our people and our alleged sources .
It is time to join the force of change , not in fine words but in fine deeds , "" Assange said .
Assange and the Ecuadorean government argue that if he goes to Sweden to face the sexual assault allegations against him , he could be extradited from there to the US to face politically - motivated prosecution .
The Sydney Morning Herald has published what it described as declassified US air force counter - intelligence reports which designated Assange and WikiLeaks as "" enemies of the United States "" , the same legal category as al - Qaida and the Taliban .
The British government said it is legally obliged to carry out Assange 's extradition after the Australian 's appeals in the British courts were rejected .
It has also said that according to European law , it would not allow extradition to the United States on charges that could result in the death penalty .
PatiÃ±o argued that the UK 's human rights obligations overrode its duty under EU treaty . ""
The United Kingdom says it defends human rights , "" PatiÃ±o said .
"" Would it be human to try to keep Mr Assange in the embassy for months or years ? ""
He added that Assange might spend up to 10 years in the embassy "" without right to his life or his privacy "" ."
2012-09-27,
2012-09-27,"A US air force systems analyst who expressed support for WikiLeaks and accused leaker Bradley Manning triggered a formal military investigation last year to determine whether she herself had leaked any documents to the group .
Air Force investigative documents , obtained through a Freedom of Information Act request , show that the analyst was repeatedly interviewed about her contacts with and support for WikiLeaks - what investigators repeatedly refer to as the "" anti - US or anti - military group "" - as well as her support for the group 's founder , Julian Assange .
The investigation was ultimately closed when they could find no evidence of unauthorized leaking , but what makes these documents noteworthy is the possible crime cited by military officials as the one they were investigating : namely , "" Communicating With the Enemy "" , under Article 104 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice ( UCMJ ) .
That is one of the most serious crimes a person can commit - it carries the penalty of death - and is committed when a person engages in "" unauthorized communication , correspondence , or intercourse with the enemy "" .
The military investigation form also requires investigators to identify the "" victim "" of the crime they are investigating , and here , they designated "" society "" as the victim : How could leaking to WikiLeaks possibly constitute the crime of "" communicating with the enemy "" ?
Who exactly is the "" enemy "" ?
There are two possible answers to that question , both quite disturbing .
The first possibility is the one suggested by today 's Sydney Morning Herald article on these documents ( as well as by WikiLeaks itself ) : that the US military now formally characterizes WikiLeaks and Assange as an "" enemy "" , the same designation it gives to groups such as Al Qaeda and the Taliban .
This would not be the first time such sentiments were expressed by the US military : recall that one of the earliest leaks from the then - largely - unknown group was a secret report prepared back in 2008 by the US Army which , as the New York Times put it , included WikiLeaks on the Pentagon 's "" list of the enemies threatening the security of the United States "" .
That Army document then plotted how to destroy the group .
But it 's the second possibility that seems to me to be the far more likely one : namely , that the US government , as part of Obama 's unprecedented war on whistleblowers , has now fully embraced the pernicious theory that any leaks of classified information can constitute the crime of "" aiding the enemy "" or "" communicating with the enemy "" by virtue of the fact that , indirectly , "" the enemy "" will - like everyone else in the world - ultimately learn of what is disclosed .
Indeed , the US military is currently prosecuting accused WikiLeaks leaker Bradley Manning on multiple charges including "" aiding the enemy "" , also under Article 104 of the UCMJ , and a capital offense
( though prosecutors are requesting "" only "" life imprisonment rather than execution ) .
Military prosecutors have since revealed that their theory is that the 23-year - old Army Private "" aided al - Qaida by leaking hundreds of thousands of military and other government documents "" -- specifically , that "" Manning indirectly aided al - Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula by giving information to WikiLeaks .
"" It seems clear that the US military now deems any leaks of classified information to constitute the capital offense of "" aiding the enemy "" or "" communicating with the enemy "" even if no information is passed directly to the "" enemy "" and there is no intent to aid or communicate with them .
Merely informing the public about classified government activities now constitutes this capital crime because it "" indirectly "" informs the enemy .
The implications of this theory are as obvious as they are disturbing .
If someone can be charged with "" aiding "" or "" communicating with the enemy "" by virtue of leaking to WikiLeaks , then why would n't that same crime be committed by someone leaking classified information to any outlet : the New York Times , the Guardian , ABC News or anyone else ?
In other words , does this theory not inevitably and necessarily make all leaking of all classified information - whether to WikiLeaks or any media outlet - a capital offense : treason or a related crime ?
International Law Professor Kevin Jon Heller made a similar point when the charges against Manning were first revealed : "" [ I]f Manning has aided the enemy , so has any media organization that published the information he allegedly stole .
Nothing in Article 104 requires proof that the defendant illegally acquired the information that aided the enemy .
As a result , if the mere act of ensuring that harmful information is published on the internet qualifies either as indirectly ' giving intelligence to the enemy ' ( if the military can prove an enemy actually accessed the information ) or as indirectly ' communicating with the enemy ' ( because any reasonable person knows that enemies can access information on the internet ) , there is no relevant factual difference between Manning and a media organization that published the relevant information . ""
Professor Heller goes on to note that while "" WikiLeaks or the New York Times could not actually be charged under Article 104 "" because "" the UCMJ only applies to soldiers "" , there is nonetheless "" still something profoundly disturbing about the prospect of convicting Manning and sentencing him to life imprisonment for doing exactly what media organizations did , as well "" .
What these new documents reveal is that this odious theory is not confined to Manning .
The US military appears to be treating all potential leaks - at least those to WikiLeaks - as "" aiding "" or "" communicating with "" the enemy .
But there is no possible limiting principle that would confine that theory only to such leaks ; they would necessarily apply to all leaks of classified information to any media outlets .
It is always worth underscoring that the New York Times has published far more government secrets than WikiLeaks ever has , and more importantly , has published far more sensitive secrets than WikiLeaks has ( unlike WikiLeaks , which has never published anything that was designated "" Top Secret "" , the New York Times has repeatedly done so : the Pentagon Papers , the Bush NSA wiretapping program , the SWIFT banking surveillance system , and the cyberwarfare program aimed at Iran were all "" Top Secret "" when the newspaper revealed them , as was the network of CIA secret prisons exposed by the Washington Post ) .
There is simply no way to convert basic leaks to WikiLeaks into capital offenses - as the Obama administration is plainly doing - without sweeping up all leaks into that attack .
Of course , that outcome would almost certainly be a feature , not a bug , for Obama officials .
This is , after all , the same administration that has prosecuted whistleblowers under espionage charges that threatened to send them to prison for life without any evidence of harm to national security , and has brought double the number of such prosecutions as all prior administrations combined .
Converting all leaks into capital offenses would be perfectly consistent with the unprecedented secrecy fixation on the part of the Most Transparent Administration Ever ™ .
The irony from these developments is glaring .
The real "" enemies "" of American "" society "" are not those who seek to inform the American people about the bad acts engaged in by their government in secret .
As Democrats once recognized prior to the age of Obama - in the age of Daniel Ellsberg - people who do that are more aptly referred to as "" heroes "" .
The actual "" enemies "" are those who abuse secrecy powers to conceal government actions and to threaten with life imprisonment or even execution those who blow the whistle on high - level wrongdoing ."
2012-09-28,"Oh dear , Slutwalk London .
On Saturday you 're marshalling crowds of women in fishnets and bras to chant "" my dress is not a yes "" and promoting petitions insisting that the Home Office should prosecute rapists .
Come Tuesday , you 're taking to Twitter to issue statements objecting to the extradition of Julian Assange to face rape allegations in Sweden .
Rapists should be prosecuted , but according to Slutwalk London , the fact that many who are accused of rape ultimately are n't convicted means that this particular accused rapist should n't be subject to due process .
It 's an awkward position to adopt , and the most awkward thing of all is the way it conscripts those who joined the march to a cause that was never part of the prospectus .
I 've squinted at the statement , lurched back and forth at my monitor , and made myself boss - eyed in the hope that the statement is the literary equivalent of a Magic Eye picture : looks like a nonsensical smear on first glimpse , eventually resolves into glorious meaning .
I 'm going to save you some time here .
Do n't bother with any of that , because the statement really is nothing but a self - contradictory trainwreck .
Slutwalk Toronto ( the mother of all Slutwalks ) has already discreetly expressed its concern about the London branch 's statement , again via Twitter .
Now , the legality of Assange 's extradition has been done and done and done again , and I 've got no desire to rehash here what 's been dealt with thoroughly elsewhere â€
“ not least because I 'm not a lawyer , and I think the world can do without another non - legal opinion on this business .
But given that Slutwalk London has no more passed its bar exams than I have , I do wonder why on earth they felt they had to say anything .
What did the person posting that statement think she was going to achieve ?
It 's hard to imagine that anyone was waiting for Slutwalk London to take a stand before they decided for themselves about a matter of international law .
There are things I might look to Slutwalk for guidance on : for example , does flashing my thigh mean I deserve to get raped ( no ) and should the police advise women against flashing their thighs for their own protection ( no again ) , but the Assange case is n't one of them .
And while it ca n't do any good , it can certainly do plenty of harm .
Anyone who 's ever had a vague feeling that all - out - with - our - tits - out is flawed as an anti - sexual violence strategy could point to this as evidence of Slutwalk 's lack of coherence â€ “ and no one who 's ill - disposed to a cause is likely to distinguish London 's organisers from all the Slutwalks worldwide making a noise for women 's right not to be assaulted .
At the same time , Slutwalk London has inadvertently lined itself ( and its unwitting supporters ) up with an unappealing gaggle of rape apologists and victim blamers .
It 's all very well for the statement to stress ""
We are not saying the women lied or that they should not get justice , "" but lots of people who support Assange have said that women lie .
If an anti - rape campaign must intervene on this case at all , surely it should be addressing those grotesque statements , not condoning the position of those who made them .
The revelations of how the victims of the Rochdale child abuse circle were failed show again how prejudices about female sexuality are used to deny women and girls justice .
In a BBC interview , one of the abused girls explains that social services told her parents that she was a "" prostitute "" and had made a "" life choice "" â€ “ even though she was only 15 .
Apparently , whatever she wore and wherever she went were seen as tokens of her own moral failings , rather than being recognised as the signs of hideous abuse .
Attitudes like that are what Slutwalk was founded to counter .
Co - opting supporters in defence of an alleged rapist is a betrayal of victims of sexual violence and a manipulative abuse of the backing that women have given to the Slutwalk cause .
Oh dear , Slutwalk London , oh dear .
Slutwalk London were asked for a comment but have not yet replied .
â€¢ This article was amended on 28 September 2012 .
The original version referred to SlutWalk London objecting to the prospect of Julian Assange being extradited to face rape charges in Sweden .
This sentence has now been changed to remove the implication that charges have already been brought"
2012-09-28,"Ecuador is prepared to set up an operating theatre in its London embassy if Julian Assange needs urgent medical attention and the UK is not prepared to guarantee his safe passage to a hospital and back , according to the Ecuadorean foreign minister .
As the WikiLeaks founder spent his 100th day in the Ecuadorean embassy , where he has sought refuge from extradition to Sweden to face allegations of sexual crimes , the country 's foreign minister met his British counterpart , William Hague , to ask about contingency plans should Assange fall ill .
Hague told Ricardo Patino that he would consult officials and lawyers and respond within a few days , but a British official commented : "" Maybe the Ecuadoreans should have thought of that before they granted him asylum . ""
The official added that British police were under obligation to arrest Assange as soon as he stepped out of the embassy . ""
One thing we have proposed is to have an ambulance parked outside , "" Patino told the Guardian in an interview in New York .
"" What we have said , if such a case should happen , we should be ready to install an operating theatre inside the premises , unless Mr Hague responds , as he promised in the next few days , that he [ Assange ] would be able to go to a hospital . ""
The Ecuadorean foreign minister said that the Australian government had offered to help organise Assange 's healthcare during an indefinite stay in an embassy apartment , given the diplomatic impasse over his fate .
Ecuador offered him asylum last month , saying he faced political persecution in the US , but the UK insists it has a legal duty to arrest him and extradite him to Sweden to face questioning .
Australian officials have not confirmed Patino 's claim that Canberra had offered medical help .
When Assange addressed diplomats at the UN general assembly this week , via a satellite link from the London embassy , he appeared pale , with dark rings under his eyes .
His voice was hoarse and his sniffed frequently .
Patino said he was not aware of any immediate health concerns for Assange but added : "" We know that anyone who lives in these conditions of confinement may easily suffer from health issues , not only physical but also psychological .
Imagine you have to stay in a room for three months .
Imagine if you are going to be five years in this confinement . ""
In November 2010 , a Swedish court ordered Assange be detained for questioning after allegations by two women that what had started as consensual sex had turned non - consensual .
This week , Amnesty International called on Sweden to provide a guarantee that if Assange travelled there to answer questions over the sex - crime allegations , he would not be sent on to the US for charges connected to WikiLeaks ' publication of thousands of US diplomatic and military cables .
A spokeswoman for the Swedish foreign ministry said the country 's legislation did not allow any judicial decision like extradition to be predetermined .
The UK , which would also have to permit an extradition to the US , has given the same response but Hague stressed to Patino at their New York meeting that the European Convention on Human Rights sets strict limits on such extraditions , forbidding them , for example , if the charges in question carry the death penalty . ""
The foreign secretary described the extensive human - rights safeguards in UK extradition law .
He requested the government of Ecuador to study these provisions closely in considering the way ahead , "" a foreign office spokesman said .
Officials said that the treatment of the alleged source of the WikiLeaks US cables , Bradley Manning â€ “ an American soldier whose lawyers say was subject to brutal and humiliating treatment and who has so far spent more than two years in jail without trial â€
“ would be taken into account if and when any future extradition decision was made .
However , Patino said that it was too late for such assurances , since Ecuador 's decision to offer asylum was irrevocable .
"" When we had n't yet granted asylum , we could talk about guarantees , "" the foreign minister said .
"" Now that we have granted asylum we are under the obligation not to surrender Mr Assange . """
2012-10-01,"Julian Assange 's bedroom behaviour is still the subject of much debate , but at least we now know what his bedroom looks like .
In a sort of budget version of MTV Cribs , Assange has given the Mail on Sunday a tour of his garret inside the Ecuadorean embassy in west London , where he fled in June to escape allegations of rape .
So what have we learned ?
The secrets of his pinkish tan , for one .
When he emerged blinking into the light for a speech in August , he looked surprisingly ruddy for a man who had spent the previous two months indoors .
That , we learn , was thanks in part to a blue floor - light that makes the ceiling look like the sky .
Then there 's a UVB light , which unfortunately worked a little too well .
"" I had blisters all down the left side and then my skin started to fall off , "" he tells the Mail â€ “ and it took half an hour of make - up "" to ensure I did n't look like a Chernobyl victim .
"" What else ?
Ken Loach has donated a running machine , on which Assange runs three to five miles a day .
Every two days , he works out with a former SAS officer .
Quite where he finds the room is unclear .
He shares a bathroom , but has his own tiny en - suite kitchen .
At one end of the room , he has squeezed a round conference table for meeting journalists and colleagues .
In front of the window ( and he moans about daylight ! )
stand four tall shelves
â€ “ sparsely filled with files , CDs for burning , pens , and a printer .
There 's a Spanish dictionary , for conversing with embassy staff , and a book about GuantÃ¡namo .
Assange claims he works a 17-hour day
â€ “
but he still finds a suspicious amount of time for watching films .
The West Wing and The Twilight Zone are current favourites , he says , as is a film about Aborigine rights
: This is How You 'll Make Your Bed in Prison .
And how does Assange make his own bed , a single mattress lying on the floor ? ""
Clumsily "" , says the Mail â€ “
though "" reports of a lack of self - care seem wide of the mark "" .
But it 's not all fun and games .
Outside , he moans , "" there is an absurdly oppressive police presence "" .
And we thought Bradley Manning had it tough ."
2012-10-01,"My very first week writing regularly at the Guardian generated intense conflict with numerous members of the British media because that happened to be the week when Ecuador granted asylum to Julian Assange ( a decision I defended ) , and - for reasons that warrant sustained study by several academic fields of discipline - very few people generate intense contempt among the British commentariat like Assange does .
One of the prime arguments I have always made about the Assange asylum case is that his particular fear of being extradited to Sweden is grounded in that country 's very unusual and quite oppressive pre - trial detention powers : ones that permit the state to act with an extreme degree of secrecy and which can even prohibit the accused from any communication with the outside world .
That is what has always led Assange to fear going to Sweden : that those detention procedures could be used to transfer him to the US without any public scrutiny ( only the most willfully irrational , given evidence like this , would deny that this is a real threat ) .
And that is the argument on behalf of Assange that has produced the greatest amount of anger : in part because some self - loving westerners find the suggestion inconceivable and offensive that a nice western nation ( as opposed to some Muslim or Latin American country ) could possibly be oppressive in any real way .
But now we have a case that confirms exactly those claims about Sweden 's justice system , and since it has nothing to do with the WikiLeaks founder , one hopes these issues can be viewed more rationally .
Gottfrid Svartholm is the founder of the file - sharing Pirate Bay website who has been prosecuted by the Swedish government for enabling copyright infringements .
At the behest of Sweden , he was recently arrested in Cambodia and then deported to Stockholm , where he has now also been accused ( though not charged ) with participating in the hacking of a Swedish company .
Svartholm is now being held under exactly the pretrial conditions that I 've long argued ( based on condemnations from human rights groups ) prevail in Sweden : "" Gottfrid Svartholm will be kept in detention for at least two more weeks on suspicion of hacking into a Swedish IT company connected to the country 's tax authorities .
According to Prosecutor Henry Olin the extended detention is needed ' to prevent him from having contact with other people . '
The Pirate Bay co - founder is not allowed to have visitors and is even being denied access to newspapers and television . . . .
"" Since he has n't been charged officially in the Logica case the Pirate Bay co - founder could only be detained for a few days . "" But , after a request from Prosecutor Henry Olin this term was extended for another two weeks mid - September , and last Friday the District Court decided that Gottfrid could be detained for another two weeks .
""
To prevent Gottfrid from interfering with the investigation the Prosecutor believes it 's justified to detain him for more than a month without being charged .
The Pirate Bay co - founder is not allowed to have visitors and is being refused access to newspapers and television . . . .
The Prosecutor has n't ruled out a request for another extension of Gottfrid 's detainment in two weeks , if the investigation is still ongoing . ""
The claim that produced the most vitriol was that Sweden vests remarkable power in prosecutors and courts to keep accused suspects completely hidden from public view , with no communication or other contact with the outside world , and that this power is exercised with some frequency .
Now we have confirmation of that claim from , of all people , the Swedish prosecutor in this case , Henrik Olin , who said in an interview outside the courtroom : "" '
According to the Swedish system , when the preliminary investigation is finished , I as prosecutor will decide whether to prosecute him . . . .
In the Swedish system it is quite usual for people to be detained on this legal ground , and it gives me the possibility to prevent him from having contact with other people . '
"" Unlike in the British system , in which all proceedings , including extradition proceedings , relating to Assange would be publicly scrutinized and almost certainly conducted in open court , the unusual secrecy of Sweden 's pre - trial judicial process , particularly the ability to hold the accused incommunicado , poses a real danger that whatever happened to Assange could be effectuated without any public notice .
That has always been , and remains , the prime fear for his being extradited to Sweden : a fear that could be , and should be , redressed by negotiations between Ecuador , Sweden and the UK to assure that he can go to Sweden while having his rights protected ."
2012-10-03,"Julian Assange 's supporters have pleaded in court to keep Â£140,000 in bail money that is in jeopardy because of the WikiLeaks founder 's decision to seek political asylum in the Ecuadorean embassy in London .
Vaughan Smith , the former British army captain who hosted Assange at his Norfolk home while he was on bail throughout 2011 , told Westminster magistrates court that Assange 's nine sureties were powerless over the man whose compliance with the legal process they had guaranteed back in 2010 .
He said Assange 's decision to evade a European arrest warrant had become an "" unprecedented "" matter of diplomatic and inter - governmental concern , which they could not reasonably influence .
Smith spoke on behalf of sureties who include Philip Knightly , a veteran Australian investigative journalist who exposed the British traitor Kim Philby as a Russian spy , and Sir John Sulston , a Nobel prize - winning biologist .
Smith told the court that a group of them visited Assange on Monday and concluded "" the sureties do not have the power to meaningfully intervene in this matter .
This has become a matter between the Ecuadorean , British , Swedish , US and Australian governments . ""
The supporters provided between Â£5,000 and Â£20,000 each to secure Assange 's freedom when he was arrested in December 2010 in connection with allegations of rape and sexual assault relating to relationships with two women in Stockholm .
Assange broke his bail conditions in June this year when he took refuge in the Ecuadorean embassy in Knightsbridge after he lost a supreme court challenge to the validity of the European arrest warrant that demanded his return to Sweden for questioning .
It is understood that a separate group of Assange supporters , thought to include the film - maker Ken Loach , the writer and campaigner Jemima Khan , the journalist John Pilger and the magazine publisher
Felix Dennis have already forfeited bail cash worth Â£200,000 following a court order earlier this year .
"" We never envisaged when we became sureties that the matter would become a diplomatic argument and it is clear that this needs to be resolved at diplomatic level , "" said Smith in the short hearing in front of the chief magistrate , Howard Riddle , which was attended by four other sureties :
Knightly , Prof Patricia David , a retired professor of education , Lady Caroline Evans , the wife of the former Labour minister Lord Evans , and Tracy Worcester , a model turned environmental activist .
Smith told the court that the sureties could not ignore the perceived risk that if Assange is extradited to Sweden he could end up in a US prison "" under unjust conditions "" .
To publicly urge him to leave the embassy would "" render us mercenary and contemptible individuals of great weakness of character "" , Smith said .
He urged the court to take into account the "" huge amount of effort over an unexpectedly long period "" the sureties had put in to support the legal process .
He drew attention to his own efforts and those of his family , who as well as standing Â£20,000 in bail money hosted Assange for 13 months .
He also highlighted the efforts of Sarah Saunders , a WikiLeaks activist and surety , who hosted Assange at her Kent home from where he had to report each day to a police station and adhere to a 10pm - to-8am curfew . ""
We request that sureties in this case be treated gracefully , in a manner that reflects the impossible position that we are in , "" he said .
"" In this unique , this quite exceptional case , complying with what this court seems to expect from us , to all publicly urge Mr Assange to abandon the sanctuary that he has found in the Ecuadorean embassy , would see us acting against a man whom we and others judge to have understandable fears about his ultimate treatment in the United States if he abandons his asylum . ""
The chief magistrate said he would take several days to consider the submission and other evidence before making a ruling .
In an earlier hearing in September , he had given the nine sureties a month to persuade Assange to surrender himself to police if they wanted their money back , saying he was not persuaded that they were not "" using every effort , publicly and privately , to persuade Mr Assange to surrender himself to UK authorities "" .
In August , Ecuador 's president , Rafael Correa , granted Assange asylum and said the 41-year - old Australian could stay indefinitely in the London embassy .
Sweden said in August that any suggestion that Assange could be extradited to America , where he is wanted for his role in leaking hundreds of thousands of classified US military and diplomatic papers , was "" hypothetical speculation that shifts the focus away from what this case is actually about "" .
Assange has claimed he could face the death penalty in the US .
Karin Hoglund , deputy ambassador at the Swedish embassy in Washington DC , said the issue was "" exclusively a question of surrender to Sweden under a European arrest warrant on Mr Assange , who is under criminal investigation in Sweden suspected of sexual offences against two Swedish women "" .
She said : "" Sweden is not allowed to extradite a person at risk of capital punishment â€ ¦ The extradition act also includes grounds for refusal of extradition , such as political or military offences and situations in which the person who is extradited is at risk of persecution . ""

2012-10-03,"Benedict Cumberbatch is in line to play Julian Assange in a forthcoming biopic about the WikiLeaks founder , reports Deadline .
Steven Spielberg 's Dreamworks studio is basing its film on the books WikiLeaks :
Inside Julian Assange 's War on Secrecy , by Guardian writers David Leigh and Luke Harding , and Inside WikiLeaks : My Time With Julian Assange at the World 's Most Dangerous Website , written by Assange 's former right - hand man Daniel Domscheit - Berg .
Both books were optioned by the studio last year .
Deadline says Joel Kinnaman of the US version of The Killing , who was recently cast as the new Robocop , could play Domscheit - Berg .
The casting news suggests that Jeremy Renner , who had previously been tipped to play Assange , is no longer in the running .
Bill Condon , the man behind The Twilight Saga :
Breaking Dawn â€ “
Part One and Two , remains the studio 's first choice to direct .
Assange is currently holed up in the Ecuadorian embassy in London , where he has claimed political asylum to avoid extradition to Sweden to face sex - crime accusations .
His lawyer has argued that his client would not receive a fair trial , and Assange also fears he could face extradition to the United States .
The WikiLeaks film was previously reported to be pitched somewhere between The Social Network and All the President 's Men , and is one of a number of mooted projects about Assange doing the rounds .
Others include an Australian TV movie , in which Anthony LaPaglia plays a cop tracking the young Assange as he embarks on his early career as a hacker in Melbourne , a fictional account of the activist 's adventures in internet dating by Khodorkovsky director Cyril Tuschi , and a second TV film from the HBO stable .
Cumberbatch has so much work on his plate that fans of his turn as Sherlock Holmes in the BBC TV series Sherlock may be wondering how he plans to fit series three into his schedule .
The British actor plays a headline - grabbing villain role in the next Star Trek film , titled Into Darkness , and is voicing both the dragon , Smaug , and the Necromancer in Peter Jackson 's Hobbit trilogy .
He will also star in Steve McQueen 's Twelve Years a Slave , and has a role lined up in the forthcoming big - screen adaptation of the Pulitzer and Tony - winning play August : Osage County opposite Meryl Streep and Julia Roberts ."
2012-10-08,"Julian Assange 's supporters have been ordered to forfeit Â£93,500 in bail money after the WikiLeaks founder sought political asylum in the Ecuadorean embassy in London .
A court ruled on Monday that the payments must be made within a month by nine friends and backers who in 2010 pledged Â£140,000 to guarantee Assange would abide by bail conditions during a failed legal challenge to extradition proceedings brought by authorities in Sweden , where he faces allegations of rape and sexual assault .
Vaughan Smith , the former British army captain who hosted Assange at his Norfolk home while he was on bail throughout 2011 , and had promised to pay Â£20,000 if Assange skipped bail , was ordered to pay Â£12,000 , while Philip Knightly , a veteran Australian investigative journalist who exposed the British traitor Kim Philby as a Russian spy , was ordered to pay Â£15,000 , Â£5,000 less than he originally pledged .
Making the ruling at Westminster magistrates court , the chief magistrate , Howard Riddle , said he accepted that the sureties "" acted in good faith "" , but said the system of sureties for defendants who want to remain at liberty would be undermined if cash was not forfeited .
"" I accept that they trusted Mr Assange to surrender himself as required , "" he said .
"" I accept that they followed the proceedings and made necessary arrangements to remain in contact with him .
However , they failed in their basic duty , to ensure his surrender . ""
Assange broke his bail conditions in June this year when he took refuge in the Ecuadorean embassy in Knightsbridge after he lost a supreme court challenge to the validity of the European arrest warrant that demanded his return to Sweden for questioning .
He was due to be sent to Sweden within days when he took up residence in the diplomatic mission , where he was granted political asylum .
Assange 's colleagues in the WikiLeaks organisation , Joseph Farrell and Sarah Harrison , were ordered to pay Â£3,500 each after originally pledging a combined Â£10,000 .
Sir John Sulston , a Nobel - prize - winning biologist , was ordered to pay Â£15,000 of the Â£20,000 he pledged .
Tracy Worcester , a model turned environmental campaigner , had to pay Â£7,500 while Prof Tricia David , an educationalist , had to pay Â£10,000 of the Â£20,000 she promised .
Caroline Michel , at one time Assange 's literary agent , was ordered to pay Â£15,000 of the Â£20,000 she had promised .
The forfeitures came after the nine sureties last week pleaded for leniency in a statement to the court read out by Smith .
He had argued the sureties were powerless over Assange 's decision to evade a European arrest warrant because it had become an "" unprecedented "" matter of diplomatic and inter - governmental concern .
He also said they could not ignore the perceived risk that if Assange was extradited to Sweden he could end up in a US prison "" under unjust conditions "" and that to have urged Assange to give himself up would "" render us mercenary and contemptible individuals of great weakness of character "" .
In his ruling , the chief magistrate said he understood this final point and took "" some account of their integrity "" , but dismissed the argument that Assange feared that he would be subsequently extradited to the United States and even GuantÃ¡namo Bay .
"" It is not new and should have been taken into account by the sureties when entering into and maintaining their obligations , "" he said .
"" What is undoubtedly unique is that the defendant sought , and has apparently been granted , asylum by Ecuador , "" the chief magistrate said .
"" It was suggested that the defendant is simply seeking an alternative legal process .
However , in principle I see no difference between seeking refuge in the Ecuadorean embassy , and taking flight to that country . ""
He accepted that it was different in that "" this could take place without the need for travel documents , advanced flight arrangements and so on "" . ""
Secondly , "" he agreed , "" there remains the hope , expressed by all the sureties , that discussions between the relevant governments will lead to a solution , and in particular the solution of Mr Assange surrendering to the police here . ""
He said he also took account of the sureties ' means . ""
Professor David is a pensioner and the sum of Â£20,000 comprises a substantial portion of her savings jointly with her husband , "" he ruled . ""
Sarah Saunders has also provided details of her financial position and I am satisfied that she is of comparatively limited means .
Mr Vaughan Smith tells me that if he forfeits the Â£20,000 surety it will have a significant impact on the welfare of his family and his employees . ""
Smith said he was disappointed at the ruling and felt the sureties were being punished despite providing "" a public service "" in ensuring Assange met his bail conditions for 18 months until he entered the Ecuadorean embassy .
"" We feel we 've done our bit , but the ball has moved into another court now , "" he said .
"" We feel there are many in this country who are sympathetic . ""
He said he would have to borrow the money .
"" I rely on an income from a farm and from my journalism and I do n't have Â£12,000 sitting in the bank , "" he said .
It is understood that a separate group of Assange supporters , thought to include the film - maker Ken Loach , the writer and campaigner Jemima Khan , the journalist John Pilger and the magazine publisher
Felix Dennis have already forfeited bail cash worth Â£200,000 following a court order earlier this year ."
2012-10-08,"Julian Assange 's last foray into the publishing world ended in an acrimonious and highly costly dispute , after he withdrew from his million - pound contract and his publishers released a draft autobiography manuscript against his wishes .
Now confined to the Ecuadorean embassy in London after being granted asylum , the WikiLeaks founder has announced he is to publish a new book about the internet , freedom and what he terms "" the resistance "" .
The book , entitled Cypherpunks : Freedom and the Future of the Internet , will be published in paperback and electronically on 26 November , the US publisher OR Books told the New York Times .
Three "" cutting - edge thinkers and activists from the frontline of the battle for cyberspace "" are listed as co - authors : US - based Jacob Applebaum , Jeremie Zimmermann from France and German Andy MÃ¼ller - Maguhn .
The text is largely based on a transcript of an interview Assange conducted with the three others for an episode of his TV show , The World Tomorrow , broadcast in June on the Russian state - funded channel RT , Zimmermann told the Guardian .
But he said there would be "" plenty of added content "" .
"" We covered a wide range of issues : from surveillance to data protection , from corporate influence over politics to citizen participation and action , transparency and accountability , from liberalism to anarchism , from copyright enforcement to culture , from flying killing robots ( drones ) to representation of crime scenes depicting abuse of children ( child porn ) , "" he added in an email .
Zimmermann , the co - founder and spokesman for the citizen advocacy group La Quadrature du Net , said he had insisted on a bottle of whisky and some cigars during the interview , "" to make the discussion more fluid , cosy and friendly "" .
The announcement comes a year after the publication of Julian Assange : The Unauthorised Autobiography , which was issued by the publishers Canongate against the Australian 's wishes after he withdrew from his contract but failed to return his advance .
Last week Canongate blamed the collapse of its deal with Assange , reportedly worth a total of Â£930,000 , for operating losses of Â£368,000 last year .
The published book , based on an early draft manuscript , was a dramatic flop , selling only 644 copies in its first week of release .
Assange has been living in a small room in the Ecuadorean embassy in west London since June , when he sought asylum , arguing that his imminent extradition to Sweden to answer accusations of sex offences put him at risk of onward removal to the US , where he fears espionage charges .
The central American country granted his asylum request in August , but the UK authorities have insisted he will be arrested if he tries to leave the embassy .
Colin Robinson , co - publisher of OR Books , said Assange had made the initial approach to the publisher , which claims to "" embrace progressive change in politics , culture and the way we do business "" and deals directly with readers , cutting out booksellers and sales teams .
The format of the book had evolved in discussions , he said , but more than half of it was new material . ""
The issues they are discussing â€ “ how do you create an internet where secrecy by governments and powerful institutions is minimised and privacy for ordinary people is guaranteed ?
â€ “ are complicated questions , "" he said .
Assange had received an advance for the book , he said , though he declined to reveal how much ."
2012-10-09,"Julian Assange has found a new platform on which to press his case against extradition : the vast "" little monster "" fanbase of the pop star Lady Gaga , who has visited him for dinner at the Ecuadorean embassy .
Gaga dined with the WikiLeaks founder on Monday night after launching a perfume at the Harrods department store next door to the embassy where Assange , 41 , has been holed up since seeking political asylum in June .
WikiLeaks seized on the apparently impromptu visit by one of the world 's biggest - selling singers to urge its defenders to "" educate her support base "" , which includes over 30 million followers on Twitter .
Assange broke his bail conditions to evade extradition to Sweden where he is wanted to face allegations of rape and sexual assault , which he strenuously denies .
He believes he faces imprisonment in the US and has claimed he could be sent to GuantÃ¡namo Bay for his role in disseminating classified US government documents .
Gaga , whose real name is Stefani Germanotta , has backed several political campaigns , notably gay rights campaigns in America .
This week she urged her fans , who she calls "" little monsters "" , to read up on fracking , the controversial technique of extracting shale gas , which campaigners complain causes environmental destruction .
Gaga 's meeting with Assange was heavily plugged by WikiLeaks , which urged supporters to join protests outside the embassy and kept them up to date about Gaga 's arrival .
The Bad Romance singer posted pictures of the visit on her website , including one of her with Assange inside the embassy .
Her trademark extravagant dress , including a witch - style hat , made for a stark contrast with Assange 's plain white T - shirt .
Assange is able to accept visitors but can not step outside the embassy because the British authorities have posted policemen at the front and back entrances who are poised to arrest him if he leaves .
He would then be sent to Sweden under the terms of a European arrest warrant ( EAW ) .
Last week , Assange 's visitors included a group of financial backers who stood to lose Â£140,000 in bail money because of Assange 's refusal to accept the supreme court 's verdict upholding the EAW .
On Monday a court ordered them to forfeit Â£93,500 .
It is understood Lady Gaga was encouraged to meet Assange by MIA , the British rapper who scored the music for Assange 's chatshow on Russia Today , the Kremlin - funded English language TV channel .
Gaga already has a bit part in the story of WikiLeaks .
Bradley Manning , the US army private who is accused by the American authorities of stealing hundreds of thousands of classified US military and diplomatic documents , once told a computer hacker called Adrian Lamo that he "" listened and lip - synched to Lady Gaga 's song Telephone while exfiltrating possibly the largest data spillage in American history "" .
He is facing trial next February , by which time he will have spent 983 days in prison without trial ."
2012-10-09,"It 's a celebrity pairing too peculiar to have been invented : on Monday evening , Lady Gaga , fresh from a public appearance over the road at Harrods , dropped by the Ecuadorian embassy to see Julian Assange , who has been holed up there , claiming asylum , since June .
It was , by all accounts , no flying visit
â€ “ Gaga stayed for five hours .
She came , apparently , at the behest of rapper MIA , but it 's unclear if the latter actually turned up herself .
Assuming it was just the two of them , what did Gaga and Julian talk about for five hours ?
Answers , please , below ."
2012-10-12,"The computer hacker collective Anonymous has distanced itself from WikiLeaks , claiming the whistleblowers ' site has become too focused on the personal tribulations of its founder , Julian Assange .
A statement posted on the Anonymous Twitter account , AnonymousIRC , described WikiLeaks as "" the one man Julian Assange show "" after the website began asking users to pay for access to millions of leaked documents . ""
The idea behind WikiLeaks was to provide the public with information that would otherwise be kept secret by industries and governments .
Information we strongly believe the public has a right to know , "" said the statement on behalf of Anonymous . ""
But this has been pushed more and more into the background , instead we only hear about Julian Assange , like he had dinner last night with Lady Gaga .
That 's great for him but not much of our interest .
We are more interested in transparent governments and bringing out documents and information they want to hide from the public . ""
Anonymous has long been one of WikiLeaks 's most loyal and vocal allies .
Supporters bearing Anonymous posters regularly turned out at Assange 's public announcements , and members of the group have waged an online campaign against critics of the whistleblowers ' site .
WikiLeaks said it is funded entirely by donations from members of the public .
The site angered some users on Thursday after it made a donation page automatically appear before it allowed access to leaked documents .
Some users are unable to view WikiLeaks material unless they choose to donate money to the site .
WikiLeaks said on Twitter that the move was an attempt to counter what it called "" high costs in military courts "" .
In the statement , Anonymous told its 285,000 followers that WikiLeaks was an "" awesome idea ruined by egos "" and claimed the site had abandoned the ideals of freedom of expression .
The group added : "" We have been worried about the direction WikiLeaks is going for a while .
In the recent month the focus moved away from actual leaks and the fight for freedom of information further and further while it concentrated more and more on Julian Assange .
It goes without saying that we oppose any plans of extraditing Julian to the USA .
He is a content provider and publisher , not a criminal . ""
The dispute could starve WikiLeaks of potentially newsworthy leaks in the future , as some of the site 's recent disclosures â€ “ including the cache of Stratfor emails â€ “ are alleged to have come from Anonymous ."
2012-10-12,"The winner of the 2012 Nobel peace prize will be revealed later today , amid frenzied speculation that this year 's award could be given to bloggers from the Arab spring , Russian rights activists or even to Julian Assange , currently holed up in an embassy next to Harrods .
The five members of the Nobel peace prize committee will announce their decision at 10 am BST .
Some 231 individuals and organisations have been nominated for this year 's prize , to be awarded in Oslo on 10 December â€ “ slightly fewer than 2011 , which had a record 241 entries .
Last year three women shared the award â€ “ Liberia 's president Ellen Johnson Sirleaf , the Liberian activist Leymah Gbowee and the Yemeni politician Tawakkul Karman .
It significantly boosted the number of women winners â€ “ the tally was previously just 12 since 1901 .
The committee praised their "" non - violent struggle for the safety of women and for women 's rights to full participation in peace - building work "" .
However , in an embarrassing blow to the committee , Gbowee recently launched a scathing attack on Sirleaf , her fellow laureate and Africa 's first female head of state .
Gbowee accused Liberia 's president of nepotism and complacency over poverty reduction , and dramatically quit her post as head of the government 's Peace and Reconciliation Commission .
This year , the bookies ' favourite for the Nobel prize is Gene Sharp , one of the world 's leading theorists of non - violence and an emeritus professor at the University of Massachusetts .
( Paddy Power has installed him at 6/4 . )
Sharp is credited with inspiring peaceful protests across the globe , from Cairo to Beijing .
Two other activists prominent during the Arab spring are also tipped â€ “ 29-year - old Tunisian blogger Lina Ben Mhenni and the celebrated Egyptian internet activist Wael Ghonim .
The most politically controversial choice , however , would be to give the prize to campaigners from eastern Europe .
Since his return to the Kremlin in May , Russia 's president Vladimir Putin has enacted a series of repressive new measures in response to growing anti - government protests .
He has expelled USAID and demanded that western - funded Russian non - governmental organisations brand themselves as "" foreign agents "" â€ “ a move straight from the KGB 's playbook .
One activist mentioned for the prize is Svetlana Gannushkina and her Moscow - based human rights organisation Memorial .
Another is Lyudmila Alexseyava , the 85-year - old doyenne of Russia 's human rights scene , and chair of the Moscow Helskinki Group .
Alexeyeva is one of the few survivors of the Soviet dissident movement , a veteran enemy of state power , and was arrested two years ago at a New Year 's Eve protest dressed as the Snow Maiden .
Another contender is Ales Belyatsky , an activist from Belarus .
Belyatsky was detained in August 2011 and jailed after a show trial condemned as "" political "" by the European Union .
Putin and his Belarusian counterpart Alexander Lukashenko are likely to react badly if the peace prize is given to activists from their countries , and to regard it as unacceptable western meddling .
Following his nomination in 2011 , the WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange is also on the list â€ “ and tipped by the bookies at 16/1 .
It seems far - fetched , however , that Assange will get the award at a time when he is fighting rape allegations and an EU arrest warrant for extradition to Stockholm , home of the Nobel Foundation .
Assange has been living in the Ecuadorean embassy in London since June and has been given political asylum .
He would have to get past the Scotland Yard policemen waiting on the doorstep to arrest him to collect his prize .
There are several long - shot suggestions also on the bookies ' list including Facebook ( 33/1 ) , the European Union ( 40/1 ) and Bono ( 100/1 ) .
Other more plausible names doing the rounds in Oslo include the former German chancellor Helmut Kohl , now in poor health ; the Mexican bishop Jose Raul Lopez ; Cuban dissident Oscar Elias Biscet ; blogger Yoani Sanchez ; and the instigators of the Myanmar reform process .
The award consists of a Nobel diploma , a gold medal and 8 m Swedish kronor ( Â£700,000 ) .
Previous winners who have provoked controversy include Barack Obama â€ “ he had only just become US president in 2009 , leading many to wonder what he had actually achieved â€ “ and Henry Kissinger ."
2012-10-26,"Julian Assange has said he will not consider leaving the Ecuadorean embassy in London unless the US government drops its "" immoral "" investigation into WikiLeaks .
Assange has been sheltering in the embassy since June as part of his attempt to avoid extradition to Sweden to face rape allegations .
He fears he will ultimately be sent to the United States to face interrogation over the whistleblowing website , which he founded .
In a CNN interview in the embassy , Assange said the standoff could end if the US government drops its investigation .
"" It 's an immoral investigation , "" he said .
"" It breaches the first amendment , it breaches all the principles that the US government says it stands for and it absolutely breaches the principles the founding fathers stood for and which most of the US people believe in . ""
Assange broke his bail conditions in June when he took refuge in the embassy in Knightsbridge after he lost a supreme court challenge to the validity of the European arrest warrant that demanded his return to Sweden for questioning .
He was due to be sent within days when he took up residence in the diplomatic mission having been granted political asylum .
His lawyers and the Ecuadorean government contend that travelling to Sweden could lead to his extradition to the US , where he could face charges over WikiLeaks ' publication of thousands of US diplomatic cables .
US soldier Bradley Manning is two years into his military solitary confinement for allegedly leaking hundreds of thousands of US state secrets , many of which ended up on the WikiLeaks website .
He is currently awaiting trial and could be sentenced to life in prison if found guilty .
"" There 's an attempt to extradite me without charge and without evidence , allegedly for the purpose of questioning , "" said Assange .
"" Meanwhile , the FBI has been engaged in building this tremendous case , now up to 41,235 pages . ""
In the interview , Assange compared life in the embassy to "" living on a space station "" .
"" There 's no natural light , "" he said .
"" You have got to make all your own stuff .
You ca n't go out to the shops .
But I 've been in solitary confinement .
I know what life is like for prisoners
â€ “
[ this is ] a lot better than it is for prisoners . ""
His interview came after WikiLeaks released more than 100 US defence department files on Thursday disclosing the military 's detention policies in Guantanamo Bay and Iraq , dating from the September 11 attacks until 2004 .
Assange said the documents showed that "" policies of unaccountability "" had allowed prisoners to be abused with impunity .
The destruction of video interviews or the failure to record them , as revealed in the files , had led to a situation "" where abuse can occur and it ca n't be discovered "" ."
2012-11-12,"The Last King of Scotland actor James McAvoy is set to join Benedict Cumberbatch in the cast of the as - yet - untitled Wikileaks film currently being developed by DreamWorks , reports Variety .
Cumberbatch will play WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange , while McAvoy is in negotiations to play Daniel Domscheit - Berg , the German "" technology activist "" who became Assange 's associate at WikiLeaks in 2007 and spokesperson for the organisation , but who then fell out with Assange and left WikiLeaks three years later .
Domscheit - Berg is also the author of Inside WikiLeaks :
My Time with Julian Assange at the World 's Most Dangerous Website , one of the production 's principal sources for the film ; the other is WikiLeaks :
Inside Julian Assange 's War on Secrecy by Guardian journalists David Leigh and Luke Harding .
According to Variety , "" Assange is expected to be portrayed as a noble crusader who eventually becomes drunk with power as he grows increasingly paranoid and obsessed with winning the ' war of information ' .
"" The film is scripted by The West Wing 's Josh Singer .
Bill Condon , of The Twilight Saga :
Breaking Dawn Parts 1 and 2 has been hired to direct ."
2012-11-26,"Julian Assange 's new book is not a manifesto , he writes in its introduction â€ “
"" There is no time for that "" .
Instead the short volume , entitled Cypherpunks : Freedom and the Future of the Internet and published on Monday , is intended to be what the Wikileaks founder calls "" a watchman 's shout in the night "" , warning of an imminent threat to all civilisation from "" the most dangerous facilitator of totalitarianism we have ever seen "" â€ “ the web .
Assange announced in October his intention to publish the book , based largely on the transcript of an interview conducted earlier in the year with three fellow "" cutting - edge thinkers "" on the web , and broadcast on the Russian state - controlled TV channel RT .
But in his introduction , written from the small room in the Ecuadorean embassy in London to which he has been confined for more than five months , the Australian has described for the first time how he views the context for its publication .
It is not an upbeat assessment : thanks to the "" global surveillance industry "" and states that seek to control the net , he writes , "" within a few years , global civilisation will be a postmodern surveillance dystopia , from which escape for all but the most skilled individuals will be impossible .
In fact , we may already be there . ""
Assange sought political asylum from Ecuador on 19 June in order to avoid imminent extradition to Sweden , where he is wanted for questioning in connection with alleged sex offences , including rape .
He has said that he fears onward extradition to the US , where a grand jury has been convened to investigate Wikileaks over its publication in 2010 of leaked US diplomatic cables , in this newspaper and elsewhere .
His request was later granted by Ecuador , which said he could stay inside the embassy for "" two centuries "" if necessary .
Britain has said that if he tries to leave he will be arrested and extradited to Sweden , but that it would block any onward extradition request to the US if the Australian were to face a possible death penalty .
His experiences have influenced his world view , Assange acknowledges in his introduction . ""
While many writers have considered what the internet means for global civilisation , they are wrong â€
¦
They are wrong because they have never met the enemy
â€
¦
We have met the enemy . ""
Jeremie Zimmermann , co - founder and spokesman for the French citizen advocacy group La Quadrature du Net ( Squaring the Net ) and one of Assange 's named fellow authors , told the Guardian when the book was announced that it would cover "" a wide range of issues : from surveillance to data protection , from corporate influence over politics to citizen participation and action , transparency and accountability , from liberalism to anarchism , from copyright enforcement to culture , from flying killing robots ( drones ) to representation of crime scenes depicting abuse of children ( child porn ) "" .
Also contributing to the book are Jacob Applebaum , a US - based computer security expert , and Andy MÃ¼ller - Maguhn , a leading German hacker .
Zimmermann said he had insisted on a bottle of whisky and some cigars when the four met , "" to make the discussion more ' fluid ' ( no pun intended ) , cozy and friendly "" ."

2012-12-13,"WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange has revealed his intention to run for a Senate seat in the 2013 Australian federal election .
Assange , 41 , said plans to set up a WikiLeaks political party were "" significantly advanced "" and had received support from a number of "" worthy people "" in his home country .
In an interview with Fairfax Media , he said his party would promote openness in government and politics and combat growing intrusions on individual privacy .
He said he would be eligible to register as an overseas voter in either New South Wales or Victoria and would shortly take a "" strategic decision "" about which state he would contest .
Assange , who was born in Queensland , has been holed up inside Ecuador 's embassy in London since June in a bid to avoid extradition to Sweden for questioning over rape and sexual assault allegations .
He has stated he would happily go to Stockholm , providing the Swedish government guaranteed he would not be extradited on to the US .
The WikiLeaks party would require 500 members listed on the electoral roll for it to be registered with Australia 's electoral commission .
If Assange is elected but unable to return to Australia to take up his position , a nominee would occupy a Senate seat ."

2012-12-20,"Julian Assange has said ( video ) that WikiLeaks is preparing to publish 1 m new secret government documents as he marked six months of refuge in the Ecuadorean embassy in London with a speech from its balcony on Thursday .
The WikiLeaks founder has remained in the embassy to avoid arrest and extradition to Sweden on suspicion of sexual offences .
There is a permanent police guard and Assange will be arrested if he leaves the premises .
About 80 supporters gathered on Thursday night to hear Assange speak .
They carried candles and held placards reading , "" Do n't shoot the messenger "" and "" Do n't trust Sweden "" .
Some sang Christmas carols as they waited for Assange to speak from the first floor balcony , a short distance from Harrods department store .
There were 60 additional police officers on duty .
Assange emerged with a raised fist and greeted the crowd : "" What a sight for sore eyes .
People ask what gives me hope .
The answer is right here . ""
He was momentarily disturbed when a journalist from Channel 4 shouted questions at him with a loudhailer , but he recovered and delivered a 15-minute speech which was high in rhetoric and low in novelty . ""
Six months ago I entered this building .
It has become my home , my office and my refuge .
Thanks to the principled stance of the Ecuadorean government and the support of its people , I am safe in this embassy and safe to speak from this embassy , "" he said .
Assange said that as long as the US government sought to persecute him and the Australian government refused to support him , he had no choice but to remain in the Ecuadorean embassy .
He said he was willing to negotiate with anyone . ""
However , the door is open , and the door has always been open , for anyone who wishes to use standard procedures to speak to me or guarantee my safe passage , "" he said .
Assange said attempts to prosecute him were an attack on freedom of speech before stepping back into the embassy .
Time Blades , 40 , one of Assange 's supporters , said that he had been coming to the embassy to show his support for the WikiLeaks founder since August .
"" I come in defence of freedom of speech and to defend the right of Julian Assange to have asylum granted to him by a sovereign and independent country .
This can not go on for ever .
The British government has to permit safe access to Ecuador for Julian Assange .
This will only happen as a result of diplomatic pressure and the people pressure , "" he said .
Ana Alban , the Ecuadorean ambassador , said in a statement that his government continued to support Assange ."
2012-12-20,"WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange said on Thursday night the "" door is open "" for talks to break the deadlock over his campaign to avoid extradition to Sweden .
He made a rare public appearance on a balcony at the Ecuadorean embassy in London to mark the six - month anniversary of his sudden arrival at the building .
He has since been granted political asylum by Ecuador 's government but has remained inside the embassy .
The Australian will be arrested if he steps outside as he has broken his bail conditions .
He thanked his supporters , who stood in the street outside , some carrying lighted candles .
He said : "" Six months ago I entered this building .
It has become my home , my office and my refuge .
Thanks to the principled stance of the Ecuadorean government and the support of its people , I am safe in this embassy and safe to speak from this embassy . ""
He said he had been sustained by the solidarity of his supporters and people around the world supporting WikiLeaks and freedom of the press . ""
While my freedom is limited , I am still able to work and communicate , unlike the 232 journalists who are in jail tonight . ""
Assange is wanted for questioning in Sweden over allegations of sexual assault , which he denies .
He fears being sent to the United States to be questioned over his whistleblowing website .
He said on Thursday that the Pentagon claimed recently that the existence of WikiLeaks was an "" ongoing crime "" .
Assange continued : "" While that remains the case and while my government will not defend the journalism and publishing of WikiLeaks , I must remain here . ""
However , the door is open , and the door has always been open , for anyone who wishes to use standard procedures to speak to me or guarantee my safe passage . ""
TV crews from across the world filmed the speech .
There was an added police presence outside the embassy ."

2013-01-10,"Outraged Oxford students are planning demonstrations following news that Julian Assange , the controversial Wikileaks founder , has been invited to speak at the 189-year - old Oxford Union debating society .
The union plans to include Assange in an event celebrating prominent whistleblowers on 23 January .
He is scheduled to speak via video link from the Ecuadorian embassy , where he sought sanctuary last June from a European arrest warrant for extradition to Sweden over rape allegations .
As news of the invitation broke , criticism of the decision to give a platform to such a controversial figure came swiftly .
Tom Rutland ( @tomrutland ) , president - elect of the Oxford University students ' union , tweeted : "" Someone facing a European arrest warrant in relation to being wanted for questioning regarding sexual offences should not be platformed . ""
The student 's union is not affiliated with the Oxford Union , a politically neutral debating society .
Opposition to the invitation is focused primarily upon Assange 's status as an alleged sex offender resisting arrest .
Simone Webb , who has instigated a Facebook campaign to protest outside the union on the night itself , says : "" The protest is objecting primarily to Julian Assange 's continued unwillingess to face the Swedish justice system over rape allegations .
It is particularly ironic that he 's been asked to speak at an awards event which supposedly celebrates integrity and the search for truth , when he is himself blocking the search for truth . ""
Others , however , are keen for Assange to speak , after a planned appearance at the Cambridge Union was cancelled last year . ""
The central principle is that a debate must not merely provide a platform for the guest speaker .
There must be the opportunity for the speaker 's views to be tested through questioning and debate , "" says a former president of the union , Izzy Westbury .
"" Inviting someone controversial â€ “ be it in a political sense , a religious one or , in the case of Assange , a legal one â€ “ is the best way of showing them for what they really are .
When Assange is video - linked to the union , I would expect and encourage questions that challenge both his views and his actions .
We should put him in an uncomfortable position â€ “ that is the condition of the invite . ""
In a press release , the union also emphasised that there would be an opportunity to question Assange . ""
Mr Assange is clearly a figure who generates controversy for reasons ranging from the charges made against him in Sweden , to the perceived recklessness of some Wikileaks activities .
We would therefore encourage those who disagree with him , or with any of our other speakers , to participate in the Q&amp;A session . ""
Westbury says that untenable views are often shown up at the union : "" In February 2011 , Zakir Naik addressed the Oxford Union via video link , despite an exclusion order imposed by home secretary , Theresa May , in June that year .
There was a fair bit of fuss at the time and a few Tory MPs were a bit rankled by the decision , but frankly , he did n't come out all that well . ""
The protesters have rejected a charge of being anti - free speech , and question whether the Wikileaks founder will be subjected to any serious cross - examination at the union . ""
Assange is being invited to speak at an award ceremony , where he will be lauded for the work that he has done , "" says Abigail Burman , equal opportunities president at Corpus Christi college .
She argues that an invitation to someone accused of rape "" sends the message that rape is no big deal , apologies will be made for perpetrators , and survivors wo n't be heard .
I completely support his right to free speech , but I think he needs to find another place to exercise it .
Oxford should be a place where sexual assault is never okay . ""
With the women 's campaign at the student 's union due to meet soon to discuss the matter , and the numbers planning to join the protest already at 86 on the Facebook group , the controversy looks unlikely to abate .
Tom Beardsworth , a deputy editor on the student newspaper Cherwell , notes : "" Protest is fairly common , but it 's normally small scale .
There were only about 10 for George Galloway last term , whereas it looks like the turnout against Assange could top 100 , which certainly has n't been seen in my memory . """
2013-01-23,"There are at least three films in the works about the life of WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange , but only one has already entered production with Hollywood 's current hottest Brit Benedict Cumberbatch in the lead .
The Fifth Estate , from a script by The West Wing 's Josh Singer and with Dreamgirls / Twilight director Bill Condon on board , has begun principal photography this week at an undisclosed location .
Cumberbatch stars as Assange , and the first picture of the Sherlock star with dyed white - blond hair ( alongside Goodbye , Lenin ! 's Daniel BrÃ¼hl as the activist 's confidant Daniel Domscheit - Berg ) has been released to coincide .
If you 're wondering why the screen version of the WikiLeaks founder seems a bit more hirsute than the current model , that 's because The Fifth Estate focuses on the early days of the site .
Based on Domscheit - Berg 's own book Inside WikiLeaks : My Time with Julian Assange at the World 's Most Dangerous Website , as well as Guardian writers David Leigh and Luke Harding 's WikiLeaks : Inside Julian Assange 's War on Secrecy , it 's being tipped as a celluloid document of Assange 's meteoric rise into the public consciousness .
"" It may be decades before we understand the full impact of WikiLeaks and how it 's revolutionised the spread of information , "" Condon says in a statement released by DreamWorks . ""
So this film wo n't claim any long view authority on its subject , or attempt any final judgment .
We want to explore the complexities and challenges of transparency in the information age and , we hope , enliven and enrich the conversations WikiLeaks has already provoked . ""
Due for release on 15 November in the US , The Fifth Estate is clearly being pushed as an awards contender for 2014 .
The stellar cast also includes Laura Linney , Anthony Mackie , David Thewlis and In the Loop 's Peter Capaldi .
But never mind all of those - could this be Cumberbatch 's first bash at Oscars recognition ?"
2013-01-23,"You 'd think you 'd learn a lot about Julian Assange from We Steal Secrets :
The Story of WikiLeaks .
Allow me to disavow you of that notion .
The latest documentary to roll out of the Alex Gibney factory looks at the life and times of the crusading website and explores related themes such as freedom of information and the moral responsibility of activism , but is far less illuminating about its silver - haired standard - bearer .
It 's probably too soon for a meaningful perspective on the WikiLeaks saga .
Nonetheless Gibney ploughs ahead and adopts a conventional architecture â€ “ outlining facts that will be familiar to anyone who has kept up with the news .
He sprinkles a liberal dose of talking heads over the brisk exposition , punctuated by dynamic digital renderings of cyber - chat and the flow of information .
Gibney touches on Assange 's early life as a computer hacker in Melbourne , which we are told was something of a hacker 's haven in the late 80s .
Back then the Australian operated under the nom de guerre of Mendax , whose signature was all over a cyber attack that threatened briefly to sabotage the Atlantis space shuttle mission in 1989 .
Assange , in one of several archive on - camera interviews Gibney uses in his movie , does not deny his involvement in an episode for which the perpetrators have never been brought to account .
The focus jumps forward to WikiLeaks itself , as Gibney chronicles the freedom - of - information collective 's hitherto short but tumultuous life .
The narrative starts with the group 's origins in the mid-2000s and its growth spurt in the aftermath of the 2008 financial collapse when Assange forged strong ties with Icelandic activists .
Then come the heady days of 2010 and the leaked Iraq and Afghanistan war logs .
By now Assange has become an activist rock star , a household name
â€ “ although it is not long before the Robin Hood persona begins to implode amid personal recrimination and legal threats .
There is frank and insightful commentary from former high - ranking members of the US administration , such as ex - CIA director Michael Hayden .
However , the most revealing testimony is personal in nature .
Former colleagues Daniel Domscheit - Berg and James Ball , now a staff writer at the Guardian , offer a fascinating inside track .
Their initial allegiance to the cause gives way to serious misgivings about Assange 's uncompromising view of information dissemination and , most ironically of all , his growing opacity when besieged by allegations of sexual assault and censure from the US government and its allies .
Without doubt the movie 's most memorable achievement is the poignant telling of Bradley Manning 's story .
The US army private stands accused of leaking hundreds of thousands of classified documents such as the Collateral Murder video and a series of highly embarrassing diplomatic cables that ended up on WikiLeaks and partner news organisations ( including the Guardian ) .
Manning was dispatched to work in intelligence at a forward operating base in Iraq .
A troubled soul who wrestled with gender - identity issues , the twentysomething serviceman reacted with acute sensitivity to what he read and saw .
Gibney uses a simple text scrawl across the screen to show email and instant messenger conversations Manning struck up with the hacker Adrian Lamo that portend the information dump and clearly amount to a cry for help .
Lamo was concerned about the impact of the leaks and eventually went to the FBI .
As Gibney 's camera hovers close to Lamo 's face , there is no doubt about the hacker 's contrition .
Gibney is an exhaustive researcher and also talks to one of the two Swedish women who accused Assange of sexual assault , a claim the Australian continues to dispute .
The unresolved nature of the case is one of many uncertainties dangling over the story .
Nobody knows what will happen to WikiLeaks or to Assange , who currently resides as a houseguest at the Ecuadorian embassy in London .
Manning , meanwhile , awaits trial this summer on charges that include aiding the enemy .
Truth is an endangered species in this war , but Gibney 's thoughtful movie suggests Manning might be its greatest casualty .

2013-01-24,"WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange has described a forthcoming Hollywood film about him as a "" massive propaganda attack "" during a video - linked talk to students at Oxford University .
Assange said he had seen a copy of the script for The Fifth Estate , which stars Sherlock 's Benedict Cumberbatch and is directed by Dreamgirls ' Bill Condon .
Addressing the Oxford Union from his refuge at the Ecuadorian embassy in London last night , the activist also described the film as an inflammatory attack on Iran .
The first picture of Cumberbatch as Assange was released yesterday , featuring Cumberbatch standing alongside Goodbye , Lenin ! 's
Daniel BrÃ¼hl , who is playing the activist 's confidant Daniel Domscheit - Berg .
The Fifth Estate , which focuses on the early days of WikiLeaks , is based on Domscheit - Berg 's book Inside WikiLeaks : My Time with Julian Assange at the World 's Most Dangerous Website , as well as Guardian writers David Leigh and Luke Harding 's WikiLeaks : Inside Julian Assange 's War on Secrecy .
Assange told the Oxford Union that Condon 's film began with scenes inside a military complex in Iran , where nuclear symbols could clearly be seen .
The suggestion , he said , was that the country was building a nuclear weapon and the film was clearly an attempt to go about "" fanning the flames "" of war . ""
How does this have anything to do with us ?
It is a lie upon lie , "" he said .
"" The movie is a massive propaganda attack on WikiLeaks and the character of my staff . ""
Assange , who held a purported copy of the script for The Fifth Estate by The West Wing 's Josh Singer in his hand throughout , though did n't show it to the camera , also quoted from a scene in which he said scientists were seen meeting a US agent .
"" How is it that a lie gets into a script about WikiLeaks ? , "" he asked .
Condon had earlier issued a statement via studio Dreamworks in which he said : "" It may be decades before we understand the full impact of WikiLeaks and how it 's revolutionised the spread of information .
So this film wo n't claim any long view authority on its subject , or attempt any final judgment .
We want to explore the complexities and challenges of transparency in the information age and , we hope , enliven and enrich the conversations WikiLeaks has already provoked . ""
Assange is currently living in the Ecuadorian embassy , which offered him asylum in August , in an effort to avoid being extradited to Sweden , where he faces allegations of rape and sexual assault .
He says he fears being extradited onwards to the US over his WikiLeaks activism .
The Fifth Estate , also starring Laura Linney , Anthony Mackie , David Thewlis and Peter Capaldi , is due to be released in the US in November , the timing of which suggests an awards - season run in 2014 ."
2013-01-24,"His critics were reasoned , those who queued for over an hour in the snow to hear him speak were thoughtful .
It was Julian Assange â€ “ the man at the centre of controversy â€ “ who refused to be gracious .
Speaking by video link from his refuge at the Ecuadorean embassy to undergraduates at Oxford University as part of an awards ceremony celebrating whistleblowers , Assange gave an impassioned defence of WikiLeaks and against censorship of all kinds .
But in the Q and A session that came afterwards , the former winner of the Sam Adams award repeatedly refused to answer questions about his decision not to return to Sweden to face allegations of rape and sexual assault .
"" How much longer are you going to stay in the Ecuadorean embassy ? "" asked one undergraduate .
"" We will see , "" Assange said , then smiling : "" Who knows ? ""
The next student fared no better . ""
Sweden is a free country with an independent judiciary .
Why do you resist being questioned in that country ? ""
Assange 's smile faded .
"" I have answered these questions extensively in the past , "" he replied sharply and referred the student to a website .
A question about cyber terrorism was greeted with verbose warmth .
Rachel Savage , a 22-year - old PPE student then asked : "" What would you say to the protesters outside who say your appearance tonight diminishes the seriousness of rape and sexual assault ? ""
Assange half closed his eyes and sighed .
"" I heard there was a protest but we sent our cameras out there before joining you tonight and there were 28 supporters of me and of no one else . ""
Before the event , however , there had been at least 50 protesters and no supporters of Assange to be seen .
After the ceremony , security staff confirmed they had not seen anyone defending the WikiLeaks founder all evening .
Waving her anti - Assange banner while around 400 undergraduates queued to get into the hall , Simone Webb , the protest organiser , insisted the demonstration was not a stand against free speech .
"" I do n't think that by saying the Oxford Union should not have invited Assange I am in any way questioning their right or freedom to do so , "" she said . ""
Nor do I think Assange should be censored .
I 'm not necessarily advocating a blanket no platform policy : I would feel somewhat differently were he speaking at a debate where there would be more opportunity for him to be challenged and held to account . ""
The motivation for this protest is twofold .
Primarily that Assange 's continued evasion of justice makes it hugely ironic that he 's speaking at an awards ceremony about truth , justice , integrity and courage .
And , secondly , protesting to challenge the marginalisation of rape allegations in society as a whole and also by the union in particular . ""
Driven by a determination to see Assange , around 400 students had waited for over an hour in the driving snow to get a seat .
"" I 'm conflicted about being here , "" said David , who refused to give his full name , "" because I 'm struggling to figure out where I stand on this Assange issue .
I believe he should be on trial
but he 's an important figurehead
and I 'm interested in what he has to say .
"" As she stood waiting to enter the hall , Savage said : "" I 'm glad the protesters are demonstrating about the evasion of the rape allegations but I 'm not standing with them because I do n't oppose him speaking . ""
After Assange 's response to her question however , Savage was left sanguine .
"" This has confirmed to me that he 's evading justice , "" she said .
"" He did n't even answer my question , he just made a disparaging comment about the protesters .
He showed no respect at all for victims of the types of crime that he has been accused of . """
2013-01-24,"Julian Assange does n't like the movie that is being made about Wikileaks , called The Fifth Estate . ""
It is a lie upon lie , "" he told Oxford university students by videolink from the Ecuadorian embassy . ""
The movie is a massive propaganda attack on WikiLeaks and the character of my staff . ""
Assange , who will be portrayed in the film by Benedict Cumberbatch , read from a copy of the script as he accused the movie 's maker , Dreamworks , of "" fanning the flames "" of war against Iran .
He told the Oxford Union that the opening scene was set inside a military complex in Iran with documents containing nuclear symbols and asked : "" How does this have anything to do with us ? ""
In a publicity picture released this week , Cumberbatch was shown in character , sporting long blonde hair .
A press release said The Fifth Estate would trace the early days of WikiLeaks , which culminated in the release of a series of information leaks .
It is due to be released in the US in November .
Assange has been inside London 's Ecuadorian embassy since August .
He is defying an extradition warrant to Sweden , where he faces allegations of sex crimes .

2013-01-31,"The Australian prime minister , Julia Gillard , has announced that the Australian election will take place on 14 September , ushering in an unprecedented eight - month election campaign .
The announcement was completely unexpected â€ “ a number of Gillard 's own ministers heard about it first during her press conference â€ “ and has set up a battle stretching over months between two of Australia 's least popular politicians .
In what is set to be a gruelling campaign there are any number of fascinating subplots to be played out , but here are five of the most important : 1 .
Gillard v Abbott â€ “ who can be the least unpopular ?
With the opposition leading the governing Labor party in the polls by a healthy 6 % , in most elections the centre - right Liberal party would be seen as a shoo - in come September .
But it remains hamstrung by its biggest political liability , the leader , Tony Abbott .
Abbott is a staunch Catholic whose social conservatism places him on the right of not only most Australians but most of his own party .
With an approval rating of only 34 % and a disapproval rating of over 60 % , Abbott is a deeply unpopular figure , and Gillard 's decision to set the date of the election so early has been seen , in part , as a way to ensure that Abbott is her rival .
But Gillard herself suffers from low approval ratings which , despite a bounce after her speech accusing Abbott of misogyny , have never recovered from her backflip on the introduction of a carbon tax , and the mode of her ascension to power â€ “ replacing the more popular Kevin Rudd .
Her opposition to gay marriage also rankles with the left .
An election where both leaders are unpopular with their opposition is de rigueur â€ “ one where they are both so unpopular across the political spectrum is something new .
2 .
The gender issue With her October 2012 speech Gillard placed gender at the centre of Australian political discourse in a way that is rare , and perhaps unheard of in a major election .
Not that Gillard 's position on the moral high ground is assured .
In recent days the issue was thrown into a tailspin by her partner , Tim Mathieson , encouraging Australian men getting their prostates checked to choose a "" small Asian female doctor "" , thus opening himself to accusations of sexism , racism and , indeed , heightism .
But this remains an election where the leaders â€ “ despite Abbott 's attempts to distance himself from the issue â€ “ are seen as occupying starkly different positions .
Abbott 's stance on abortion , for instance â€ “ he has said that the current rate of abortion is "" this generation 's legacy of unutterable shame "" and as health minister attempted to block access to RU486 , the medical alternative to surgical abortion â€ “ has led to fears that as prime minister he would limit access to options and medical care .
3 .
Immigration â€ “ tough v tough While Australia has never been tempted to adopt the mooted British proposal of actively talking down the nation in order to discourage immigration from Romania and Bulgaria â€ “
Australian rhetoric about being the greatest nation on earth would disallow such posturing â€ “ both parties have hardline stances on immigration .
Since the premiership of John Howard in the 1990s â€ “ "" We will decide who comes into this country "" â€ “ opposition to illegal immigration and the detention of illegal immigrants are political no - brainers in Australia .
Abbott 's rhetoric is firmer â€ “ the party has adopted the phrase "" stop the boats "" as a catch - all for the debate .
But the Labor position â€ “ some would call it more nuanced , others more confused â€ “ is more or less the same , differing more in method than in desired outcome .
Gillard increased the annual refugee intake from 13,700 to 20,000 last year , but allied it to a reversal in Labor 's opposition to offshore detention and processing .
This issue is Abbott 's to exploit â€ “ Labor 's response to the issue has all the problems of incumbency against the opposition 's sloganeering .
4 .
Business or environment
â€
“
you choose A huge part of Gillard 's unpopularity lies in her imposition of a carbon emissions tax on Australia 's largest polluters , a tax she promised not to introduce and which the opposition has pledged to repeal .
The issue polarises Australia in a way that has no real UK equivalent , dividing the nation between those who are for "" business "" and those for "" the environment "" , with middle ground often hard to identify .
Mining remains the nation 's chief source of income , but environmental concerns are growing ever more pressing â€
“ Australia is suffering through its hottest summer ever , battered by an increasing number of natural disasters .
Abbott , a climate change sceptic , has placed the Liberal party firmly on the side of business and will seek to portray the government as being firmly on the side of the so - called tree huggers .
Labor will be walking a tightrope on the issue , as it has done since being elected .
5 .
The wild card â€ “ Julian Assange
And as if the personality battles and global policy issues were n't enough , there is the decision of WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange to run for the Australian Senate from his domicile in the Ecuadorian embassy , a move that Assange 's own mum has come out and called "" awesome "" .
Assange remains popular in Australia , and his promise to form a WikiLeaks party will make both established parties uncomfortable .
Assange has nothing to lose , and the prospect of watching Gillard and Abbott being called to account is a fascinating one .
Roll on 14 September ."
2013-02-06,"In the seven years since he founded WikiLeaks , Julian Assange 's relationships with a number of his former collaborators and supporters have broken down , with each side variously claiming broken promises or bad faith on the part of the other .
On Wednesday Jemima Khan , a former close supporter of Assange 's who stood bail for him while he fought extradition to Sweden over sexual assault accusations , became the latest to speak of becoming "" alienated "" from the Australian after she executive - produced a film he believes to be "" anti - WikiLeaks "" .
Khan , who is associate editor of the New Statesman , has written an article for the magazine about losing faith in Assange , saying she has come to believe that he is "" undermining both himself and his own transparency agenda â€ “ as well as doing the US department of justice a favour â€ “ by making his refusal to answer questions in Sweden into a human rights issue "" .
She suggests he risks becoming like "" an Australian L Ron Hubbard "" , in a reference to the founder of Scientology .
Assange is confined to the Ecuadorian embassy in London , where he sought asylum last June after losing his legal attempts to avoid extradition to Sweden , where he is wanted to answer allegations of rape and sexual assault against two women .
Assange denies the claims , and argues that he fears that if he was remanded in Sweden he would be at greater risk of onward extradition to the US to face potential prosecution for espionage relating to the WikiLeaks cable releases .
The core of her disaffection , Khan argues , is her view that "" WikiLeaks â€ “ whose mission statement was ' to produce ... a more just society ... based upon truth ' â€ “ has been guilty of the same obfuscation and misinformation as those it sought to expose , while its supporters are expected to follow , unquestioningly , in blinkered , cultish devotion "" .
She says that when she told Assange she was involved in the film We Steal Secrets , directed by the American documentary maker Alex Gibney , she "" suggested that he view it not in terms of being pro- or anti - him , but rather as a film that would be fair and would represent the truth ...
He replied : ' If it 's a fair film , it will be pro - Julian Assange . '
Beware the celebrity who refers to himself in the third person "" .
WikiLeaks has objected to the film 's title , saying it is "" an unethical and biased title in the context of pending criminal trials .
It is the prosecution 's claim , and it is false . ""
The organisation did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Khan 's article , but Assange has repeatedly disputed the accounts of those with whom he has fallen out , including his former collaborator Daniel Domscheit - Berg , his former legal team , and journalists from this newspaper and others .
Khan writes that she still believes there are "" troubling aspects "" to the Swedish sexual assault case , and that "" questions may need to be asked "" about the Swedish police investigation : "" I do n't regret putting up bail money for Assange , "" she says .
However , Khan adds : "" I did it so that he would be released while awaiting trial , not so that he could avoid answering to the allegations . ""
She writes of her regret that many of the discussions about WikiLeaks have been more about "" tribalism than truth "" , but she argues : "" It would be a tragedy if a man who has done so much good were to end up tolerating only disciples and unwavering devotion , more like an Australian L Ron Hubbard . """
2013-02-08,"Modern etiquette dictates that you ca n't even say Hamlet is a tragedy unless you preface the revelation with the phrase "" spoiler alert "" .
So I wo n't say which specific Agatha Christie mystery it is where all the characters commit the murder .
But the notion of the "" alldunnit "" comes to mind every time I think of those poor Ecuadorian embassy staff , holed up for more than six months at close quarters with Julian Assange .
I 've half a mind to rush out a very bad play set in a fictional version of that most claustrophobic - sounding embassy , in which everyone from cleaner to ambassador is driven to wielding the knife on perhaps the most rapidly oxidising figure of the age .
The work , if you could call it that , would be a rather farcical sort of tragedy , for who in all seriousness can continue to suppress the odd smirk at the thought of Assange , holed up with his sunbed and his computer and his radioactive self - regard â€ “ a sort of diplomatic parody of the former Crystal Palace chairman Simon Jordan ?
Many natural allies will recall the various moments at which they first realised they would have to work incredibly hard not to giggle at the WikiLeaks founder .
A friend cites that 2010 snap of him celebrating his bail at the Frontline Club in London by being photographed with a martini .
Less Skyfall , more Pratfall .
This week , we learned he had shed another high - profile supporter , Jemima Khan .
It 's been a while since we heard from the Ecuadorian ambassador , initially so keen on her houseguest , but it is difficult not to read between the lines of Her Excellency 's November suggestion that Assange must be allowed to leave for medical treatment , and not wonder whether by then she had the terminal ministrations of an NHS geriatric ward in mind .
Eventually the embassy staff may be revealed as suffering from a perversion of Stockholm syndrome , when those doing the house arresting fall so deeply out of love with their victim that the only cure is to extradite him to the Swedish capital .
Before we go any further , I 'm warned that any criticism of Assange will land me in the doghouse with those somehow still able to take him 100 % seriously , and may even cause a section of commentators to suspect I am part of some Guardian plot against him .
The reality is a thousand times less intriguing , alas , and may even land me in the doghouse with the Guardian .
You see , I am dimly aware of all sorts of articles about this newspaper 's break - up with Assange , but I have to confess to not being abreast of their import .
I do look at the headlines and make quarter - arsed mental notes to read them later in order to stay au courant , but the inelegant truth of it is that I never do because it just sounds like such an absolutely massive bore - off .
There are apparently even two films in which this paper 's dysfunctional relationship with Assange will feature at some level , which means there 'll be one more box office receipt for whatever else is playing at my local cineplex at the time of their release .
( Films featuring the Guardian are n't really what I go to the movies for .
It was awfully sweet of Jason Bourne to try and help my fictional colleague in The Bourne Ultimatum , but I would have preferred him to have had rather more riveting things to do with his time . )
So if you must see a conspiracy in all of this , is it not time that you considered the increasingly more credible one ?
Namely , that Julian Assange is a creation and agent of the global right , specifically designed to make the left look ridiculous .
Assange ...
the very name seems a sledgehammer hybrid of ass and angel , and with each balcony scene or face - saving desertion of a celebrity supporter , whichever CIA mastermind conceived Julian in a petri dish must be rubbing his hands with glee .
Quite where his narrative arc now goes is unclear .
I suppose he might attempt to shoot his way out of his Knightsbridge bolthole like one half of Butch and Sundance , perhaps using a weapon fashioned from bits of his sunlamp and a USB stick .
( It 's certainly something The A - Team would have been able to come up with had they been holed up there for even an afternoon . )
Certainly , if the attention continues to wane , the tractor - beam of the limelight will become harder to resist , and we should expect what Assange imagines to be the unexpected .
And so it goes on .
How can it be that the man who shot to fame engaged in a swashbuckling , sublimely modern form of secret - busting has caused his former allies to wince at his name , as one might over a particularly misguided and naff teenage crush ?
Clearly there are all sort of complex legal , moral , philosophical and psychological answers to that question , which I 'll leave to cleverer people to unravel .
The quick answer is that Assange seems quite insufferable , certainly in any sort of long term .
If one subscribes to the view that only an ultimately insufferable narcissist could have had the balls to do what he did , then it was always going to come to this .
But when so very few come out of a story well , from star to supporters , perhaps a mirthless laugh is the only option left ."
2013-02-11,"Birgitta JÃ³nsdÃ³ttir , the Icelandic MP and member of the WikiLeaks team that released secret footage of a US Apache helicopter attack on civilians in Iraq , is planning to visit America for the first time since the ' Collateral Murder ' video was made public to express her support for Bradley Manning , the video 's alleged source .
JÃ³nsdÃ³ttir plans to travel to New York on 5 April to mark the third anniversary of the posting of the footage , one of the most dramatic WikiLeaks releases and one that helped put the website and its founder Julian Assange on the global map .
She is making the journey even though she has been advised by the Icelandic government not to do so for fear of legal retribution from US authorities .
She told the Guardian that she had held back from visiting the US long enough .
"" I refuse to live in fear , and I do n't want to live in the shadows .
I do n't think I 've done anything illegal or that I 'm an enemy of the US state , but if they think I 've committed a crime , I want to know , "" she said .
JÃ³nsdÃ³ttir plans to bring with her an exhibition of still photographs drawn from the Collateral Murder video that she will show in New York on the anniversary and Los Angeles on 6 April .
Later , she hopes to take the exhibition on a road tour across the US on the eve of Manning 's trial that is currently scheduled to begin in June .
The MP was part of a group of WikiLeaks volunteers who gathered in Iceland in early 2010 to help Assange prepare the footage of the Apache attack .
JÃ³nsdÃ³ttir organized the volunteers , researched details of the footage so that it could be annotated and selected stills for distribution to the media .
The footage , allegedly leaked by Manning while he was working as an intelligence analyst in a US base outside Baghdad , related to a US airstrike in Baghdad on 12 July 2007 .
Eight men were killed in the attack , including two Reuters correspondents whose cameras were mistaken for weapons .
The posting of the video had immediate and immense impact , prompting debate on the cost in civilian deaths of the Iraq war .
A month later , Manning was arrested as the suspected source of the video along with hundreds of thousands of leaked confidential diplomatic cables .
The Iraq video has been cited in four of the 22 counts that Manning is facing , for which he faces up to life in military custody with no chance of parole .
JÃ³nsdÃ³ttir said that she wanted to visit the US so that she could speak out about the importance of Collateral Murder in a way that Manning himself could not .
"" I feel connected to Bradley Manning 's fate through that video , "" she said .
"" It 's deeply troubling to me that he is the only one suffering the consequences â€ “ none of the people responsible for the war crimes in the video have been held accountable .
"" For the past two years JÃ³nsdÃ³ttir has been locked in legal dispute with the US Justice Department over its attempts to obtain her private information .
It was revealed in 2011 that the US government had served a subpoena on Twitter demanding personal data from her Twitter feed dating back to November 2009 .
JÃ³nsdÃ³ttir riposted by petitioning a federal appeals court in Virginia , calling on the courts to force the DoJ to open its files on her to disclose the other internet providers that had also been ordered to submit her private data .
Last month the appeal court ruled against her and her two co - defendants , allowing the US government to keep secret its attempts to force internet providers to hand over private information without a warrant .
In 2011 the US ambassador to Iceland gave verbal assurances that JÃ³nsdÃ³ttir could travel freely to the US without fear of arrest or prosecution .
But she has been advised by senior Icelandic government officials not to do so on the grounds that a verbal assurance is not binding and could be overruled by the US at any time ."
2013-02-19,"â€¢ What has Ecuador gained from harbouring Mr Wiki Julian Assange from the authorities ?
Quite a bit , says Fidel NarvÃ¡ez , the country 's consul in London and the man who has done most to keep the fugitive happy .
"" I would say that the image the international community has of Ecuador and its president has improved , "" NarvÃ¡ez tells the Prisma news organisation . ""
This is the most important political asylum seeker in the world , and he turned to Ecuador for protection . ""
NarvÃ¡ez likes and believes in Assange .
But is he easy to get along with , the Prisma inquires ? ""
Hmmm , "" the consul says .
"" I do n't know whether easy is the best description .
I would imagine he 's very demanding of the people who work for him .
In any case , he 's a good ' tenant ' as far as being respectful towards all the embassy staff is concerned . ""
So when will it end ?
"" We believe a political and diplomatic solution will be possible sooner rather than later , "" NarvÃ¡ez says .
But if he 's wrong ? ""
Julian Assange and Ecuador will be able to hold out as long as it takes . ""
Fighting talk .
Take note , William Hague .

The thoughts of Kevin Hurley , Britain 's most outspoken elected police commissioner , also excite comment , particularly his view that Sir William Macpherson was the victim of "" post - colonial guilt "" .
Hurley shoots from the lip , we said of him on Friday .
He does all that and more , says reader Graham Howard , recalling an email exchange with the commissioner for Surrey .
You say you prize independence , noted Howard .
Why did you seek the Conservative party nomination ?
Because it seemed the only way to win the election .
However , Hurley says : "" I was regarded as not ' political enough ' . ""
So he ran with his own cash as an independent .
And the good thing about being totally independent , he told his constituent , "" is that now I do n't have to put up with nonsense from anyone .
That includes you "" .
That 's the commish .
A sharp word for everybody .
â€¢ Many questions asked of education secretary Michael Gove and his disciples .
Here is one of the more unusual : why were the writings of a former government adviser on race and social inclusion ( and an ex - adviser to London mayor Boris Johnson ) apparently designated by the department as "" hate speech "" ?
Professor Gus John tells us that a DfE civil servant was forwarded a link to his blog detailing fears that Mary Seacole might be airbrushed as part of Gove 's brave new world of history tuition .
Finding that he could not open it , the civil servant went to Prof John 's website .
An automated notice appeared saying "" Access to this site has been denied as ' the content of the site may be contrary to DfE standards of behaviour and decency ' , "" the professor tells us .
"" It says also that my website has been categorised as promoting ' hate and discrimination ' . ""
Prof John has written to Gove seeking an explanation .
But as we know , chaos reigns at the department .
There may be a lengthy wait .

All change at the BBC as director general Tony Hall lunches and then anoints candidates for high office .
Last week saw the announced return of former Labour minister turned community organiser James Purnell , who will be director of strategy .
Many were waiting to see if the DG would break significant bread with Jay Hunt , the BBC 's "" queen over the water "" at Channel 4 , who has done her commercial stint for two years .
Many thought she might be enticed to return to the mother ship .
But as yet no sign .
Could it be that too many other execs would n't feel ready to welcome her back just yet ?

As the Cambridge Union prepares today to welcome the doyenne of the French far right , Marine Le Pen , and the interested media and the noisy attentions of Unite Against Fascism , thoughts turn to last year 's kerfuffle when the undistinguished guest was Dominique Strauss - Kahn .
What happened then ?
Well , things became rumbustious .
Indeed the minutes from the inquest conducted by the union afterwards complain of a "" mini riot "" , and suggest it was forced to shell out Â£8,000 on security .
The bursar , who blamed the student union for whipping up the rage , was most aggrieved and called for students to be landed with the bill .
All very unfortunate and , some would say , unnecessary .
The event comes and goes but recriminations can last for years .

2013-02-23,"Supporters of Bradley Manning , the US soldier who is accused of being behind the largest leak of state secrets in America 's history , held a series of rallies across the US and the world on Saturday .
The demonstrations in more than 70 locations were aimed at marking Manning 's 1,000th day in jail and came as the young soldier prepares to appear again before a military court next week .
Manning is being prosecuted by the US government for allegedly transmitting confidential material to the anti - secrecy campaigner Julian Assange 's web organisation WikiLeaks .
The US government considers such actions a threat to its national security .
If convicted the 25-year - old could be confined to military custody for the rest of his life .
But Manning 's plight has become a cause cÃ © lÃ¨bre among Wikileaks supporters , as an example of a brave whistleblower exposing injustice . ""
A heroic young man faces life in prison for exposing the truth , "" said Jeff Paterson , a spokesman for the Bradley Manning Support Network .
Earlier on Saturday , protests were set to be held in Australia , Britain , Germany , France , South Korea and Belgium , as well as several other countries .
In the US , planned actions stretched from coast to coast with events scheduled for Los Angeles , San Francisco , Denver , New York and dozens of other communities .
Manning , a former military intelligence analyst , faces 22 charges relating to the leaking of hundreds of thousands of classified diplomatic cables , war logs from the Afghan and Iraq wars , and videos of US military actions .
The most serious count , that of "" aiding the enemy "" , accuses him of arranging for state secrets to be published on the internet , knowing that al - Qaida would have access to them ."
2013-03-03,"Supposing Lord Rennard needs a respite from sexual accusations this weekend , he might want to study the resilient career of his fellow sufferer , President Clinton , of whom Tony Blair has written : "" I doubt he is much different from most of the male population . ""
Then , in no particular order , there are the heartwarming tales of Roman Polanski , John Prescott , Arthur Koestler , Harold Bloom , Boris Johnson , the US judge Clarence Thomas and , for all its incompleteness , that of Julian Assange .
Rennard can not but conclude that , even if they are never entirely forgotten , accusations of sexual misbehaviour , from wandering hands and routine priapism to legally documented accusations of rape , can , in the end , be set aside , dismissed as petty , even , with the right defenders , adduced as smear campaigns which only enhance the martyred integrity of the accused .
Even now , in the sunless basement where he hopes to escape extradition to Sweden for questioning about alleged sexual assaults , Assange remains a hero to millions , notably the loyal John Pilger .
Examples like this may also raise a few questions for commentators who have been speculating darkly about a Lib Dem propensity for sexual muddles : something inherently corrupt , you intuited , that makes this party , if not the natural home of pervs , especially prone to lurch drunkenly up to the wrong person and subject him or her to a snog .
In the Times , Rachel Sylvester noted that current senior Lib Dems had , for reasons best known to themselves , chosen a party that was never likely to win .
Flawed , perhaps ?
"" There must be either psychological or political reasons for that . ""
But when you take the Goveian approach to history , taking in the full chronological sweep of sexual harrassment , naturally stressing the famous names but not excluding its place in slavery and the post - industrial sexual subjugation depicted by Upton Sinclair , then dedicated creeps do seem to turn up regularly in far - flung communities that have never heard of Lembit Opik .
Indeed , the popularity of the warning acronym NSIT , "" not safe in taxis "" , among debutantes of the 50s , suggests that the incredible capacity of the most tipsy and ungovernably hormonal alpha male brain to postpone unwanted touching until nobody important can see , arrived even before the Lib Dem impulse towards sexual stealth and concealment .
Given the continuing sexual incontinence that , to judge by last week 's testimonials , has not left a single presentable woman columnist unmolested by some unnamed but world - class politician , it might be worth reviving , along with NSIT , the contemporaneous deb classifications MSC ( makes skin creep ) and VVSITPQ ( very , very safe in taxis , probably queer ) .
Although , if the historian Dominic Sandbrook is correct , the Lib Dems are still so wedded to misconduct as to merit their very own acronym : NSOB might work , given the party 's preference for unshowy transportation . ""
Perhaps , "" Sandbrook writes , punctiliously adding Lord Palmerston ( not safe in landaus ) and more recently , William Gladstone and his "" extraordinary sex drive "" to the charge sheet , "" there is something in the Lib Dems ' DNA that explains why its senior figures so often court disaster . ""
Or is there , the untrained behavioural psychologist might amateurishly posit , something in this same , irritating DNA that makes Lib Dems much more prone to getting caught or , failing that , to provoke universal rejoicing when this happens ?
In the absence of a proper experiment , featuring , as well as subjects from the leading parties , guinea pigs from Ukip and , supposing he agreed , George Galloway , Respect 's distinguished defender of "" bad sexual etiquette "" , we can only look at the anecdotal evidence and theorise that , far from being especially faulty in this regard , Lib Dem gropers are no different to millions of others .
What is it , historians might equally ask , that makes city bankers so prone to the sexual bullying and pursuit of junior female staff , to a point that may even feel more relentless than a Lib Dem awayday ?
That Naomi Wolf 's version of unwanted touching , as a 20-year - old student , allegedly by her then tutor , the revered literary critic Harold Bloom , should sound â€ “ "" The next thing I knew , his heavy , boneless hand was hot on my thigh "" â€ “ so similar to the recent recollections of Lib Dem women does not , of course , indicate that such behaviour is so unexceptional as to justify the party 's complacency .
Rather , the ceaseless recitation of similar harassment stories â€ “ out with the boss ; mentioned my dress / hair / mouth ; had some wine ; his hand was on my thigh / breast / bum ; he backed me into the wall / room ; I did n't get the job / grade / interview / seat - only underlines the perversity , supposing you want to stop this offence , of defining relevant behaviour as the speciality of one or another community .
Equally unhelpful , when you consider the gropee experience , is the readiness to excuse standard molestation because of the offender 's exceptional talent , devotion , prize - winning TV series or loveliness in every department except the sexual usage of humbler individuals .
Harold Bloom he ai n't , but to loyal Shirley Williams , Rennard remains , post - accusations , "" a very fine man "" .
After everyone discovered that Labour 's deputy leader was the sort of boss who , by way of an office icebreaker , would lift his secretary 's dress ( "" to see my stockings "" , Tracey Temple explained ) , Blair was swiftly able to reconcile this practice with Harriet Harman 's equalities agenda , because of "" all the service he had given "" .
The Lib Dem response to "" rumours "" was deplorable , but precedents go beyond Westminster , to judge by a Yale dean 's alleged response to Wolf
( "" No one came to me with a formal complaint "" ) and arguably include her own flexible approach to testimony when an admired figure is at risk . ""
Of course , "" she wrote in 2010 , in a famously snarky address to Assange 's persecutors , "" as a feminist , I am also pleased that the alleged victims are using feminist - inspired rhetoric and law to assuage what appears to be personal injured feelings .
That 's what our brave suffragette foremothers intended ! ""
In fairness to Wolf , alternative explanations keep coming for sexually offensive behaviour that should now , even for inebriated old farts and the cretinous authors of Uni Lad ( an online site aimed at the younger creep ) , be clearly distinguishable from the compliments , admiration and consensual courtship that are common to all workplaces .
Anyone who can tell criticism from bullying can probably distinguish between "" you look well "" and pervy breast inspection .
But evolutionary psychologists are invited into orderly , co - ed studios to make the case for hormonal anarchy ; professional tough cookies advocate their own knee - in - the - groin tough - cookiness for use in the hostile environment of work ; followers of the sociologist Catherine Hakim fear â€ “ if we all get too legally minded about a wee bit of Clinton - style how 's your father â€ “ for their own , depreciating stock of "" erotic capital "" .
Excuses , excuses , excuses .
Gropers should not be forgiven for treating colleagues like sex workers , but you do see why they hope to get away with it ."
2013-04-02,"( 1 ) The government of Ecuador continues its attempts to obtain assurances from either Britain or Sweden that Julian Assange 's appearance in Stockholm for questioning on sex crimes allegations will not be used to extradite him to the US .
This week , the Sydney Morning Herald reported on several interesting new developments in the case in Sweden , including the fact that the high - profile prosecutor driving the case from the start has now "" abruptly "" left it .
Moreover , both Alexa O'Brien and Ryan Gallagher note that the Obama DOJ continues to say that its Grand Jury investigation of Assange and WikiLeaks is ongoing .
Leaked documents from last year reflect that Australian diplomats believe the US is still intent on prosecuting WikiLeaks ( a threatened prosecution which former New York Times General Counsel James Goodale recently described as "" absolutely frightening "" and "" the biggest challenge "" to press freedoms today ) .
Those of us who believe there is a valid fear that WikiLeaks will be prosecuted by the US for its journalism have long advocated - along with the Ecuadorians - that Assange immediately go to Stockholm to face the accusations against him in exchange for the Swedish government agreeing that his presence there will not be used as a pretext to turn him over to the US .
In response , numerous WikiLeaks critics , led by New Statesman legal blogger David Allen Green , insisted that it would be impossible for the Swedish government to agree to this proposal because , as he put it last year , "" any final word on an extradition would ( quite properly ) be with an independent Swedish court , and not the government giving the purported ' guarantee ' .
"" As I 've detailed previously on several occasions , that claim is absolutely false : even if Swedish courts rule that extradition is legally proper , the discretion lies with the Swedish government ( as it does with most governments in extradition cases ) to decide if extradition should occur .
The final decison - maker on extradition is the Swedish government .
This week , Stefan Lindskog , a justice of the Supreme Court of Sweden , the highest court in that country , definitively settled that disagreement when he wrote an excellent column on the facts of the Assange case and explained ( emphasis added ) : If a person whose extradition is requested opposes extradition , it falls to the Supreme Court to examine whether extradition can be legally granted under the conditions laid down by law .
The Supreme Court then delivers its opinion to the government for use in its examination of the case .
If the Supreme Court holds that there is any legal impediment to extradition , the government is not allowed to approve the request .
The government can , however , refuse extradition even if the Supreme Court has not declared against it .
The evidence that this is true has long been clear .
Like most governments , the Swedish government retains the power to refuse extradition even when its courts find that it would be legally valid ; that 's because extradition entails more than just legalistic questions but also encompasses political considerations and questions of fairness and equity .
That 's why this always has been and remains the right solution : the Swedish government should agree that it will not use Assange 's appearance on its soil as a ruse to turn him over to the US , and Assange should then board the next possible plane to Stockholm to face the accusations against him .
That will ensure that the complainants in Sweden get the due process to which they are absolutely entitled for their serious accusations , while protecting Assange 's rights against vindictive prosecution by the US for his journalism .
Ecuador continues to try to bring about this solution with both Sweden and the UK .
( 2 ) Over the past couple months , I twice wrote about the plight of Saadiq Long , the US Air Force veteran who was first barred from visiting his ailing mother in the US by being placed on the no - fly list , then - once removed from the list and able to fly to the US without incident - was barred from returning home to his job and family in Qatar by being re - placed on that list .
Several weeks ago , Long was finally able to get back home .
To do that , he had to take a six - day journey that began with a a bus from Oklahoma City to Laredo , Mexico , followed by a flight to Mexico City , followed by flights to Brazil and then on to Argentina .
From Argentina he was able to fly to Istanbul , Turkey and then finally on to Doha , Qatar .
As unjust as this plight was for someone never accused of any wrongdoing of any kind , he was ultimately lucky : Mexico and Canada often uncritically honor the US no - fly list .
It cost him thousands of dollars , weeks away from his job and family , and untold amounts of stress , but it 's good that he was able finally to return home .
( 3 ) Two weeks ago , I wrote about the persecution of journalist and internet freedom activist Barrett Brown and encouraged readers to donate to his legal defense fund so that the government 's efforts to imprison him would at least be a fair fight .
Readers here generously donated close to $ 15,000 , which will help a great deal in his effort to secure a vigorous defense , but more is needed ; those inclined to donate can do so via the link here or by paypal to freebbfund@gmail.com .
To illustrate how vindictive this prosecution is , the US government has continued to target Brown 's mother .
It was threats to indict her that triggered his angry YouTube video denouncing the FBI which then became the basis for yet another indictment .
Last week in a federal court in Dallas , Brown 's mother pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor count of obstructing a search warrant by allowing Barrett to come to her home in order allegedly to try to hide his laptop .
US torturers who did things like this and Wall Street tycoons who collapsed the global economy with systemic fraud have faced no legal consequences , but the DOJ has aggressively pursued Barrett Brown 's mother ( along with the persecution of gay rights activist Dan Choi ) .
That speaks volumes about how the law is exploited by the US government .

The Freedom of the Press Foundation , the organization which I helped found and on whose Board I sit , is currently raising funds for several excellent transparency projects .
One particularly compelling one is the "" Name the Dead "" project of the Bureau of Investigative Journalism , based on the fact that "" fewer than 20 % of those killed "" by US drone attacks in Pakistan have ever been named ; this "" project aims to identify as many as possible of the remainder , whether civilian or militant "" .
It is extraordinary to me how many people are willing to assert that it is "" the terrorists "" or "" militants "" being killed in these strikes even though they have no idea who is being killed .
As I wrote on Sunday , keeping the victims of US violence anonymous and unseen is a key tactic for sustaining support for it .
Those wishing to support that project , or the others the Foundation is supporting , can do so here .

Last month , GOP Senator Rob Portman announced he was changing his mind and would now support same - sex marriage , citing his gay son .
This week , a hard - core social conservative GOP Congressman from Arizona , Matt Salmon , a devout Mormon , talked about how he has also discovered that he has a gay son but nonetheless still opposes same - sex marriage .
The video of the father describing his obviously pained efforts to reconcile his long - held religious and political dogma with the love of his gay son is interesting .
But it 's a different video - one that his son ( also named Matt ) made in 2011 as part of the "" It Gets Better "" campaign - that I found really poignant , for the pure authenticity , lack of cynicism and impressive empathy he displays .
If you have a few minutes , I think it 's really worth watching :
( 6 ) Following up on last week 's column I wrote about the hunger strike at Guantanamo , the number of detainees participating still continues to grow .
Relatedly , this Guardian article from this morning , on British troops recounting the grotesque torture that took place at a US detention facility in Iraq frequently visited by then - US Joint Special Operations Commander Gen. Stanley McChrystal , is really remarkable .

In Washington state , legislation favored by the ACLU was recently introduced by a GOP state legislator , which attracted the support of numerous Democrats , to regulate the use of domestic drones , including requiring a search warrant before they can be used to surveil individuals .
But the aircraft manufacturer giant Boeing sprung into action , opposing the bill and causing the Democratic Speaker of the House to block a vote on the bill .
Pratap Chatterjee has a great report on this here .
The politics driving the efforts against the abuses of domestic drones are fascinating and will scramble the stale and traditional partisan categories , as these fights will pit the corporate drone lobby , the establishment politicians it owns from both parties , and bipartisan authoritarian apologists for police power against anti - establishment politicians from both parties along with civil libertarian and privacy groups .

2013-04-08,"WikiLeaks has published more than 1.7 m US records covering diplomatic or intelligence reports on every country in the world .
The data , which has not been leaked , comprises diplomatic records from the beginning of 1973 to the end of 1976 , covering a variety of diplomatic traffic including cables , intelligence reports and congressional correspondence .
Julian Assange said WikiLeaks had been working for the past year to analyse and assess a vast amount of data held at the US national archives before releasing it in a searchable form .
WikiLeaks has called the collection the Public Library of US Diplomacy ( PlusD ) , describing it as the world 's largest searchable collection of US confidential , or formerly confidential , diplomatic communications .
Assange told Press Association the information showed the vast range and scope of US diplomatic and intelligence activity around the world .
Henry Kissinger was US secretary of state and national security adviser during the period covered by the collection , and many of the reports were written by him or were sent to him .
Thousands of the documents are marked NODIS ( no distribution ) or Eyes Only , as well as cables originally classed as secret or confidential .
Assange said WikiLeaks had undertaken a detailed analysis of the communications , adding that the information eclipsed Cablegate , a set of more than 250,000 US diplomatic cables published by WikiLeaks from November 2010 and over the following year .
He said WikiLeaks had developed sophisticated technical systems to deal with complex and voluminous data .
Top secret documents were not available , while some others were lost or irreversibly corrupted for periods including December 1975 and March and June 1976 , said Assange .
He added that his mother , who lives in Australia , had told him he was being kept at the embassy "" with nothing to do but work on WikiLeaks material "" .
Assange is confined to the Ecuadorian embassy in London , where he sought asylum in June after losing his legal attempts to avoid extradition to Sweden , where he is wanted to answer allegations of rape and sexual assault against two women .
Assange denies the claims , and argues that he fears that if he was remanded in Sweden he would be at greater risk of extradition to the US to face potential prosecution for espionage relating to the WikiLeaks cable releases ."
2013-04-11,"Oscar - winning director Oliver Stone has attacked two forthcoming films about Julian Assange after revealing that he met the WikiLeaks founder at the Ecuadorian embassy in London last week .
Stone , a long - time supporter of Assange , tweeted a picture of himself with the political activist .
He wrote : "" A sad occasion in that Julian could not follow me out the door .
He lives in a tiny room with great modesty and discipline . ""
In further tweets , Stone added : "" Strong mind , no sun , friends who visit , work to be done , one documentary coming out from Alex Gibney that is not expected to be kind . ""
Another film from Dreamworks which is also going to be unfriendly â€
¦
I do n't think most people in the US realise how important WikiLeaks is and why Julian 's case needs support . ""
Julian Assange did much for free speech and is now being victimised by the abusers of that concept .
"" The films criticised by Stone were Alex Gibney 's forthcoming documentary We Steal Secrets , which debuted at Sundance in January , and Dreamgirls director Bill Condon 's drama The Fifth Estate , which stars Sherlock 's Benedict Cumberbatch as Assange alongside Laura Linney , Anthony Mackie and Peter Capaldi .
It is due to be released in the US in November , which suggests an awards - season run in 2014 .
Assange himself has attacked The Fifth Estate , which is based on former aide Daniel Domscheit - Berg 's book Inside WikiLeaks : My Time with Julian Assange at the World 's Most Dangerous Website , as well as Guardian writers David Leigh and Luke Harding 's WikiLeaks : Inside Julian Assange 's War on Secrecy .
Speaking via video link to the Oxford Union in January , he labelled it "" a massive propaganda attack "" that told "" lie upon lie "" .
Assange is living in the Ecuadorian embassy , which offered him asylum in August , and is hoping to avoid extradition to Sweden , where he faces allegations of rape and sexual assault .
He says he fears being extradited from Sweden to the US over his WikiLeaks activism ."
2013-05-20,"Authorities at GCHQ , the government eavesdropping agency , are facing embarrassing revelations about internal correspondence in which Wikileaks founder Julian Assange is discussed , apparently including speculation that he is being framed by Swedish authorities seeking his extradition on rape allegations .
The records were revealed by Assange himself in a Sunday night interview with Spanish television programme Salvados in which he explained that an official request for information gave him access to instant messages that remained unclassified by GCHQ .
A message from September 2012 , read out by Assange , apparently says : "" They are trying to arrest him on suspicion of XYZ â€ ¦
It is definitely a fit - upâ€
¦
Their timings are too convenient right after Cablegate . ""
The messages appear to contain speculation and chatter between GCHQ employees , but Assange gave little further explanation about exactly who they came from .
The WikiLeaks founder , who has spent the past 11 months in the Ecuadorian embassy in London to avoid arrest and extradition to Sweden , claimed GCHQ had been unaware that it might have anything on him that was not classified .
"" It wo n't hand over any of the classified information , "" he said .
"" But , much to its surprise , it has some unclassified information on us . ""
"" We have just received this .
It is not public yet , "" he added .
A second instant message conversation from August last year between two unknown people saw them call Assange a fool for thinking Sweden would drop its attempt to extradite him .
The conversation , as read out by Assange , goes : "" He reckons he will stay in the Ecuadorian embassy for six to 12 months when the charges against him will be dropped , but that is not really how it works now is it ?
He 's a foolâ€ ¦
Yeah â€
¦ A highly optimistic fool . ""
"" This is what the spies are discussing amongst themselves , "" Assange told the Spanish television presenter Jordi EvolÃ
© .
The Cheltenham - based agency said : "" We can confirm that GCHQ responded formally to the subject who made the request .
The disclosed material includes personal comments between some members of staff and do not reflect GCHQ 's policies or views in any way .
GCHQ is exempt from the Freedom of Information Act .
However , it is understood that Assange 's request was a subject access request , a mechanism under the Data Protection Act that can be used by individuals to obtain personal information that bodies hold about them .
On its website , the agency says : "" As one of the UK 's intelligence and security agencies , we gather and analyse digital and electronic signals from many channels , from all corners of the world "" .
"" Converting this information into intelligence material , we play a significant role in informing national security , military operations , police activity and foreign policy . """

And depending on how they fare in the September poll , they may even have something to teach the major parties .

But then , we donâ€

He is David to the USâ€ ™ Goliath , a Ned Kelly like figure fighting injustice while being hounded by the authorities .

You probably did not need the recent University of Melbourne survey to tell you that a majority of voters think our level of political debate is the worst ever : they despair at the quality of political leadership ; an even greater majority has even less confidence in the media .
Voters are tuning out .
The prime minister scored a major coup earlier this month when she snookered the Opposition leader into supporting a rise in the Medicare levy to partly fund the National Disability Insurance Scheme ; people who lead desperate lives will be the beneficiaries .
But even this victory is too late to change her fate at the election , too late to change our perception of her .
We have become the selfish culture , addicted to handouts and tax cuts never justifiable when extended to others , especially special interest groups .
While those in the top tax bracket moan endlessly about the amount of tax they pay , there is little acknowledgement they also benefit from tax breaks useless to the poor ; and the healthy breeding majority â€ “ â€œworking
familiesâ€
�
â€ “ can sit back and auction their vote .
Abbott is currently the highest bidder .
Both parties have been bereft of policy based on principle .
They have also failed to develop the engaging , inspirational and transformational narrative required to lead .
They merely capitulate when they have to be pragmatic , as Gillard did on the Emissions Trading Scheme .
The Labor leadership row is a farce the public have long ceased to find funny .
The media , too busy egging it on , havenâ€ ™ t noticed .
Labor reached a new low point when respected party elder Simon Crean recently self- immolated .
As for Abbott , his favourite pastime is staying fit .
You might ride to and from work ; he rides while at work .
Never mind honing policy , his priority is sculpting a six pack .
Why arenâ€ ™ t we hearing what he will do , not just undo , when he wins the election ?
Politicians and mainstream media are locked in a narcissistic dance
â€ “ an endless repetition of 10 second grabs , sloganeering , mantras , spin and speculation .
Music to their ears , noise to the public .
Then there is the small matter of truth and accuracy .
Both Gillard and Abbott love the term â€œillegalâ€
� for people they disapprove of â€ “ for Gillard , itâ€ ™ s Assange and Wikileaks , for Abbott , asylum seekers .
Their policy on boat people is similar and guess what , the courts decreed it illegal .
True , Clive Palmer will not be prime minister come September and the party of the man behind Titanic II may go the way of Titanic I.
But his professed commitment to issues of equality and a less draconian attitude towards asylum seekers remind us it is possible to be economically conservative and socially progressive
â€ “ an anathema to the Coalition .
Assange may be Australiaâ€ ™ s first senator unable to take up his place in parliament .
Whether he is elected or not , the Wikileaks Party will be raising issues that are not big ticket items for the mainstream parties who prefer to be left alone to quietly do as they please on matters relating to freedom of information , whistle - blower protection , privacy , surveillance and government accountability to citizens .
The Wikileaks brand is associated with empowering citizens â€ “
it may just be a little party with a lot of grunt .
Come September , poll results will force Labor into the wilderness for a rethink .
If the size of the Coalition win is a landslide , as it is expected , they wonâ€
™ t have to think at all .
We will all be the losers .
We need leaders more engaged with policy than power , and a media more engaged with nuance , less with noise ."
2013-06-01,"Ecuador 's foreign minister will travel to the UK later this month to meet Julian Assange on the eve of the WikiLeaks founder 's first anniversary of living in the country 's embassy in London .
Ricardo Patino has also offered to hold talks with his British counterpart , William Hague , to try to reach an agreement over Assange 's future .
Assange has been inside the embassy since 19 June last year and has been granted political asylum by Ecudador .
If he leaves the embassy , he will be arrested and sent to Sweden for questioning over sexual allegations made by two women , which he denies .
Assange fears that if he is sent to Sweden , he will then be extradited to the US for questioning over publication by WikiLeaks of confidential information .
An Ecuadorean government spokesman said : "" On Sunday 16 June Ricardo Patino , Ecuador 's foreign minister , will be visiting London in order to meet with Julian Assange at the Ecuadorian embassy , on the eve of the first anniversary of Mr Assange in our diplomatic premises . ""
The ministry of foreign affairs of Ecuador has informed UK authorities that Mr Patio will be in London and has offered to meet with foreign secretary William Hague to discuss the case of Julian Assange . """
2013-06-03,"The US government used the first day of the Bradley Manning trial to allege that the soldier had a much closer relationship with Julian Assange , the founder of WikiLeaks , than has previously been claimed .
Prosecution lawyers peppered the government 's opening statement at the trial with references to Assange , suggesting that he built up close ties to the army private over a six - month period in 2009 and 2010 .
The government alleged â€ “ sometimes directly , on others through insinuation â€ “ that Assange guided Manning as to which classified documents to leak , advised him on how to avoid detection and even involved the soldier in the WikiLeaks editing process .
Manning has already admitted to leaking a large cache of diplomatic secrets to WikiLeaks , including a video of a July 2007 helicopter attack in Baghdad in which civilians , including two Reuters journalists , were killed ; war logs from Afghanistan and Iraq , and 250,000 diplomatic cables from US embassies around the world .
Captain Joe Morrow , presenting the government 's opening statement , cited extracts of a web chat between the soldier and an individual that the prosecution claims was the WikiLeaks founder .
The chats showed , he alleged , that there was a "" familiarity between Manning and Julian Assange "" .
As early as 29 November 2009 , just two weeks after he began working as an intelligence analyst in Iraq , Manning obtained the personal telephone number of Assange in his base in Iceland .
Between then and his arrest in May 2009 , Manning searched for the term "" WikiLeaks "" more than 100 times on the secure intelligence databases that he was authorised to use at Forward Operating Base Hammer outside Baghdad .
Morrow alleged that examinations of Manning 's computers revealed an email exchange between him and WikiLeaks in which the soldier took part directly in the editing process of a video showing a US Apache helicopter attack on a group of civilians in Baghdad in 2007 in which two Reuters journalists were killed .
The video was released by WikiLeaks with sensational worldwide impact in April 2010 under the title Collateral Murder .
The prosecution case that Assange and Manning were actively acting together has widespread ramifications , not just for the trial of Manning , who faces 21 counts relating to the leaks that carry a possible life in military custody .
The claim also has potentially serious implications for Assange himself , who has been , and may still remain , the subject of a grand jury investigation in Virginia exploring the possibility of a federal criminal prosecution against him .
Assange , who remains holed up in the Ecuadorean embassy in London attempting to fight extradition to Sweden on sexual assault allegations , has long insisted that the US government is preparing to hold him responsible for the WikiLeaks disclosures of hundreds of thousands of state secrets including embassy cables , war logs and videos .
Assange believes the US government will press for his extradition to face charges should he be forced to go to Sweden .
In legal argument before the trial began , the US government alleged that WikiLeaks guided the selection of documents leaked by Manning through its 2009 "" most wanted list "" , which provided the soldier with a "" menu "" from which he would do his searches .
Prosecutors claimed that Manning sought intelligence using precisely the same file names as contained on the WikiLeaks itinerary .
The accusation was hotly disputed by Manning 's defence lawyer , David Coombs .
"" There is no evidence to support that Manning took direction from WikiLeaks or that he used this list as a guide to what he would give to WikiLeaks .
Mr Manning was not taking his direction from WikiLeaks , "" Coombs told the court .
The prosecution 's allegations of a direct interplay between the soldier and Assange extended to the assessment reports on detainees in GuantÃ¡namo Bay , which were among the WikiLeaks disclosures .
Morrow said that Manning initially downloaded about 400 detainee assessments , but then he went back to the secure intelligence database on which they were stored and downloaded a total of more than 750 .
Morrow added that in the chat logs with Assange , Manning had asked the WikiLeaks founder about how "" valuable "" the assessments were .
In other communications , Assange was alleged to have advised the soldier on "" finding ways to browse Siprnet [ a secure database ] anonymously "" .
On 10 May 2010 WikiLeaks put out a tweet asking for as "" many .mil email addresses as possible â€ ¦ please submit "" .
The next day , the government alleged , Manning downloaded form a classified database the email addresses and names , ranks and positions of more than 74,000 service members on the Iraq global address list ."
2013-06-03,"The highest - profile trial of an official leaker in a generation got under way on Monday when the US government accused Bradley Manning of betraying his nation to satisfy a craving for notoriety , while the defence presented him as a young , naive humanist who just wanted to make the world a better place .
In two hours of intense opening statements , the courtroom in Fort Meade , Maryland , heard the outlines of a fundamental clash of interpretations about the US soldier 's actions .
The court was also told of new allegations about the links between Manning and Julian Assange , founder of WikiLeaks , the whistleblowing website to which Manning is accused of sending the information .
The statements framed a legal battle that has been slated to last as long as three months with almost 200 witnesses scheduled to give evidence .
Outside the military base where Manning 's court martial is taking place , a large crowd of protesters gathered for what they billed as a "" show trial "" .
As proceedings began , three years after Manning was arrested in Iraq , the slightly built soldier sat calmly on the defence bench , wearing a dark green dress uniform .
The judge , Colonel Denise Lind , opened the trial by asking Manning a number of procedural questions , including to confirm his decision not to have the case decided by a jury , and whether he was satisfied with his defence team . ""
Yes , your honour , "" Manning replied .
The prosecution 's case opened with a statement by a government lawyer , Captain Joe Morrow .
He began by quoting Manning in an extract from a web chat with Adrian Lamo , the former hacker who informed on the soldier to US authorities : "" If you had unprecedented access to classified networks 14 hours a day , seven days a week , eight - plus months , what would you do ? ""
Manning 's question was answered by the prosecution : within two weeks of beginning work as an intelligence analyst in Iraq , the army private had begun to "" systematically and indiscriminately "" harvest a massive trove of US state secrets , Morrow said .
The solider disregarded his extensive training in handling intelligence , and the judgement of his senior officials , in providing useful information "" in the aid of our adversaries "" , Morrow told the court .
During the raid that killed Osama bin Laden in 2011 , Morrow said , information was recovered that showed the al - Qaida chief had personally requested material from WikiLeaks .
According to digital evidence taken from the scene , Bin Laden was given a download of the entire Afghan war logs and many of the US embassy cables that were among the website 's most dramatic disclosures , the prosecution alleged .
"" This is not a case about a few documents â€ ¦ or about a government official who made a discrete leak , "" Morrow said .
"" It was about dumping hundreds of thousands of classified information into the lap of the enemy .
PFC Manning violated the trust of his superiors to gain the notoriety he craved .
"" Manning faces 21 counts relating to the transmission to WikiLeaks of more than 250,000 US embassy cables , Afghan and Iraq war logs , detainee assessments from GuantÃ¡namo Bay and videos of US attacks in Iraq and Afghanistan .
The most serious charge , "" aiding the enemy "" , in violation of Article 104 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice , carries a life sentence with no chance of parole .
Manning has pleaded guilty to lesser offences , but the prosecution rejected the pleas .
The depiction of Manning given by his defence lawyer , David Coombs , was sharply at odds with that of the prosecution .
Coombs said that when Manning arrived in Iraq for his deployment at Forward Operating Base Hammer outside Baghdad in November 2009 he was motivated by his humanist belief in the importance of life .
Coombs said he had been "" young , naive , but good intentioned "" .
Coombs referred to a separate set of web chats that Manning had with a transgender woman called Lauren McNamara , who was at the time a man , before the soldier deployed .
The chats showed that Manning felt "" a huge amount of pressure to do everything he could to help his unit "" , Manning said .
"" He was reading more into politics and philosophy and he indicated he was doing that as he wanted to give the best possible information to his commander and possibly save lives , "" Coombs said .
But Manning 's mindset changed dramatically on Christmas Eve , 2009 .
Manning was ordered to investigate a roadside bomb attack on a passing US military convoy near the base .
When the news came through that all US personnel were uninjured , Manning 's colleagues all cheered and clapped .
Manning did not cheer , because he was aware that five civilian Iraqis had also been caught up in the bombing , after they had pulled over their car to let the convoy pass .
One of them , a woman , had died on the way to hospital . ""
After the 24 December incident he started to struggle .
He kept thinking about that family who had pulled over in their car to let the convoy go by , "" Coombs said , adding that Manning also had "" a very internal private struggle with his gender "" .
The impact of those struggles instilled in Manning a need to "" do something to make a difference in this world "" , Manning said .
"" From that moment forward he started selecting information that he believed the public should hear and see , information that would make the world a better place . ""
Coombs stressed that the data that Manning transmitted to WikiLeaks was specifically chosen not to harm the US or benefit any foreign entity .
He was thinking about its impact on the American public , not its use by the enemy .
Of the US embassy cables , Coombs said Manning believed "" these were some of the more important documents of our time showing , through the fog of war , the asymmetric nature of modern warfare "" .
In its statement , the prosecution alleged that the soldier was in direct and significant contact with Julian Assange over selection and delivery of the leaked material .
The US government 's depiction of Assange 's role will be closely analysed by his supporters , as the Justice Department is known to have been investigating a possible criminal prosecution against him .
Morrow told the court that forensic examiners who studied the computers used by the soldier in Iraq had found that he had searched "" WikiLeaks "" more than 100 times during his deployment .
The examiners also found a file which contained Assange 's personal telephone number in Iceland where he was preparing the first WikiLeaks disclosures .
"" You can currently contact an investigation editor directly in Iceland , "" the note said .
The US government will allege in the course of the trial that Manning was guided directly by Assange as to what documents to download and leak .
Morrow said that file names listed on WikiLeaks 's "" most wanted list "" in 2009 were discovered on Manning 's computers .
In his web chat with Assange , Morrow said , Manning had asked the WikiLeaks founder directly to assess the value of official assessments of GuantÃ¡namo detainees which he went on to leak .
Assange had also advised the soldier on how to browse secure intelligence databases without revealing his identity .
But Coombs told the court that Assange was not significant as a figure behind the soldier 's actions . ""
Mr Manning was not taking his direction from WikiLeaks , "" he said ."
2013-06-10,"Edward Snowden is a "" hero "" who has exposed "" one of the most serious events of the decade â€ “ the creeping formulation of a mass surveillance state "" , Julian Assange said on Monday .
The WikiLeaks founder said the question of surveillance abuses by states and tech companies was "" something that I and many other journalists and civil libertarians have been campaigning about for a long time .
It is very pleasing to see such clear and concrete proof presented to the public . ""
Assange told Sky News that Snowden was "" in a very , very serious position , because we can see the kind of rhetoric that occurred against me and Bradley Manning back in 2010 , 2011 , applied to Snowden "" .
Following the Cablegate exposures in 2010 there were calls from some US politicians for Assange to be tried for treason and even assassinated .
Manning , who has admitted leaking classified US military secrets to WikiLeaks , is on trial facing 21 charges , including "" aiding the enemy "" .
Assange has been confined for almost a year to the Ecuadorian embassy in London , having been granted asylum by the Latin American country in a bid to avoid extradition to Sweden to face sex assault and rape accusations , which he denies .
The Australian fears answering the allegations in Sweden would make him vulnerable to onward extradition to the US to face potential charges relating to the WikiLeaks releases .
Assange had earlier told an Australian interviewer for ABC News that he had been in "" indirect communication with [ Snowden 's ] people "" , but declined to elaborate further .
He described Manning and Snowden as "" very serious , earnest young men who really believe in something , and have shown great courage , and there is no doubt actually that history will look on them extremely favourably and perhaps , in a few years , will liberate them from their predicament . ""
Assange called on supportive countries to "" line up "" and offer support to Snowden .
"" It will be really telling to see which countries really protect human rights , the privacy of the public , asylum rights , or which countries are scared of the United States or are in bed with this surveillance complex . """

2013-06-14,"Governments around the world have surveillance programs similar to PRISM but they have not been as effective as in the United States , Julian Assange has said in an address to Sydney University .
The WikiLeaks founder delivered the keynote address to close the 19th International Symposium on Electronic Art on Thursday night via video link from the Ecuadorian embassy in London .
In a wide - ranging speech he covered military surveillance , the WikiLeaks party and Google 's relationship with the US government . ""
Edward Snowden revealed something that I 've been speaking about for a long time , providing clear concrete proof that the internet has penetrated every aspect of society , right along with it is mass surveillance , "" he said .
"" Right along with it is mass surveillance - mass surveillance by the National Security Agency of the US , working in co - operation with its partners and other countries trying to do the same thing , although not nearly as effectively . ""
Assange also said he had met with Google chairman Eric Schmidt and his girlfriend Lisa Shields , a communications vice - president at the Council on Foreign Relations , as well as one of Hillary Clinton 's advisers .
He then revealed when he was trying to get in touch with Clinton two months ago for legal reasons , it was Shields who rang the person acting as his PA to verify the call .
He said the Google chairman 's girlfriend ringing on behalf of the former secretary of state showed how close Google was with the US government .
Assange also revealed his party 's policies were formed during discussions with select advisers and happened "" very quickly "" , although he was looking to a more collaborative approach after Australia 's federal election .
"" We 're a young party and we 're , what , 93 days away from an election ?
So the answer is very quickly , "" he said when asked how policies were developed .
He said WikiLeaks campaigners and people with legal backgrounds were among the key group . ""
As time goes on we want to rule out new technologies to be able to draw on the many ideas and proposals from our leadership base , "" he said .
"" A party 's leadership can only be as good as the ideas that are brought on . ""
Earlier in the speech Assange said the world was no longer divided into those who had access to the internet and those who did not . ""
This week 's revelations have proven [ the internet ]
â€ ¦ is very far from a civilian place , "" he said .
"" The internet is being transformed into a military - occupied state . ""
Communications between husbands and wives , business partners and even the bureaucracy and the government are all under surveillance , according to Assange .
"" We have a soldier under our bed listening to everything a husband and wife say to each other when they are communicating on email or SMS , "" he said ."
2013-06-16,"Ecuador 's foreign minister has arrived in Britain for talks with William Hague over the future of the WikiLeaks founder , Julian Assange , who has been confined to the Ecuadorean embassy in London for almost a year .
Ricardo Patino met Assange on Sunday and will meet Hague on Monday .
On Wednesday it will be one year since the WikiLeaks founder walked into the embassy in Knightsbridge in an attempt to avoid extradition to Sweden to face sex assault and rape accusations , which he denies .
In August last year , Ecuador granted him political asylum but the British authorities have made clear that he will be arrested if he leaves the building .
Patino said Assange was in "" good spirits "" despite the "" limitations of his accommodation "" .
He added : "" I was able to say face to face to him , for the first time , that the government of Ecuador remains firmly committed to protecting his human rights and that we continue to seek cast - iron assurances to avoid any onward extradition to a third state . ""
During the meeting we were able to speak about the increasing threats against the freedom of people to communicate and to know the truth , threats which come from certain states that have put all of humanity under suspicion . ""
Since Assange entered the embassy , the Metropolitan police have maintained a round - the - clock guard , which cost Â£3.3 m up to March .
Patino has previously accused the British government of trampling on the human rights of the Australian national by refusing to allow him to travel to Ecuador .
Assange said last year he expected to wait six months to a year for a deal that would allow him to leave the embassy .
On Sunday he said : "" I remain immensely grateful to the support Ricardo , President [ Rafael ] Correa and the people of Ecuador have shown me over the last year . ""
He fears answering the allegations in Sweden would make him vulnerable to onward extradition to the US to face potential charges relating to the WikiLeaks releases , fears dismissed by Swedish prosecutors ."
2013-06-17,"The WikiLeaks founder , Julian Assange , says he is fit enough to spend another five years inside the tiny Ecuadorean embassy in London , Ecuador 's foreign minister said on Monday , as it was announced that British and Ecuadorean legal experts would try to resolve the impasse .
Despite the news of the legal talks â€ “ which followed a meeting on Monday morning between the British foreign secretary , William Hague , and his Ecuadorean counterpart , Ricardo PatiÃ±o â€ “ neither London nor Quito is showing any sign of backing down .
The Foreign Office said "" no substantive progress "" had been made during the discussions , while PatiÃ±o told a press conference that Assange 's situation was "" totally unjust "" .
PatiÃ±o said his government and Assange himself were prepared for a long waiting game , with the WikiLeaks founder telling him he was fit enough to spend another five years inside the embassy , in which he will have been holed up for exactly a year on Wednesday .
Assange walked into the embassy in Knightsbridge last June in an attempt to avoid extradition to Sweden to face sexual assault and rape allegations , which he denies .
Ecuador granted him political asylum two months later but the British authorities have made it clear that he will be arrested if he leaves the building .
PatiÃ±o expressed hope that the legal working party might find a solution to the impasse , but insisted his government would never abandon Assange .
"" Our government will not hand Mr Assange over to the UK government nor to anyone else and we shall continue to stress that Mr Assange has the right to benefit from asylum , "" he said .
"" We feel he should be handed over into safe conduct so that he can leave the UK for elsewhere . ""
He said Assange had been deprived of his liberty for a year , adding : "" Really , is justice prevailing here ?
It 's not , is it ? ""
PatiÃ±o said : "" For us this is a matter of principle rather than patience , and of course if you have strong principles you must have sufficient patience
â€
¦
When you act on principle , you have all the time in the world and that 's what we 've also committed to Mr Hague and Mr Assange . ""
He added : "" We do hope that Mr Assange is not going to get older and die in our embassy . ""
A Foreign Office spokesman said : "" Ministers agreed that officials should establish a working group to find a diplomatic solution to the issue of Julian Assange , but no substantive progress was made .
The foreign secretary was clear once again that any resolution would need to be within the laws of the United Kingdom . ""
PatiÃ±o , who conceded that Scotland Yard 's round - the - clock guarding of the embassy was sometimes "" a bit uncomfortable "" for staff , said the police and the British government could rest assured that Ecuador would make no attempt to whisk Assange from the premises .
"" We 're not going to smuggle Mr Assange out in the boot of a car or through an underground tunnel or something , "" he said .
"" The Ecuadorean government is n't going to go out through the back door , we 're going to come out proud through the front door
â€
¦
We 're going to ensure that he comes out facing his freedom â€ “ the freedom of our country .
This is what we are hoping for . ""
He said Assange was in good spirits and they had been up until 4 am on Monday talking about the situation . ""
He said he was strong enough to stay in our embassy for at least five years if he is not granted safe passage , "" PatiÃ±o said .
"" [ But ] I would consider it a total injustice if he has to spend more time in our embassy . ""
Asked whether Quito would countenance a similar request for asylum from the NSA whistleblower , Edward Snowden , PatiÃ±o said the government would certainly consider it .
"" If he applies to our government , then of course we shall analyse the situation and of course other countries may be involved too , "" he said .
"" But if he applies for asylum to the Ecuadorean government , then , shouldering its full responsibility , the Ecuadorean government will analyse the request . """
2013-06-18,"Julian Assange will not leave Ecuador 's embassy even if Sweden drops its extradition bid over accusations of sexual assault , because he fears moves are already underway by the US to prosecute him on espionage charges , he has said .
On the eve of the anniversary of his seeking asylum in the embassy in Knightsbridge , Assange said he believed a sealed indictment had already been lodged by a grand jury in Virginia , which could see him being arrested and extradited by Britain to the US to face prosecution over the WikiLeaks cable releases .
"" The strong view of my US lawyer is that there is already a sealed indictment , which means I would be arrested , unless the British government gave information or guarantees that would grant me safe passage , "" the WikiLeaks founder told a small group of news agencies .
"" We know there is an ongoing investigation in the US and we know I am a target of the federal grand jury .
There is a 99.97 % chance that I will be indicted .
So if the Swedish government drops their request [ to go to Sweden ] tomorrow , I still can not leave the embassy .
My lawyers have advised me I should not leave the embassy because of the risk of arrest and extradition to the US . ""
The foreign secretary , William Hague , and his Ecuadorean opposite number , Ricardo PatiÃ±o , met on Monday to discuss the ongoing diplomatic stalemate , but were unable to reach agreement .
Ecuador argues that having been granted political asylum , Assange should be allowed to board a plane to Quito unimpeded but the British authorities have insisted they will not let him leave without acting on the Swedish warrant .
The two countries agreed to set up a legal working group in an attempt to arrive at a solution to the impasse .
Asked if he regretted seeking asylum because of the resulting stalemate , Assange said : "" Strategically , it has been exactly what I hoped for . ""
Living and working from a small room in the embassy was less stressful than the 600 days he spent on bail wearing an electronic tag , Assange said , although he admitted that it took "" diligence "" to stay healthy with limited access to natural light .
"" You can get rickets by not having any sunlight
â€
“
it is not healthy to be in this position . ""
But he shrugged off reports that he had been ill during his time in the embassy , describing health stories about a chest condition as "" lung - gate "" .
Assange said that when he sought asylum he had believed he would be in the embassy for between six months and two years , a timescale he still considered realistic . ""
My case could be swiftly resolved if Sweden were to guarantee that I would not be extradited to the US or if the British government would guarantee to veto any such extradition to the US , "" he said .
"" While I remain hopeful that a diplomatic solution can be reached , or that the Swedish and US authorities will cease their pursuit of me , it remains the case that it is highly unlikely that Sweden or the UK will ever publicly say no to the US in this matter . """
2013-06-19,"Julian Assange has delivered a scathing attack on the Australian government in an interview marking one year since he walked into the Ecuadorean embassy in London and sought asylum .
Assange told the press he hoped the predicted Coalition win in September would clean out the Labor party and prime minister
Julia Gillard 's "" cronies "" , who he said had relied too heavily on the United States and abandoned himself and WikiLeaks . ""
The duty of that government was to protect an Australian organisation and citizen , and it did just the opposite , "" he said .
"" It bent over more than any country in the world to publicly satisfy the US . ""
Assange has many reasons for his dislike of the current Australian government , which he said was "" as perverted a government as you can possibly imagine "" .
He took aim at Gillard for her initial labelling of him as a criminal and her push for a government inquiry into WikiLeaks , and at former attorney - general Robert McClelland , who considered charging Assange with treason .
Despite being granted asylum by Ecuador , Assange has refused to leave its London embassy for fear the UK government will extradite him to the US , where he may face espionage charges relating to WikiLeaks ' release of classified documents , or to Sweden , where he faces accusations of sexual assault .
"" We know there is an ongoing investigation in the US and we know I am a target of the federal grand jury , "" he said .
"" There is a 99.97 % chance that I will be indicted , so if the Swedish government drops their request ( to go to Sweden ) tomorrow , I still can not leave the embassy .
My lawyers have advised me I should not leave the embassy because of the risk of arrest and extradition to the US . ""
He raised the possibility of travelling to the airport in a diplomatic car to avoid arrest , but noted : "" We know that the UK police were instructed ( in the Sweden case ) to break international law and arrest me even if I was in a diplomatic vehicle and had diplomatic immunity . ""
Assange 's WikiLeaks party , which is fielding candidates for the senate in several states in the September elections , has been buoyed by recent polls which suggest 20 per cent of Australians are considering voting for it .
The party would announce more senate candidates , including well - known names , Assange said .
He dismissed AAP reports that , should he be elected to the senate , he could face a constitutional challenge because he has lived overseas for so long . ""
Various claims have been made over the past year by so - called election experts and they 've all fallen one by one , "" he said .
"" I 've personally researched the detail of the constitution and its interpretation . ""
The outcome of the election would determine whether he considered it safe to return to Australia ."

2013-06-22,"The WikiLeaks founder , Julian Assange , has called on the world to "" step forward and stand with "" Edward Snowden , after the NSA whistleblower was charged with espionage by US federal prosecutors .
According to a statement on the WikiLeaks website , Assange said : "" A few weeks ago , Edward Snowden blew the whistle on an ongoing program â€ “ involving the Obama administration , the intelligence community and the internet services giants â€ “ to spy on everyone in the world .
As if by clockwork , he has been charged with espionage by the Obama administration .
"" It was revealed on Friday that the US has charged Snowden with unauthorised communication of national defence information and wilful communication of classified communications intelligence to an unauthorised person â€ “ charges that are part of the US Espionage Act .
The 30-year - old , who is reportedly hiding in Hong Kong , has also been charged with theft of government property .
The Washington Post reported that US authorities have asked Hong Kong to detain him on a provisional arrest warrant with a view to extradition .
It is just over a year since Assange sought refuge in the Ecuadorian embassy in London in order to avoid being extradited to Sweden , where he is wanted for questioning over allegations of rape and sexual assault .
He claims the allegations are politically motivated .
In the statement , Assange accuses President Barack Obama of going back on a promise to run a transparent administration and suggests he is the true "" traitor "" for supposedly betraying a generation of "" young , technically minded people "" such as Snowden and Bradley Manning , the US Army soldier charged with aiding the enemy who is presently on trial after he gave classified material to WikiLeaks . ""
The US government is spying on each and every one of us , but it is Edward Snowden who is charged with espionage for tipping us off .
It is getting to the point where the mark of international distinction and service to humanity is no longer the Nobel Peace Prize , but an espionage indictment from the US Department of Justice , "" said Assange .
"" The charging of Edward Snowden is intended to intimidate any country that might be considering standing up for his rights .
That tactic must not be allowed to work .
The effort to find asylum for Edward Snowden must be intensified .
What brave country will stand up for him , and recognize his service to humanity ?
Tell your governments to step forward .
Step forward and stand with Snowden . ""
Several American politicians have backed the decision to charge Snowden .
Senator Bill Nelson , a Florida Democrat and a member of the Senate armed services committee , said in a statement on Friday : "" I 've always thought this was a treasonous act .
Apparently so does the US Department of Justice .
I hope Hong Kong 's government will take him into custody and extradite him to the US . ""
Congressman Peter King , a Republican from New York , also praised the move .
"" I fully support the efforts of the United States government to indict and prosecute Edward Snowden to the fullest extent of the law , "" he said , according to Fox News .
"" He has betrayed his country and the government must demand his extradition at the earliest date . ""
King last week called for the prosecution of Glenn Greenwald , the Guardian journalist who has been heavily involved in breaking the NSA surveillance stories .
John Miller , a CBS News correspondent who is a former government intelligence worker , said on CBS that the extradition treaty between the US and Hong Kong has been "" used a lot
â€
¦
that 's the good news , which is this wo n't be a rusty process .
The complicating factor is it 's a complicated process . ""
The Government Accountability Project , a US whistleblower support group , issued a statement backing Snowden .
It read : "" He disclosed information about a secret program that he reasonably believed to be illegal , and his actions alone brought about the long - overdue national debate about the proper balance between privacy and civil liberties , on the one hand , and national security on the other . ""
Charging Snowden with espionage is yet another effort to retaliate against those who criticize the overreach of US intelligence agencies under this administration .
The charges send a clear message to potential whistleblowers : this is the treatment they can expect should they speak out about constitutional violations . """
2013-06-23,"When WikiLeaks claimed in a tweet that it was assisting NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden 's "" political asylum in a democratic country "" there was one detail that apparently confirmed its involvement â€ “ that Snowden was travelling with a person whose surname was Harrison .
Sarah Harrison â€ “ who WikiLeaks on Sunday published an updated biography for â€
“ has been a staff member for more than two years , and is one of Julian Assange 's closest advisors .
She began her involvement with the group when as an intern at the UK - based Centre for Investigative Journalism , she was assigned to Assange ahead of WikiLeaks ' publication of the Afghan war logs .
As several key members , including Assange 's number - two Daniel Domscheit - Berg and several of his associates , left in a dispute with Assange , she became more important to WikiLeaks and was closely involved in the publication of the embassy cables and with Assange 's personal legal battles to avoid extradition to Sweden .
She has been pictured on numerous occasions attending court with the WikiLeaks founder .
Despite her closeness to Assange , Harrison may seem a strange choice to accompany Snowden , as unlike several people close to WikiLeaks â€ “
most notably human rights lawyer Jennifer Robinson â€ “ Harrison has no legal qualifications or background .
Julian Assange has made several public statements in support of Edward Snowden and told reporters last week he had been in touch with the whistleblower through intermediaries .
The direct intervention in Snowden 's situation marks a departure in practice for WikiLeaks â€ “ which has previously stressed its arms - length relationship with sources â€ “ but is consistent with the organisation 's world view on protecting and supporting whistleblowers .
Snowden 's intended destination , his plans once he gets there , and whether WikiLeaks intends to play a longer - term role supporting or working with Snowden are not yet known ."

It also cements its reputation as a thorn in the side of the US and UK governments .
Speaking to the Sydney Morning Herald from the Ecuadorean embassy in London , Assange said : "" Owing to WikiLeaks ' own circumstances , we have developed significant expertise in international asylum and extradition law , associated diplomacy and the practicalities in these matters .
"" I have great personal sympathy for Ed Snowden 's position .
WikiLeaks absolutely supports his decision to blow the whistle on the mass surveillance of the world 's population by the US government . ""
Harrison may seem a strange choice to accompany Snowden since , unlike several people close to WikiLeaks â€ “
most notably human rights lawyer Jennifer Robinson â€
“
she has no legal qualifications or background .
But Assange 's group has also offered the support of its legal director Baltasar GarzÃ³n , the former judge who ordered the arrest in Spain of former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet ."
2013-06-23,"Political cover
Although Ecuador is relatively small , it has strong regional allies and economic support from China , which strengthens its ability to resist extradition requests .
The president , Rafael Correa , has shown he is not afraid of standing up to the US and Europe by granting asylum to the WikiLeaks founder , Julian Assange .
WikiLeaks claimed on Sunday that it was helping Snowden to secure asylum in "" a democratic nation via a safe route "" .
Correa has just been re - elected to a four year term so Snowden 's cover would be likely last until at least 2017 .
Reputation impact Slightly less risky than Venezuela .
Correa is less of a hate figure in the US than Hugo ChÃ¡vez or NicolÃ¡s Maduro .
Ecuador is too small to be considered a threat , though its increasingly close ties to China might raise questions .
Correa has been heavily criticised for cracking down on private media groups , though there is still a diverse range of opinion on TV and in newspapers .
Living standard Quito is a stunning city high in the Andes with great food , decent internet , reasonable prices and easy access to Pacific beaches and Amazon forest .
Crime rates are somewhat lower than Venezuela and inequality , though a major problem , is less apparent .
Climate Quito 's altitude of 2,800 m ( 9,200 ft ) takes some getting used to .
It has cool summers and mild winters , interspersed with the occasional mountain storm and lots of cloud cover ."
2013-06-26,"Ecuador has said it could take months to decide whether to grant asylum to Edward Snowden , potentially confining the US whistleblower to the halls of a Russian airport for weeks to come .
Ricardo Patino , Ecuador 's foreign minister , said Snowden 's case was similar to that of the WikiLeaks founder , Julian Assange , who has been granted asylum at the country 's embassy in London .
"" It took us two months to make a decision in the case of Assange , so do not expect us to make a decision sooner this time , "" Patino said during a visit to Malaysia .
He said Ecuador would "" consider all the risks "" in granting asylum , including concerns that it could harm trade ties with the US .
Sander Levin , a US congressman , told The Hill newspaper on Wednesday that if Ecuador granted Snowden asylum there was no "" basis for even discussing "" extending a trade deal up for renewal in July .
Snowden fled Hong Kong on Sunday after leaking secret documents revealing US surveillance programmes .
Vladimir Putin , the Russian president , confirmed on Tuesday that Snowden had arrived in Moscow 's Sheremetyevo airport and was waiting in its transit area following days of speculation as to his whereabouts .
Reporters at the airport have seen no sign of Snowden , fuelling suspicion that he is being hidden by the Russians .
Despite remarks by Putin that he hoped Snowden would leave the country soon , it appeared Snowden might have to settle in at the Sheremetyevo airport for a while .
An anonymous source told the news agency Interfax that Snowden lacked documents that would allow him to travel . ""
Snowden 's US passport has been cancelled , he has no other identification documents in his hands , "" the source said .
"" So he 's required to stay in Sheremetyevo 's transit zone , since he ca n't leave Russia or buy a ticket . ""
The official Twitter site for WikiLeaks also proposed that Snowden would be bound to the Moscow airport for the foreseeable future . ""
Cancelling Snowden 's passport and bullying intermediary countries may keep Snowden permanently in Russia . ""
Commentators also denied that Snowden was cooperating with the Federal Security Service ( FSB ) , following Putin 's similar denial on Tuesday . ""
Mr Snowden is not being ' de briefed ' by the FSB , "" the group said , adding that he was well .
Yet Snowden lost a supporter on Wednesday when the Spanish judge Baltasar GarzÃ³n said he would not represent him .
Snowden has been charged under the espionage act for gathering and leaking classified materials .
GarzÃ³n , who represents Assange , offered no explanation .
Russian officials have been lining up to throw their support behind Snowden since he first landed in Moscow on Sunday .
On Wednesday , Alexey Pushkov , head of the Duma 's international affairs committee , said : "" Assange , [ Bradley ] Manning , and Snowden , were not spies and did n't give up secret information for money but out of conviction .
They are the new dissidents , fighters of the system .
"" Russia 's embrace of Snowden stands in stark contrast to its own record on human rights and the treatment of whistleblowers .
Putin and his foreign minister , Sergei Lavrov , have lashed out at the US for demanding Snowden 's extradition and implying Russian involvement in his flight .
Putin presented Snowden as just another transiting passenger , and Russian news agencies on Wednesday continued their campaign of possible disinformation , citing an anonymous source who claimed that he had checked in to an airport hotel but checked out a few hours later .
Reporters staking out the hotel caught no site of Snowden and receptionists there had no memory of him .
A top story on the evening news , run from the Kremlin , discussed the possibility of Russia 's granting Snowden political asylum .
Andrei Soldatov , an expert on the Russian security services , said : "" I do n't think he 's just wandering around .
It seems he is hiding in some place or they are hiding him . ""
Soldatov said he did not think Russia would accept Snowden permanently . ""
In this case , it would be completely impossible to say he was not briefed by the FSB â€ “ even now , it 's quite difficult to say he 's not being briefed . ""
He said he expected the guessing game to continue , however .
"" I think the Kremlin just enjoys it . "" Elsewhere in Europe the reverberations continued following Snowden 's revelations on the extent of British electronic eavesdropping , as the human rights watchdog , the Council of Europe , took issue with attempts by the UK foreign secretary , William Hague , to play down the impact of the disclosures .
"" Privacy is a fundamental human right which is essential if we wish to live in dignity and security .
It can not be forfeited so easily , "" Nils Muiznieks , the council 's commissioner for human rights , wrote in a commentary for the Guardian .
Muiznieks acknowledged the duty of the state to ensure national security but added : "" Those who implement secret surveillance measures risk undermining or even destroying democracy while pretending to defend it . ""
He advocated a new set of safeguards , including greater clarity over the laws governing surveillance , firm guidelines on the use and storage of surveillance data , and the creation of oversight bodies "" accountable to parliament rather than the executive "" .
In Westminster , British MPs are due to meet on Thursday to hear expert testimony on the impact on British citizens of Prism , the US internet surveillance program exposed by Snowden ."
2013-06-27,"If Edward Snowden can make it to Ecuador , it will be a good choice for him and the world .
The government , including the president , Rafael Correa , and the foreign minister , Ricardo PatiÃ±o , proved their steadfastness in the face of threats and abuse last year when they granted asylum to WikiLeaks ' founder Julian Assange .
The media took advantage of the fact that most of the world knows very little about Ecuador to misinform their audience that this government "" represses the media "" .
The same efforts are already under way in the Snowden case .
Without defending everything that exists in Ecuador , including criminal libel laws and some vague language in a new communications law , anyone who has been to the country knows that the international media has presented a gross caricature of the state of press freedom there .
The Ecuadorian private media is more oppositional than that of the US , trashing the government every day .
Unfortunately , groups like Americas Watch ( of Human Rights Watch ) and the Committee to Protect Journalists , which do good work in some countries , have joined Washington 's campaign against Ecuador , publishing gross exaggerations .
These groups should be a bit more worried about the chilling effect that the Obama administration 's unprecedented prosecution of whistleblowers has had on investigative journalism in the United States .
The great irony is not that Snowden should enlist help from Ecuador , or even Russia and China for that matter , in escaping political persecution .
Has any journalist or human rights advocate criticised the thousands of Salvadoran refugees who escaped US - sponsored murder and repression in the late 1970s and 80s by fleeing to the United States , "" the world 's greatest purveyor of violence , "" as Martin Luther King once described it ?
Political refugees do not choose their host countries according to whether they agree with government policy .
The great irony in this case is that Ecuador gets dragged through the mud for considering asylum for a whistleblower who has been charged under the espionage act .
Who â€ “ yes , ironically â€ “ probably could not even get a fair trial in the US because the media there has already convicted him .
Washington would almost certainly retaliate against Ecuador for granting asylum to Snowden .
In addition to commercial sanctions , there are possible covert actions .
In 2010 there was a coup attempt against Correa ; although there is no direct evidence of US involvement , the police who led the uprising had a long relationship with US officials , including funding .
Many in Ecuador 's government believe that Washington was involved , and if it was n't , this would be the first coup attempt in at least 60 years against a left - wing government in Latin America that Washington had nothing to do with .
The Obama administration has led a successful media campaign to reframe the Snowden case in cold war terms , and much of the media has gone along for the ride , portraying Ecuador as wanting to "" poke its finger in Washington 's eye "" .
Correa must be doing this for some political gain at home too , they say .
It 's the exact same menu that was served up when Ecuador granted asylum to Assange , with the added primitive view that these "" anti - American "" troublemakers down south must have a new "" ringleader "" to replace Hugo ChÃ¡vez .
But any of the newly independent left - of - centre governments in South America would have granted asylum to Assange .
Brazil 's then - president Lula da Silva was one of Assange 's first ( before Correa ) and strongest defenders , and Brazil would likely approve an asylum request from Snowden too .
Snowden , like Assange , has a well - founded fear of political persecution â€ “ especially after being charged with espionage , a crime he clearly did not commit .
So as a matter of international law and of principle â€ “ including the principle of self - determination â€ “ none of these governments would participate in what WikiLeaks is correctly calling a "" rendition "" of Snowden to the US .
If Washington is ultimately forced to respect international law in this case , it will be because many countries , most strikingly in South America , no longer fear US retaliation .
Since Snowden did a huge public service by revealing government wrongdoing , this is another example of how US citizens â€ “ contrary to what our media tells us every day â€ “ actually benefit from the development of a more multipolar world ."
2013-06-27,"Hacktivist groups have been in existence for many years , however the iconic imagery and chilling propaganda messages of Anonymous mean that this loosely linked group of individuals are almost synonymous with the movement .
Breaking through to mainstream attention with their support of Julian Assange 's WikiLeaks programme , Anonymous rapidly rose to become a high - profile combatant in the fight for freedom of information and social justice , becoming associated with the 2011 Occupy movement , and being listed in Time magazine 's 100 most influential .
Their stock was high , organisations feared the scrutiny of hacktivist groups and their foot soldiers seemed to be able to steal and publish corporate or governmental data at will .
In 2013 , however , things look a little different .
Hacktivist groups have suffered from a string of convictions as frustrated governments clamped down on their activity .
Attacks seems to have lessened as confirmed by the recent Verizon data breach report , which tracks security incidents across the globe .
It stated that only a small minority of attacks have hacktivist roots , and that the vast majority of data security threats now originate from organised criminal and state sponsored groups .
The distributed and individualised nature of this movement mean that the groups have no common background or goal and this can lead to a level of inconsistency and randomness that would befuddle most CEOs .
Lacking a nominated leader , the hacktivist movement relies on clear causes to unite and focus their activities â€ “ when these causes are not so clear , the group tends to fragment and seek out other activities .
One drawback of this decentralised and leaderless structure is that it can be subverted and used by other parties for their own gain .
Criminals may leverage the hacktivist brand to obfuscate their activities and groups appear which push government propaganda under the auspices of representing the people and freedom of speech .
The hacktivist 's signature distributed denial of service ( DDoS ) attack , for example , is increasingly being seen as a smokescreen to divert an organisation 's attention while a deeper infiltration attempt is made .
Irrespective of whether you feel the movement represents hero , or anti - hero , it 's clear that it represents a change in the nature of protest , but should firms be concerned about the threat from hacktivists ?
The bark and bite of the movement seems to vary as members join and leave , and as social or political buttons are pressed â€ “ one moment Anonymous are taking down child porn sites , while the next , another group attacks US banks to protest an anti - Islamic YouTube video .
The connections are vague and random .
One thing is certain , however , the nature of the current information threat landscape means that organisations need to be applying a series of technical controls and leveraging the staff as part of a human firewall , which Forrester Research perceives as much more than simply a range of policies and a security awareness programme .
If the management of information security focuses on the key information assets and services , and applies the controls in a methodical , prioritised manner with audits and metrics to measure effectiveness , then it will be effective protecting the firm from all manner of external attackers â€ “ whether criminal , state - sponsored or simply opportunist .
Looking to the future , hacktivist activity is too random to predict with great certainty â€ “ which is just the way they like it
â€ “ but their threat will continue to ebb and flow .
Expect the movement to reinvent and reinvigorate itself as emerging countries come online and revolt at global inequality , and as a stuttering European economy continues to fail to find employment for educated , capable and disillusioned individuals .

2013-06-28,"The plan to spirit the surveillance whistleblower Edward Snowden to sanctuary in Latin America appeared to be unravelling on Friday , amid tension between Ecuador 's government and Julian Assange , the founder of WikiLeaks .
President Rafael Correa halted an effort to help Snowden leave Russia amid concern Assange was usurping the role of the Ecuadoran government , according to leaked diplomatic correspondence published on Friday .
Amid signs Quito was cooling with Snowden and irritated with Assange , Correa declared invalid a temporary travel document which could have helped extract Snowden from his reported location in Moscow .
Correa declared that the safe conduct pass issued by Ecuador 's London consul â€ “ in collaboration with Assange â€ “ was unauthorised , after other Ecuadorean diplomats privately said the WikiLeaks founder could be perceived as "" running the show "" .
According to the correspondence , which was obtained by the Spanish - language broadcaster Univision and shared with the Wall Street Journal , divisions over Assange have roiled Ecuador 's government .
Ecuador 's ambassador to the US , Nathalie Cely , told presidential spokesman Fernando Alvarado that Quito 's role in the drama was being overshadowed by the WikiLeaks founder , who has sheltered in Ecuador 's London embassy for the past year to avoid extradition .
"" I suggest talking to Assange to better control the communications .
From outside , [ Assange ] appears to be running the show .
"" Earlier this week a senior foreign diplomat in Quito told the Guardian that some â€ “ though not all â€ “ factions in the government were annoyed with what they saw as Assange grandstanding .
In a message attributed to Assange sent to Ecuador 's foreign minister , Ricardo PatiÃ±o , and other top officials , the WikiLeaks founder apologised "" if we have unwittingly [ caused ]
Ecuador discomfort in the Snowden matter .
"" The note continued : "" There is a fog of war due to the rapid nature of events .
If similar events arise you can be assured that they do not originate in any lack of respect or concern for Ecuador or its government . ""
Assange appears to have had a strong role in obtaining the travel document for Snowden , dated 22 June which bore the printed name , but not signature , of the London consul , Fidel Narvaez , a confidante .
By mid - week Narvaez was reportedly in Moscow .
The document could have helped Snowden , whose US passport has been revoked , leave the transit lounge of Moscow 's Sheremetyevo airport where he has reportedly holed up since fleeing Hong Kong last weekend .
On Thursday , Correa , who previously has hailed Snowden for exposing US spying , and has earned kudos for defying Washington pressure over the affair , reduced Snowden 's chances of making it to Quito .
At a press conference the president declared the travel document invalid and said Ecuador would not consider an asylum request unless Snowden reached Ecuadorean territory , an increasingly remote prospect . ""
The situation of Mr Snowden is a complex situation and we do n't know how he will solve it . ""
Correa did however ramp up defiance of the US by waiving preferential trade rights to thwart what officials called Washington "" blackmail "" .
Analysts said Correa , an economist who specialised in game theory , had so far skilfully extracted political capital from the saga without drawing US retaliation .
In a TV interview on Friday , Snowden 's father said said he was worried about the involvement of WikiLeaks .
"" I do n't want to put him in peril , but I am concerned about those who surround him , "" Lonnie Snowden told NBC .
"" I think WikiLeaks , if you 've looked at past history
â€ ¦ their focus is n't necessarily the constitution of the United States .
It 's simply to release as much information as possible . ""
Snowden said he did not believe his son had betrayed his country . ""
At this point , I do n't feel that he 's committed treason .
He has broken US law , in a sense that he has released classified information .
And if folks want to classify him as a traitor , in fact he has betrayed his government .
But I do n't believe that he 's betrayed the people of the United States . ""
Snowden said he had told US attorney general Eric Holder through his lawyer that his son might return home if he would not be detained before trial , could choose the location for his trial and would not be subjected to a gag order .
It was not clear that Lonnie Snowden was communicating his son 's views , as he also said they had not spoken since April ."
2013-06-30,"Julian Assange , the WikiLeaks founder , has warned the US government that no matter what it does to try and apprehend Edward Snowden , the revelations he has unearthed on secret digital surveillance of American citizens will see the light of day .
Assange stated pointedly that steps had been taken to foil any US attempt to block publication .
"" There is no stopping the publishing process at this stage , "" he said .
Speaking to This Week on ABC news from the Ecuadorean embassy in London , where he is fighting extradition to Sweden to face sexual assault allegations , Assange would not go into details .
But he added : "" Great care has been taken to make sure Mr Snowden can not be pressured by any state to stop the publishing process .
"" Snowden is believed to be holed up in the transit area of a Moscow airport , as he seeks asylum in another country , possibly Ecuador .
The former contractor for the National Security Agency has been charged under the 1917 Espionage Act , having leaked classified information on the US government 's digital surveillance of phone records , emails and internet communications to the Guardian and the Washington Post .
WikiLeaks has been assisting Snowden in his attempt to avoid capture , providing the 30-year - old with travel expenses and legal counsel and sending advisers to accompany him on his journey from Hong Kong to Moscow earlier this month .
Assange said he had offered to help because "" we 've had some experience in the past with dealing with attacks from the US , with asylum and so on , and I have some personal sympathy for Mr Snowden "" .
But WikiLeaks has come under criticism from Snowden 's father , Lonnie Snowden , who through his lawyer has accused the anti - secrecy organization of using his son to raise money for itself and to prevent Edward Snowden "" from doing the right thing "" by returning to the US to face charges .
Assange told This Week that he had contacted the lawyer to try to "" put some of his concerns to rest "" .
Snowden 's predicament , trapped in a legal no man 's land between countries , shows no sign of any early resolution .
The US government has revoked his passport , making it almost impossible for him to travel on from Russia to any possible final destination .
Countries such as Iceland , which Snowden has mentioned as a desired potential safe haven , have made clear that he has to be on their soil before he can claim asylum , creating a legal Catch-22 .
The Ecuadorean president , Rafael Correa , told the Associated Press on Sunday that Snowden was "" in the care of the Russian authorities "" and would not be able to leave Moscow 's international airport without his US passport .
In a comment that indicated the cautious response of Ecuador to the case , Correa reprimanded Ecuador 's consul for issuing Snowden with a letter of safe passage that he is believed to have used to travel from Hong Kong to Russia .
To have done that without consulting the central Ecuadorean government was a "" serious error "" , Correa said .
In comments that will not encourage Snowden or his supporters , the Ecuadorean leader added that if Snowden had broken US laws he would have to assume responsibility , adding that the case was "" not in Ecuador 's hands "" .
Correa 's ambivalent remarks might reflect the fact that he has come under heavy diplomatic pressure from the US to reject Snowden 's appeal .
On Saturday , Correa said Joe Biden , the US vice president , had contacted him personally by telephone to ask him to dismiss any asylum claim .
The Obama administration shows no sign of wanting to help Snowden find a way out of international limbo .
Last week , Barack Obama said : "" I 'm not going to be scrambling jets to get a 29-year - old hacker . ""
Snowden turned 30 last week .
On Sunday , Nancy Pelosi , leader of the Democratic group in the House of Representatives , told Meet the Press on NBC that in her view "" it 's pretty good that he 's stuck in Moscow airport .
That 's OK with me
â€ “ he can stay there . """
2013-07-02,"Covering the Edward Snowden story has not been straightforward for many in the mainstream media , which is reflected in the disjointed coverage it has received in the UK so far .
For the newspapers that campaigned so hard to get the communications data bill thrown out because of the implications for privacy , he should be a hero .
But then the brash young American "" stole "" the material , came to the Guardian with it , and has ended up stranded in Russia , where he may or may not receive asylum with the help of Julian Assange .
All of which makes him rather unpalatable to many in Fleet Street â€ “ and indeed the House of Commons .
For many of them , the easier story to tell was the one about Snowden 's girlfriend , who was left bereft in Hawaii .
This week there have been more revelations about the way the US spied on the EU , which followed the Guardian 's disclosures about how the British snooped on diplomats from Turkey and South Africa , among others , at the G20 summit in London four years ago .
This has caused genuine fury among those targeted , particularly the Germans and the French .
But their anger has been met with shoulder - shrugging indignation from former British diplomats and security experts , who say this sort of thing happens all the time .
They would hardly say anything different .
In all likelihood , they have either authorised or benefited from such covert intelligence gathering , so the lack of biting analysis was entirely predictable .
For those in the media unsure how to deal with Snowden , and rather hoping the complex saga would go away , this was another easy escape route : "" No story here , let 's move on . ""
But there is a story .
It gets lost , all too conveniently , in the diplomatic rows and the character - assassinations , but ultimately it is the legacy of the Snowden files .
The documents have shown that intelligence agencies in the UK and the US are harvesting vast amounts of information about millions of people .
This is fact , not fantasy .
They are doing this right now , on a scale that could not have been envisaged five years ago , let alone when the laws covering the collection and retention of data were drafted .
They are also sharing this treasure trove of intelligence with each other , and other close allies .
In the UK , the same ministers who sign off operations to spy on our allies , are also approving countless warrants to allow GCHQ to siphon off data from cables that carry internet traffic in and out of the country .
Emails , conversations on Skype , the details of phone calls â€ “ they all go into the intelligence pot ready for analysis and digestion .
The methods that GCHQ has developed may be ingenious .
But are they right ?
Do the laws really legitimise this activity ?
And can the handful of MPs and commissioners tasked with the scrutinising the agencies really keep on top of all this ?
Do they have the staff , the expertise ?
Those are the questions that need proper argument .
The reassurances of senior cabinet ministers , such as William Hague , who is responsible for GCHQ , needed to be tested , not just repeated unchallenged .
Those who wail about the leaks affecting national security might consider the words of Bruce Schneier , a security specialist , who wrote in the New York Times : "" The argument that exposing these documents helps the terrorists does n't even pass the laugh test ; there 's nothing here that changes anything any potential terrorist would do or not do . ""
And where are the telecoms companies in all this , and the internet service providers ?
For now , they are still keeping quiet .
But at some point they will be asked to explain to their millions of customers what they knew about this industrial - scale snooping .
None of this is easy , and ministers and intelligence officials would like nothing more than to shut down the debate .
The clues are in their discomfort ."
2013-07-02,"Despite the cheers and jeers at leakers such as Julian Assange , Bradley Manning and Edward Snowden over the last few years , it would seem access to such information is less protected than ever .
Serving intelligence officers are allowed to sell their skills to corporations .
High - level intelligence work , once closely guarded , is farmed out to contractors , who leak information like a sieve .
The Obama White House has conducted more leak investigations than any previous administration , now including the leak of a cyber - warfare campaign against Iran by a top US army general , James Cartwright .
We are selling our national security in an effort to save a buck â€ “ and we will continue to pay for it in other ways .
In 2010 , Eamon Javers reported on CIA 's controversial "" moonlighting "" policy , which allowed active intelligence officers to seek permission to work in the private sector on the side if they made full disclosure and it did not conflict with their duties .
Generally , the same standard applies to all federal employees who are not political appointees .
But not all federal employees are CIA officers .
No statistics of how many took advantage of the policy were forthcoming , but the policy itself was disturbing enough to lead to questions before Congress .
Why is this allowed ?
Defenders hold it is important to stop the "" brain drain "" , where the best and brightest depart the agency for better pay .
Supporters argue the level of compensation at CIA does n't stack up against other federal or private - sector employment .
This "" discrepancy "" leads talented employees to look elsewhere â€ “ for roles in which their skills fetch better prices .
The CIA thus finds itself in competition with the private sector to keep personnel on whom it has expended a great deal of money and effort in training .
Demand for intelligence work has ballooned since 9/11 , though government belt - tightening in recent years has had an effect .
Washington has decided , rather than expanding intelligence services in a permanent sense , to farm out the increased workload to private contractors .
This has advantages , as for any business seeking to outsource operations .
When the need for the work reduces , it is easier to allow a contract to expire than it is to lay off excess federal employees or to keep them on , under - employed .
But there are drawbacks as well .
Rather than paying solely for the service , the price also reflects the contractor 's own costs â€ “ their HR , finance , management and marketing departments ' wages , office costs , even redundancies .
It is questionable if contracting saves anything at all .
One does n't have to look hard to find stories of wasted costs , foul - ups or even corruption in security contracting .
Just last week , USIS , the contractor responsible for performing background checks for security clearances â€ “ including Edward Snowden 's â€ “ was accused of misleading the government as to the thoroughness of their investigations .
Lawmakers have been told that thousands of background checks may have been improperly conducted .
( The firm has made no comment , but issued a statement saying it was co - operating with an investigation . )
Private intelligence contractors look to hire employees who already have active clearances and intelligence experience â€ “ requirements not easily obtained elsewhere than an intelligence agency .
The problem becomes circular .
Farming out intelligence work to contractors creates its own demand .
Agency employees leave for jobs with higher pay because the government itself has created a market for them , creating the very "" brain drain "" it seeks to stem .
This is because bean - counters are worried about the effect on the budget â€ “ namely , of salary , benefits and pension obligations to employees .
In the CIA 's defence , these decisions are made in Washington , DC , not Langley , Virginia .
A second argument is that no harm is being done and these individuals have dedicated years to the country and are entitled to "" feather their nests "" .
However , the US military shares the same commitment to the country â€ “ yet service personnel get paid even less , and veterans are coming home to high unemployment rates .
While the job has its risks , most CIA employees still have desk jobs .
The more academic nature of the job does not automatically entitle analysts to higher pay .
There are also brainy folks at the Department of Interior or Forest Service who are overworked and underpaid .
Many other less fortunate Americans would be happy to have such pay and benefits as CIA officers enjoy .
That our national security apparatus feels it must compete with the private sector to attract the best talent now means attracting the wrong kind of talent .
Those who work in such a vital role should not do so for the salary , even if that is a great recruitment tool .
One recruit who signs up for the right reasons is worth five who sign up for others .
This should be familiar to US intelligence officers from the CIA 's chief architect , Allen Dulles , who believed the most dependable sources are those not in it for pay .
The net effect on security is that it has become impossible for America to keep secrets .
Security information is being handled by private companies poaching the intelligence community 's talent and selling it back to the government , who paid to develop it in the first place .
Government budget cuts and a failure to invest in intelligence infrastructure have created this problem .
National security challenges do not simply go away because we are having budget fights .
If we are not willing to pay for this now , we 'll pay for it
later â€ “ in another , more sinister sense .
Some things are worth paying for ; our national security is one of them ."
2013-07-03,"A hidden microphone has been found inside the Ecuadorean embassy in London , where the WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange is holed up , according to the country 's foreign minister .
Ricardo PatiÃ±o said the device had been discovered a fortnight ago inside the office of the Ecuadorean ambassador , Ana Alban , while he was in the UK to meet Assange and discuss the whistleblower 's plight with the British foreign secretary , William Hague .
"" We regret to inform you that in our embassy in London we have found a hidden microphone , "" PatiÃ±o told a news conference in Quito on Tuesday .
"" I did n't report this at the time because we did n't want the theme of our visit to London to be confused with this matter , "" he said .
"" Furthermore , we first wanted to ascertain with precision the origin of this interception device in the office of our ambassador . ""
He described the discovery of the device as "" another instance of a loss of ethics at the international level in relations between governments "" and said he would reveal more details as to who might have planted the microphone on Wednesday .
The Foreign Office declined to comment immediately on the allegation , while a No 10 spokesman said he did not comment on security issues .
Assange has been living inside the embassy for more than a year to avoid extradition to Sweden to face allegations by two women of sexual assault and rape , which he denies .
He fears that if sent to Sweden he could be extradited from there to the US to face potential charges over the release of thousands of confidential US documents on WikiLeaks .
Ecuador 's protection of Assange has strained relations with Britain .
After talking to Assange until four in the morning on 17 June , PatiÃ±o met Hague for fruitless negotiations on the affair .
The Foreign Office said "" no substantive progress "" had been made during the discussions , while PatiÃ±o told a press conference that Assange 's situation was "" totally unjust "" .
PatiÃ±o also said his government and Assange himself were prepared for a long waiting game , with the WikiLeaks founder telling him he was fit enough to spend another five years inside the Knightsbridge embassy .
Staff at the embassy are understood to have found the heavy police presence around their office intimidating .
The round - the - clock police guard has so far cost more than Â£3.3 m and has been described by PatiÃ±o as "" a bit uncomfortable "" for embassy employees .
Despite the discomfort and the diplomatic impasse , however , the Ecuadorean foreign minister has been careful to stress that his government had no intention of using espionage sleight - of - hand to whisk Assange off the premises .
"" We 're not going to have Mr Assange escaping from our embassy ; we 're not going to come up with some undercover operation to smuggle him out , "" he told reporters following his June meeting with Hague .
"" We want to be open about this , we want to discuss the issue with the UK government â€ ¦
but if they insist on putting the police around our embassy , then OK , we respect that .
But it 's important that they know that Ecuador is n't going to do anything irregular ; we 're not going to smuggle Mr Assange out in the boot of a car or through and underground tunnel or something .
"" The Ecuadorean government is n't going to go out through the back door , we 're going to come out proud through the front door .
We 're going to ensure that he does n't get smuggled out in a vehicle ; we 're going to ensure that he comes out facing his freedom - the freedom of our country .
This is what we are hoping for . """
2013-07-03,"The international wrangle over the future of Edward Snowden took a further twist when Ecuador declared it had found a listening device in its London embassy and threatened to reveal who had planted it .
In another day of drama and diplomatic indignation , Ricardo PatiÃ±o , Ecuador 's foreign minister , said the device had been discovered a fortnight ago when he had been in the UK to discuss another fugitive , the WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange .
PatiÃ±o said the hidden microphone had been found in the office of Ecuador 's ambassador , Ana Alban , and he condemned the development as a "" loss of international ethics "" .
If the claim proves true , the spotlight is likely to fall on Britain 's intelligence agencies .
MI5 would normally be tasked with concealing listening devices in buildings such as embassies in the UK , though MI6 could also seek authorisation .
This could not be done without ministers knowing .
Theresa May , the home secretary , is responsible for the conduct of MI5 and deals with its most sensitive applications .
If the agency had planted the bug , her authority would have been needed .
Such warrants have to be renewed at regular intervals as part of Britain 's legal framework for spying activity .
Whitehall sources refused to be drawn on the bugging issue , saying they could "" neither confirm nor deny "" whether UK intelligence agencies had been involved .
PatiÃ±o 's intervention came as leaders across Latin America condemned the treatment of the Bolivian president , Evo Morales , whose plane was forced to land in Austria amid suspicions that it might be carrying Snowden , the US intelligence analyst .
Morales was on his way back home after a trip toMoscow , where Snowden has been stranded since he left Hong Kong more than a week ago .
Bolivia accused Austria of "" kidnapping "" the president , who was kept in Vienna for 14 hours while his plane was searched .
France , Portugal and Spain were all said to have refused permission for the president 's plane to enter their airspace , raising suspicions about the pressure being exerted by the US .
The episode stoked anger in Latin America , where there is growing disquiet over the way in which the US has attempted to pressure countries into refusing to offer Snowden sanctuary .
Ecuador has said it will not consider an application for his asylum unless he is in the country .
But the assistance that it gave to Assange , who has been staying at the country 's at the Ecuadorian embassy in London for more than a year , has made it a focus of American and British diplomatic pressure .
WikiLeaks has been trying to help Snowden evade US law enforcement officials , who want him to face trial on espionage charges for leaking details about the country 's top - secret surveillance programmes .
Though PatiÃ±o gave few details , it would appear that the bug was discovered on June 17 â€ “ a week before Snowden left Hong Kong .
At the time , Assange and other members of WikiLeaks were providing the former intelligence analyst with legal and logistical help .
At a press conference in Quito , PatiÃ±o said : "" We regret to inform you that in our embassy in London we have found a hidden microphone .
I did n't report this at the time because we did n't want the theme of our visit to London to be confused with this matter .
Furthermore , we first wanted to ascertain with precision what could be the origin of this interception device in the office of our ambassador . ""
He described the discovery of the device as "" another instance of a loss of ethics at the international level in relations between governments "" .
PatiÃ±o was in the UK last month to talk to Assange , who was granted asylum by Ecuador to prevent him being extradited to Sweden , where he has been accused of sexual assault and rape .
He denies the allegations , and claims that if he went to Sweden , he could be extradited from there to the US to face potential charges over the release of thousands of confidential US documents on the WikiLeaks website .
During his visit , PatiÃ±o met the foreign secretary William Hague , and denounced Assange 's captivity as "" totally unjust "" .
The affair has strained the relationship between Ecuador and the UK , and infuriated Washington , which was embarrassed by the mass disclosure of diplomatic cables and correspondence provided to Wikileaks by Bradley Manning .
Though the discovery of a bug in the Ecuadorean embassy could prove awkward for the UK , there is nothing illegal about so - called "" intrusive surveillance "" .
There are provisions in the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act ( RIPA ) for the police and intelligence agencies to bug buildings or cars .
MI5 and MI6 can also break into buildings to place surveillance devices under powers provided by the Intelligence Services Act .
To obtain ministerial approval , the agencies have to show that there is a requirement to place the device .
The broad and ill - defined categories include protecting national security , preventing or detecting crime and safeguarding the economic wellbeing of the UK.In a speech today , the security minister , James Brokenshire , dismissed concerns about the extent of UK surveillance .
"" Anyone reading the papers over the past year could be forgiven for thinking that the main threat to our freedoms in fact comes from those working so hard to protect the public across a range of national security issues .
I know that this is n't true .
You know that this is n't true .
And most of the people in this country know that this is n't true .
But it is right that we should be challenged and that we should challenge ourselves . """
2013-07-10,"The cost of maintaining a round - the - clock guard outside the Ecuadorian embassy to prevent the escape of Wikileaks founder Julian Assange has risen to Â£3.8 m , the Metropolitan police have revealed .
The amount , which covers the period between June 2012 and the end of May 2013 , was disclosed in response to a letter to London assembly member Jenny Jones , who said the constant police presence outside the embassy in Knightsbridge , west London , was stretching resources , describing it as ridiculous .
The Metropolitan police commissioner , Sir Bernard Hogan - Howe , said in his reply to Jones that Â£0.7 m of the total represented additional costs incurred as a result of increased overtime payments .
He also said that the Met had not yet formally sought reimbursement from the Home Office for the costs but that they were now in early discussions concerning the matter .
Green party member Jones said : "" It 's ridiculous that for over a year now the Metropolitan police service have been stationed outside the Ecuadorean embassy waiting for Julian Assange to attempt an escape .
At a time when the Met is making cuts how can this be a priority for the police ?
This situation can not be allowed to continue indefinitely .
The mayor really should be trying to find a solution to this stalemate because in the meantime the Met is spending time and resources on an expensive stakeout . ""
Assange walked into the embassy on 19 June last year in an attempt to avoid extradition to Sweden to face sex assault and rape accusations , which he denies .
In August last year , Ecuador granted him political asylum but the police are stationed outside the building to arrest him if he leaves the building .
The foreign secretary , William Hague , and his Ecuadorean opposite number , Ricardo PatiÃ±o , met last month to discuss the ongoing diplomatic stalemate , but were unable to reach agreement .
Assange subsequently said he would not leave the embassy even if Sweden drops its extradition bid , because he fears moves are already underway by the US to prosecute him on espionage charges ."
2013-07-10,"( updated below - Update II )
On Monday night - roughly 36 hours ago from this moment - the Washington Post published an article by its long - time reporter Walter Pincus .
The article concocted a frenzied and inane conspiracy theory : that it was WikiLeaks and Julian Assange , working in secret with myself and Laura Poitras , who masterminded the Snowden leaks ahead of time and directed Snowden 's behavior , and then Assange , rather than have WikiLeaks publish the documents itself , generously directed them to the Guardian .
To peddle this tale , Pincus , in lieu of any evidence , spouted all sorts of accusatory innuendo masquerading as questions ( "" Did Edward Snowden decide on his own to seek out journalists and then a job at Booz Allen Hamilton 's Hawaii facility ? "" - "" Did Assange and WikiLeaks personnel help or direct Snowden to those journalists ? "" - "" Was he encouraged or directed by WikiLeaks personnel or others to take the job as part of a broader plan to expose NSA operations to selected journalists ? "" ) and invoked classic guilt - by association techniques ( "" Poitras and Greenwald are well - known free - speech activists , with many prior connections , including as founding members in December of the nonprofit Freedom of the Press Foundation "" - "" Poitras and Greenwald have had close connections with Assange and WikiLeaks "" ) .
Apparently , the Washington Post has decided to weigh in on the ongoing debate over "" what is journalism ? "" with this answer : you fill up articles on topics you do n't know the first thing about with nothing but idle speculation , rank innuendo , and evidence - free accusations , all under the guise of "" just asking questions "" .
You then strongly imply that other journalists who have actually broken a big story are involved in a rampant criminal conspiracy without bothering even to ask them about it first , all while hiding from your readers the fact that they have repeatedly and in great detail addressed the very "" questions "" you 're posing .
But shoddy journalism from the Washington Post is far too common to be worth noting .
What was far worse was that Pincus ' wild conspiracy theorizing was accomplished only by asserting blatant , easily demonstrated falsehoods .
As I documented in an email I sent to Pincus early yesterday morning - one that I instantly posted online and then publicized on Twitter - the article contains three glaring factual errors : 1 ) Pincus stated that I wrote an article about Poitras "" for the WikiLeaks Press 's blog "" ( I never wrote anything for that blog in my life ; the article he referenced was written for Salon ) ; 2 ) Pincus claimed Assange "" previewed "" my first NSA scoop in a Democracy
Now interview a week earlier by referencing the bulk collection of telephone calls ( Assange was expressly talking about a widely reported Bush program from 8 years earlier , not the FISA court order under Obama I reported ) ; 3 ) Pincus strongly implied that Snowden had worked for the NSA for less than 3 months by the time he showed up in Hong Kong with thousands of documents when , in fact , he had worked at the NSA continuously for 4 years .
See the email I sent Pincus for the conclusive evidence of those factual falsehoods and the other distortions peddled by the Post .
There is zero possibility that the Washington Post was unaware of my email to Pincus early yesterday .
Not only was it re - tweeted and discussed by numerous prominent journalists on Twitter , but it was also quickly written about in venues such as Politico and Poynter .
Nonetheless , the Post allowed the falsehoods to stand uncorrected all day .
Finally , at 3:11 pm ET yesterday afternoon - 15 hours ago as of this moment , and more than 8 hours after I first publicized his errors - Pincus emailed me back to acknowledge that his claim about my having written for the WikiLeaks blog was false , and vowed that a correction would be published ( he did not address the other errors ) :
While it was nice that he finally acknowledged this one falsehood , there was a problem with Pincus ' email to me : it , too , was false .
The excuse Pincus offered for his error did not happen .
The WikiLeaks Press Blog did not , contrary to his claim , carry my April 10 article , nor did it do so "" without attribution to Salon as the originating venue "" .
The blog - as countless websites around the internet do every day - simply excerpted several paragraphs of that article and then , right at the bottom , provided a link to the full article at Salon .
After he sent that email , someone apparently gave Pincus a tutorial on how this new invention called "" The Internet "" works , because , 30 minutes later , he sent me another email correcting the error in his first email : I had no intention of writing about any of this here , and would n't even have bothered doing so this morning if not for one fact : 36 hours after the Post published these falsehoods , 24 hours after I publicized them , and 15 hours after the author of this article acknowledged one of those errors and vowed a correction , the Post article still sits on the internet :
uncorrected .
What kind of newspaper would allow claims they know to be false to remain uncorrected for 15 hours ?
How many tens of thousands of people went to the Post website all day yesterday and read Pincus ' sleazy innuendo about my "" close connections "" to WikiLeaks when the primary , if not only , "" fact "" offered in support of that
( that I wrote for the WikiLeaks blog ) is one that Pincus himself acknowledges is completely false ?
At least at one point yesterday , the Pincus article was the third - most - read article on the entire Post website .
What makes this even worse is that after I checked the Post article last night and saw that it was still uncorrected , I went to Twitter at 10:28 pm ET and wrote this
: The paper 's official "" corrections and clarifications "" policy states that "" the Washington Post always seeks to publish corrections and clarifications promptly after they come to our attention .
"" When corrections are to be made to articles published online , "" the change should be made within the article and the correction should also be noted at the top of the item .
"" The lengths to which some media outlets in this case have gone to assist the US government in trying to criminalize the journalism we 've done has been remarkably revealing .
But the willingness of the Post to aid in this effort by spewing falsehood - based innuendo , which they then permit to remain hour after hour even while knowing it 's false , is a reminder of how ill - advised it is to trust what you read in that establishment venue , and is a vibrant illustration of the reasons such organizations are held in such low esteem .
UPDATE
The Washington Post 's Erik Wemple spoke to Pincus about all of this , and Pincus ' comments have to be read to be believed .
He says a correction "" is in the works .
"" Wemple 's analysis of his Post colleague 's journalistic practices is , by itself , well worth reading .
UPDATE II
The Washington Post , roughly 48 hours after publication of the original article , just posted a lengthy , multi - point correction at the top of Pincus ' article : "" CORRECTION :
This Fine Print column ( also published in the July 9 A - section print edition of The Washington Post ) incorrectly said that an article by journalist Glenn Greenwald was written for the WikiLeaks Press blog .
The article , about filmmaker Laura Poitras and WikiLeaks being targeted by U.S. officials , was written for the online publication Salon and first appeared April 8 , 2012 .
Its appearance on the WikiLeaks Press blog two days later was a reposting . ""
The Fine Print column also asserted that WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange , during a May 29 interview with Democracy Now , ' previewed ' the story that Greenwald wrote for the Guardian newspaper about the Obama administration 's involvement in the collection of Americans ' phone records .
There is no evidence that Assange had advance knowledge of the story ; the assertion was based on a previously published interview in which Assange discussed an earlier surveillance project involving the collection of phone records .
""
The column also did not mention Snowden 's past work in the intelligence community .
The lack of this context may have created the impression that Snowden 's work for Booz Allen Hamilton gave him his first access to classified surveillance programs .
"" That 's a thorough correction : better late than never ."
2013-07-11,"Alex Gibney 's film about WikiLeaks , Julian Assange and Bradley Manning is a thorough and decently intentioned work , though it accepts a little too glibly the more - in - sorrow - than - in - anger line against Assange : that he is a fascinating radical who simply became a paranoid authoritarian .
Gibney concludes by saying that Private Manning is the real whistleblowing hero by leaking the documents â€ “ and he is , but Assange put the facts in the public domain in a way conventional media never could , and like Manning , he faced extraordinary pressures from which conventional journalists are shielded .
Both men are troubled , but it is probably only such temperamental outsiders who will do what they did .
Without them , we would not know that civilian casualties in Iraq and Afghanistan are much higher than the authorities pretended , nor of the dysfunctional US relationship with aid - recipient and drone - target Pakistan .
In creating an anonymous "" dropbox "" for the WikiLeaks site , so that he could not name his informant even he wanted to , Assange himself became both journalist and source , creating a unique mental ordeal that might make anyone difficult to deal with ."

2013-07-17,"It has been condemned by Julian Assange himself as a "" massive propaganda attack on WikiLeaks and the character of my staff "" , yet the first trailer for The Fifth Estate suggests an even - handed political thriller which sits halfway between indictment and eulogy .
Featuring Britain 's Benedict Cumberbatch as a floppy - fringed , youthful Assange with the air of an Aussie Bond villain , Bill Condon 's film also stars Goodbye Lenin 's Daniel Bruhl as former WikiLeaks spokesman Daniel Domscheit - Berg .
It has been adapted by The West Wing 's Josh Singer from Domscheit - Berg 's book Inside WikiLeaks : My Time with Julian Assange at the World 's Most Dangerous Website , as well as Guardian writers David Leigh and Luke Harding 's WikiLeaks : Inside Julian Assange 's War on Secrecy .
The trailer offers up a blitzkrieg of snapshots from Assange 's path out of obscurity , yet seems to oscillate between celebrating its subject 's bravery and condemning his narcissism .
One confidant tells him : "" If we 'd had someone like you , the Berlin wall would have come down years before . ""
On the other hand , Domscheit - Berg screams : "" It 's just you and your ego - and the lies you tell to get whatever you want ! ""
Scenes of horrified US politicians and aides ( Anthony Mackie , Laura Linney ) are contrasted with a shadowy shot of Assange seducing a paramour .
The official synopsis from producing studio Dreamworks reads : "" Through the eyes of Daniel Domscheit - Berg ( Daniel Bruhl ) , an early supporter and eventual colleague of Julian Assange ( Benedict Cumberbatch ) , the film follows the heady , early days of WikiLeaks to its abrupt end after a series of controversial and history changing info leaks . ""
"" The website 's overnight success brought instant fame to its principal architects , but as their power expanded across the globe , Daniel grew increasingly disillusioned with Julian 's questionable tactics and ethics .
The rift between the two friends became irreparable and their ideological differences tore them apart , but not before they revolutionised , for better and worse , the flow of information to news media and the world at large . ""
The Fifth Estate is being primed for an October release in the US , timing that suggests an Oscars run in 2014 .
It is being compared to The Social Network , another awards season favourite by a West Wing writer about a controversial figure , which won Aaron Sorkin the Oscar for best screenplay .
The film will also be released in the UK this year but does not yet have a release date in Assange 's native Australia ."
2013-07-25,"Of all the venues in which Julian Assange might have dreamed of launching his political career , itâ€ ™ s safe to say a library in an inner - city Melbourne suburb via a capricious Skype connection
probably wouldnâ€ ™ t have been top of the list .
But it was the homely surrounds of Fitzroy Library where the WikiLeaks party unveiled its candidates , and its abridged policy platform , on Thursday for the upcoming Australian federal Senate election .
Four of the candidates â€ “ standing in Victoria , NSW and WA â€ “ were physically present .
But even before he appeared on a screen behind them , the spectre of Assange loomed over this unusual political launch .
WikiLeaks party operatives vainly attempted to nudge the focus onto the other candidates , but this was always about Assange .
Finally , Wizard of Oz - like , the sense of theatre melted away as he appeared on screen .
Assange was wagging his finger and laughing to someone off - screen , a sprightly presence given it was 3 am in London , where he has been holed up inside the Ecuadorian embassy for the past two years .
The WikiLeaks founder , who is wanted for questioning in Sweden over allegations of sexual assault , is standing for the Senate seat representing Victoria .
The last time Assange was in Australia , the Labor party leader , Kevin Rudd , was in his first stint as prime minister .
However , the ongoing diplomatic impasse over his situation means that should voters flock to Assange , they could well get author and medical ethicist Leslie Cannold , the No 2 on the Victorian WikiLeaks ticket , in his stead .
Assange waved away suggestions that this odd scenario is â€ “ ironically for a party with â€œtransparency , accountability ,
justiceâ€ � as its catch - cry â€ “ a sleight of hand .
â€œHopefully , the situation with the US and UK will have resolved by the time I would have to take up the seat in July , â€ � said the grainy figure of Assange , a giant WikiLeaks graphic fidgeting next to his head .
â€œIf not , the Senate is able to give a grace period of a couple of months and then another candidate is able to take my place .
People know who they are voting for and thereâ€ ™ s no problem in terms of losing the seat.â€ �
Assange said there had been a â€œgradual decline in Australian democracyâ€ � , politicians too remote from their constituentsâ€ ™ needs and guilty of â€œsecret , back - door dealsâ€ � with big business and US interests .
He also bemoaned a lack of media diversity that stymies political debate .
The WikiLeaks party , Assange said , â€œhas at its core a union of people who give a damn , but also candidates who are highly educated and can dissect how the government works .
In effect , they will bring investigative journalism to the heart of the Australian Senate and bring the government to account.â€ �
On the day the Coalition announced a military - led response to the vexed issue of asylum seekers , Assange , perhaps the worldâ€ ™ s most famous political refugee , conjured up the intriguing scenario of NSA whistle - blower Edward Snowden escaping to Sydney via boat , only for Tony Abbott to launch a search for him , â€œlike the Hunt for Red Octoberâ€
� .
â€œItâ€ ™ s absurd , â€ � he said .
â€œTony Abbott knows nothing of asylum seeker policy .
[ The ] Australian military defends the sovereignty of Australia , itâ€ ™ s not a plaything for re - enacting fantasy movies for purposes of election campaigns.â€
�
Two other candidates â€ “
Kellie Tranter and Gerry Georgatos â€ “ outlined further policy on climate change and asylum seekers , respectively .
WikiLeaks wants â€œfull disclosureâ€ � over the governmentâ€ ™ s refugee deal with PNG , including host arrangements , health provisions and the conditions of resettlement .
The processing of refugees should take no longer than 45 days , according to Georgatos .
Tranter was a little more vague on specific climate change policy , but said the party was committed to reducing emissions , while warning that Australia should not repeat the mistakes of the European emissions trading scheme .
So what are the electoral prospects for the WikiLeaks party ?
ABC election guru Antony Green has said Assange , the main hope of a Senate spot , has â€œnext to no chanceâ€ � of achieving this goal .
However , the party points to polling in April that showed that 26 % of voters were minded to back its candidates , with support strongest in NSW and Victoria , and among those aged under 30 .
Party strategists concede privately that while votes are most likely to flow from supporters of the Greens , led by Christine Milne , Wikileaks will have to distance itself from the party in order to secure support .
Negotiations are underway with other minor parties over preference deals , and WikiLeaks is keen to preference the major parties last .
As one party figure pointed out , the measure of Senate success is variable â€ “ Steve Fielding was elected in 2004 after his Family First party achieved just 1.9 % of the vote in Victoria .
â€œThese people ( WikiLeaks candidates ) arenâ€ ™ t political people , â€ � said Assange , shortly before the live feed from London became garbled and finally died .
â€œThey are academics .
They are the people we need to keep the bastards honest.â€ �
To add to its day of technological problems , with WikiLeaks party website was down for a lengthy period following the launch due to what it called a â€œdirect denial of service attackâ€ � ."

2013-08-13,"Julian Assange 's WikiLeaks party is investigating ways to harness international backers and mobilise support in the lead - up to the Australian election .
The party is running seven candidates in the election , including Assange , who remains in the Ecuadorean embassy in London .
A spokeswoman , Sam Castro , said while the party 's key obligation was to its Australian members , it was looking at creating a "" supporter class "" for people outside Australia . ""
Australian people do n't realise how much interest there is in this election , "" she said .
"" As soon as we set up the party , we had people from Greece , India , Iceland , South Africa , Brazil , Germany â€ “ just about everywhere

and we want to do the same in our countries . ""
[ The WikiLeaks movement ] did n't happen in a cultural vacuum â€ “
it is about transparency and justice .
There is generational change taking place .
People are searching for a new body politic . ""
WikiLeaks launched its Senate campaign in July .
It will be run by the barrister Greg Barns , a former Liberal staffer who ran the Australian Republican Movement 's referendum campaign in 1999 .
Assange is leading the ticket in Victoria , with the ethicist Leslie Cannold and the academic Binoy Kampmark .
The human rights lawyer Kellie Trantor and the former diplomat Alison Broinowski are running in NSW and the journalist Gerry Georgatos and the economist Suresh Rajan in Western Australia .
WikiLeaks has a fundraising target of $ 700,000 for the election but the party has only attracted $ 49,000 so far .
The former banker , philanthropist and animal activist Philip Wollen has provided it with a Melbourne campaign headquarters .
Membership costs $ 20 ; so far the party has attracted about 2,000 members .
Assange gave an address at the campaign launch and continues to hold forums over Skype connections .
He speaks to WikiLeaks staff daily .
He sought asylum from Ecuador to avoid the risk of extradition to the US from Sweden , where he is wanted for questioning about alleged sexual offences ."
2013-08-18,"Julian Assange 's WikiLeaks party has blamed an "" administrative error "" for its preferences going to rightwing parties including Australia First and the Shooters and Fishers ahead of the Greens on its New South Wales Senate ticket .
Amid a storm of criticism on Twitter , the WikiLeaks party released a statement on Sunday that said it was not aligned with any other political group and would prefer not to allocate preferences at all . ""
In allocating preferences between 53 other parties or groups in NSW some administrative errors occurred , as has been the case with some other parties , "" the WikiLeaks statement said .
"" The overall decision as to preferences was a democratically made decision of the full national council of the party .

2013-08-19,"The Western Australian Greens senator Scott Ludlam described the WikiLeaks party 's decision to preference the Greens below the Nationals as "" extraordinarily disappointing "" but said he did not regret supporting Julian Assange .
The WikiLeaks decision means Ludlam will face a battle to keep his spot in the Senate , particularly given the National party is his main competition .
The WA WikiLeaks Senate candidate Gerry Georgatos said on Twitter that Ludlam had WikiLeaks ' "" effective "" first preference .
Ludlam said : "" What it shows is that WikiLeaks effectively does n't understand preferential voting . ""
This decision could really impact on WikiLeaks ' primary vote .
But I do n't regret speaking out .
Bradley Manning is still in a cage , Edward Snowden is still on the run and Julian Assange is still in a broom closet .
"" The WikiLeaks decision comes less than a week after the opposition leader , Tony Abbott , announced he would place the Greens behind Labor , making it difficult for the Greens ' only representative in the lower house , the member for Melbourne , Adam Bandt , to retain his seat .
The Greens v WikiLeaks battle is just one of a number of preference fights between minor and micro parties in the Senate , which may see One Nation 's Pauline Hanson back in the federal parliament , boosted by flows from rightwing parties .
Hanson is a rightwing populist politician who exploded onto the political scene in 1996 after she was disendorsed by the Liberal party for making racist comments .
She went on to lead the One Nation party .
Ludlam called for reforms that would allow optional preferential voting , where voters could nominate their preferences above the line .
The current system means if voters want to nominate their own preferences , rather than the preferences of their party , they have to number every Senate candidate .
In New South Wales , for example , this means numbering more than 100 candidates .
WikiLeaks , whose No 1 Senate candidate is Julian Assange , blamed an administrative error "" for its preferences going to Australia First and the Shooters and Fishers before the Greens on its NSW Senate ticket .
Amid criticism on Twitter , the party released a statement on Sunday that said it was not aligned with any other political group and would prefer not to allocate preferences at all . ""

The Shooters and Fishers party is running on a platform to increase access to public land and waters for recreational shooters and fishers , as well as reduce Australia 's foreign aid budget .
But a prominent Greens member claims he was told a week ago that WikiLeaks would place rightwing parties above the Greens in Senate preferences , rejecting the party 's explanation that the decision was an "" administrative error "" .
Max Phillips , a media adviser to the NSW Greens MLC Jeremy Buckingham , said a WikiLeaks representative had told him WikiLeaks would preference micro parties before the Greens .
Phillips had a conversation with the representative at community markets in the Sydney suburb of Marrickville . ""
They said they would preference micro parties and would be put the major parties last , "" he said .
"" I asked about the Greens and she said WikiLeaks would put them last .
"" I said to her , ' You would put right wing parties ahead of the Greens ? '

2013-08-21,"The WikiLeaks party 's number two Victoria Senate candidate , Leslie Cannold , has resigned amid a storm over the party 's preferences , which favoured rightwing extremists ahead of the Greens .
Cannold 's decision came as Julian Assange 's party declared it would issue a how - to - vote card to its supporters to override the lodged preferences .
The party also announced an independent review into the communications and decision - making process around preferences , though it has claimed it was an "" administrative error "" .
Cannold said she discovered the review , promised immediately , would be delayed until after the election and would not be independent .
She said it reflected problems with the "" capacity of the party "" .
"" This is the final straw , "" Cannold said .
"" As long as I believed there was a chance that democracy , transparency and accountability could prevail in the party I was willing to stay on and fight for it . ""
But where a party member makes a bid to subvert the party 's own processes , asking others to join in a secret , alternative power centre that subverts the properly constituted one , nothing makes sense any more .
This is an unacceptable mode of operation for any organisation but even more so for an organisation explicitly committed to democracy , transparency and accountability . ""
Even if I stop campaigning this minute , remaining in my role implicitly invites voters to trust the WikiLeaks party .
By staying in this role I am implicitly vouching for the worthiness of this party to receive the votes of the Australian people .
I can no longer do this because I no longer believe it is true , and so I must resign . ""
Earlier in the day , WikiLeaks had promised a how - to - vote card but for for it to take effect , it would require WikiLeaks voters to number every box below the line .
WikiLeaks released part of an email on Wednesday to try to stem the damage of the preference storm , which broke at the weekend after the close of lodgement of party preferences with the Australian Electoral Commission .
WikiLeaks said it was in discussions with the Australian Electoral Commission ( AEC ) over the preferences .
However , an AEC spokesman , Phil Diak , said the commission was bound by the deadline .
"" The deadline for lodgement group voting tickets was Saturday midday , 17 August and that is a legislated deadline so AEC has published and lodged group voting tickets . ""
Diak said once the deadline passes , "" the basis for the preferences are allocated "" .
The WikiLeaks party ( WLP ) email suggests in New South Wales the party placed the Greens above Family First , Shooters and Fishers and and Christian Right .
In Western Australia , the email says : "" WLP puts Greens first of major parties and above Christian Right and Shooters . ""
But the group voting ticket actually lodged had preferences going to parties including the rightwing nationalist Australia First and the Shooters and Fishers ahead of the Greens on its NSW Senate ticket .
In WA , WikiLeaks placed Senator Scott Ludlam , who has been a vocal supporter of Assange , Bradley Manning and Edward Snowden , below the National party .
Julian 's mother , Christine Assange , tweeted :
In the statement , Julian Assange said : "" We are a new party , comprised of hard - working people donating their time , not career politicians .
However this is no excuse .
We can and will do better . ""
The statement added : "" If necessary , the party will ... issue instructions to its members and supporters in the states concerned , on how to vote below the line . ""
Due to the low vote of the parties concerned , the chance that the errors could have an effect on Senate make - up is remote , even without modification . ""
Ludlam said he had spoken at many forums with Christine Assange and appreciated her support .
He said the independent review into the WikiLeaks preferences and the how - to - vote cards was "" better than nothing "" , even though many found it onerous to fill out every box on the Senate paper ."

2013-08-27,"Perhaps understandably , reaction to Julian Assange 's recent appearance in a spoof video filmed partly at the Ecuadorian embassy in London , where he has been holed up for more than a year , has focused mainly on the terrible blond mullet wig the WikiLeaks founder and free - speech warrior dons to lip - sync a rehash of the 1980s John Farnham soft - rock hit
You 're the Voice ( sample lyrics
: "" We have the chance to turn the pages over./ We can write what we want to write./
We got ta make things leak/ so we can get much bolder â€ ¦ "" )
But the video â€ “ which also features eye - wateringly crude caricatures of leading Australian politicians Tony Abbott , Kevin Rudd and Julia
Gillard â€ “ is part of the campaign for a perfectly serious Senate run by Assange 's WikiLeaks party , which is fielding six candidates , including Assange , in Australia 's 7 September federal elections .
So what do they stand for , and how might they fare ?
According to its website , the WikiLeaks party believes that "" truthful , accurate and factual information are [ sic ] the foundations of life and democracy "" .
Quite how that will translate into concrete policies on , for example , the economy , is harder to say ; the party promises only that its positions will always be driven by its "" core values and guided by our objectives : the free flow of information and transparency to achieve true accountability "" .
Assange , who has been granted asylum by Ecuador but refused safe passage by the UK government , which wants him extradited to Sweden to answer questions about alleged sexual assault , is running in Victoria .
The party says he satisfies all relevant electoral criteria , and that if he is elected but unable to take up his seat â€ “ he fears that if he does go to Sweden he will end up in the US , facing espionage charges â€ “ the vacancy will be filled by a party nominee .
Some polls have suggested support for his party might be as high as 26 % .
Many doubt it is that high , but some also point out it does n't have to be : in the 2010 federal election , a Democratic Liberal party candidate ended up in the Senate with just 2.3 % of the primary vote .
Assange could easily do better than that , prompting one commentator to observe that the WikiLeaks party "" might well end up holding the balance of power "" between a resurgent centre - right Coalition , Labor and the Greens .
Perhaps we should n't be sniggering at Assange 's hair - do ."
2013-08-27,"A controversial asylum seeker , a Latin American embassy and a daring escape from the authorities .
The ingredients of the diplomatic drama that has just forced the resignation of Brazilian foreign minister Antonio Patriota may sound familiar , even appealing , to NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden and WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange .
But the repercussions are now shaking two of South America 's staunchest allies .
Brazil and Bolivia are at odds over the flight of Roger Pinto , a Bolivian senator who had for 452 days been seeking asylum at the Brazilian embassy in La Paz .
Like Assange at the Ecuadorean embassy in London and Snowden at Moscow airport , the opposition politician was stuck in diplomatic limbo while governments wrangled over his fate .
Although Brazil offered temporary refuge , Bolivia refused safe passage across its borders , saying Pinto had to face accusations of corruption and 13 other criminal charges .
But Pinto escaped this weekend in a 22-hour dash to the border in the car of a sympathetic Brazilian official , who used his diplomatic immunity to protect him .
That diplomat , Eduardo Saboia , said he was moved to take action because Pinto had grown dangerously depressed as a result of his near-15-month confinement in a small room in the embassy .
"" I took the decision to conduct this operation , because there was an imminent risk to life and dignity of senator , "" he told local media .
The intervention has prompted an angry response by Bolivian officials , who accused Brazil of violating international agreements .
The Brazilian government claims it had no prior knowledge of the escape , which it described to local media as a "" disaster "" .
An inquiry has been launched and heads have started to roll .
After a 50-minute meeting with President Dilma Rousseff , Patriota took responsibility by standing down as foreign minister on Monday .
He will swap jobs with Luiz Alberto Figueiredo , a veteran diplomat and climate negotiator who is the head of Brazil 's UN mission in Washington .
The foreign ministry had reportedly decided in June not to arrange asylum unless the Bolivian government promised safe passage .
Now , faced with an apparent fait accompli , Brazil said it would not extradite Pinto , who claims he is victim of political persecution because he accused Bolivian president Evo Morales of links to drug cartels .
How many people were involved in the escape remains unclear .
The chairman of Brazil 's senate foreign relations committee reportedly met Pinto at the border on Sunday morning and flew with him on a private jet to Brasilia .
In a two - page letter released after his arrival , Pinto thanked Rousseff for granting asylum and the Brazilian ambassador in La Paz , Marcel Biato , for "" protecting me and giving me security and shelter "" .
But he expressed the most appreciation to Saboia , whom he described as a "" brave and intelligent man "" who knew the risk he was exposing himself to .
Foreign ministry officials are now interviewing Saboia and are expected to announced punitive measures ."
2013-08-30,"Julian Assange has been told to stop using the Ecuadorean embassy in London to poke fun at Australian politicians as part of his Senate election bid , it has been reported .
The South American nation 's president , Rafael Correa , chastised Assange after a video appeared online in which the WikiLeaks founder â€ “ along with Juice Rap News â€
“ ridiculed Tony Abbott , Kevin Rudd and Julia Gillard .
"" We have sent him a letter : he can campaign politically , but without making fun of Australian politicians .
We are not going to allow that , "" said Correa , who is attending a South American summit in the Surinamese capital Paramaribo .
Assange appeared wearing a comedy wig and bandanna emblazoned with the Australian flag in the video .
He also performed a cover version of John Farnham 's
You 're the Voice .
He is one of six WikiLeaks party candidates running for election .
The party 's chances at the ballot box were hit when Assange 's running mate in Victoria , Leslie Cannold , resigned .
She was followed out of the door by six other members .
Tensions between Assange and his Ecuadorean hosts were heightened during the Snowden affair , with diplomats saying that they felt that the WikiLeaks founder was trying to steal the limelight .
According to Agence France - Presse , Correa said : "" The rules of asylum in principle forbid meddling in the politics of the country that grants asylum .
But as a matter of courtesy , we are not going to bar Julian Assange from exercising his right to be a candidate .
Just so long as he does n't make fun of Australian politicians or people . ""
Assange took refuge in the Ecuadorean embassy in London in June 2012 to avoid extradition to Sweden , where he is wanted for questioning about sexual assault allegations .
He fears Sweden would extradite him to the United States , where he believes he is wanted in relation to WikiLeaks ' disclosure of a huge trove of classified US military and diplomatic documents .
Chelsea Manning , the US army private who leaked the documents to Assange 's organisation , was sentenced to 35 years in prison by a US military court on 21 August .

2013-09-03,"We all remember President Obama 's smiling face , full of hope and trust , in his first campaign : "" Yes , we can ! ""
â€ “ we can get rid of the cynicism of the Bush era and bring justice and welfare to the American people .
Now that the US continues its covert operations and expands its intelligence network , spying even on its allies , we can imagine protesters shouting at Obama : "" How can you use drones for killing ?
How can you spy even on our allies ?
"" Obama murmurs with a mockingly evil smile : "" Yes , we can . ""
But simple personalisation misses the point : the threat to freedom disclosed by whistleblowers has deeper , systemic roots .
Edward Snowden should be defended not only because his acts annoyed and embarrassed US secret services ; what he revealed is something that not only the US but also all great ( and not so great ) powers â€ “ from China to Russia , Germany to Israel â€ “ are doing ( to the extent they are technologically able to do it ) .
His acts provided a factual foundation to our suspicions of being monitored and controlled â€ “ their lesson is global , reaching far beyond the standard US - bashing .
We did n't really learn from Snowden ( or Manning ) anything we did n't already presume to be true .
But it is one thing to know it in general , another to get concrete data .
It is a little like knowing that one 's sexual partner is playing around â€ “ one can accept the abstract knowledge , but pain arises when one gets the steamy details , pictures of what they were doing â€ ¦ Back in 1843 , the young Karl Marx claimed that the German ancien regime "" only imagines that it believes in itself and demands that the world should imagine the same thing "" .
In such a situation , to put shame on those in power becomes a weapon .
Or , as Marx goes on : "" The actual pressure must be made more pressing by adding to it consciousness of pressure , the shame must be made more shameful by publicising it .
"" This , exactly , is our situation today : we are facing the shameless cynicism of the representatives of the existing global order , who only imagine that they believe in their ideas of democracy , human rights etc .
What happens in WikiLeaks disclosures is that the shame â€ “ theirs , and ours for tolerating such power over us â€ “ is made more shameful by publicising it .
What we should be ashamed of is the worldwide process of the gradual narrowing of the space for what Kant called the "" public use of reason "" .
In his classic text , What Is Enlightenment ? ,
Kant contrasts "" public "" and "" private "" use of reason â€ “ "" private "" is for Kant the communal - institutional order in which we dwell ( our state , our nation â€ ¦ ) , while "" public "" is the transnational universality of the exercise of one 's reason : "" The public use of one 's reason must always be free , and it alone can bring about enlightenment among men .
The private use of one 's reason , on the other hand , may often be very narrowly restricted without particularly hindering the progress of enlightenment .
By public use of one 's reason I understand the use that a person makes of it as a scholar before the reading public .
Private use
I call that which one may make of it in a particular civil post or office which is entrusted to him .
"" We see where Kant parts with our liberal common sense : the domain of state is "" private "" constrained by particular interests , while individuals reflecting on general issues use reason in a "" public "" way .
This Kantian distinction is especially pertinent with internet and other new media torn between their free "" public use "" and their growing "" private "" control .
In our era of cloud computing , we no longer need strong individual computers : software and information are provided on demand ; users can access web - based tools or applications through browsers .
This wonderful new world is , however , only one side of the story .
Users are accessing programs and software files that are kept far away in climate - controlled rooms with thousands of computers â€ “ or , to quote a propaganda - text on cloud computing : "" Details are abstracted from consumers , who no longer have need for expertise in , or control over , the technology infrastructure ' in the cloud ' that supports them . ""
Here are two telltale words : abstraction and control .
To manage a cloud there needs to be a monitoring system that controls its functioning , and this system is by definition hidden from users .
The more the small item ( smartphone )
I hold in my hand is personalised , easy to use , "" transparent "" in its functioning , the more the entire setup has to rely on the work being done elsewhere , in a vast circuit of machines that co - ordinate the user 's experience .
The more our experience is non - alienated , spontaneous , transparent , the more it is regulated by the invisible network controlled by state agencies and large private companies that follow their secret agendas .
Once we choose to follow the path of state secrets , we sooner or later reach the fateful point at which the legal regulations prescribing what is secret become secret .
Kant formulated the basic axiom of the public law : "" All actions relating to the right of other men are unjust if their maxim is not consistent with publicity . ""
A secret law , a law unknown to its subjects , legitimises the arbitrary despotism of those who exercise it , as indicated in the title of a recent report on China : "" Even what 's secret is a secret in China . ""
Troublesome intellectuals who report on political oppression , ecological catastrophes , rural poverty etc , got years in prison for betraying a state secret , and the catch was that many of the laws and regulations that made up the state - secret regime were themselves classified , making it difficult for individuals to know how and when they are in violation .
What makes the all - encompassing control of our lives so dangerous is not that we lose our privacy , that all our intimate secrets are exposed to Big Brother .
There is no state agency able to exert such control â€ “ not because they do n't know enough , but because they know too much .
The sheer size of data is too large , and in spite of all intricate programs for detecting suspicious messages , computers that register billions of data are too stupid to interpret and evaluate them properly , ridiculous mistakes where innocent bystanders are listed as potential terrorists occur necessarily â€ “
and this makes state control of communications even more dangerous .
Without knowing why , without doing anything illegal , we can all be listed as potential terrorists .
Recall the legendary answer of a Hearst newspaper editor to Hearst 's inquiry as to why he does n't want to take a long - deserved holiday : "" I am afraid that if I go , there will be chaos , everything will fall apart â€ “
but I am even more afraid to discover that if I go , things will just go on as normal without me , a proof that I am not really needed !
"" Something similar can be said about the state control of our communications : we should fear that we have no secrets , that secret state agencies know everything , but we should fear even more that they fail in this endeavour .
This is why whistleblowers play a crucial role in keeping the "" public reason "" alive .
Assange , Manning , Snowden , these are our new heroes , exemplary cases of the new ethics that befits our era of digitalised control .
They are no longer just whistleblowers who denounce the illegal practices of private companies to the public authorities ; they denounce these public authorities themselves when they engage in "" private use of reason "" .
We need Mannings and Snowdens in China , in Russia , everywhere .
There are states much more oppressive than the US â€ “ just imagine what would have happened to someone like Manning in a Russian or Chinese court ( in all probability no public trial ) .
However , one should not exaggerate the softness of the US : true , the US does n't treat prisoners as brutally as China or Russia â€ “ because of its technological priority , it simply does not need the brutal approach ( which it is more than ready to apply when needed ) .
In this sense , the US is even more dangerous than China insofar as its measures of control are not perceived as such , while Chinese brutality is openly displayed .
It is therefore not enough to play one state against the other ( like Snowden , who used Russia against the US ) : we need a new international network to organise the protection of whistleblowers and the dissemination of their message .
Whistleblowers are our heroes because they prove that if those in power can do it , we can also do it ."
2013-09-03,"WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange is to join the jury for this year 's Raindance film festival .
Raindance revealed the high - profile addition on Twitter .
Assange remains at the Ecuadorian embassy in London , where he has claimed political asylum since last summer in order to avoid extradition to Sweden , where he is wanted for questioning over rape and sexual assault allegations .
His lawyer has argued his client would not receive a fair trial , while Assange fears he could face onward extradition to the US in relation to WikiLeaks ' disclosure of a huge trove of classified US military and diplomatic documents .
Raindance , billed as Europe 's largest festival of independent film - making , will being screening Mediastan , a documentary produced by Assange .
Founder Elliot Grove said it was Assange 's experience in online journalism that attracted them to the idea of having him on the jury . ""
His work with Wikileaks is a textbook example of how to use social media - relevant not just for filmmakers grappling with this new distribution channel , but for the fact that he is highlighting important social and political issues , "" Grove said .
"" Raindance has never shied from important social issues , as a glance at our festival screenings in years past will confirm . ""
The festival has not revealed the logistics behind Assange 's involvement .
He could presumably receive screener DVDs and appear by video link if required , following in the footsteps of Iranian dissident film - maker Jafar Panahi , who used Skype to promote his latest film , Closed Curtain , at a July film festival in the Czech Republic .
Panahi is under house arrest after falling foul of authorities in Tehran .
Other members of this year 's Raindance jury include British actor Jason Flemyng , Portishead singer Beth Gibbons , and Telegraph film critic Robbie Collin .
The lineup also features actor Sean Brosnan , son of James Bond star Pierce , Chinese director Anthony Chen , Games Workshop founder Ian Livingstone , and fantasy author Robert Rankin .
The 21st Raindance film festival will run from 25 September to 6 October at a variety of venues in central London , screening 100 feature films and more than 150 short films .

I only wanted to help people . ""
In a covering letter to the pardon , Manning 's civilian lawyer David Coombs adds a harder note , criticising his client 's 35-year sentence as one that "" grossly exaggerates the seriousness of his conduct .
The sentence was disproportionate to both the offense and the offender .
It will undoubtedly have a chilling effect on future whistleblowers and damage the public 's perception of military justice .
"" Manning was last month acquitted of the most serious charge against him
â€ “ that he "" aided the enemy
"" â€ “ but convicted of 20 counts relating to the gigantic stash of state secrets she transmitted to WikiLeaks .
The files included hundreds of thousands of US diplomatic cables from embassies around the world , war logs from Afghanistan and Iraq and files on GuantÃ¡namo detainees .
Manning is beginning her sentence at Fort Leavenworth in Kansas where Coombs said she is doing well .
Shortly after she was sentenced , the lawyer revealed that she wanted to live as a woman and change her name from Bradley to Chelsea .
She is requesting hormone treatment in line with general medical care for people with gender dysphoria and has offered to pay for the drugs herself .
So far , her military captors have indicated they have no intention of facilitating such treatment .
According to Coombs , unless Manning 's request for a pardon is successful the earliest she could be paroled would be after 10 years .
The lawyer writes in his covering letter : "" We rely upon whistleblowers , even in those instances that might cause embarrassment , to keep our government accountable to its people .
Private Manning is a military whistleblower .
He disclosed documents that were vital for a healthy public debate about our conduct in Iraq and Afghanistan , our detention policies at GuantÃ¡namo , and our diplomatic activities around the world . ""
In the pardon request , Manning writes : "" I will serve my time knowing that sometimes you have to pay a heavy price to live in a free society .
I will gladly pay that price if it means we could have a country that is truly conceived in liberty and dedicated to the proposition that all women and men are created equal . """
2013-09-06,"Today Julian Assange is putting the final touches to an election campaign that has involved a lot of social media , a few virtual town hall meetings and a music video that required him to don a blonde mullet and lip - synch to a rewritten version of John Farnham 's great Australian activist anthem , You 're the Voice .
But will he make history tomorrow by winning a Victorian Senate seat from his campaign bunker in the Ecuadorian embassy in London ?
Assange is a "" wild card "" , according to poll - watcher William Bowe â€ “ who writes the Poll Bludger blog for Crikey â€ “ but he does have an outside chance of winning the sixth Senate spot , despite the strength of the Greens vote in Victoria . ""
Assange 's capacity to drain anti - establishment votes away from the Greens remains an imponderable that opinion polling is not well placed to measure , "" says Bowe .
"" And he could potentially draw preferences from the Sex party , the Pirate party , two drug law reform parties and , less intuitively , Family First . ""
But there 's no doubt that the WikiLeaks party 's recent preferencing scandal has put a dent in the party 's support base across the country .
Assange heads the Senate ticket in Victoria , but the party is also running candidates in New South Wales and Western Australia .
Lawyer and human rights activist Kellie Tranter , who leads the ticket in NSW , and WA 's lead candidate , researcher Gerry Georgatos , were both involved in a controversial last - minute decision to put right - wing parties ahead of the Greens on the WikiLeaks party 's Senate group voting tickets in those two states .
The decision , which was not endorsed by the party 's national council , was explained away as an "" administrative error "" â€ “ but insiders claim the process was deliberately thwarted .
The party 's second Victorian Senate candidate , ethicist Dr Leslie Cannold , accused members of the party leadership of undermining their own democratic process and resigned . ""
To keep being a candidate feels like I 'm breaking faith with the Australian people , "" she wrote in her resignation letter on 21 August . ""
By being in this role I am implicitly making a statement that the WikiLeaks party is what it claims to be : a democratically run party that both believes in transparency and accountability , and operates in this way
â€
¦ I am implicitly vouching for the worthiness of this party to receive the votes of the Australian people .
I can no longer do this because I no longer believe it is true . ""
Several key campaign staff followed Cannold 's lead , including Melbourne campaign staffer Sam Castro , who wrote on Facebook on 25 August : "" I will not be part of a group unable to walk the talk , as I do not wish to replicate a dying paradigm , the movement deserves better and we need a new body politic . ""
For a party running on a platform of "" truthfulness and the free flow of information "" , it was not a good look .
Assange blamed himself , saying he had overdelegated because he was "" trying to save the life of a young man "" â€ “ NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden .
Fairfax journalist Philip Dorling , who has close access to Assange , defended the preference decision this week , saying : "" Assange has been consistent in presenting himself as a libertarian and has repeatedly said that the WikiLeaks party was never intended to be a stalking horse delivering Senate preferences for the Greens . ""
But despite Assange 's insistence that his politics do not fit neatly into left or right brackets , it is clear that many of his Australian supporters have a bent towards social justice and identify with the political left .
The party 's preferencing of the Nationals ahead of the Greens in Western Australia â€ “ where Greens Senator Scott Ludlam , who has done more for Assange 's cause than any other Australian parliamentarian , is fighting for his seat â€ “ was seen as a gross betrayal .
In NSW , WikiLeaks put the Greens behind the quasi - fascist Australia First and the powerful Shooters and Fishers â€
“
no doubt hoping to capitalise on the latter party 's significant base in NSW , where they have used a balance of power in the NSW state parliament to campaign for policies such as shooting in national parks .
The Shooters and Fishers reportedly paid self - styled consultant Glenn Druery to negotiate a "" preference harvesting "" scheme with other minor parties .
If Assange wins a seat tomorrow he will have 10 months to secure passage to Australia to take up his parliamentary responsibilities on 1 July .
If he 's unable to do that â€ “ and neither of the major parties support his bid to avoid fronting up to questioning over rape allegations in Sweden â€ “ then the spot will be filled by his running mate , Melbourne academic Binoy Kampmark .
Assange says that Kampmark would not necessarily be kicked out of the seat if he is able to return to Australia at a later date .
He told ABC Radio on Friday : "" He 'd be keeping it warm [ but ] I would n't want to be in a position where Dr Kampmark was really turning out to be an excellent senator then I would come back and demand to knock him off .
"" We 're a team , so we would see what the performance was in the Senate .
If it was viewed that I would be a stronger performer in the Senate then I assume he would be happy to hand the seat over . ""
However , if the WikiLeaks founder loses his gamble to enter the Australian parliament from afar , he will also have lost a number of long - term Australian supporters in his campaign to get out of the Ecuadorian embassy and avoid extradition to the United States â€ “ by far the bigger prize for Assange ."
2013-09-06,"For an employee of the Guardian , particularly one with jetlag , Bill Condon 's WikiLeaks thriller can seem more hallucination than movie .
An account of the ascent of Julian Assange and his collaboration with this newspaper ( among others ) in the publication of classified documents , it plays like one of those dreams in which your office looks normal enough from the outside , but step within and everything 's subtly different .
It 's more Scandinavian , somehow ; with car park pillars and glass walls to which people attach crucial bits of paper , as on Crimewatch .
The editor has developed a sudden taste for shagpile rugs .
And why did you never notice the deputy is a dead spit for the dishy one on Downton Abbey ?
Such tweaks will not get an artistic licence revoked .
In fact , in adapting both a book on the affair by Guardian journalists David Leigh and Luke Harding , as well as tech activist Daniel Domscheit - Berg 's account of working for Assange , The Fifth Estate is a project in whose sources one can place considerable faith .
Certainly , Condon does .
At times it can feel he 's risked coherence for chronology , giving us his own surfeit of data without offering sufficient kit with which we can sift it .
The plot tracks Assange from the time he recruited Domscheit - Berg , through early online celebrity , before his meeting with Guardian investigative reporter Nick Davies ( David Thewlis ) , who , in consultation with editor Alan Rusbridger ( Peter Capaldi ) and deputy Ian Katz ( Dan Stevens ) , began working with Assange towards a coordinated launch of hundreds of thousands of secret diplomatic cables and war reports .
The timeline bumps a bit , but still pushes forward confidently , with our hacker heroes forever arriving in a new city , before some fresh turn of events requires them to slam shut their laptops and rush off again .
The template is David Fincher 's The Social Network , which took the creation of Facebook and turned it into the character study of a neurotic loner with the world at his fingertips .
Both films go big with the swishy visuals , this one deploying a bombardment of text and newsreel to suggest the morass of info , plus flight map - style graphics illustrating its flood across the globe .
Both films are eager to show that computing is an arena for creative genius , with much clacking on laptops like Steinways .
Both also suffer from the problem that watching someone type is n't , after a while , that exciting .
Condon further ups the dramatic ante with Lynchian visualisations of Domscheit - Berg 's inner life , plus a lot of techno .
And both films choose as their key arc the relationship between men most closely associated with the site 's inception .
But while The Social Network kept the focus on the anti - hero , relegating Eduardo Saverin 's role to support , this one bumps up the best friend to a lead , overestimating our interest in Domscheit - Berg 's lovelife .
Not that the film is really that interested either .
At heart , The Fifth Estate is a good , old - fashioned bromance â€ “ Assange even gets to meet the parents ( spoiler : it does n't go well ) .
As for Cumberbatch , he 's both the asset and the slight undoing ; so magnetic as to render hopes of a two - hander redundant .
It 's a virtuoso impersonation , from the deep drawl to louche geek twitches .
Suited , he could pass for Nick Cave after a night or two in the fridge .
Mostly , though , this Assange is as extraterrestrial as Cumberbatch 's Khan in last year 's Star Trek , a lip - smacking vampire typing through the night .
From a distance , he looks like a lizardy angel , courageously saving the world ; close up he squints and snuffles like a bleached , greasy mouse .
Introducing the film last night , Condon said he wanted to explore the limits of truth - telling : when was a lie too important not to expose , and when was it so crucial you must not dream of doing so ?
In that , he has succeeded admirably : this is highly competent catnip for the watercooler crowd .
Toronto has prepared itself well for the forthcoming week with a hot potato .
Now roll on the cheese ."
2013-09-13,"Benedict Cumberbatch has revealed details of his email exchanges with Julian Assange about the new WikiLeaks film , including Assange 's plea for him not to take part in the movie , sent the day before filming began .
Cumberbatch , who plays Assange in The Fifth Estate , told the Guardian he had received the 10-page email from the WikiLeaks founder as he made final preparations to begin filming in January .
"" It was a very considered , thorough , charming and intelligent account of why he thought this was morally wrong for me to be part of something he thought was going to be damaging in real terms â€ “ not just to perceptions but to the reality of the outcome for himself , "" the actor said .
"" He characterised himself as a political refugee , and with [ Chelsea , formerly Bradley ]
Manning awaiting trial , and other supporters of WikiLeaks who have been detained or might be awaiting detention , and the organisation itself â€ “ all of that being under threat if I took part in this film . ""
Assange has been outspoken in his opposition to the film , which he has described as a "" massive propaganda attack "" on him and his organisation .
The movie is based on two books , by the German technology activist Daniel Domscheit - Berg and by Luke Harding and David Leigh of the Guardian , former collaborators with whom the Australian has now fallen out .
But Cumberbatch , who said he made repeated unsuccessful requests to meet Assange before beginning filming , has defended the project , saying the film "" shows his ideas and integrity and self - sacrifice "" .
The actor , best known for Sherlock , did think twice , he says , when he received the email . ""
Of course [ I wobbled ] .
The fact that it was coming from the man himself , the day before we started filming ?
Of course I would hear and feel the protests of the man I was about to pretend to be .
I 'm a human being . ""
He wrestled with his reply for four hours , he said .
"" I said listen , this film is going to explore what you achieved , what brought you to the world 's attention , in a way that I think is nothing but positive .
I admit to doing work because I 'm a vain actor
â€
¦
yet I 'm not acting in a moral vacuum .
I have considered this , and whatever happens I want to give as much complexity and understanding of you as I can . ""
Asked about Manning â€ “ who was sentenced last month to 35 years in prison for leaking documents to WikiLeaks , after which she announced she wished to live as a woman â€ “ Cumberbatch said he was not convinced that the army private should be granted the presidential pardon for which she has now appealed . ""
He [ sic ] did what he did out of a conviction that an alarm bell needed to be sounded .
But his superiors might have been right to say to him , it 's not your position to be worried about it within the hierarchy of the military organisation , which is why he had to be sentenced .
He took an oath , and he broke that oath . ""
While alarmed by the revelations of state surveillance disclosed by the whistleblower Edward Snowden , the actor admitted he was also ambivalent about disclosing secrets . ""
If they are saving lives , how can we say that 's less important than civil liberties ?
You do n't have any civil liberties if you 're dead . """

It was a great discussion and really covered in a broad way many of the issues discussed here over the last year , especially the last several months ( I dropped out for roughly 25 minutes after I first spoke due to some technical difficulties with the video feed but returned to participate actively in the rest of the discussion ) .

2013-10-10,"WikiLeaks has released a letter from Julian Assange to Benedict Cumberbatch , in which he asked the actor to drop out of a film about the organisation and refused to meet him .
Assange told Cumberbatch : "" I believe you are a good person , but I do not believe that this film is a good film . ""
Cumberbatch plays the WikiLeaks founder in The Fifth Estate , which is released in the UK on Friday .
He revealed last month he considered quitting the film after Assange wrote to him in January with a "" very considered , thorough , charming and intelligent account "" of why he should n't participate .
In the letter , Assange described the film as a "" toxic "" and "" wretched "" , based on a distorted version of the truth . ""
This film is going to bury good people doing good work , at exactly the time that the state is coming down on their heads , "" he wrote .
"" I do not believe it is going to be positive for me or the people I care about . ""
Assange warned Cumberbatch : "" You will be used , as a hired gun , to assume the appearance of the truth in order to assassinate it .
To present me as someone morally compromised and to place me in a falsified history .
To create a work , not of fiction , but of debased truth .

He added : "" I believe you are well intentioned but surely you can see why it is a bad idea for me to meet with you . ""

""
The release of the letter follows the leaking of the film 's script by WikiLeaks last month .
It was posted on the internet alongside a damning 4,000 word essay .
In a statement accompanying the release of the letter , Assange said : "" Instead of the exciting true story , we get a film about a bland German IT worker who was n't even there and a fabricated fight over redactions with the old newspapers and the state department saving the day .

The story of Julian Assange 's relationship with the world at large , the media in general and the Guardian in particular was recently told in engrossing detail in Alex Gibney 's documentary
We Steal Secrets :
The Story of WikiLeaks .
That film ( which provoked an equally detailed response from its subject ) concluded that Assange was an information freedom fighter who became overwhelmed by his own ego , descending into recklessness , deviousness and worse .
Now , amid the usual denunciations from the white - haired one , comes Bill Condon 's more overtly dramatic but less piercing biopic .
Based in part upon Daniel Domscheit - Berg 's account of his time as Assange 's partner at "" the world 's most dangerous website "" , this visually flashy thriller retreads familiar ground , attempting to address the widest possible audience ( Condon is clearly aiming for those who would have missed Gibney 's film ) , constantly acknowledging its partisan sources , ultimately hedging its narrative bets .
After a title sequence that zips from the invention of writing , through the rise of the printing press to the dawn of the internet , we land in 2010 , where the Guardian is holding out for accuracy , verification and redaction while others rush to publish the biggest information leak in history .
From here , we flash back to the creation of WikiLeaks , tripping through its more celebrated revelations ( tackling banks and politicians , exposing neo - Nazis ) , stopping occasionally to wonder about the balance between privacy and transparency ( "" you published their names and addresses ; they have families , childrenâ€ ¦ "") which is the key concern of West Wing graduate Josh Singer 's script .
Mirroring this philosophical tension is the personal relationship between Assange and WikiLeaks spokesperson Daniel Berg , very well played by Benedict Cumberbatch and Daniel BrÃ¼hl , who respectively come to embody the soul and conscience of their internet monster
â€ “ one eager to charge in where angels fear to tread , the other increasingly concerned about the consequences of their actions .
There 's a clear echo here of The Social Network , which similarly counterpointed the rise of electronic information with the breakdown of communication between the co - founders of an online revolution , one nice , one nasty .
To solve the age - old problem of making people sitting at keyboards seem cinematic , Condon looks back beyond Hideo Nakata 's Chatroom ( a stage play adaptation that presented the internet as a series of physical spaces ) to Iain Softley 's Hackers , derided upon its release in the mid-90s but regularly copied ever since .
Following in Softley 's footsteps , The Fifth Estate offers surreal vistas of electronic landscapes through which our heroes chase each other 's tails ; IP addresses made flesh , a thousand Julians smiling back at us through cyberspace .
These sequences are fun , and no less fancifully cartoonish than the scenes in the Guardian offices that employ the usual screen cliches about the thrilling behaviour of news reporters ; a stubbly David Thewlis channelling Paddy Considine in The Bourne Ultimatum as he storms theatrically into offices â€ “ always late , always cross â€ “ while Peter Capaldi frowns over folded arms as the concerned editor whose hand appears to have been glued to his chin .
Meanwhile , cinematographer Tobias Schliessler chases the cast along glassy corridors , up stairs , down escalators , through doors , apparently terrified of ever coming to a halt .
After a while it becomes apparent that the visual fizz is hiding an essential emptiness , a hole where the film 's meaty core should be .
Condon has always been an exceptionally even - handed director ( look at his refreshingly sober take on Kinsey ) , and despite Assange 's assertion that this film will be "" a massive propaganda attack "" goes out of his way to be balanced , perhaps overly so .
Indeed , with the sexual assault charges referred to only as a final footnote , the film 's most barbed allegation is that Assange dyes his hair , a detail linked to a bizarre childhood that is unsuccessfully raked for a character - forming back story .
Condon even gives his adversarial central character the last word , dismissing the film from the confines of the Ecuadorian embassy , telling viewers that it this is only one version of a far more complex story , urging them to find out more for themselves .
While this may be philosophically admirable , it does n't make for great drama , and for all its simplifications and fictionalisations , The Fifth Estate feels strangely unfocused , uncertain of how to deal with its slippery enigma .
Cumberbatch is brilliant , getting the peculiar vocal and physical mannerisms of Assange just so , playing him as saint and sinner , perfectly capturing his shabby charisma .
Yet the film never allows him to show his teeth , withholding not only judgment but also clear direction , creating an unsatisfactory vacuum at the heart of the piece , like a great big cinematic meringue .
A shame , too , that the terrific Alicia Vikander gets lost in the mix , her role as Berg 's confidante and lover being one of the script 's sketchiest confections .
In the end we 're left with an enjoyable but rather empty ride ; easy on the eye , kinetic in construction , but undone by indecision about its still unfolding history ."
2013-10-16,"The Fifth Estate ( 2013 )
Director : Bill Condon Entertainment grade : C History grade : B+ WikiLeaks , an online organisation publishing secret information , became internationally prominent by the end of the first decade of the 21st century .
Importance
The Fifth Estate begins grandly with a montage of the history of media , from people chipping hieroglyphics on pyramids through the invention of the printing press to the televised announcement of John F Kennedy 's assassination .
The end result of this great sweep of events , it suggests , was a platinum blond Australian bombshell , Julian Assange ( Benedict Cumberbatch ) , leaking stuff on a website .
As the film begins in 2012 his former BFF , Daniel Berg ( Domscheit - Berg in real life , here played by Daniel BrÃ¼hl ) , is trying to send him a message over and over again : "" Julian , are you there ? ""
That would have made a good alternative title for this movie .
Leaks
The film flashes back to 2002 .
Berg attends some sort of rave - inflected nerd convention in Berlin , full of people who look like they could do with a hot bath and some vitamins , wiring bits of Lego up to Tesla coils and so forth .
Assange refers to this lot as "" cypherpunks "" .
He talks about freedom of information and protecting the anonymity of whistleblowers .
Berg is smitten .
The two team up to leak information on Bank Julius Baer in a complicated case that the film does a decent job of making comprehensible .
The leaks multiply : Tibet protests , Scientology secrets , Sarah Palin 's emails .
WikiLeaks soon attracts the attention of journalists at the Guardian , all of whom are brave , charismatic and incredibly attractive .
Naturally , this bit is completely accurate .
People
The real Julian Assange deplores this film , writing to Cumberbatch claiming that it would "" depict me and my work in a negative light "" .
In fact , The Fifth Estate goes fairly soft on him .
Cumberbatch 's portrayal is brilliant : terrifically accurate in terms of speech and mannerisms , while skilfully capturing a sort of traumatised vulnerability beneath all the searing hostility .
It would be possible for audiences to find the screen Assange sympathetic .
Moreover , the film all but dodges the sexual assault allegations made against him in Sweden , mentioning them only in a title card at the end .
Still , it seems like the real Assange would have been unhappy with any script unless it began "" INT .
STABLE .
BETHLEHEM .
NIGHT .
Shepherds and wise men gather round to adore the strikingly handsome newborn JULIAN ASSANGE while angels sing hosannas , "" and got ever more appreciative from there .
Plot Historically speaking , it 's fine that the film does n't ever fully determine whether Assange is a hero , an antihero or a villain .
It need n't patronise its audience with a didactic conclusion .
As some reviews have noted , it takes cues from similarly ambivalent Facebook drama The Social Network .
In both , a sweet , innocent nerd embarks upon a codependent bromance with a smarter , more ruthless nerd , and gets burned .
The Social Network was written by West Wing creator Aaron Sorkin ; The Fifth Estate was written by West Wing writer Josh Singer .
And for all these films ' dash and style , they both face the fundamental narrative problem : nothing really happens in them .
Action
The significant action in The Fifth Estate boils down to a few keystrokes on a laptop .
The film - makers have tried to add excitement with the murders of Kenyan human rights activists in 2009 , a State Department informant being exfiltrated from Libya before WikiLeaks can blow his cover , and a few government - issue heavies glaring at Assange across Scandinavian cocktail bars .
Even so , the principal characters face no tangible peril : just the amorphous threat of lawsuits and bad publicity .
It would have taken substantially greater historical inaccuracies to turn this film into a genuine thriller .
If it were theatre , of course , The Fifth Estate could have made a virtue of its own lack of action .
They could have set the entire thing in the broom cupboard of the Ecuadorean embassy , with Assange sitting under his sunlamp , explaining how important and wonderful he is he is to a sock on his hand with eyes drawn on it .
Every single day .
For the last 16 months .
Now that , one suspects , would be all too close to the truth .
Verdict A valiant attempt to dramatise the WikiLeaks story â€
“ but the story itself lacks drama ."
2013-10-21,"I spent the weekend with an old British friend , now resident in the US and well - versed in the world of espionage , spy - swaps and the inherent duplicity of secretive intelligence services the world over .
He reinforced my view that , whatever doubts many of us had about the WikiLeaks affair or Julian Assange , Edward Snowden 's data - mining revelations are of major importance to democratic debate .
No wonder then that Chris Huhne returns to the attack in today 's Guardian on the triple failure of the press , parliament and the law to address the real issue that Snowden 's disclosure highlights , the unaccountable accretion of sensational eavesdropping technology by the NSA and GCHQ .
I ca n't agree with the disgraced Lib Dem ex - cabinet minister when he calls this development the most catastrophic power - grab in British peacetime history .
That strikes me as much hyperbole as the security establishment 's counter - claim that Snowden 's treachery is the worst in postwar British history , worse than Burgess , Maclean and Blunt at the height of the cold war , when 25,000 nuclear missiles pointed our way .
The lackey press ( "" 45 minutes to an Iraqi missile launch on Britain "" , anyone ? ) pumped that nonsense up into "" the worst leak in western history "" .
So it 's worth recalling that Huhne is a journalist by trade too , albeit an economics journalist , the modern equivalent of the religious affairs correspondent .
Exaggeration is what the hacks do in all branches of the business .
But he 's on to something in his article when he asks which cabinet ministers signed off on GCHQ 's Tempora programme in 2006 - 08 .
Margaret Beckett under Tony Blair ?
David Miliband , her successor as foreign secretary under Gordon Brown ?
Good question and a change of elected regime is always a good moment for the permanent government to pull a flanker on untried ministers â€ “ to win political cover and pass the buck if things go wrong , as they sometimes do .
I think I have an answer to his question .
But first , the context .
It was n't hard to see why Chris Huhne was cross with Whitehall two Mondays ago about the failure to tell the coalition cabinet in which he served the scale and nature of GCHQ 's data - mining operations .
Huhne 's indignation was clearly fuelled by the call he says he got from a senior official reminding the former energy secretary that he should not use his new Guardian column to reveal "" privileged information "" acquired in office .
The ex - MP â€ “ whose fall from power to prison was classic hubris
â€ “ retaliated by examining something he was NOT told about instead .
After going through some of Edward Snowden 's cache of NSA / GCHQ files last month , the novelist John Lanchester wrote long and well in the Guardian â€ “ read this important essay here if you missed it
â€ “ about why it is important that the British public , sleeping soundly when it should be concentrating , must debate how much information we should allow the state to extract from us and file in the name of security â€ “ and upon what terms of accountability .
Harry Evans , one of Fleet Street 's greatest postwar editors in the heyday of the Sunday Times under Roy Thomson 's benign ownership , says much the same in today 's paper .
That is correct .
But it is a world away from the practical business of running a coalition government in an age of 24/7 media .
Which is why David Cameron may not have told colleagues all he knew .
Cabinets are important institutions whose collective role and shared responsibility is diminished at our peril if we do so in favour of rule of a quasi - president â€ “ one with presidential powers but little constitutional constraint , let alone by a shadowy cabal of key ministers and faceless civil servants .
Collective decision - making matters ( it reduces mistakes by testing policy ) but it 's painful .
That eternal battle goes on in committees , in quiet corridors but also on TV , where ministers and officials are grilled by MPs and Paxman - folk alike .
Ditto the courts , as Huhne writes today .
It 's just more visible now
â€ “ except when it is n't .
When the Labour backbencher and future founder of the NHS , Aneurin Bevan , constantly challenged Churchill in his prime as Britain 's warlord between 1940 - 45 he made himself an unpopular nuisance .
But Nye 's instinct was sound .
In 1951 Bevan helped bring down the Labour government over its new chancellor 's preference for war rearmament in Korea funded by NHS prescription charges .
He was wrong about the NHS charges but right about the defence budget , as Churchill later acknowledged when he cut it .
In the intervening years Clem Attlee had decided that Britain must build its own atomic bomb in order to remain one of the war - time "" big three "" powers .
He and his intimates , chiefly Ernie Bevin , trade union hero turned cold war foreign secretary , kept the secret to themselves .
Why ?
Cabinets are leaky ; there would have been a row of the kind that later fuelled the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament ( CND ) , the passionate if self - absorbed crusade to rid the world of nukes by setting a good unilateral example .
CND was way past its prime in the late 1970s when Jim Callaghan â€ “ like Attlee a Labour PM with wartime military service
â€ “ again decided not to tell his cabinet of the decision to upgrade the warhead on Britain 's US - bought Polaris nuclear missile system , the Chevaline programme which was revealed by the incoming Thatcher government in a Commons statement by Francis Pym , defence secretary .
I was present .
The idea had been to ensure that at least one missile would still be able to penetrate Moscow 's improved anti - ballistic missile defences and do the job of destroying the city .
That 's what deterrent theory was about .
Those were the days !
This is n't a straight left - right cultural issue , though governments of the left tend to have more politicians with a commitment to openness , not to mention messianic self - aggrandisement , which can be harnessed to the openness agenda .
It 's not as if Chris Huhne himself has always been frank about political or even personal matters .
But Tory governments are instinctively more amenable to "" reasons of state "" arguments , more worldly you might say .
Even so Margaret Thatcher had her secrets , too sensitive to risk a leak .
They all do and are entitled to have them , though they will all have to be justified in the end
â€ “ or not .
How many of Anthony Eden 's cabinet colleagues knew of his secret collusion with France and Israel â€ “ cooked up at Sevres outside Paris in 1956 â€ “ to seize the Suez canal back from Egyptian nationalisation via a collusive invasion ?
Not many .
It cost him his health and job â€ “ and was all his own fault .
As Churchill said of his fragile successor , I would never have dared do it , but having done it , I would not have dared stop .
Eden stopped .
So the prime question I asked myself two weeks ago is the one Huhne pointedly asks today : how much did the security apparatus , GCHQ , M15 and M16 , tell David Cameron â€ “ and before him all PMs as far back as John Major â€ “ about the new surveillance technologies which effortlessly outstripped all capacity to place them under legal control and constraint ?
And who signed off on whatever it was they were told .
It 's not that what they did was criminal ; there were probably good reasons at the time .
Good reasons , too , why the Brown or Blair cabinet was not informed , nor Clem Attlee 's .
The dangers of a leak from an inexperienced cabinet in 2010 , full of tension and Lib Dems , is obvious .
You can see why they did n't do it , rightly or not .
But now that it 's out â€
“
most things come out in the end
â€

we need to know who knew what so that the routine claims since Snowden broke cover that Tempora and its kind are properly accountable can be exposed for the self - serving deceits they probably are ."
2013-11-13,"Charles Firth appears to have got exactly what he wanted : fake controversy to promote his fake museum , with a series of news stories announcing the imminent opening of The Sydney Museum of Words , a two - week event to be staged in a gallery in Kings Cross from November 16 .
Various famous people were asked to donate a single word â€ “ Vladimir Putin , Germaine Greer and Julian Assange among them
â€ “ to be installed in the gallery .
Supported by the City of Sydney and in partnership with Firthâ€ ™ s production company NewsLab and the Sydney Writers Room , SMOW looked like a project cooked up by some media creatives to take the piss out of the art world .
And so it was : on Tuesday , Firth claimed he had been sacked by his own company for claiming that $ 30,000 the project had received in funding from an undisclosed arts body was patently absurd because the SMOW was nothing more than a scam ; a cover to raise money for the Sydney Writers Room , which doesnâ€ ™ t receive arts funding .
Firth , has form with this kind of cultural hijinks .
The Zeppo Marx of The Chaser team ,
heâ€ ™ s the creator of some occasionally amusing piss takes , but the SMOW idea â€ “ to hang unrelated words on gallery walls and call it a museum â€ “ was really nothing special .
As a hard - hitting satire of the art world , it was no big deal either , it had all the hallmarks of people who didnâ€ ™ t know what they were talking about .
For art neophytes , conceptual art is an obvious target since it lacks what most people recognise as craft skill or as possessing some intrinsic artistic value .
But text art , a discreet kind of art that has evolved from its roots in the early 20th century art movements such as dadaism and surrealism , puts a high value on the audience 's ability to recognise and understand a sophisticated and often satirical communication bereft of frills and bourgeois values of landscape painting and portraiture .
The irony here is that Firth and his accomplices appear to misunderstand text art and conceptualism , two types of contemporary art that are in fact their allies .
Where Firth might have done damage is in the realm of arts funding .
SMOW approached the Australia Council , Arts NSW , the State Government and the City of Sydney for funding .
That they got it , is , Firth says , evidence that the whole arts funding system is rotten .
â€œI think that what this exhibition , more than anything , shows [ is ] that the arts funding model is broken , â€ � Firth claimed .
â€œIf something as fundamentally stupid as this can get funding from all levels of government then clearly there is something profoundly wrong with arts grants in Australia.â€
�
But what Firth plainly doesnâ€
™ t understand is his â€œfundamentally stupidâ€ � exhibition is nothing of the sort ; there are numerous Australian artists who have staged exhibitions of text works , in painting , drawing , and sculpture .
They have serious intentions and are taken seriously by the art world .
Artists such as Jon Campbell , Robert MacPherson and Emily Floyd work out of the conceptual and text art tradition and , far from being dilettantes , they have long and substantial careers that demonstrate their serious intentions .
The big difference between Firth and those kinds of artists is that their work is offered in good faith .
No matter how much some might believe that conceptual artists are frauds , and that their work is worthless , that it is offered in good faith is the last line of defence against the emperor 's new clothes syndrome .
Everyone is entitled to their opinion â€ “ no matter how wrong headed or misguided â€
“ but good faith
is the protective armour against ignorance and disbelief .
Itâ€ ™ s not difficult to satirise the world of art funding â€ “ a peruse through the annual reports of the Australia Council announcing which artists got what money for their projects supplies more than enough material .
Plans to build a yurt or to buy a Segway or to stage projects of such little interest that only the artist and their friends will ever likely bother to see it
â€ “ all of this stuff
just lies in wait for any shock jock or tabloid columnist ready to decry the "" waste "" and "" stupidity "" .
Firth has in one move belittled artists everywhere who apply for funding and most likely cruelled his chances of ever receiving a grant again .
But there 's a bigger point here than just his silliness and muddle - headed reasoning .
In the current political climate , with the federal government flagging funding cuts for humanities research and a promise to find "" savings "" wherever possible , there 's real threat that arts organisations that are the lifeblood of art - making and exhibition will get the axe .
Stunts such as Firth 's might give the federal government 's razor gang exactly the excuse they 're looking for ."
2013-11-26,"The lawyer acting for WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange over the US criminal investigation into his publication of hundreds of thousands of state secrets has called on the Department of Justice to make a formal statement that it will not prosecute him , in the wake of off - the - record reports that the department is minded not to press charges .
Barry Pollack responded sharply to anonymous officials who told the Washington Post that the US government was unlikely to prosecute Assange because to do so would raise the issue of prosecuting news organisations and journalists involved in the WikiLeaks disclosures .
Pollack said that the Justice Department had failed to respond to WikiLeaksâ€ ™ inquiries about the status of the investigation , which has been led by the eastern district of Virginia , where a grand jury has been impaneled .
â€œMr
Assange would welcome a formal unequivocal statement from the Department of Justice that it has not brought charges against him and will not do so in the future .
Unfortunately , to date , the Department of Justice has not been willing to make such a statement ,
â€ �
Pollack said .
The Washington Post report is the latest in a flurry of unattributed articles suggesting that the Justice Department is unlikely to take up formal charges against Assange .
The paper said that the justice officials had concluded that they had a â€œNew York Times problemâ€ �
â€ “ that is , if they went after Assange they would also have to prosecute journalists from the New York Times , the Guardian and others who worked on the WikiLeaks revelations .
In 2010 , WikiLeaks shared with the Guardian and other international news organisations access to the massive trove of US state secrets leaked by the American soldier Chelsea Manning , formerly Bradley .
WikiLeaks has consistently argued that it is a journalistic organisation , and thus shielded by the same first amendment protections as any other news outlet .
The Justice Department declined on Tuesday to comment on whether or not it would prosecute Assange .
The drip - drip of anonymous indications from the department of justice that Assange will not be prosecuted , combined with the refusal to make public its intentions , has caused anger and frustration in the WikiLeaks camp which sees it as a form of games - playing on the part of the Obama administration .
WikiLeaks used its Twitter feed â€ “ often used by Assange as a channel for his personal opinions â€ “ to vent a sceptical response to the story , pointing out that the US government under Obama has an aggressive record on pursuing official leaks .
Manning has been sentenced to 35 years in military custody as the source of the WikiLeaks disclosures .
She is one of eight individuals charged under the Espionage Act in recent years , the latest being Edward Snowden of the National Security Agency leaks .
Other observers , however , reserved their scepticism for Assange , who has been ensconced for more than a year in the Ecuadorean embassy in London where he has been granted diplomatic asylum .
He is wanted for questioning in Sweden in regard to sexual assault allegations .
Assange has said he is resisting extradition to Sweden for fear of being sent in turn to the US to face criminal prosecution over WikiLeaks .
Were the US to confirm publicly that it will not press charges , Assangeâ€ ™ s critics believe that would undermine his self - defence .
Philip Crowley , the former US State Department spokesperson who resigned from the post in protest at the treatment of Chelsea Manning in a US marine jail , struck that note in a tweet : â€œWith a US indictment not plausible , Julian Assangeâ€ ™ s new narrative is information should be free , and rent too.â€ �"
2013-11-27,"WikiLeaks drama
The Fifth Estate , starring Benedict Cumberbatch as Julian Assange , has been named the year 's biggest movie disappointments by experts at financial magazine Forbes .
Bill Condon 's film about the early years of the whistleblowing site was tipped for awards season success prior to hitting cinemas .
With the up - and - coming Cumberbatch in the lead , an Oscar - winning director and highly topical theme it had seemed like a shoo - in .
But the film bombed with critics and later flopped at the box office .
It has so far returned a mere $ 6 m ( Â£3.6 m ) of its relatively meagre $ 28 m ( Â£17.1 m ) budget , according to Forbes , a percentage of just 21 % .
Cumberbatch need not take the news too harshly : the top 10 of flops assembled by the magazine ahead of the annual Thanksgiving holiday in the US is filled with numerous films featuring well known stars .
In second place is the Sylvester Stallone action movie Bullet to the Head , which took just $ 9 m ( Â£5.52 m ) on a budget of $ 25 m ( Â£15.3 m ) , a return of 36 % .
With Stallone hot property once again thanks to the success of The Expendables movies and 48 Hours ' Walter Hill in charge of the cameras , producers had expected rather better returns .
Third place on the list went to corporate thriller Paranoia , starring Harrison Ford and Gary Oldman alongside The Hunger Games ' Liam Hemsworth .
Despite all that star power , Robert Luketic 's film took just $ 13.5 m ( Â£8.2 m ) at the global box office on a $ 35 m ( Â£21.4 m ) budget , a return of only 39 % .
Fourth spot went to the Jason Statham / Jennifer Lopez heist thriller Parker , starring the British action stalwart as a professional thief vying to take revenge on his double - crossing crew .
It managed to recoup just 49 % of its production budget at the box office .
Mark Wahlberg was one of last year 's top box office draws with success in comedy Ted .
But this year his thriller Broken City , in which he starred opposite Russell Crowe , was 2013 's fifth biggest turkey .
Allen Hughes ' film earned just $ 19 m ( Â£11.6 m ) on a $ 35 m ( Â£21.4 m ) budget , a 54 % return .
Full list of Forbes ' top 10 box office turkeys of 2013 1 .
The Fifth Estate - 21 % return 2 .

2014-01-01,"WikiLeaks has revealed it did not â€œknow or approveâ€ � of its Australian political partyâ€ ™ s visit to Syria to meet Bashar al - Assad , amid criticism from both the government and Labor over the trip .
A WikiLeaks party delegation , reportedly including its founder Julian Assangeâ€ ™ s father , John Shipton , held talks with a number of high - ranking Syrian officials , with a picture released by the Syrian government of a meeting with the president himself .
Before the visit , the party stated it was going as part of its â€œpeace and reconciliationâ€ � efforts , as well as warning over the dangers of western intervention into the bloody three - year Syrian civil war .
Shipton said he wanted to show â€œsolidarityâ€ � with the Syrian people and told a local TV station that WikiLeaks would be opening an office in Damascus this year .
But WikiLeaks has distanced itself from the trip , saying via Twitter that while peace brokering is a â€œgood ideaâ€ � , it â€œdid not know or approveâ€ � of the delegationâ€ ™ s visit to Syria .
Julie Bishop , the Australian foreign affairs minister , said Syria was not a place for â€œpolitical parties to pursue their political endsâ€ � .
â€œI find it extraordinarily reckless that an organisation registered as a political party in Australia would seek to insert itself into the conflict in Syria and engage with a leader accused of war crimes and crimes against humanity , including using chemical weapons against his own people , "" Bishop told The Australian newspaper .
"" Their actions could be interpreted as a show of support for President Assad 's behaviour .
Further , the Syrian regime is subject to wide - ranging sanctions and WikiLeaks ' actions are deeply counterproductiveâ€ � .
Labor has also criticised the visit , with Chris Bowen , the shadow treasurer , calling the decision â€œextraordinaryâ€ � . ""
The Assad regime has been widely criticised and correctly criticised around the world , â€ � he said .
"" And for an Australian political party to think it 's sensible to go and have discussions and try and provide some legitimacy , is something I think which they have to explain . ""
Itâ€ ™ s understood that the visit was initially intended as a â€œfact - findingâ€ � mission before meetings with Syrian government officials were brokered .
Members of the visiting group , which included the academic Tim Anderson and activists Jamal Daoud and Gail Malone , are expected back in Australia next week .
Several former members of the WikiLeaks party have told Guardian Australia the trip has caused further consternation within the party , which was formed last year but endured a fraught federal election campaign after several of its candidates resigned amid dissatisfaction over preferencing and internal party processes .
Antony Loewenstein , an author and long - term supporter of WikiLeaks â€ “ although never a member of the political party â€ “ told Guardian Australia the situation was a â€œsad state of affairsâ€ � .
â€œI
donâ€
™ t think meeting Assad is the issue , although he is a brutal dictator , no doubt about it , â€ � he said .
â€œThe problem is the optics of it , that they are being used as a prop by a regime that has undeniably killed tens of thousands or more civilians.â€ �
The WikiLeaks party has been contacted for comment on the trip but not responded ."
2014-01-02,"WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange has used the unlikely platform of the religious slot on the BBC 's Today programme to condemn attempts by US and UK governments to acquire a "" god - like "" knowledge of citizens through mass surveillance .
Assange , who has been holed up in an embassy in London for more than a year , delivered a sermon about the importance of freedom of information , and liberating "" hoarded knowledge "" , in an alternative Thought for The Day on the Today Programme .
He said disclosures by the security contractor Edward Snowden about the scale of mass surveillance by the US and UK security services had exposed how governments and corporations seek to "" know more and more about us "" while "" we know less and less about them "" .
Assange , who has been granted asylum by Ecuador but faces arrest if he leaves the country 's London embassy , was chosen to appear by Today 's guest editor , musician PJ Harvey , who introduced him as a "" person of great courage "" .
She said he had "" opened a door to freedom that ought to be the essence of democracy "" .
Assange likened contemporary mass surveillance to the way the Catholic church operated during the reformation .
He said : "" Through the confessional system the Catholic church spied upon the lives of its congregants .
While Latin mass excluded most people who could not speak Latin from an understanding of the very system of thought that bound them . ""
Knowledge has always flowed upwards , to bishops and kings not down to serfs and slaves .
The principle remains the same in the present era .
Documents disclosed by NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden show that governments dare to aspire , through their intelligence agencies , to a god - like knowledge of each and every one of us . ""
Assange cited Aristotle and passages from the Bible to claim backing for the idea that knowledge is power . ""
To be alive as a human being is to know , in the same way as it is to have a heart that beats , "" he said .
The WikiLeaks founder added : "" To keep a person ignorant is to place them in a cage .
The powerful â€ “ if they want to keep their power â€ “ will try to know as much about us as they can , and they will try to make sure that we know as little about them as is possible . ""
Assange was one of several alternative , left - leaning voices chosen by Harvey .
Her programme also featured contributions from campaigning journalist John Pilger , an interview on torture with the Guardian 's Ian Cobain ; and a poem by a GuantÃ¡namo Bay inmate .
Ian Austin , the Labour MP for Dudley , described the programme as the "" worst ever "" .
He tweeted : "" In 30 years of listening , I already thought today 's @BBCr4today was worst ever .
I cldn't imagine it cld get worse .
Then they put Assange on . ""
The singer said she was assured by the BBC that the guests she had chosen would not be edited .
Harvey is one of a number of guest editors who are commissioned by the programme each year over the festive period .
Others in the past few days have included Tim Berners - Lee , the inventor of the world wide web , and Lady Manningham - Buller , the former director general of MI5 .
Assange entered the Ecuadorian embassy while he faced extradition to Sweden to face rape allegations and he was given asylum in August 2012 .
In 2010 , WikiLeaks shared with the Guardian and other international news organisations access to the huge trove of US state secrets leaked by the American soldier Chelsea Manning , formerly Bradley ."
2014-01-02,"I enjoyed listening to John Pilger and Julian Assange on PJ Harvey 's guest - edited edition of Radio 4 's Today programme this morning .
Excellent .
It 's not that I necessarily trust their handling of the facts , let alone their judgment , much more than I do the Daily Mail 's .
It 's just that â€ “ like the Mail â€ “ they force us to confront our comforting prejudices .
Having an outsider come in to shake things up is always a gamble , a bit like calling in management consultants at a company or government department .
They may be brilliant â€ “ as some of Today 's guest editors are â€ “ and they may be dull or worse .
I did n't catch all of PJ Harvey 's â€ “ Polly Jean to the family , I expect â€ “
but she 's pretty talented and obviously decent , so you had to admire her determination to shine some light on neglected corners like war - injured servicemen and the UN security council .
Here 's her own website 's running order .
What fascinates me with such exercises is how persuasive they are â€ “ or are not â€ “ in changing people 's views .
Reading the Mail
( it 's the best of the rightwing polemical papers in my view ) is often hard work , though it has a lively mix ( the health features are terrific and City coverage combative ) and a stream of reliable jokes , erudite and malicious , from diarist , Ephraim Hardcastle .
But the relentless and hectoring nature of much of what it does usually puts me off .
The "" Man Who Hated Britain "" attack on Ed Miliband 's father , the Marxist intellectual , Ralph Miliband , was a case in point .
There is a really interesting study to be done of Ralph 's world view and its impact on his younger son .
But the Mail 's bilious attack has made it toxic .
I feel the same way about some of today 's Today .
John Pilger 's take on the world is better known to older readers , he 's less often on radio and TV now
â€ “ no longer writing for the Mirror either â€ “ which is a shame because his kind of indignation is best suited to young people for whom things are simpler than they become as most of us get older .
Pilger took as his text media censorship and the poll which suggested that most Brits only think 10,000 Iraqis were killed during the US / UK - led invasion - occupation when the reality may be closer to 1 million .
In saying that , JP may be almost as guilty of overstatement as the poll found public opinion was guilty of understatement .
It 's a much - disputed figure .
Pilger also said that in the days when Saddam Hussein was still "" a good dictator "" ( ie deemed to be on our side )
Sunni and Shia Iraqis lived happily side by side , a distinctly Pilgerish take which means the ancient sectarian feud is all our fault .
Delivering the second of the day 's Thoughts for the Day ( former archbishop of Canterbury Rowan Williams delivered the first ) , Julian Assange was much more persuasive .
Holed up in the Ecuadorian embassy he has time to think , and quoted both Aristotle and the Books of Proverbs on the natural human thirst for knowledge and understanding on the world in which we live . ""
Knowledge is power , "" he said .
Quite so , and it was only a small jump to WikiLeaks and Edward Snowden 's disclosures about the long reach of the NSA and GCHQ .
It 's not quite true that the invention of the printing presses "" was opposed by the old powers of Europe "" .
Princes did try to control it and Catholic countries were far worse than the emerging Protestant ones â€ “ for whom the vernacular translation of the bible was transforming â€ “ but they went with the technological flow .
It was the mighty Ottoman empire , the imperial power which terrified Christian Europe , which banned the new discovery .
That was the error which would eventually allow George W Bush to occupy once - mighty Baghdad 500 years later .
Where the monochrome view of a Pilger or Assange gets it wrong is in the same way that the Mail gets it wrong and that Noam Chomsky got it wrong the last time I heard him addressing a large audience , at the Friends Meeting House in central London in 2013 .
They want to blame the "" other "" for all our woes , they want to blame foreigners .
In the Mail 's case â€ “
I dare not read the less subtle Sun or Express 's take â€
“
they focus on Romanians and Bulgarians , on Roma in particular ( try Elinor Goodman 's informed Radio 4 view here â€ ¦ ) , the foreigners most perceived to threaten our way of life in 2014 .
There are serious issues about immigration which successive governments have handled badly .
But the media have responsibilities here , too â€ “ and behave worse .
When Pilger , Assange or Noam Chomsky address US or British abuses â€ “ torture in Cyprus during the Eoka crisis of the 1950s popped up in PJ Harvey 's edition
â€ “ they have issues worth addressing too , if only to guard against repeating past failures and crimes .
We are victims of media censorship is the thrust of their complaint , the "" normalisation of the unthinkable "" as another critic , Edmund Herman , puts it .
As always , the rich and powerful want to know all they can about us â€ “ "" the serfs and slaves "" as Assange called us â€ “ while letting us know as little as possible about them .
I have a lot of sympathy with that concern , indeed I recently wrote a piece about the dangers from oligarchy of fashionable anti - politics rhetoric on the left .
Where we should part company from such talk is in regarding ourselves merely as pawns and victims .
There has never been a time in history when it has been easier for most people to know a LOT about what 's going on in the world .
Voters have responsibilities too and the mainstream media is not the only tool available .
Nor are the western powers the sole villains of the story â€ “ victimisation of China is laughable in 2014 .
Yet China gets a pretty gentle run .
For the Pilgerites the evil foreigners are not the Mail 's gypsies or Chinese entrepreneurs resource - grabbing in Africa , but us , white Europeans and their former colonial descendants , mostly in the Anglosphere .
We are the foreigners who invade other people 's worlds and spoil them .
If there was an upside ( there usually was )
it is either not mentioned or discounted .
Pilger likened the death rate in Iraq to the Rwandan genocide on Thursday morning , a dreadful failure of UN non - intervention , but so far as I know it 's not one of his causes .
That 's OK , he ca n't do everything .
But when I listened to Chomsky , erudite and funny , mocking the crimes of the Anglosphere , I was struck by the near absence of any mention of the old Soviet Union 's ( now Putin 's Russia ) opportunist role in the Middle East 's miseries , let alone those Chinese oil contracts .
Palestine is his great cause , but to listen to Chomsky you would not know that Palestinian terrorists had ever bombed an Israeli bus or thrown stones ( and worse ) into crowded cities .
It 's not just good guy / bad guy , it 's more tragic than that .
If I understand correctly , Chomsky explains that he is an American and his duty is to hold American power to account .
OK , but I am not sure it works very well except among the already - converted who do n't need any more help in feeling a warm glow of self - righteous persecution .
By the same token PJ Harvey 's programme included the Guardian 's indefatigable sleuth , Ian Cobain , discussing the British army 's torture record with Phil Shiner , the lawyer who handles Iraqi compensation claims .
It was interesting to anyone who might not know much about the subject , but it was not a very balanced discussion despite the efforts of John Humphrys who did the interview to put the absent army 's side .
Sarah Montague and Mishal Husain were presenting the show , so
Humpo â€ “ who is Daily Mail man incarnate in some ways â€ “ could be seen as one of the guests , a token dissident in the Dorset singer - songwriter 's world .
As it happened , one of the programme 's last items shone some inadvertent light on the problem .
Montague interviewed Professor Robert Service , a tough old Soviet - watcher , on Kim Jong - un 's blood - curling New Year message about why he had to kill his once - loved uncle .
The language of cleansing , of ridding the homeland of contaminating foreign filth , is characteristic of North Korea , of China and the Soviet Union , indeed of all totalitarian regimes , Service explained .
It 's important , too , when broadcasting for the tyrant not to make boasts that his domestic audience will not laugh at in the privacy of their own homes , he said .
Well , such risks and temptations affect us all in milder ways , the impulse to blame the "" other "" .
Whatever its considerable faults elsewhere , western imperialism is not to blame for the grotesque and incompetent communist dynasty which savagely rules North Korea , although China props it up for want of a better solution .
In fairness to Beijing , I doubt if it feels very comfortable with its choice .
That 's life , alas .
Perhaps we will hear more about it on Friday 's edition of the Today programme .

PJ Harvey is Polly Jean , not Polly Jane ."
2014-01-02,"The BBC has come under fire for broadcasting "" incomprehensible liberal drivel "" in a special edition of Radio 4 's Today programme guest - edited by the musician PJ Harvey .
The corporation was accused of allowing left - leaning contributors â€ “ including the WikiLeaks founder , Julian Assange , and the campaigning journalist John Pilger â€ “ to air their views uninterrupted on the flagship radio show on Thursday .
Harvey , who has twice won the Mercury prize , overhauled the show 's usual format of Today to introduce song and poetry , including verse by the former archbishop of Canterbury Rowan Williams and Shaker Aamer , the last British resident held by the United States in GuantÃ¡namo Bay .
The minister for Wales , David Jones MP , led a stream of criticism online , writing that the programme was "" rather unusual "" . ""
Have to wonder who extended the invitation , "" he added .
Colin Bloom , executive director of the Conservative Christian Fellowship , lambasted the show as a "" train wreck of a programme "" and "" incomprehensible liberal drivel "" .
And the Daily Mail 's columnist Stephen Glover denounced the show as "" silly , frivolous and unpatriotic "" .
Most of the criticism was aimed at the leftwing skew of Today 's contributors , including Assange , who used the Thought for the Day slot to defend the leaking of government secrets .
Harvey introduced Assange as a "" person of great courage "" before the whistleblower cited the recent disclosure of surveillance revelations by the whistleblower Edward Snowden as evidence that governments were aspiring to a "" god - like knowledge "" about everyone .
Assange , who has been holed up in an embassy in London for more than a year , said in the broadcast : "" Knowledge is power .
To keep a person ignorant is to place them in a cage .
So it follows that the powerful , if they want to keep their power , will try to know as much about us as they can , and they will try to make sure that we know as little about them as is possible . ""
Kevin Marsh , the former Today editor who introduced the idea of guest editors , described Thursday 's programme as "" odd "" .
He added : "" PJ Harvey is a bit off - the - wall
but that 's the whole point .
It 's not as if you 're saying this is the Today programme of the future : you 're trying to do something that makes people think a little bit â€ ¦ . ""
Would I have put John Pilger on ?
Probably not .
I do n't know what he 's got to say .
Assange has got to be interesting even if you do n't like the guy .
Do you say this man is not allowed on the airwaves ?
I do n't think so . ""
The Labour MP Diane Abbott welcomed the editorial change , saying Harvey "" should do it every day "" .
The Independent 's media editor , Ian Burrell , said the programme did skew to the left , but described it as "" radical and refreshing "" .
The BBC said it had received 37 complaints about the programme , but defended its use of guest editors , which it said came "" from all walks of life "" .
"" The well - established role of the guest editors is to bring their own unique ideas and expertise to the Today programme , working closely with the regular programme team to ensure the material meets the BBC 's editorial guidelines , "" said a BBC spokesman .
This festive season , Today 's guest editors have included the Barclays Bank chief , Antony Jenkins ; the former MI5 director Eliza Manningham - Buller , the traveller and broadcaster Sir Michael Palin , and Tim Berners - Lee , inventor of the world wide web ."
2014-01-02,"This morning the BBC bravely handed over the Today programme to PJ Harvey as guest editor , clearly unconcerned that she might well use the opportunity to take a piercing look at the burning civil war and witch trial issues of 1647 .
Instead , in an "" unusual "" programme , she commissioned business reports from anti - austerity campaigners , organised debates on torture , asked Ralph Fiennes to recite Woody Guthrie lyrics and gave Thought Of The Day over to Julian Assange .
These were , as Harvey explained in her opening statement of intent , "" people I consider to be highly articulate , stimulating and extremely interesting to listen to , people who challenge us and move us to examine our deepest beliefs and feelings , "" each choosing their own method of expression , unedited by the BBC .
What might have turned into a series of abstract haikus hinting at political discontent in Thom Yorke 's hands , three hours of world leaders ' personal call - waiting messages in Bono 's or one long screaming , SoundLink - shattering diatribe about the aliens controlling the Bilderberg Group in Matt Bellamy 's was actually a provocative , shocking and revealing broadcast which tackled topics of financial inequality , oppression , war , torture and censorship head on .
Aside from some of the bigger topics , here 's what we learnt .
Jamie Cullum is a smokescreen At 6.30am we heard a trailer for Cullum 's forthcoming programme Piano Pilgrimage , wherein the purse - faced dullard tours the country tinkling away on the UK 's best and shiniest pianos .
Like Jools Holland with a rucksack , the ad seemed designed by the powers that be to distract us from all the Truth .
Or to tarnish all of the country 's best pianos .
Burn Cullum !
Tom Waits does n't work as a weather forecaster "" The world is getting flatter and the sky is falling all around , "" Waits mumbles as Peej decides to play Strange Weather instead of the rather more helpful regular forecast .
So , whether that means hail or apocalypse , I 'll need an umbrella , Tom ? ""
I never buy umbrellas 'cause there 's always one around "" .
Right .
And in summary ?
"" I believe that brandy 's mine "" .
Clearly .
So that 'll be fog and rain with scattered moroseness and a chance of heavy sclerosis later on .
Thanks .
Now back to the global corruption .
Joan Baez knows the horrors of war Reading on mobile ?
Click here to listen In one of the morning 's most moving segments , war photographer and triple amputee Giles Julie frankly discusses the grisly physical and psychological after - effects of battle injuries with injured war veterans , rounded off with Baez 's sombre take on the traditional protest song Johnny I Hardly Knew Ye .
Twitter falls respectfully silent .
Julian Assange is the new Kanye West
At least , that 's what you begin to think as , in grand Thought
For The Day tradition , he quotes Jesus to justify his information revolution , WikiLeaks portrayed as a kind of Niagara Falls of fact , gushing down towards the common man against the traditionally upward flow of knowledge .
It 's the most controversial part of Harvey 's programme , but also the most righteous - "" to keep a person ignorant is to keep them in a cage , "" Assange says , paying respect to the actions of Edward Snowden and attacking governments for aspiring to "" a God - like knowledge of each and every one of us . ""
Regular listeners may be up in arms , but give the man his damn croissants .
Ralph Fiennes is funky Closing this bold broadcast with a swinging recital of Woody Guthrie 's Ticky Tock , Fiennes sounds like Coriolanus doing skat jazz .
A fittingly awkward end to three hours of hard - hitting humanitarianism , highlighting how all is askew in the world .
Bravo ."

2014-01-15,"Editor 's note : The author is the US attorney for Julian Assange and WikiLeaks .
Last week , both the New York Times and the Guardian released editorials supporting clemency for NSA leaker Edward Snowden .
Considering the important nature of Snowden 's revelations , clemency is definitely in order â€ “
and it 's about time that major outlets recognize that .
However , the focus on Snowden 's singular case seriously deflects from the fact that the Obama administration has been a nightmare for whistleblowers and truth tellers , and that several others currently in prison or in exile deserve the same clemency or clear assurances they will not be prosecuted .
So why is the media now calling for mercy for Edward Snowden , while other truth tellers including Chelsea Manning and Julian Assange , continue to face persecution ( and prosecution ) ?
If you apply the criteria established by both the New York Times and the Guardian to Manning and Assange â€ “ as well as other truth tellers including Jeremy Hammond , currently in prison serving a 10-year sentence after exposing corporate spy networks
â€ “ a clear double standard emerges .
First and foremost , all of these truth tellers exposed or published documents exposing government misdeeds and crimes .
All of the disclosures were of information that was valuable to the public debate of United States war tactics , intelligence gathering and privacy concerns , with no documentable damage to national security interests .
For example , Chelsea Manning exposed American involvement in torture centers in Iraq , an unauthorized war in Yemen , and the so - called "" collateral murder "" of thousands of Iraqi citizens .
Manning brought the "" Collateral Murder "" video and other documents to Wikileaks after going to people above her in the chain of command who refused to act .
In fact , none of these truth tellers had another way to get this information out , which should afford them protections from prosecution .
Throughout Manning 's case , it became clear that the government could not prove that her disclosures did any significant harm to national security .
And yet this young soldier is still facing exorbitant time in prison , because the information she revealed casts a dark shadow on the United States ' war tactics .
The "" incredible value "" that the New York Times and the Guardian ascribed to the Snowden leaks is clearly present in the Manning disclosures , which exposed the brutal and illegal nature of America 's wars in Iraq and Afghanistan .
Manning 's disclosures opened up an entirely new public debate on the nature of modern war and diplomacy .
And yet none of these other truth tellers have received the kind of public and media support that this set of editorials represents , perhaps because there is a fundamental difference between Manning 's disclosures and Assange 's publication of Wikileaks , when compared to Snowden 's revelations on NSA intelligence gathering .
Manning and Assange exposed information pertaining to American activities abroad , actions that affected foreign nationals rather than American citizens .
Americans are clearly outraged by the unprecedented level of surveillance they 're being subjected to by their own government , which is perhaps why so many are now calling for a deal for Snowden .
Nowhere near the same amount of public outrage has been mustered for Manning and Assange , whose disclosures mostly effect situations far from home .
But this should n't excuse war crimes , or condemn those who tried to shine light on them .
Instead , Manning , Assange and Hammond have all been subjected to unfair character assassination , resulting in ignominious imprisonment for Manning and Hammond , and the continued detention of Assange in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London , where he remains isolated due to the knowledge that leaving will mean almost certain imprisonment in the United States .
But Manning , Assange , and Hammond all did their civic duty by disclosing information on government overreaching .
They all exhibited great moral courage in doing so .
And they all deserve far more than unfair imprisonment and exile for the service they have done for the American people and for people all around the world ."
2014-02-05,"He has played the great English sleuth Sherlock Holmes , voiced magnificent dragon Smaug , slipped on the wig of Julian Assange and even stepped into the shoes of the late great Ricardo Montalban as supremely bright Star Trek villain Khan .
Yet Benedict Cumberbatch has now proved himself as capable a brain as the parts he 's played after solving a maths riddle on Sesame Street .
Cumberbatch appears with series stalwarts the Count and Murray Monster in a new segment for the long - running US children 's show .
Charged with defeating his nemesis , "" Murraryarty "" , the actor â€ “ referred to as Benedict Sherlock , is put through the intellectual wringer with a counting challenge involving a number of apples and oranges .
With the help of the Count , he successfully solves the mystery .
Cumberbatch is said to have taped the appearance in January while promoting the new series of the BBC 's Sherlock in the US .
He follows in the footsteps of fellow thespians Amy Adams , Glenn Close , Robert De Niro , Tom Hiddleston , Jamie Lee Curtis , Nicole Kidman , Mila Kunis and Cameron Diaz , all of whom have appeared on the long - running show ."
2014-02-21,"The ghostwriter who collaborated with Julian Assange on his abortive 2011 autobiography has broken his silence to describe his months working with the WikiLeaks founder , which culminated in the acrimonious collapse of one of the highest profile and most lucrative book deals of recent times .
Three years after he was first introduced to the Australian , Andrew O'Hagan has now spoken out about how he worked with Assange on the book , which he said the publishers Canongate had sold in more than 40 countries for a total of US$ 2.5 m before the deal dramatically imploded .
In a lengthy , nuanced essay for the London Review of Books , a version of which he delivered in a lecture in London on Friday , O'Hagan describes working with a mercurial character who was , by turns , passionate , funny , lazy , courageous , vain , paranoid , moral and manipulative .
The book deal ultimately collapsed , O'Hagan writes , because "" the man who put himself in charge of disclosing the world 's secrets simply could n't bear his own .
The story of his life mortified him and sent him scurrying for excuses .
He did n't want to do the book .
He had n't from the beginning . ""
Assange , he writes , was persuaded to agree to the autobiography by his lawyers who said the huge sums on offer would cover his mounting legal costs .
He had initially been enthusiastic about the project , telling his ghostwriter that he "" hoped to have something that read like Hemingway "" , and suggesting ever more avant garde styles for the book to take , such as writing the first chapter with one word , the second with two , and so on .
But O'Hagan reveals that as the deadline to deliver a manuscript approached , Assange was "" totally shocked "" at the prospect of his own story being told , describing people who write about their family as "" prostitutes "" .
Exasperated at their author 's non - co - operation and hoping to reclaim a proportion of their significant stake , Canongate published a version of O'Hagan 's manuscript as Julian Assange :
The Unauthorised Biography in September 2011 without the Australian 's consent .
Though Assange denounced its publication , he told O'Hagan that he was covertly encouraging sales and tweeting links to its Amazon page .
That strategy failed : despite its huge advance and publicity , the book sold fewer than 700 copies in its first week , a spectacular publishing failure .
O'Hagan , an award - winning , Booker - nominated novelist and non - fiction writer , was brought into the project in January 2011 when Assange was living with a group of supporters at Ellingham Hall in Norfolk , while on bail over allegations of rape and sexual assault in Sweden .
The "" studenty WikiLeaks charabanc "" was at times bold and highly effective , writes O'Hagan â€ “ during the Egyptian uprising , when president Mubarak tried to close the country 's phone network which was routed through Canada , he describes Assange and other staffers hacking into the Canadian telecom firm from their Norfolk kitchen table to reverse the Mubarak shutdown , then leaning back to eat chocolates as the revolution continued .
Former Cuban president Fidel Castro , the ghostwriter was told , had sent a message to say WikiLeaks was the only website he liked .
But the Australian 's suspicion of the authorities led to a broader paranoia , writes O'Hagan , describing one car journey in which Assange demanded the writer pull off a small country road to avoid a white Mondeo that he was convinced was tailing them , but which turned out to be a taxi dropping a child off from school .
A trip to the local police station , which Assange was obliged to visit daily as a condition of his bail , was completed only after Sarah Harrison , described by O'Hagan as Assange 's PA and girlfriend , had checked the bushes for assassins .
It was , by O'Hagan 's account , an occasionally surreal life : one of those who flew to Ellingham Hall by helicopter to pay court was the billionaire Matthew Mellon , who later sent a delivery of Savile Row suits by designer Oswald Boateng which Assange then wore constantly .
When a group of company presidents offered a fee of Â£20,000 for an hour 's Skype time with Assange , he told Harrison : "" If Tony Blair â€ “ a war criminal â€ “ can get Â£120,000 , I should get at least Â£1 more than him . ""
The WikiLeaks founder was highly vocal on the subject of former collaborators whom he now regarded as "" enemies
"" â€ “ a long list to which his publishers would ultimately be added , writes O'Hagan , but among which the Guardian and New York Times were judged as particular offenders .
Assange regarded this newspaper as having "" double - crossed "" him , writes O'Hagan .
"" It was an early sign of the way he viewed ' collaboration ' : the Guardian was an enemy because he 'd ' given ' them something
and they had n't toed the line , whereas the Daily Mail was almost respected for finding him entirely abominable . ""
He describes the Australian as being "" a little put out by the global superstardom "" of Edward Snowden following his leaks to Glenn Greenwald and the Guardian .
While Snowden was marooned in Moscow airport , writes O'Hagan , "" Julian was keen to help him and keen to be seen to be helping him "" ; shortly afterwards Assange sent Harrison to Moscow where she acted for a time as the American 's "" legal advisor "" .
When he asked Assange "" just how good "" was Snowden , O'Hagan writes , he was told : "" He 's number nine . ""
"" In the world ?
Among computer hackers ?
And where are you ? ""
"" I 'm number three . ""
The relationship between O'Hagan and Assange remained amicable throughout their collaboration â€ “ even as the book deal collapsed , Assange described it as a "" close friendship "" â€ “ and the two have remained on good terms until recently .
( The Australian , he concedes , will "" hate this "" â€ “ meaning his lecture â€ “ but in signing on with a ghostwriter , Assange "" forgot what a writer is , someone with a tendency to write things down and seek the truth "" . )
However , O'Hagan says Assange 's contradictions "" could rock you off your feet "" : during the making of The Fifth Estate , the recent Assange biopic ( based in part on a book by Guardian journalists ) which he angrily denounced , O'Hagan describes being called by Assange one day to suggest that the writer offer himself as a consultant to the movie and split his fee with him .
But while the ghostwriter writes of feeling "" a kind of loyalty to Julian 's vulnerability , especially ( not in spite of ) his role as enemy to himself "" , the "" clarifying "" moment in their relationship came in May 2011 when Assange had tried persuade O'Hagan to join him in flying to the Hay festival in a Daily Telegraph helicopter , to promote a book that by that time "" we both knew he would never produce "" . ""
He wanted me to see him on the helicopter
and he wanted me to assist him in living out that version of himself he so craves .
He was flying in from Neverland with his own personal JM Barrie ...
What could be nicer for the lost boy of Queensland with his silver hair and his sense that the world of adults is no real place for him ? ""
Pondering on the enigma that is Assange , O'Hagan concludes that it is difficult to determine whether the WikiLeaks founder is another Daniel Ellsberg , the Pentagon Papers leaker , or John Wilkes , the 18th - century radical politician , or the fictional character Charles Foster Kane , who was "" abusive and monstrous in his pursuit of the truth that interests him , and a man who , it turns out , was motivated all the while not by high principles but by a deep sentimental wound .
Perhaps we wo n't know until the final frames of the movie . """
2014-02-26,"An 11th - hour move to Udineseâ€ ™ s feeder club could not save Lucas Neill .
Much has been made of Neillâ€ ™ s future in the Socceroos after his extended sabbatical from regular first - team football .
When he was picked to play against Costa Rica late last year in Ange Postecoglouâ€ ™ s first match in charge , a few eyebrows were raised .
Announced on Wednesday , Postecoglouâ€ ™ s squad to face Ecuador is one for the future .
There is no Neill , no Harry Kewell .
Aside from Tim Cahill , Mark Milligan , Mile Jedinak , Matt McKay and Luke Wilkshire , none of the squad members can be classed as regulars .
Curtis Good , Massimo Luongo , Chris Herd and Ben Halloran are all in line for their first Socceroos caps , while quiet achievers such as Mat Ryan , Adam Sarota , James Holland , Dario Vidosic , Matthew Leckie and Oliver Bozanic , all of whom ply their trade on the continent , have been named in the 23-man squad .
Ange has been true to his word .
Since he took charge late last year , he has made it clear that he will only select players who appear regularly for their clubs .
Leaving Neill out might have been expected â€ “ even called for â€ “
but it is still a statement of intent to drop the captain .
Asked who would replace Neill , Postecoglou played hard - to - get .
He has also been coy on selecting players who play in the Middle East , commenting previously that the football â€œis a slower pace and we want to play a high - intensity , high - tempo kind of game.â€
�
The likes of Alex Brosque , Brett Holman and Mark Bresciano , all of whom play in the Gulf states , have been overlooked for this squad , although Bresciano is currently serving a Fifa ban and is unable to play for his club in Qatar .
Ryan McGowan , who plays for Shandong Luneng , is the only squad member currently playing in Asia .
Fan favourites and media darlings Tom Rogic and Matthew Spiranovic have also been selected , although questions remain over Rogicâ€ ™ s fitness after he was trod upon by a team - mate in Melbourne Victoryâ€ ™ s win over Adelaide United last weekend .
Indeed , there are positive signals in the amount of players who have progressed through the A - League to the national team .
Rogic , Spiranovic , McKay , Milligan and Ivan Franjic are currently playing for A - League clubs , while Bozanic , Good , Halloran , Holland , Jedinak , Leckie , Oar , Sarota , Vidosic , Ryan and Mitch Langerak began their careers in the A - League before moving abroad .
A - League players such as Michael Zullo and James Troisi might have hoped for a call - up , but still , the pathway is becoming increasingly clearer for young Australian players .
Interestingly , there are no out - and - out , fire - breathing , give - me - the - ball - to - my - feet type centre forwards in this squad .
Beanpole striker Josh Kennedy has been overlooked , and it is expected Tim Cahill will lead the forward line .
Although Western Sydney Wanderers gun - for - hire Tomi Juric suffered a hamstring strain over the weekend , one wonders whether he , or Kennedy , will figure in Postecoglouâ€ ™ s plans at all .
Is Juric still too raw , or is it that he and Kennedy arenâ€ ™ t the type of players Postecoglou is looking for in the final third ?
The ghost of Mark Viduka still haunts the Socceroos .
With a five - year contract and three major tournaments ahead of him , Postecoglou is doing what previous Socceroos coaches Pim Verbeek and Holger Osieck failed to do : plan .
â€œThe squad to face Ecuador represents the first steps in what I believe is the building of the next golden generation for Australian football , â€ � Postecoglou said .
â€œIt makes sense to me to start looking at building a new core in the team.â€ �
With a horror draw in Brazil , few expect the Socceroos to progress past the first round .
Australian fans will , however , want to see signs that there are foundations being laid , and players are being selected on form rather than reputation .
The Socceroos best chance of silverware is at the 2015 Asian Cup , which will be held on home soil .
This is the last squad that Postecoglou will experiment with before naming his World Cup squad in May. â€œSelection in the final squad for the World Cup is still very much an open door , â€ � Postecoglou said .
â€œThere were quite a few players , particularly those in Asia whose leagues are just beginning , who are still very much on the radar.â€ �
The Socceroos will play Ecuador at The Den in London on 5 March .
The question is , with the Ecuadorian embassy just over the Thames , will Julian Assange be allowed a brief respite to watch the country of his birth take on the country that has provided him political asylum ?
At least let him venture out to sink a few pints at the Walkabout pub in Watford .
Perhaps Lucas Neill can join him ."
2014-03-16,"1 The debate over online privacy is just getting started The big draws at the interactive arm of SXSW were n't actually there : National Security Agency whistleblower Edward Snowden and WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange appeared via videolink from Russia and the Ecuadorian embassy in London respectively .
The setting for their keynote speeches , a huge room of 3,500 people paying rapt attention to a man on a giant screen , felt eerily like Nineteen Eighty Four .
The key theme for both was that the discussions over online surveillance and digital privacy are just getting started .
"" We are all involved in what we traditionally called the state , whether we like it or not , "" said Assange . ""
So we have no choice but to try to manage the behaviour of the state that we have been forced to be part of . ""
Snowden called for internet users to get to grips with encryption and anonymous web browsing technology and encouraged technology companies to make them more accessible . ""
The NSA is setting fire to the future of the internet and you guys are the firefighters , "" he said .
2 Two of this year 's best documentaries focus on British musicians Two film premieres focused on UK pop stars .
The theme of The Possibilities are Endless is a journey back to health for the singer and guitarist Edwyn Collins , who suffered a debilitating stroke in 2005 .
It tracked his recovery , intercutting archive footage of his career with Orange Juice with his return to live performing and composition : it 's a beautiful piece of work even when at its most deliberately unsettling .
Gruff Rhys of Super Furry Animals showed and talked about his American Interior documentary , which starts as a whimsical journey to the heart of the US in the footsteps of a distant ancestor who went in search of a mythical Welsh - speaking Native American tribe .
As the film goes on and Rhys meets the last native speaker of the Mandan tribe 's language , it makes some thought - provoking points about the fragility of culture â€ “ issues that will be expanded on in a companion app and book later this year .

The stars of Girls are suffering from Hollywood typecasting HBO 's hit TV show Girls has been acclaimed across the world , but its star and creator Lena Dunham used her speech to point out the industry sexism that continues to stymie her female colleagues , even as male star Adam Driver prospers .
"" People are ready to see Adam play a million different guys in one year
â€ “ from lotharios to villains to nerds .
Meanwhile Allison Williams , Jemima Kirke and Zosia Mamet are still waiting for parts they can get interested in , "" said Dunham , suggesting that most of the offers they receive are for "" high school ditzes "" .
Even Dunham is struggling for decent roles .
"" There 's no place for me in the studio system , "" she said , while stressing that she is happy for Driver 's success .
4 Neil Young wants to shake up the digital music world Neil Young came not just to talk music , but to talk technology too .
He used his appearance to launch a campaign on crowdfunding website Kickstarter for his PonoPlayer music gadget and PonoMusic downloads store .
The motivation behind both : to sell music files with a higher audio quality than is available in stores such as Apple 's iTunes .
"" It 's about the music , real music .
We want to move digital music into the 21st century and PonoMusic does that , "" said Young .
Enough people agreed with him to have pledged $ 2.9 m on Kickstarter in the first three days after his speech .
There were some sceptics , though , including those pointing out that many smartphones are already capable of playing the high - resolution files that PonoMusic will be selling .

Nasa is crowdsourcing the hunt for hazardous asteroids
Neil Young was n't the only one seeking help from the crowd .
Space agency Nasa used the show to launch Asteroid Data Hunter : a set of contests offering prize money to developers who help it better identify potentially hazardous asteroids using ground - based telescopes .
The agency has identified 98 % of the larger - than-1 km asteroids that could cause a dinosaur - style mass extinction if they collided with Earth .
Now it 's hunting down the million - plus more smaller asteroids that could wipe out a city .
Nasa 's Jason Kessler said : "" This is not us coming to say that we 've got this problem solved .
We want to join a conversation . ""
6 Big stars ( and brands ) are now flocking to SXSW SXSW veterans will happily bang on about how much better the event was when it was younger , smaller and mainly focused on new bands hoping to make a name for themselves .
They 're all still playing the bars of Austin , but in 2014 , the big stars and brands were out in force too .
Lady Gaga played a gig for Doritos , with fans and journalists asked to complete social media tasks to qualify for entry .
Apple transplanted its London iTunes festival to Texas , with Coldplay , Pitbull and other big stars in tow .
Samsung hosted a gig by Kanye West and Jay - Z , while even Justin Bieber showed up to play an acoustic number at a sausage restaurant called Banger 's .
It reinforced SXSW as a place where headlines are made , not just careers .
7 Kevin Bacon has come to terms with the Six Degrees game Who could rival the likes of Assange and Snowden for a hotly attended event ?
Kevin Bacon might have made the biggest splash , in a session celebrating the 20th anniversary of the Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon meme that , initially at least , he hated .
"" I was horrified by it .
I thought it was a giant joke at my expense , "" Bacon said .
"" I appreciate it now .
But I was very resistant to it . ""
Now he 's more relaxed about what the game â€ “ which assigns a "" Bacon number "" to any celebrity based on the number of professional steps they are away from Bacon .
"" I do n't think it 's a great testament to my ability .
My movies just happen to be on a lot , "" he said , before posing for a Vine video in front of the audience that , by the rules of the game , gave them all a Bacon number of one .
8 Algorithms may be more powerful than editors in the news world
How do twentysomethings and teenagers get their news online ?
"" If news is going to find you , it 's going to find you because of an algorithm , "" said Kelly McBride of Florida journalism school
The Poynter Institute , talking about how Facebook , Twitter and Google decide which news stories to show their users .
Will those algorithms be biased towards populist stories and penalise serious fare ?
Eli Pariser , CEO of news website Upworthy , which attracts up to 60 million people a month to stories about income inequality , climate change and human rights that are designed to be shared on Facebook , claimed not .
But he admitted that "" these little pieces of code are more powerful now than a lot of the most powerful editors in media "" .
9 Wearable gadgets are the next big thing in technology While Snowden was encouraging people to think more about digital privacy , the big hardware topic â€ “ wearable gadgets â€ “ was based on them potentially sharing even more of their personal data with the world .
No wonder Google is interested , announcing plans for "" Android for wearables "" so that its smartphone and tablet software can be used for a new wave of smart watches , fitness - tracking gadgets and other devices .
"" We see a world of sensors .
Sensors can be small and powerful , and gather a lot of information that can be useful for users , "" said Google exec Sundar Pichai .
A host of sessions debating the potential for smart health and location - based services on these gadgets backed up his suggestion .
10 Cat videos are n't just popular : they 're lucrative too One key lesson : if someone brings Grumpy Cat into the room , half your audience will be lost trying to take her picture .
That was the jostling scene in a session devoted to "" the economics of internet cat videos "" with an array of startling facts .
The Internet Cat Video festival outsold Depeche Mode by 3,000 tickets at last year 's Minnesota State Fair
; a philosophical cat called Henri Le Chat Noir 's YouTube channel earns $ 10 in advertising for every 1,000 views ; and the Grumpy Cat book has spent 10 weeks on the New York Times bestseller list this year .
All this is based on a keen online fanbase for cats .
"" There 's an evolution of the crazy cat lady , "" said Animal Planet 's Grace Suriel .
"" From all walks of life , people have cat dresses , cat tattoos â€

2014-03-24,"Greens senator Scott Ludlam is reportedly trying to have WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange and NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden called before a Senate committee to testify about mass surveillance of Australian citizens .
Ludlam successfully had the inquiry commissioned in December 2013 , to review what he called the â€œdeeply flawedâ€ � Telecommunications ( Interception and Access ) Act , which has , since the September 11 terrorist attacks in 2001 , been amended to give the government greater powers to monitor peopleâ€ ™ s phones and activities online . ""
The scope and reach of the laws were unprecedented , and included extraordinary powers of surveillance , detention and restriction and censorship on speech , â€ � Ludlam said in December .
"" Since the revelations of Edward Snowden , the Senate has repeatedly voted to avoid knowing what is going on , until today failing in its primary duty as a parliament.â€ � The ABC reports that Ludlam will be seeking to have Snowden and Assange appear before the committee via videolink .
Snowden last year leaked thousands of classified documents to the Guardian revealing widespread collection of private data by spy agencies in the US and its allies around the world .
Among the revelations leaked by Snowden was evidence that Australia targeted the private phones of the Indonesian president , Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono , his wife , and senior Indonesian government officials .
Snowden has been charged with espionage in the US , and has sought temporary asylum in Russia .
Assange has spent more than a year living under diplomatic protection in the Ecuadorian embassy in London , avoiding extradition to Sweden to face allegations of sexual assault .
A spokeswoman for Ludlamâ€ ™ s office would not confirm the reports , saying the witness list for the committee hearings is strictly confidential .
The committee is due to report in June ."
2014-04-03,"Julian Assange is writing a "" major "" new book , in which the Wikileaks founder details his vision for the "" future of the internet "" as well as his encounter in 2011 with Google chairman Eric Schmidt â€ “ a meeting which his publisher described as "" an historic dialogue "" between "" the North and South poles of the internet "" .
The book , When Google Met WikiLeaks , will be published in September this year , announced publisher OR Books this morning .
It will recount how , in June 2011 when Assange was living under house arrest at Ellingham Hall in Norfolk , Schmidt and "" an entourage of US State Department alumni including a top former adviser to Hillary Clinton "" visited for several hours and "" locked horns "" with the Wikileaks founder . ""
The two men debated the political problems faced by human society , and the technological solutions engendered by the global network â€ “ from the Arab Spring to Bitcoin .
They outlined radically opposing perspectives : for Assange , the liberating power of the internet is based on its freedom and statelessness .
For Schmidt , emancipation is at one with US foreign policy objectives and is driven by connecting non - western countries to American companies and markets .
These differences embodied a tug - of - war over the internet 's future that has only gathered force subsequently , "" said OR Books in its announcement .
The title will include an edited transcript of the conversation between Schmidt and Assange , as well as new material written by Assange , who has been confined to the Ecuadorian embassy , in London , for the last 18 months .
The book will provide "" the best available summary of his vision for the future of the internet "" , said the publisher , including his proposal for "" a radical overhaul of the naming structure of the internet , one which would revolutionise the way information is accessed "" . ""
By coupling the intellectual content of a document to its online name â€ “ doing away with the haphazard URL system â€ “ Assange outlines a potential future for the internet that would make it faster and much more difficult to censor , "" said OR Books .
The author will also denounce Schmidt 's "" world view "" â€ “ which he says "" equates progress with the geographic expansion of Google , supported by the US State Department "" â€ “ as "" technocratic imperialism "" .
OR Books , a small New York press which calls itself a "" new type of publishing company "" , has previously published Assange 's Cypherpunks .
Founder Colin Robinson defended his author last month following a revelatory account by Assange 's former ghostwriter Andrew O'Hagan in the London Review of Books about the problems of working with him .
O'Hagan wrote that "" the man who put himself in charge of disclosing the world 's secrets simply could n't bear his own .
The story of his life mortified him and sent him scurrying for excuses .
He did n't want to do the book .
He had n't from the beginning . ""
Robinson , however , said that O'Hagan focused on Assange 's "" character defects "" , while passing over his "" achievements in uncovering the misdemeanours of the secret state "" .
Cypherpunks , he said , was the publisher 's bestselling title , and while he describes himself as "" Julian Assange 's publisher , not his friend "" , Robinson said he was "" acutely aware of [ Assange 's ] achievements , which seem to me to be both substantial and generally on the side of justice "" ."
2014-04-27,"George Clooney , Hollywood 's most celebrated bachelor , is reportedly engaged to a British human rights lawyer .
The 52-year - old actor and Amal Alamuddin , 36 , a Beirut - born barrister , have bought an engagement ring and shared the news with friends , according to various celebrity news sources .
Alamuddin , who is fluent in French and Arabic , has represented Julian Assange , the Wikileaks founder , and Yulia Tymoshenko , a former prime minister of Ukraine .
The couple reportedly displayed the ring to Clooney 's business partner , Rande Gerber , and his wife , the model Cindy Crawford , over sushi at a Nobu restaurant in Malibu over the weekend .
â€œGeorge and Amal are trying to keep things very low - key
but they also are n't really trying to hide this
, it does n't seem , â€ � an unnamed source , said to be close to the couple , told People magazine .
â€œI think it 's like they want the people they love to know that this is real , that they plan on being together forever.â€ �
According to E !
News , when the actor Edward Norton dropped by during the meal the couple told him they were engaged , prompting congratulatory kisses .
Clooney 's agent , Stan Rosenfield , declined to comment on the reports , saying he did not comment on personal matters â€ “ a change from last October , celebrity buffs noted , when Rosenfield said the actor and the lawyer were just friends .
After the end of a four - year marriage to actress Talia Balsam in 1993 , Clooney famously vowed to not marry again , saying he was n't very good at it .
He kept his word through a string of relationships with models and actors .
The star of Batman and Robin , Ocean 's Eleven and The Descendants â€ “ who won a supporting - actor Oscar for Syriana and was nominated as director of Good Night , and Good Luck â€ “ dated the former wrestler Stacy Kiebler , a relationship which ended last July , soon after which he was spotted on safari in Tanzania with Alamuddin .
A graduate of St Hugh 's College at Oxford and New York University School of Law , Alamuddin works out of the Doughty Street Chambers in London , specialising in human rights and international law .
According to the chambers ' website , she has served as counsel to the inquiry led by United Nations special rapporteur on counter - terrorism and human rights , Ben Emmerson QC , into the use of drones , and as an adviser to Kofi Annan , the joint special envoy of the UN and the Arab League on Syria .
Clooney has campaigned for liberal causes in the US and human - rights causes abroad , notably in Darfur .
He is also known for a penchant for younger women , a point co - host Tina Fey noted at the Golden Globes earlier this year .
The comedian called the award - winning Gravity , in which Clooney stars with the 49-year - old Sandra Bullock , "" a story about how George Clooney would rather float away into space and die than spend one more minute with a woman his own age "" .

2014-06-05,"Dreamgirls director Bill Condon will take charge of Disney 's live action reimagining of Beauty and the Beast , which is moving forward in the wake of success of Maleficent , according to the Hollywood Reporter .
Condon , who most recently directed the final two films in the Twilight saga and Julian Assange drama
The Fifth Estate , will hope to ape the impressive box office opening for the studio 's revisionist take on the Sleeping Beauty fairy tale .
Starring Angelina Jolie in the title role , Maleficent took $ 170 m worldwide on its weekend debut .
Beauty and the Beast , whose last big screen incarnation was a 1991 hand - drawn musical animation , also follows Disney 's Oz the Great and Powerful ( a prequel to The Wizard of Oz ) and Alice in Wonderland into cinemas .
Disney has a live action take on The Jungle Book , its classic 1967 musical animation , in development .
First revealed in March by Deadline , Disney 's latest fantasy was referred to as The Beast in the initial report .
The famous story will most likely be tweaked for a new era if the studio is staying true to form : Alice in Wonderland was a sequel of sorts , in which Alice returns to Lewis Carroll 's subterranean netherworld as a teenager , while Oz the Great and Powerful recounts the wizard 's arrival in Oz , and Maleficent examines the Sleeping Beauty story from the evil queen 's perspective .
Condon 's Dreamgirls , a thinly veiled retelling of the story of The Supremes , won two Oscars in 2007 .
Condon also wrote the Oscar - winning musical Chicago for director Rob Marshall .

2014-06-18,"Lawyers for Julian Assange , the WikiLeaks founder who on Thursday marks his second anniversary holed up in the Ecuadorian embassy in London , are preparing to file a challenge to his detention order in Sweden in a move that could impact the state of legal limbo in which he is trapped .
Jennifer Robinson , Assangeâ€ ™ s UK - based lawyer , told reporters that the legal challenge , which is due to be lodged with Swedish courts next Tuesday , was based on â€œnew information gathered in Swedenâ€ � .
She declined to give any further details until the filing had been made .
News of the challenge was the first indication in months of any possible way out of the legal deadlock in which Assange has fallen since he took refuge in the Ecuadorian embassy on 19 June 2012 .
Since then , the embassy has been ringed with British police 24 hours a day , at a cost of more than Â£6 m ( $ 10 m ) to the taxpayer , as the UK government seeks to enforce an extradition order to send the WikiLeaks publisher to Sweden .
The Swedish detention order that Assange is now challenging was issued in November 2010 .
It requires the founder of the free information website to be arrested and extradited to Sweden to face questioning over the alleged sexual assault of two women in that country .
Assange and his legal advisers have always protested that were he to cooperate with the British and Swedish authorities , he would expose himself to an ongoing criminal investigation by the US Department of Justice .
The DoJ is known to have opened a grand jury investigation into WikiLeaksâ€ ™ publication of a vast tranche of secret official documents leaked by the US army private Chelsea Manning
( Bradley Manning at the time ) .
In a telephone press conference on the eve of the second anniversary of his asylum in the embassy , Assange called on the US attorney general , Eric Holder , to put a stop to the investigation .
â€œIt is against the stated principles of the US and I believe the values supported by its people to have a four - year criminal investigation against a publisher .
The on - going existence of that investigation produces a chilling effect not just to internet - based publishers but to all publishers , â€ � he said .
WikiLeaks caused a global sensation in 2010 when it began publishing , in collaboration with international news organisations including the Guardian , hundreds of thousands of confidential US files including diplomatic cables , warlogs from Iraq and Afghanistan , and a video of a US apache helicopter attack in Baghdad .
The US government convened a grand jury to investigate WikiLeaksâ€ ™ role in the leak , although it has been reported that charges have not been filed .
Since his retreat into the Ecuadorian embassy , Assange has also played a key role in the fleeing of Edward Snowden , the former National Security Agency contractor , from Hong Kong to Russia .
WikiLeaks staffers last year helped Snowden evade arrest and secure temporary asylum in Moscow .
Assange declined to say whether he has been in personal contact with Snowden .
He also declined to say whether WikiLeaks has had access to the mountain of secret documents from the NSA and its British counterpart , GCHQ , leaked by Snowden .
The WikiLeaks founder said that were next weekâ€
™ s challenge successful in lifting the Swedish detention order , he would still face â€œthe larger problem of the US and its pending prosecution and perhaps extradition warrantâ€ � as well as any possible arrest by the UK government for his role in the Snowden affair .
But he said it would be an important first step as it would remove â€œan extremely distracting political attack which has been to try and draw attention away from the largest criminal investigation ever by the department of justice into a publisher and me personallyâ€ � .
Despite attempts by Assange and his lawyers to focus attention on the US governmentâ€ ™ s investigation into WikiLeaks , he continues to face public criticism for his refusal to subject himself to questioning in Sweden on the sexual assault allegations .
A reporter from the UK broadcaster Channel Four News accused Assange of failing to abide by his own principles of global transparency , to which he replied : â€œOh here we go , Channel 4 News , this is the state of the media in the UK.â€ � Assange gave few details about how he was coping personally with living in cramped conditions in the embassy .
He said he was watching the World Cup , supporting the Ecuador team , though television reception in the embassy was poor .
â€œPerhaps it makes it more difficult for the bugs to transmit through the walls as well , â€ � he quipped .
Asked how he was coping on the second anniversary , he deflected the question by saying there were other people in more difficult circumstances .
He pointed to Manning who has been sentenced to 35 years in military custody for leaking the WikiLeaks material and is currently being held in Fort Leavenworth in Kansas .
Assange repeatedly referred to the soldier as â€œheâ€ � even though Chelsea Manning has legally changed her name and now requests that she is addressed as a woman ."

2014-06-24,"Lawyers for Julian Assange have called for controversial telephone evidence to be released as they made a fresh attempt to break the deadlock in the rape case brought four years ago against the WikiLeaks founder .
Filing a challenge to the prosecution in the Swedish courts , lawyers for Assange â€ “ who last week marked the second anniversary of his asylum in Ecuador 's embassy in London â€ “ said a recent revision to Swedish law requires evidence held by the prosecution to be made available to the defence .
Text messages sent by the two women plaintiffs were seen by defence lawyers in 2010 , but copies of the messages were not issued to them .
Assange has claimed that text messages sent by one of his accusers show that she was ambiguous about his arrest and even opposed to it . ""
The messages strongly suggest that there is no basis for the arrest and they are thus vital so that he [ Assange ] can effectively tackle the arrest warrant , "" the lawyers say in documents filed with Stockholm district court on Tuesday .
The court said the request would be assessed within a few days by judge Bertil Sundin , who declined to comment .
The Swedish detention order that Assange is challenging requires him to be extradited to Sweden to face questioning over the alleged rape and sexual assault of two women there in August 2010 .
Assange claims cooperation with the British and Swedish authorities would expose him to an ongoing criminal investigation by the US Department of Justice into WikiLeaks activity .
Sweden 's code of judicial procedure was updated on 1 June to conform with EU law , and now includes a provision that anyone arrested or detained has the right to be made aware of "" facts forming the basis for the decision to arrest "" .
"" There is material in the prosecutor 's possession that we know is to Julian Assange 's advantage , "" said his lawyer Thomas Olsson , based in Stockholm .
"" The new law enables her to release that new material , which has been in the prosecutor 's possession from the start
â€
¦
We have seen the text messages but have not been able to use them because we could not demand that the prosecutor hand them over as evidence to the court .
"" The new law was "" a little bit of a revolution "" in Swedish legal procedure , Olsson said .
Bengt Ivarsson , president of the Swedish Bar Association , confirmed that since 1 June a suspect has had the right to be made aware of "" all the circumstances that have influenced a court 's decision "" , so all the papers for the prosecution must be handed over to the defendant . ""
The new law gives us more power , "" said Per Samuelson , another lawyer for Assange in Stockholm , who said they had also written directly to the prosecutor on Tuesday to request the text messages .
"" In 2011 we were allowed to read them and memorise them , but we do not have the full messages .
"" Î
©
The lawyers also argue that the "" severe limitations on Mr Assange 's fundamental freedoms "" over the past four years are "" unreasonable and disproportionate "" .
They further attest that the arrest warrant should be rescinded because it can not be implemented , owing to Assange 's asylum in the Ecuadorean embassy . ""
Under Swedish law , if a detention decision is not useful for its purpose , then it must be rescinded , "" Samuelson said .
Swedish legal opinion at a senior level has swung against the prosecutor 's decision not to travel to London to interview Assange , with Anne Ramberg , head of the Bar Association , calling the current impasse a "" circus "" .
Elisabeth Massi Fritz , a lawyer for one of the women in the case , did not respond to telephone and email requests for comment .
Interviewed this year , she said her client would wait as long as it takes to get justice in court , even if Assange stayed in the Ecuadorean embassy until the statute of limitations on the case expired in 2020 .
The Swedish prosecutor declined a request to comment ."
2014-07-03,"Prosecutors in Sweden pursuing Julian Assange over rape allegations have rejected a demand by his lawyers to hand over new evidence and withdraw the warrant for his arrest , setting the stage in two weeks ' time for the first legal battle in the case since 2012 .
In a sharply worded rebuttal , prosecutors stated that Assange does not have the right to see copies of the case files .
Lawyers for the WikiLeaks founder requested last week that text messages sent by his accusers be passed to the defence in an attempt to break the deadlock in the rape case brought four years ago against him .
"" There is still probable cause to believe that Julian Assange is guilty of the offences that he was arrested for , and the basis for his detention , risk of flight , is undiminished , "" prosecutors Marianne Ny and Ingred Isgren said in a submission to Stockholm district court .
The court announced on Thursday that the two sides will present their arguments on 16 July in a public hearing â€ “ the first formal legal discussion of the case since Assange sought asylum in the Ecuadorean embassy in London two years ago .
Dismissing the lawyers ' argument that restrictions on Assange 's "" fundamental freedoms "" since the allegations were made in 2010 are unreasonable and disproportionate , the prosecutors said Assange 's confinement in the embassy is voluntary and "" can not be equated with detention "" . ""
In our opinion , when assessing proportionality , only the time [ detained ] for questioning in the English courts should be taken into account , "" the prosecutors said .
Assange was held for just 10 days in December 2010 , they point out .
They also reiterated their refusal to travel to London to interview Assange in the embassy , which is seen by some Swedish politicians and senior legal figures as a possible first step to resolving the case .
Legal experts say that new legislation on a suspect 's right to see evidence in the case before trial is open to different interpretations and has yet to be tested in court . ""
The law states specifically that this provision does not give the suspect the right to have copies of case files , "" the prosecutors said in their rebuttal .
On Thursday Stockholm district court extended the invitation to Assange to appear at the hearing in two weeks ' time .
Writing to him at an "" address unknown "" , the court said valid reasons for not attending were problems with public transport , sudden illness , or unforeseen circumstances .
It advised him to arrive in good time and "" clear your pockets of metal objects and put them in the plastic bins provided "" .
Thomas Olsson , a Stockholm - based lawyer for Assange , said : "" The statement from the prosecutor gives us strong arguments for our case . """

2014-07-13,"When the next band of guest editors take charge of Radio 4â€ ™ s
Today , there will be a new edict from the programmeâ€ ™ s editor , Jamie Angus : leave Thought for the Day alone .
This follows singer PJ Harveyâ€ ™ s controversial editorship of the programme in January , which featured an â€œalternativeâ€ � Thought for the Day by WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange , and an attempt by another guest editor Sir Tim Berners - Lee , inventor of the worldwide web , to have an atheist do the three - minute talk .
Angus describes the slot , which began in 1970 ( following various religious programmes since 1939 ) , as sacrosanct .
â€œThe only ground rule I am going to set is you
canâ€ ™ t mess around with Thought for the Day
, â€ � he says .
â€œPeople need to be clear you
canâ€
™ t use the guest editorship as a lever to do a secular Thought for the Day or a backdoor way to open up a Thought for the Day debate.â€ �
The BBC has reviewed the mini - sermon at various times in its history , including five years ago when the BBC Trust rejected calls to feature non - religious speakers .
Angus , who describes himself as a â€œbig fanâ€ � , says : â€œOne of the great things about living in Britain is that we are a pluralist society that is immensely tolerant of a wide range of different religions .
I think Thought for the Day is one of the hidden pillars that absolutely supports that architecture.â€ �
A former Lib Dem researcher and press officer before joining the BBC , he admits he â€œwasnâ€ ™ t particularly
comfortableâ€
� about elements of the PJ Harvey edition â€ “ described by one critic as â€œliberal drivelâ€ � â€ “ which included a contribution by campaigning journalist John Pilger .
â€œSome of it was really on the edge of what we could do
but it was a really interesting programme and prompted a huge amount of response , â€ � adds Angus .
â€œI was uneasy about the unchallenged nature of both Assange and the John Pilger essay .
On the following day we did a contra - Pilger item , talking about the Iraqi death toll , which he didnâ€ ™ t like very much.â€ �
In his first interview since taking charge of Today in September last year , Angus says he has sought to expand the programmeâ€ ™ s
â€œeditorial
paletteâ€ � while remaining true to its traditions .
As well as appointing a dedicated sports producer â€ “ â€œtoo often we have ghettoised sport into the sports desk [ hourly bulletin]â€ � â€ “
he has looked to embrace â€œthe more poppy end of culture
â€ “ it needs to get a really good showing on the programme , not just high - end theatre and a bit of opera .
Popular music , TV box sets , tablets , the internet , all these things are totally mainstream for the Today
audienceâ€
� .
Where the programme can err , says Angus , is an occasional reticence by presenters to engage with such topics and a tendency to present them in â€œinverted commasâ€ � .
â€œSometimes people fall into the habit of jokily saying , â€˜of course I donâ€
™ t know anything about this stuffâ€ ™ .
I donâ€ ™ t like that
, I think it puts up a barrier for new audiences.â€
�
But he admits there will be a â€œsmall minority of the Today audience who never want to hear any sport or a single beat of pop music on the programme ever .
I canâ€
™ t deliver that for them , Iâ€ ™ m
afraidâ€ � .
The clearest change has been the arrival of Mishal Husain last year , putting an end to criticism that only one of its rota of presenters , Sarah Montague , was a woman .
Angus already knew Husain from BBC World News , where the pair worked together on its coverage of the royal wedding in 2011 .
â€œIt wouldnâ€ ™ t be surprising to say the question of who the next female presenter of Today should be came up as part of the process to get the job , â€ � he says .
â€œMishal was at the top of the list of people I wanted.â€ �
Critics say the lack of female voices on Today is still a problem .
â€œItâ€ ™ s an incredibly difficult area
and we are making a real effort to improve
and I do genuinely think we have improved enormously , â€ � says Angus .
â€œItâ€ ™ s the nature of news that sometimes you end up with big blocks of male guests and you happen to have two male presenters , and suddenly the show sounds very male .
We should never be in a position editorially where we change a guest or a story primarily on the basis of the gender of the guest.â€ �
Husainâ€ ™ s arrival inevitably raised the question â€ “ which incumbent presenter would she replace ?
As it turned out , no one .
James Naughtie , who spends part of the week on Good Morning Scotland in the run - up to Septemberâ€ ™ s independence referendum , will return full - time at the end of the year , part of a six - strong team alongside Husain , Montague , Evan Davis , Justin Webb and John Humphrys , filling 12 presenter slots a week .
It feels like an anomaly at a time when BBC News will cut up to 600 jobs as part of a further imminent cost - cutting drive .
â€œI am not anticipating further changes , â€ � says Angus , who expects the current line - up to remain â€œat least through to the end of next yearâ€ � .
â€œWe have got enough work for six presenters , â€ �
he adds .
â€œIt goes wider than just presenting , they do quite a lot of reporting and with the referendum and general election next year
I have got more demands than ever for presenters to be on the road.â€
�
Humphrys , 70 , is the â€œmost recognisable and important interviewer and presenter we have in this countryâ€ � , says Angus .
But he wonâ€ ™ t be appearing in a new TV marketing campaign for Today featuring Husain and Davis and aimed squarely at Radio 4â€ ™ s so - called â€œreplenisherâ€ � audience â€ “ aged 35 to 54 â€ “ who spend less time listening to Today than they used to .
Overall audience figures are healthy at over 7 million listeners a week , with an average age of 57 .
â€œWe donâ€ ™ t have a demographic time bomb under Today but younger audiences are listening for a shorter number of hours , â€ � says Angus .
â€œI am interested in how we keep people listening.â€ �
He wants to do more with digital and reach younger listeners on social media with â€œVine - style six second bits of eclectic Today experienceâ€
� .
Evan Davisâ€ ™ dog , Mr Whippy , attempting to predict Englandâ€ ™ s World Cup results was an early , if not entirely inspiring , example .
A former editor of the World at One , Angus took over Today after a year on BBC2â€ ™ s Newsnight , where he was parachuted in after the Savile crisis , joining three days after its calamitous Lord McAlpine report .
After eight months as Newsnightâ€ ™ s acting editor , he applied for the job full - time , but lost out to Ian Katz , former deputy editor of the Guardian .
â€œI felt strongly about lots of things [ on Newsnight ] and wanted to have my say , â€ � says Angus .
â€œI think it is fair to say I am very pleased to have got this job.â€ �
On the day we meet , another Today controversy is playing out following reports that the BBCâ€ ™ s editorial complaints unit will uphold a complaint about a debate broadcast in February featuring prominent climate change sceptic , Lord Lawson .
Angus defends his decision to invite Lawson .
â€œThe BBC canâ€ ™ t say , â€˜we arenâ€ ™ t going to put that point of view on air because scientists tell us itâ€ ™ s
not rightâ€ ™ ,â€ � he says .
â€œPeople always raise flat earth at this point , but if you go into a pub on Oxford Street you wonâ€ ™ t find anyone who says the earth is flat , but you will probably find a couple of people who are unconvinced by the science on climate change .
Clearly the BBC has to reflect what is a relatively settled view of the majority of scientists â€ ¦ but absolutely should not squeeze out alternative points of view , and we havenâ€ ™ t.â€ � Curriculum vitae Age 40 Education Winchester College , Hampshire ; Magdalen College , Oxford Career 1999 researcher , assistant editor ,

2014-07-15,"It began with a tweet from WikiLeaks on Saturday : "" Julian # Assange and Manchester United 's Eric # Cantona earlier today cross training for # counterintelligenceworldcup . ""
The accompanying photo showed exactly that : the WikiLeaks founder , in his room in the Ecuadorian embassy , eyeing a fitness tracker , next to a sweat - drenched , pretty miserable - looking Cantona .
Soon after , film director Romain Gavras tweeted a short video of Cantona huffing and puffing on the running machine ( the same one , incidentally , that was given to Assange by Ken Loach , who worked with Cantona for his 2009 film Looking for Eric ) with the words : # Assange # Cantona # counterintelligenceworldcup @wikileaks http://t.co/58T5kQbiCp â€ ” romain gavras ( @ROMAIN_GAVRAS ) July 12 , 2014 Beyond that , we do n't know much .
According to an Assange spokesman , the pair "" discussed a future collaboration "" , which will be revealed "" in due course "" .
The obvious conclusion is that they will announce said "" counterintelligence World Cup "" , presumably some sort of misguided five - a - side tournament played by teams of retired anti - establishment footballer - cum - actors and wanted whistleblowers , possibly within the confines of a corridor in the Ecuadorian embassy .
But that seems , on investigation , unlikely , since the hashtag was created by WikiLeaks a week earlier as a topical catch - all term for the ongoing stories about Germany 's plan to resume spying on the US .
No , it seems more likely that the two are in the early stages of cooking up a film idea .
One that , on this evidence , for some reason requires Assange to establish that the former footballer is in peak physical condition .
At a guess , get ready for Cantona 's star turn in Julian Assange : All - Action Hero .
It 's probably not the real explanation , sure , but in the face of a sight this baffling , it 's all we 've got ."
2014-07-16,"We are going to wrap up the blog now .
A full report on today 's court ruling will be online shortly .
In the meantime , here is take from David Crouch , who was at the court in Stockholm for the Guardian Lawyers for Julian Assange said they would appeal after a Stockholm judge rejected their challenge to the warrant for his arrest , meaning that the WikiLeaks founder is expected to remain in the Ecuador embassy in London . ""
The court believes there is probable cause for the crimes of which he is accused , "" judge Lena Egelin said in a statement to the court . ""
He has chosen himself to go into the embassy and ... the court does not believe that the deprivation of his liberty is such as to be disproportionate "" to the allegations , she said .
No charges have been brought against Assange in Sweden but he is wanted for questioning by police over allegations of sexual molestation and rape involving two women he met during a visit to the country in 2010 .
Prosecutors have declined to question him in London .
Assange sought refuge in Ecuador 's embassy in Britain in June 2012 after having exhausted all legal options in British courts to avoid being extradited to Sweden .
This was the first official legal debate in the case since that time .
"" We are confident and have strong legal arguments to get the decision overruled in the Court of Appeal , "" Assange lawyer Tholmas Olsson told the Guardian , adding that the judge 's statement was formal and gave no indication of the reasoning behind it . ""
It took two hours today for the judge to rule , so it must have been a difficult decision . ""
Those hoping that Julian Assange may make one of his appearances on a balcony at the Ecuadorian embassy look set to be disappointed .
The windows are open , but it 's a hot day .
Here 's Rob Booth talking to me from there :
Outside the Ecuador embassy in Knightsbridge a handful of Assange supporters greeted the decision with disappointment .
Lance Rolls , 51 holding a placard which read ' End the witch hunt .
Free Assange ' told Rob Booth : Americans are pulling the strings , so this is no surprise to me .
The Americans want him and that 's that .
They are all in this together .
Jim Curran , 67 , who campaigns against extraditions to the US , said : The British foreign secretary should make a request to the Swedish foreign secretary for the Swedes to come here and interview him .
Earlier , there had been suggestions that Assange might try to leave the embassy if he won the case , but that possibility was played down by his New York - based lawyer , Michael Ratner ( see earlier post ) .
The Wikileaks Twitter account tweets a link to an Associate Press report about today 's ruling , as well as an FAQ document on freeassangenow.org/faq
Here 's a background piece to get you up to speed on the background to today 's decision at Stockholm city court to keep the detention order against the WikiLeaks founder .
It 's the atest act in a highly publicised legal drama played out over four years in front of magistrates , senior judges and law lords at the high court and supreme courts in London , reports Rob Booth .
Assange has been holed up for more than two years in the Ecuadorian embassy in London evading extradition , and has become a hero figure for a diverse range of visitors ranging from Lady Gaga to the former footballer Eric Cantona ( picture with him below ) .
It all began in far more private circumstances when , in August 2010 Assange , met two young women in Stockholm with whom he went to bed on separate nights .
Afterwards they accused him of rape and sexual assault .
At the time , Assange had recently published video of a US Apache helicopter shooting a Reuters camera crew in Iraq , dubbed "" collateral murder "" .
It was to be the first of a series of blockbuster revelations from leaked US government files that WikiLeaks had obtained .
The sexual assault allegations quickly became entangled with Assange 's fears about the US authorities ' backlash over the leak of hundreds of thousands of military logs from Iraq and Afghanistan and diplomatic cables from US embassies across the globe .
Assange said the issue of the charges "" at this moment is deeply disturbing "" .
You can read more here ...
Judge Lena Egelin gave a rapid and summary dismissal of the legal challenge to Assange 's arrest warrant , but said decision could be appealed , David Crouch reports from the court .
More reaction is coming through from Assange 's defence team and supporters .
Sweden broadcast journalist Per Nyberg tweets :
The Guardian 's Rob Booth had been speaking to Assange 's US lawyer , Michael Ratner , prior to the ruling , and reports :
He said America has previously made clear there is an ongoing investigation into Assange by the Department of Justice and Assange 's lawyers have not been given any assurances about whether that investigation is over or whether there is any warrant for his arrest or criminal complaint against him .
Ratner said : The fear here was not about Sweden but that Sweden was going to be a place that would extradite him to the US .
Until we can get an assurance from the US government of non - prosecution , leaving the Ecuadorean embassy would be a very high risk move .
Britain may already have papers that allow them to arrest Julian the moment he steps out of the embassy .
The US could say it has no plans to arrest him , but unless it does so , I would not recommend him stepping out of the embassy .
There has to be some negotiation with the US before he leaves or the British need to recognise his right to asylum and let him get on a plane to Ecuador .
Julian Assange 's Swedish lawyer says he will appeal the court ruling to uphold the arrest warrant to the appellate court , reports Sven Grundberg , a Stockholm - based reported for the Wall Street Journal .
The arrest warrant for Julian Assange has been upheld by the court , which says that he is still suspected for rape and molestation .
Per Nyberg , a journalist at the court tweets : The ruling is now imminent , says David Crouch at the court in Sweden , where it 's back in session .
Meanwhile in London : The Guardian 's Rob Booth is now also outside the Ecuadorian embassy in London , from where he tweets : The media are also beginning to assemble ..
This is Ben Quinn picking up the live blog now .
Radio Sweden ( Sveriges Radio ) reports that the judge 's ruling will come around 6 pm Swedish time ( 5 pm BST ) .
This report on proceedings so far comes from news agency AFP : A Swedish court began a hearing on Wednesday to determine if an arrest warrant against WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange for alleged sexual assault should be dropped .
A decision to cancel the warrant would be a step towards enabling the 43-year - old Australian to walk out of the Ecuadorian embassy in London , where he has been holed up for the past two years in a bid to avoid extradition to Sweden .
Prosecutors demanded that the warrant should be upheld , Swedish news agency TT reported .
But Assange 's lawyer Thomas Olsson said it should be repealed with "" immediate effect "" , TT said .
The warrant was issued in late 2010 for incidents of rape and sexual molestation that allegedly took place that year â€ “ claims Assange denies .
Assange sought refuge in Ecuador 's embassy in Britain in June 2012 after having exhausted all legal options at British courts to avoid being extradited to Sweden .
He has said he fears that being sent to Sweden would be a pretext for transferring him to the United States , where WikiLeaks sparked an uproar with its publication of thousands of secret documents .
Assange 's legal team has argued that Swedish prosecutors have dragged out the case for an unreasonably long period by not interviewing him at the embassy .
"" We are confident about the hearing , "" Assange 's lawyer Olsson told AFP on Tuesday .
"" We think we have very strong arguments for the court to overrule the original decision . ""
Camilla Murray , chief administrator at the court , said a decision in favour of Assange would mean that a European arrest warrant against him will be immediately cancelled .
"" The charges will not be dropped just because the court cancels the arrest warrant .
But I can not answer for the prosecutors and what they will do .
They are the ones leading the investigation , "" she told AFP .
Olsson , Assange 's lawyer , was cautious about stating what will happen if the Stockholm district court drops the arrest warrant on Wednesday .
"" What he will do when that occurs is up to Julian Assange .
We 're going to have a hearing ... and we hope to get a decision overruling [ the warrant ] and then we will take it from there.""ï
» ¿ WikiLeaks supporters are indeed gathering outside the Ecuadorian embassy in London , as one tweets : Prosecutors argue that the original reasons for the arrest warrant remain valid ( see link below ) : The Svea court of appeal has found Julian Assange on probable cause suspected of rape , unlawful coercion and sexual molestation in two cases .
These suspicions remain in place and unchanged .
The risk of evading criminal justice system remains high .
The question is whether the long period of time that has passed since the detention order can be considered proportional to Julian Assange continuing to be detained in his absence .
The question is also what time frame should then be considered â€ ¦ On 19 June 2012 , Julian Assange sought refuge at the Ecuadorian embassy in London and has been protected there under asylum since then .
As such , he has evaded the British police .
Julian Assange has thus been able to evade enforcement of the judgment of the Supreme Court on his surrender to Sweden .
The time period for which Julian Assange has escaped the reach of the British police can not be included in an assessment of proportionality .
His stay at the embassy was his choice and can not be equated with detention .
My colleague David Crouch , who is in court in Stockholm , says the defence case took up most of the proceedings .
Assange 's lawyers claimed the WikiLeaks founder 's asylum claim to Ecuador "" had nothing to do with avoiding Swedish justice "" .
The link below is to the prosecutors ' counter - arguments ( in English ) : A small crowd â€ “ possibly some WikiLeaks supporters ; undoubtedly plenty of journalists
â€ “ has begun to congregate outside the Ecuadorian embassy in London , where Assange has been holed up for over two years .
It is unclear whether he would be able to walk free from the building if the arrest warrant were to be lifted today .
Assange himself has acknowledged that today 's ruling â€ “ even if it goes his way
â€ “ is only one step in his legal battle .
And the prosecutors could decide to appeal the decision if the judge cancels the warrant .
They will hold a press conference immediately after the judge 's ruling to explain their next moves .
Assange 's lawyer Per Samuelsson tells the court the arrest warrant should be rescinded because it can not be effected .
It will not lead to Assange being transferred to Sweden in the near future , he says .
Julian Assange is not at the hearing
â€ “ he has n't left the Ecuadorian embassy in London for more than two years
â€ “
but he was invited to attend by court officials ,
David Crouch reports : Writing to him at an "" address unknown "" , the court said valid reasons for not attending were problems with public transport , sudden illness , or unforeseen circumstances .
It advised him to arrive in good time and "" clear your pockets of metal objects and put them in the plastic bins provided "" .
An interpreter has been on standby at Stockholm city court today , so far unused .
The judge is now watching a video put together by WikiLeaks and introduced by Assange 's lawyers as proof that his liberty would be threatened if he were to return to Sweden .
In the video â€ “ called Assassinating Assange ; you can watch it below â€
“ a succession of US politicians and officials
criticise the WikiLeaks founder .
Assange claims cooperation with the British and Swedish authorities would expose him to an ongoing criminal investigation by the US Department of Justice into WikiLeaks activity .
( Although my colleague David Crouch , who is in court , tells me they have had to pause the video as there is no audio . )
Earlier , the prosecution set out its reasons for maintaining the arrest warrant .
It argues that : â€¢ Assange has been given all the evidence relevant to the case .
The prosecution is not required to hand over everything .
â€¢ prosecutors have made "" repeated "" attempts to contact Assange to conduct interviews about the allegations .
â€¢ although Assange has not been charged with any crimes in Sweden , it is likely that charges will be brought .
â€¢ the prosecutor 's actions have been proportionate , given the serious of the alleged offences .
Reporters in court in Stockholm say the judge has confirmed that there will be a decision today once the hearing has finished .
Lawyers for Assange have been making their case for the arrest warrant to be scrapped .
They argue that : â€¢ the allegations against Assange have insufficient basis according to the plaintiffs ' evidence to police .
â€¢ the prosecutor 's refusal to question Assange in London breaks the requirement of urgency in the case .
â€¢ the European warrant for his arrest is "" contrary to necessity and proportionality "" .
â€¢ there are serious threats to Assange 's safety should he agree to travel to Sweden , namely the threat of extradition to the United States .
â€¢ text messages sent by his accusers should be handed to the defence .
â€¢ Assange did not know prosecutor wanted to interrogate him when he left Sweden : "" He did not flee . ""
Key to this latest hearing is evidence held by the prosecution that Assange 's team says should be made available to the defence .
David Crouch has this useful explainer : Text messages sent by the two women plaintiffs were seen by defence lawyers in 2010 , but copies of the messages were not issued to them .
Assange has claimedthat text messages sent by one of his accusers show that she was ambiguous about his arrest and even opposed to it . ""
The messages strongly suggest that there is no basis for the arrest and they are thus vital so that he [ Assange ] can effectively tackle the arrest warrant , "" the lawyers say in documents filed with Stockholm district courtï » ¿ â€ ¦ Sweden 's code of judicial procedure was updated on 1 June to conform with EU law , and now includes a provision that anyone arrested or detained has the right to be made aware of "" facts forming the basis for the decision to arrest "" .
"" There is material in the prosecutor 's possession that we know is to Julian Assange 's advantage , "" said his lawyer Thomas Olsson , based in Stockholm .
"" The new law enables her to release that new material , which has been in the prosecutor 's possession from the start
â€
¦
We have seen the text messages but have not been able to use them because we could not demand that the prosecutor hand them over as evidence to the court .
"" My colleague David Crouch is at Stockholm city court for the hearing : The court broke almost immediately upon starting , for arguments to be heard in camera , but later resumed .
A judge in Sweden is due to rule on an application made by lawyers for WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange to cancel the arrest warrant against him .
The warrant was issued in late 2010 , following allegations of rape and sexual molestation by two women .
Assange denies the allegations .
In the first formal legal discussion of the case since Assange sought asylum in the Ecuadorian embassy in London two years ago , the city court in Stockholm will hear arguments from his lawyers and Swedish prosecutors .
My colleague David Crouch , who is at court , filed this background to the hearing : ï»¿The legal challenge to the prosecutor was issued last month after a change to Swedish criminal procedures bringing them in line with an EU directive on the right to information in criminal proceedings
â€ ¦
The prosecutor and Assange 's lawyers have rehearsed their arguments in documents lodged with court .
For Assange , Thomas Olsson and Per Samuelson argue in their latest submission this week that the allegations against Assange have insufficient basis in the plaintiffs ' evidence to police , which was leaked to the Guardian in December 2010 .
They also question the prosecutor 's motives in refusing to question Assange in London , which they say breaks the requirement of urgency in the case , while the European warrant for his arrest is "" contrary to necessity and proportionality "" .
However , the chief prosecutor , Marianne Ny , and her deputy , Ingrid Isgren , argue that "" there remain sufficient grounds to believe that Julian Assange could be found guilty of the allegations made against him "" .
They say that the change to Swedish law does not give the suspect the right to copies of case files , while Assange 's deprivation of liberty is voluntary and therefore irrelevant to maintaining the arrest warrant .
Even if the ruling goes in favour of Assange , it does not necessarily mean the WikiLeaks founder will be leaving the Ecuadorian embassy any time soon : Assange has acknowledged that even if the Swedish prosecutors decide to drop the case , it is only one part of the legal battle that keeps him marooned at the embassy .
"" I still have the larger problem , which is that of the United States and its pending prosecution , and perhaps extradition warrant , "" he told reporters in a conference call in June ."
2014-07-16,"A Swedish court will hold a public hearing to decide whether to lift the arrest warrant on Julian Assange that has kept the WikiLeaks founder holed up in Ecuador 's embassy in London to avoid extradition over allegations of rape and sexual molestation .

They also question the prosecutor 's motives in refusing to question Assange in London , which they say breaks the requirement of urgency in the case , while the European warrant for his arrest is "" contrary to necessity and proportionality "" .
The lawyers also invite the judge to watch a YouTube clip showing a montage of attacks on Assange by US politicians and officials , as evidence of the serious threats to Assange 's safety should he agree to travel to Sweden .
However , the chief prosecutor , Marianne Ny , and her deputy , Ingrid Isgren , argue that "" there remain sufficient grounds to believe that Julian Assange could be found guilty of the allegations made against him "" .
They say that the change to Swedish law does not give the suspect the right to copies of case files , while Assange 's deprivation of liberty is voluntary and therefore irrelevant to maintaining the arrest warrant .
Lawyers for the two women who brought the allegations against Assange have made strongly worded criticisms of the legal challenge in the Swedish press .
Elisabeth Massi Fritz accused lawyers for Assange of making false statements about the plaintiffs and portraying the prosecutor as "" a man - hating radical feminist "" .
The case "" is about a man with the power to destroy two women 's lives , set himself above the law and avoid having to answer for it .
It would be a slap in the face to the plaintiffs and all women who have been victims of sexual violence if the court rescinds the warrant , "" she wrote in an opinion piece for Swedish daily Svenska Dagbladet .
Claes BorgstrÃ¶m , the other lawyer for the women , said cryptically : "" There are findings that no outsider knows about . ""
Frustration at the legal deadlock in the case has seen Swedish legal opinion at a senior level swing against the prosecutor 's refusal to travel to interview Assange in London , with Anne Ramberg , head of the Bar Association , calling the impasse a "" circus "" .
Sven - Erik Alhem , a former chief prosecutor , this week accused his successor of making "" thunderous errors "" in the case .
The hearing starts at noon BST and is scheduled to end at 4 pm .
Under Swedish law , judge Lena Egelin is obliged to issue her ruling on Wednesday .
The prosecutor is due to hold a press conference afterwards ."
2014-07-16,"The decision at Stockholm city court to keep the detention order against the WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange is the latest act in a highly publicised legal drama played out over four years in front of magistrates , senior judges and law lords at the high court and supreme courts in London .

The sexual assault allegations quickly became entangled with Assange 's fears about the US authorities ' backlash over the leak of hundreds of thousands of military logs from Iraq and Afghanistan and diplomatic cables from US embassies across the globe .
Assange said the issue of the charges "" at this moment is deeply disturbing "" .
In a high court challenge against the subsequent arrest warrant , the judges were told by counsel for the Swedish authorities that the women were "" coerced , either by physical force or they were trapped into a situation where they had no choice "" .
Assange has always proclaimed his innocence .
Clare Montgomery QC said one of the women claimed "" the prelude to the offence was Mr Assange ripping her clothes off , breaking her necklace , her trying to get dressed again and then letting him undress her "" .
She said he then had sex with her after pinning her arms and trying to force her legs apart , which she did not want .
Assange 's side said the claims were baseless and the arrest warrant illegal .
His counsel in 2011 , Ben Emmerson , said police reports in Sweden showed that one of the women had told a friend that she felt police and others around her "" railroaded her "" into pressing charges .
She had only wanted the police to force Assange to take a blood test after she became worried about HIV after unprotected sex with him , he said .
Assange did not want to go to Sweden to face questioning , partly because he believed and continues to believe that he would be extradited to the US to face charges related to his WikiLeaks work .
Last year the former US army soldier Chelsea Manning was jailed for 35 years for leaking classified state documents to Assange .
For the first period of his bail , Assange was hosted at Ellingham Hall in Norfolk , home of the founder of the Frontline Club for journalists , Vaughan Smith .
During this period , the legality of Sweden 's arrest warrant was upheld by Westminster magistrates court , then by Lord Thomas , the lord chief justice , and Mr Justice Ouseley at the high court in November 2011 , and finally by the supreme court in June 2012 .
That paved the way for his extradition , but on Tuesday 19 June he sought political asylum at the Ecuadorian embassy in Knightsbridge .
He has been there ever since .
Claes BorgstrÃ¶m , a lawyer for the two Swedish women , said his move into the embassy was frustrating and disappointing for his clients . ""
The tragedy is that he does n't take his responsibility , "" he said .
One year into his stay at the small diplomatic mission , Assange said : "" We know there is an ongoing investigation in the US and we know I am a target of the federal grand jury .
There is a 99.97 % chance that I will be indicted .
So if the Swedish government drops their request [ to go to Sweden ] tomorrow , I still can not leave the embassy .
"" The embassy has been ringed by police for 24 hours a day at a cost of more than Â£6 m to the British taxpayer .
The latest chapter comes because Sweden 's code of judicial procedure was updated on 1 June to conform with EU law .
It now includes a provision that anyone arrested or detained has the right to be made aware of "" facts forming the basis for the decision to arrest "" .
Assange has claimed that text messages sent by one of his accusers show that she was ambivalent about his arrest and even opposed to it . ""
The messages strongly suggest that there is no basis for the arrest and they are thus vital so that he [ Assange ] can effectively tackle the arrest warrant , "" the lawyers say in documents filed with Stockholm district court this week ."
2014-07-16,"Lawyers for Julian Assange said they would appeal after a Stockholm judge rejected their challenge to the warrant for his arrest , condemning the WikiLeaks founder to remain in the Ecuador embassy in London . ""

No charges have been brought against Assange in Sweden but he is wanted for questioning by police over allegations of sexual molestation and rape involving two women he met during a visit to the country in 2010 .
Prosecutors have declined to question him in London .
Prosecutors Marianne Ny and Ingrid Isgren said on Wednesday that interviewing a suspect abroad was not appropriate in crimes of a sexual nature .
Isgren told the court : "" You need to have several interviews , you go back to the suspect and confront him , you go to the scene of the crime .
Also we can not take DNA swabs against the suspect 's will . ""
Assange sought refuge in Ecuador 's embassy in Britain in June 2012 after having exhausted all legal options in British courts to avoid being extradited to Sweden .
This was the first official legal debate in the case since that time .
"" We are confident and have strong legal arguments to get the decision overruled in the court of appeal , "" Assange lawyer Tholmas Olsson told the Guardian , adding that the judge 's statement was formal and gave no indication of the reasoning behind it . ""

He and his colleague , Per Samuelson , had earlier attempted to break the two - year deadlock in the case by attacking the "" passivity "" of Swedish prosecutors in refusing to interview the WikiLeaks founder in his London hideout .
Samuelson told the court : "" The prosecutor has a duty to break the deadlock .
If the mountain wo n't come to Muhammad then Muhammad must go to the mountain .
Ecuador had granted Assange asylum in good faith and in accordance with international law because of threats to his life , Samuelson said â€ “ not so he could avoid justice in Sweden .
He played a seven - minute YouTube video to the court in which US politicians called Assange a terrorist and demanded that he be assassinated .
Olsson said : "" I have been present when the CIA interviewed suspects in Sweden , so if they can come to Sweden then how can the prosecutor say it is tough to go to London . ""
Elisabeth Massi Fritz , lawyer for one of the women who brought the accusations against Assange , said : "" This was a proper and expected decision by the Stockholm district court .
Assange can not dictate the terms of the Swedish investigation . ""
The only reason that the investigation is not progressing is Assange himself .
Sooner or later he will be arrested and brought to Sweden . ""
Assange has acknowledged that even if the Swedish prosecutors decided to drop the case , it is only one part of the legal battle that keeps him marooned at the embassy .

They are all in this together . ""
Jim Curran , 67 , who campaigns against extraditions to the US , said : "" The British foreign secretary should make a request to the Swedish foreign secretary for the Swedes to come here and interview him . ""
Earlier there had been suggestions that Assange might try to leave the embassy if he won the case , but that possibility was played down by his New York - based lawyer , Michael Ratner . ""
The fear here was not about Sweden but that Sweden was going to be a place that would extradite him to the US , "" he said .
"" Until we can get an assurance from the US government of non - prosecution , leaving the Ecuador embassy would be a very high risk move .
The US could say it has no plans to arrest him , but unless it does so , I would not recommend him stepping out of the embassy .
There has to be some negotiation with the US before he leaves or the British need to recognise his right to asylum and let him get on a plane to Ecuador . ""
The possibility that he would be arrested should he leave the embassy , which is directly behind Harrods , was made plain by a Metropolitan police sergeant outside the embassy who said : "" He 's going to get nicked , if he comes out . """
2014-08-17,"Ecuador is committed to protecting persons subject to political persecution .
Two years ago , after a profound investigation and review of our legal obligations , we decided to give political asylum to Julian Assange .
This decision followed a dramatic change in our global understanding of privacy , telecommunications and diplomacy over the past few years .
Edward Snowdenâ€ ™ s revelations about mass surveillance have uncovered grave security threats for states , violations of human rights , and have shown that the future of the internet is in danger .
The millions of documents published by Wikileaks about the political , economic and military manoeuvres of powerful interests also magnified delicate matters of sovereignty and abuse of power .
All states have secrets .
And all states have the right to defend themselves .
But this must not whitewash the grave violations of human rights , including war crimes and crimes against humanity , of which we have learned .
In many cases , states with the most sophisticated methods for surveillance commit the most heinous human rights violations .
Publication of information about human rights abuses is a right in accordance with the Declaration on Human Rights Defenders of 1998 , the exercise of which implies a right of protection to those who reveal such violations .
Honest journalism and the courageous whistleblowers who denounce human rights violations or attempts against state sovereignty deserve to be protected .
We felt that the fate of Chelsea Manning , evidence of secret grand jury procedures and Snowdenâ€ ™ s exile in Russia corroborate the fears Assange had for his security , freedom and life when he sought refuge in the Ecuadorian embassy in London more than two years ago .
In order to guarantee effective protection of human rights , all states must ratify and comply with international instruments of law .
Ecuador has manifested unwavering commitment as signatories to multiple binding covenants that recognise , and pledge to defend , inalienable human rights .
Assuming our responsibility to articulate an effective judicial co - operation between states , Ecuador offered the Swedish authorities our diplomatic headquarters in London , or the possibility to hold a video conference , in order to advance the legal process involving Assange .
We fail to understand why , despite this co - operation offered by the Ecuadorian government to hold such interviews in our embassy , Swedish prosecutors sacrificed diligent due process , knowing that decision violated the rights of Assange and the two Swedish women who wish for a prompt resolution to this case .
Furthermore , despite the initiative proposed by the Ecuadorian government to create a bilateral group of jurists to facilitate a solution to the case ( accepted by the British government in June 2013 ) , itâ€ ™ s unfortunate that no results have been reached to date .
The impossibility of leaving the embassy prevents the fulfilment of Assangeâ€ ™ s asylum and seriously affects his quality of life and health .
Two years without sunlight and fresh air , unable to walk outside .
Itâ€ ™ s an injustice that an asylum seeker must remain prisoner of a stalled judicial process .
Ecuador is obligated to protect Assange in our embassy until he can fully enjoy his right to asylum .
We are concerned about the consequences of an eventual medical emergency without access to hospital facilities or care .
The United Kingdom and Sweden should consider whether they are willing to assume such consequences .
We must do justice for those who have sacrificed their freedom to inform us of the dangers of mass surveillance and the future of the internet .
We need to create an international regime of binding regulations that accompanies the process of internet governance , with solid decisions about sensitive issues , such as protection of privacy , promotion of cyberpeace and eradication of cyberwarfare , neutrality of the web and the unequivocal protection of its open and distributed nature .
In Latin America , regional integration entities such as Celac , Unasur and Alba will allow us to eliminate our technological dependence on the north and to strengthen our sovereignty .
Ecuador renews its commitment to the protection of Assangeâ€ ™ s human rights , freedom and life , and we affirm the validity of the asylum given to him two years ago .
We also reiterate our request for safe passage to Assange so he can safely travel to Ecuadorian territory .
Two years is enough time .
A viable solution to this situation must be found ."
2014-08-18,"Esther Addley has filed her take on todayâ€ ™ s press conference where there was less than meets the eye , so this seems an appropriate time to end the live blog .
Thank you for your interest and comments .
Julian Assange has rebuffed reports that he is planning to leave the Ecuadorean embassy in order to hand himself in to police , saying only that he will leave â€œsoonâ€ � .
Media reports had surfaced ahead of a press conference on Monday morning suggesting that the WikiLeaks founder intended imminently to give himself up to the British authorities .
Assange has been confined to the embassy for more than two years after being granted political asylum .
But when questioned by reporters alongside Ecuadorâ€ ™ s foreign minister Ricardo Patino , Assange said WikiLeaksâ€ ™ spokesman Kristinn Hrafnsson had â€œconfirmed that I am leaving the embassy soon , but perhaps not for the reasons the Murdoch press and Sky news are saying at the momentâ€ � .
He refused to elaborate , but speaking later , Hrafnsonn said : â€œHe is ready to leave at any moment as soon as the ridiculous siege outside will stop and he is offered safe passage.â€ �
He added â€œhis bag is packedâ€ � .
Asked explicitly were there plans for Assange to hand himself in to British police , who maintain a 24-hour guard outside the embassy , Hrafnsson said â€œnoâ€ � .
Assange also declined to respond in detail to suggestions reported in an interview with him on Sunday that he was suffering from potentially life - threatening health problems , saying only that the embassy was â€œan environment in which any healthy person would find themselves soon enough with certain difficulties that they would have to manage.â€ � Patino repeated calls published in the Guardian today for Assangeâ€ ™ s situation to be resolved , saying there had been â€œtwo lost yearsâ€
� since he entered the embassy .
The Australian sought asylum in a bid to avoid extradition to Sweden to face accusations of sexual assault from two women .
He fears onward extradition to the US to face charges relating to WikiLeaksâ€ ™ publishing activities .
â€œWe once again call on the international community particularly on journalists to join a much needed international campaign to guarantee freedom and human rights for Assange , â€ � said the foreign minister .
â€œWe uphold Julian Assangeâ€ ™ s status as a political asylee .
We continue to offer him our protection and we continue to be ready to talk to the British government and the Swedish government in order to try to find a solution to this serious breach of Julian
Assangeâ€ ™ s human rights.â€
�
He said he hoped â€œover the coming weeksâ€ � to set up a meeting with the British foreign secretary , Philip Hammond , to discuss the case .
PA has this story which rather undercuts the notion that Assange will leave the embassy soon .
Kristinn Hrafnsson , the WikiLeaks spokesman , made clear the rumours of Mr Assangeâ€ ™ s imminent departure were not true .
â€œThe world is not coming to an end , â€ � he told reporters inside the embassy .
â€œThe plan , as always , is to leave as soon as the UK government decides to honour its obligations in relation to international agreements.â€ �
Mr Hrafnsson said he did not know where the rumours reported in the British media had come from .
The Press Association has this line from the press conference , although itâ€ ™ s hard to see the basis for his optimism .
Mr PatiÃ±o referred to recent changes to the extradition laws in the UK which he believed would mean Mr Assange would not be facing extradition if the case started today .
â€œOver the coming weeks
I will be trying out set up a meeting with the UK foreign secretary .
We believe that the recent reforms create a better climate for us to try to reach an agreement.â€ �
But as things stand , the UK would be obliged to hand Assange to Sweden if he steps out of the embassy as there is a Swedish warrant for his arrest .
Esther Addleyâ€ ™ s latest tweet .
David Crouch , in Gothenburg , has spoken to one of Assangeâ€ ™ s lawyers in Stockholm and emails : Per Samuelson , a lawyer for Assange in Stockholm , said he and his colleagues were planning to press ahead with an appeal against last monthâ€ ™ s decision by a lower court to reject their challenge to the Swedish prosecutor .
He said he could offer no further clarification of Assangeâ€ ™ s comments this morning that he would be leaving the Ecuadorian embassy â€œsoonâ€ � .
The appeal would be filed shortly , he said .
â€œI think we have a very good chance
[ the Swedish appeal court ] will not uphold the decision to keep him in custody , â€ � Samuelson said .
â€œThe law is on Assangeâ€ ™ s side , it is not right to keep him in custody in this situation .
We have further arguments that will be presented at the appeal.â€ �
Assangeâ€ ™ s lawyers in Sweden have argued that the limits on his freedom are disproportionate and unreasonable , that the European arrest warrant against him should be rescinded because it can not be implemented , that they should be granted access to the case files held by the prosecutor , including text messages sent by Assangeâ€ ™ s accusers , and that the prosecutor should travel to London to interview him as a first move towards breaking the deadlock .
Just a reminder that last month , a Stockholm judge rejected a challenge by Assangeâ€ ™ s lawyers to the warrant for his arrest .
Hereâ€ ™ s an extract from the Guardian story : Lawyers for Julian Assange said they would appeal after a Stockholm judge rejected their challenge to the warrant for his arrest , condemning the WikiLeaks founder to remain in the Ecuador embassy in London .
â€œThe court believes there is probable cause for the crimes of which he is accused , â€ � judge Lena Egelin said in a statement to the court .
â€œHe has chosen himself to go into the embassy and â€ ¦ the court does not believe that the deprivation of his liberty is such as to be disproportionateâ€ � to the allegations , she said .
No charges have been brought against Assange in Sweden but he is wanted for questioning by police over allegations of sexual molestation and rape involving two women he met during a visit to the country in 2010 .
Prosecutors have declined to question him in London .
Prosecutors Marianne Ny and Ingrid Isgren said on Wednesday that interviewing a suspect abroad was not appropriate in crimes of a sexual nature .

â€œSoonâ€ � does not mean today , tweets Esther Addley .
Reuters has a short take on Assangeâ€ ™ s press conference .
WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange , who has spent over two years inside Ecuadorâ€ ™ s London embassy to avoid extradition to Sweden , said on Monday he planned to leave the building â€œsoonâ€ � , without giving further details .
Britainâ€ ™ s
Sky News , part owned by Rupert Murdochâ€ ™ s 21st Century Fox , had earlier reported that Assange was considering leaving the embassy due to deteriorating health .
â€œI am leaving the embassy soon ... but perhaps not for the reasons that Murdoch press and Sky news are saying at the moment , â€ � he told reporters at the embassy in central London , before refusing to clarify his comments .
Asked about his health , Assange said anyone would be affected by spending two years in a building with no outside areas or direct sunlight , a complaint he has made several times before .
Assange has dropped his bombshell that he will be leaving the embassy soon , but he gave no details whatsoever on how this two - year impasse will end .
So an odd press conference from the Ecuadorian embassy , which raised more questions than answers .
Assangeâ€ ™ s declaration that he will leave â€œsoonâ€ � has flummoxed rather than enlightened .
Esther Addley from the press conference .
Surprisingly , nobody has asked Assange yet what he means by â€œsoonâ€ � and the practical arrangements involved .
He is now taking questions on his health .
He says being confined â€ “ at huge expense
â€ “ has not been good for his health .
Only one hourâ€ ™ s exercise a day .
Assange now refers to support he has received from human rights groups in the UK and the US .
He cites Human Rights Watch calling on the US to stop its investigation of him .
Now itâ€ ™ s to questions .
He is asked whether he plans to surrender to the authorities .
He says he will be leaving the embassy soon .
Assange again points out that he has not been charged in the UK or Sweden at any time .
The basis of his asylum is the investigation by the US department of justice .
Itâ€ ™ s a very subdued Assange , somewhat rambling and keeping everyone on tenterhooks as to whether he is going to leave or not .
â€œWe continue to offer him our protection , â€ � says PatiÃ±o , adding that Ecuador will continue to talk to Sweden and the UK to try and resolve the impasse .
Now Assange takes the mike .
He says itâ€ ™ s been almost four years since his ordeal began .
Through that time , he has not been charged .
How can it be that such as a situation arises in Eruope when a person is held while the US government is building up a case against him , Assange asks .
The press conference has started about 20 minutes late .
The Ecuadorian foreign minister , Ricardo PatiÃ±o , kicks off proceedings with Assange sitting by his side .
There is a livestream of the event here .
Sky and the BBC have also live coverage .
PatiÃ±o is going through the legal back and forth that has been going on in the past two years .
He says Assangeâ€ ™ s human rights have been breached and the last two years have seen no justice for anyone .
â€œThe situation must come to an end .
Two years is too long .
It is time to free Assange .
It is time for his human rights to be respected , â€ � says the minister .
Who is right ?
Martin Brunt or Polly Kolko from the Russian RT network .
Esther Addley tweets from the crowded press conference at the embassy .
In an interview with the Daily Mail , Assange said that he and WikiLeaks pose no threat and admitted a lack of sun has given him problems .
The paper reports that Assange is in ill health , suffering from the potentially life - threatening heart condition arrhythmia and has a chronic lung complaint and dangerously high blood pressure .
A severe shortage of Vitamin D , the sunshine vitamin , is affecting his general health , it says .
He said : â€˜Maybe itâ€ ™ s time to think that WikiLeaks is not the main problem here for the West , maybe me and my publishing house are a lesser threat than say the Islamic State in Iraq or , closer to home , paedophiles in Westminster .
â€˜Why are they burning Â£240,000 a month on me which could be better spent on hospital beds , meals for the needy or teachersâ€ ™ salaries ?
The Metropolitan Police Service has now spent in excess of Â£7 million on guarding the embassy , which is a ridiculous waste of taxpayersâ€ ™ money.â€ ™

Julian Assange , the anti - secrecy campaigner , may hand himself over to police after a two - year standoff at the Ecuadorian embassy in London , according to reports this morning .
The normally reliable Martin Brunt from Sky News says he understands that Assange has had enough .
This is from Sky .
Sky News Crime Correspondent Martin Brunt said : â€œMr Assange gave a newspaper interview yesterday in which he sounded very dispirited .
â€œA lot of the fighting spirit seems to have gone out of him .
Itâ€ ™ s also been made clear from those around him that heâ€ ™ s quite ill .
â€œHeâ€ ™ s said to have a heart condition , a chronic lung complaint , bad eyesight , high blood - pressure , all as a result of ... two years in the Ecuadorian embassy.â€ �
The founder of WikiLeaks is scheduled to give a press conference at 9 am where he is expected to say more about his next move .
It may or may not happen , but we will keep a close watch on events .
The Ecuadorian ambassador yesterday accused the British government of having no real interest in finding a diplomatic solution to the standoff as my colleague , Esther Addley ( @estheraddley ) , reported for this morningâ€ ™ s Guardian .
Here is an extract .
Ecuadorâ€ ™ s foreign minister has accused the British government of having no real interest in finding a diplomatic solution to the confinement ofJulian Assange , the WikiLeaks founder who has spent more than two years in the countryâ€ ™ s embassy in London .
Ricardo PatiÃ±o told the Guardian that he believed the UK was violating Assangeâ€ ™ s human rights by refusing to allow him to leave the building without fear of arrest .
â€œI do not think there is a will [ in Britain ] to find a solution , â€ � PatiÃ±o said , acknowledging that without a political or legal breakthrough Assange could spend years living in a handful of tiny rooms at the countryâ€ ™ s small west London embassy .
â€œThe British government hasnâ€ ™ t taken any steps in that direction .
We have made proposals , we have submitted documents , and all we have seen on the part of the British government is an increase in security to make sure Julian Assange does not leave the embassy , but there has been no political will or any steps taken towards a diplomatic solution to this.â€ �

2014-08-18,
2014-08-18,"The first reports began circulating early on Monday morning .
Could it really be true ?
Could Julian Assange really be planning to walk out of the Ecuadorian embassy and hand himself over to the police who , since he first sought asylum there more than two years ago , have surrounded the building night and day ?
It seemed unlikely , but in the remarkable story of Assange , many more surprising things have happened .
Certainly Sky News , apparently the source of the report , seemed confident .
"" A lot of the fighting spirit seems to have gone out of him , "" said Martin Brunt , the broadcaster 's crime correspondent .
Assange was clearly "" quite ill "" , said the reporter , and in a recent interview he had sounded "" very dispirited "" .
Plus , he was due to give a press conference at the embassy at 9 am , alongside Ecuador 's foreign minister , Ricardo PatiÃ±o .
By 8.30am , reporters , camera crews and a handful of Assange supporters were lining up behind the crowd barriers in the street of smart mansion blocks next to Harrods in Knightsbridge where the embassy sits .
At the door , others were doing their best to get inside , to be met by the folded arms of a large man policing the entry .
Ecuador 's embassy is not large and the room in which the press conference was to be held would accommodate no more than 15 or so invited journalists , and that at a crush .
When the two men arrived , 20 minutes or so late , they were forced to squeeze past the tightly packed rows of heavy chairs to take their seats next to two translators and an Ecuadorian flag .
Behind their heads , the small window opened on to the narrow , dark alleyway that for 26 months has been one of the Australian 's only views .
If there had been speculation about the reason for the press conference , the foreign minister was clear .
"" The situation must come to an end .
Two years is simply too long .
It is time to free Julian Assange . ""
Ecuador agreed with Assange that he was "" suffering persecution of a political nature due to his activities as a journalist , "" said PatiÃ±o .
His government had agreed a year ago to set up a working group with the UK to resolve the situation , he said , but the British had insisted that the group have a purely legal , rather than political , character . ""
And in this sense we would like to thank the London government for their goodwill for wanting to explain to us once again the legal framework in which they were [ operating ] , "" said the minister . ""
However , we have understood it . ""
He cited recent changes to British extradition law , which ( while he stopped short of suggesting they could apply retrospectively to Assange 's case ) he hoped could change the context for discussion between the two countries .
Assange has grown a neat beard in recent months
â€ “ ""
it 's a helpful point of reference for people to acknowledge the passing of time , "" he told the Mail on Sunday â€ “ and wore a dark suit and grey shirt without a tie .
He is pale , certainly , but not more than one would expect after so long under artificial lights .
There was no particular evidence , whatever reports might have suggested , of a diminution in "" fighting spirit "" .
"" It has been four years now , almost four years , since I was first detained in this country in solitary confinement without charge , "" said Assange .
"" I have not been charged with an offence here in the UK or in Sweden at any time .
Like you . ""
His prolonged stay at the embassy , he said , was necessary because of moves in the US to prosecute him over WikiLeaks ' publishing activities , a move that would "" put all publishers and journalists at risk "" .
And would he address the reports that he was planning to surrender imminently to police ?
Assange pointed to Kristinn Hrafnsson , WikiLeaks ' spokesperson , who was standing at the rear .
"" I understand [ Hrafnsson ] has said that he can confirm that I am leaving the embassy soon "" â€ “ a broad smile â€ “ "" but perhaps not for the reasons that the Murdoch press and Sky news are saying at the moment . ""
Would he elaborate on that ?
He would not .
He declined also to address specific questions about serious health concerns that have been attributed to him , beyond calling the embassy "" an environment in which any healthy person would find themselves soon enough with certain difficulties "" .
With PatiÃ±o rushing to catch a plane , the two men were ushered out after a few questions .
It fell to Hrafnsson to explain the Australian 's enigmatic comments .
The point Assange had been making was that "" he is ready to leave at any moment as soon as the ridiculous siege outside will stop and he is offered safe passage "" .
So if circumstances were to change he would be ready to leave at the drop of a hat ? ""
His suitcase is packed . """

Everyone around the world knows that the rights of Julian Assange have been violated . ""
Assange , 43 , has not set foot outside Ecuador 's embassy since June 2012 , after seeking political asylum to avoid extradition to Sweden to face allegations of rape and sexual assault made by two women .
The anti - secrecy campaigner , who denies the accusations , fears he is at risk of onward extradition to the US to face as yet unspecified charges relating to WikiLeaks publications , a concern which prompted the Latin American country to grant him asylum status .
With the Swedish courts last month rejecting an attempt by Assange 's lawyers to quash the warrant for his arrest , Britain continuing to insist he will be arrested the instant he steps foot outside the building and the Australian refusing to budge , the situation has now reached political and legal deadlock .
British police maintain a 24-hour presence outside the embassy , at a total cost to date estimated at more than Â£7 m .
The foreign minister 's comments followed reports on Sunday sourced to WikiLeaks insiders that suggested Assange is suffering from a potentially life - threatening heart condition , has a chronic lung condition and dangerously high blood pressure .
The anonymous comments appeared in a Mail on Sunday interview with Assange in which he made no explicit mention of his health , saying only "" I ca n't even keep a pot plant alive for long in here . ""
Ecuador has asked Britain to allow Assange , in the event of a medical emergency , to be taken to hospital in a diplomatic car without risk of arrest , but the request was refused , said Patino .
In an interview with the Guardian conducted in London at the residence of the Ecuadorian ambassador Juan Falconi Puig , the foreign minister said he was not at liberty to discuss Assange 's health , "" but if you ask a doctor what happens to someone who has been locked in a place for two years who has not been allowed to get some fresh air ... obviously this will have a physical and psychological impact which we will have to see . ""
In a separate article written for the Guardian on Monday , Patino writes : "" We are concerned about the consequences of an eventual medical emergency without access to hospital facilities or care .
The United Kingdom and Sweden should consider whether they are willing to assume such consequences .
"" Patino met the then foreign minister William Hague in June last year , after which the two governments agreed , according to a Foreign Office statement at the time , to "" establish a working group to find a diplomatic solution to the issue of Julian Assange "" .
But Patino said that "" different interpretations of the decisions we had taken with William Hague "" had led to the group never being established .
Rather than being frustrated , the foreign minister said he was "" disappointed that countries that [ claim ] to defend freedom , speak up for human rights , who have taken part in many wars and invasions alleging that the reason in freedom and human rights , in this case , when you are talking [ about ] the freedom of expression of one person , they do the opposite . ""
He would not have time to meet the foreign secretary , Philip Hammond , on this trip , having come to meet Assange and his advisers .
Ecuador has said it may seek to prosecute the UK in the international court of justice , the United Nations court of arbitration between states , if Britain does not agree to grant Assange safe passage to Ecuador , something the foreign minister said was still being considered .
"" There are international legal instruments which have the agreement of both Ecuador and the British government as well as the Swedish government which would allow the government of Ecuador to take legal action , "" he said .
In his interview on Sunday , Assange spoke of missing his children , mother and grandmother , and said his stepfather and grandfather had died during his time in the embassy .
"" I said when I got out of prison [ in 2010 ] I had enough anger to last me 100 years and 100 years has not passed yet , but that anger also acts as useful fuel to get work done , "" he told the newspaper .
The Foreign Office said in a statement : "" We remain as committed as ever to reaching a diplomatic solution to this situation .
We are clear that our laws must be followed and Mr Assange should be extradited to Sweden .
As ever we look to Ecuador to help bring this difficult , and costly , residence to an end . ""
â€¢ This article was amended on 18 August to correct the description of Assange as an anti - privacy campaigner to an anti - secrecy campaigner and to refer to Ecuador as a Latin American country rather than a Central American one ."

2014-08-29,"Swaziland 's royal family have long kept their distance from the paparazzi in a way British royals can only dream about .
Not any more , thanks to the rise of Swazi Leaks , an online group determined to expose the opulent lifestyle of Africa 's last absolute monarch .
The movement , inspired by Julian Assange 's WikiLeaks , frequently publishes pictures of King Mswati and his family living the high life .
One recent post says : "" Our taxes pay for the king 's children to party in Los Angeles in the USA , will we struggle to eat here in Swaziland . ""
The intimacy of the photos suggest someone in the king 's inner circle may be leaking information about his movements .
All of which must come as a shock to Mswati , who rules Swaziland with an iron fist : opposition parties are banned , protests are swiftly crushed and a magazine editor and human rights lawyer were recently jailed .
The king owns a private jet , fleet of luxury cars and has a fortune estimated at about $ 100 m ( Â£60 m ) .
Meanwhile , about 60 % of the population live on less than $ 1 a day .
In a rare interview this week the unknown activists behind Swazi Leaks discussed their motivations .
"" We wanted to try and expose some of the exploitation and corruption of the rich and powerful , "" they told Agence France - Presse .
"" We get information and pictures from people who know or work for them .
We have never told anyone what we do and try and not put anyone in jeopardy due to the information we have . ""
Swazi Leaks launched on Twitter last year and operates a Facebook page .
One recent post reports how government officials splashed out for a person to leap out of the king 's birthday cake .
Another shows members of the royal family relaxing in the luxury Windsor suite at Heathrow airport .
The Swazi Leaks members refused to tell AFP their names or location in the southern African nation , which has a population of 1.2 million .
They said : "" Swaziland is a small country and there are a lot of rumours and half - truths with very little to back them up .
We try and not tweet information that we feel has no basis . ""
The message that royalty and their friends live off us , the people , like parasites will spread and be supported by evidence and not rumour .
In this we hope that people will start demanding what is due to them . ""
They added : "" Many , many Swazis think that their lives are the way they are due to forces beyond their control and that the king has their best interests at heart .
We hope to show them that this is not necessarily true . ""
The group is aware that the authorities are watching , they told AFP .
"" We are followed by many Swazi journalists and even a few politicians and people within the royal sphere , which amused us .
There are some people who seem angry with what we 're doing â€ “
you can see the exchanges on our tweet history . ""
"" Though they do n't seem to actually live in the country and seemingly come from privileged backgrounds , so we can understand that what we share is uncomfortable for them . ""
They also said that WikiLeaks was a major inspiration because some of the diplomatic cables it released discussed Swaziland . ""
They showed some of the alliances the ruling elite had with Gaddafi and other dictators , which allowed some Swazis to see inside the ivory tower that is the monarchy . ""
Many Swazis in rural areas , where the king remains popular , do not have internet access , so Swazi Leaks ' impact is likely to be limited .
But it was welcomed by Muzi Masuku , Swaziland programme manager of the Open Society Initiative . ""
The dynamics of social media are quite enormous , "" he said .
"" We no longer have to rely on a media so tightly controlled .
This has been a great help in knowing what 's going on and dispelling some of the myths . ""
He added : "" Whoever is doing this has access to a good cache of pictures .
It has to be someone who 's close enough but able to hide his identity . ""
Not all the king 's excesses are being captured , however .
Masuku lamented : "" He went to Disneyland .
The pictures of him meeting Mickey Mouse and gambling in Las Vegas would have been useful . """
2014-09-12,"The two - time Booker - winning novelist Peter Carey turned down the opportunity to ghost the memoirs of his fellow Australian â€ “ and WikiLeaks founder â€ “ Julian Assange , he has revealed .
Speaking to the Bookseller , Carey said that he was approached by his American editor Sonny Mehta and asked if he would like to co - write the book .
â€œBut I thought , no .
Two control freaks ?
It wouldnâ€ ™ t work , â€ �
he told the books magazine .
Assangeâ€
™ s memoir was eventually ghostwritten by the novelist Andrew Oâ€ ™ Hagan , but the WikiLeaks founder pulled out of the deal at the final hour , with publisher Canongate going on to release the book as an â€œunauthorised autobiographyâ€ � .
Oâ€ ™ Hagan shed light on the arrangement in a revelatory London Review of Books essay earlier this year .
â€œThe story of his life mortified him and sent him scurrying for excuses , â€ � wrote Oâ€ ™ Hagan .
â€œHe didnâ€ ™ t want to do the book .
He hadnâ€ ™ t from the beginning.â€ �
Careyâ€ ™ s
own forthcoming new novel , Amnesia , is out in November , and deals with a young Australian hacker who releases the â€œAngel Wormâ€
� into Australiaâ€ ™ s prisons , unlocking their doors as well as those of some 5,000 American jails .
The title , the Bookseller reveals , refers to â€œAustralians collectively forgetting they are an American client state , run roughshod over by the superpowerâ€ � .
â€œIâ€ ™ m trying to deal with the little country / big country thing :
how the little country loves the big country , and how the big country fucked over the little country , â€ �
Carey told journalist Tom Tivnan , adding that he believes that Australiaâ€ ™ s constitutional crisis of 1975 could have led to WikiLeaks .
â€œWhen Assange appeared , my first thought was , â€˜heâ€ ™ s Australianâ€ ™ .
No one really dealt with that .
What was going on in my mind was [ the US ] fucked Australians over , so
[ Assange ] fucked them over.â€ �
Carey , who won two Booker prizes for his historical novels True History of the Kelly Gang and Oscar and Lucinda , also spoke out about Amazonâ€ ™
s pitched battle with Hachette over terms for ebooks , which has been played out in public over the summer , saying â€œthe truth is far more complicated than Amazon are arseholes and publishers are saintsâ€ � .
â€œWhat I primarily think is that someone ought to start caring about the producers of the content , â€ � said Carey .
â€œPublishers are making a shitload of money because of the [ reduced ] costs on ebooks , writers less and less .
Publishers better start changing their P&amp;Ls [ profits and losses ] , and giving a better royalty rate than the pitiful one that they are offering on ebooks .
Publishers have let this happen as historically they have just rolled over for Amazon.â€ �"
2014-09-25,"How does a wanted man have a book party ?
On Wednesday night at Babycastles , a Manhattan videogame - art collective , Julian Assange celebrated the publication of his new book , When Google Met WikiLeaks .
He was present via videochat .
The collectivists projected him on their walls .
A crowd had formed to see the shining - haired hacker king â€ “ youngish New Yorkers , mostly .
They stood or sat and drank beers as Assange talked about the internet .
Assange said : â€œCompare the mission statements of Google and the NSA â€ “ the NSA , who literally say , â€˜We want to collect all private information , pool it , store it , sort it , index it , and exploit it.â€ ™
Whereas Google says , â€˜We want to collect all private information , pool it , store it , sort it , and sell those profiles to advertisers.â€ ™
Really , theyâ€ ™ re almost identical.â€ �
He said , â€œEvery time you go to a party and take a picture and post that picture to Facebook , youâ€ ™ re being a rat .
Youâ€ ™ re being a narc.â€ � Assange now wears a beard .
It fuzzed as the feed wavered .
â€œPeople who use Google are the product , â€ � he said .
Assange has not left the Ecuadorean embassy in London since August 2012 .
Meanwhile , he is cursed by statesmen , acclaimed by radicals , and copied by anarchists all over .
â€œThank
God for prison!â€ �
the hero of Aleksandr Solzenhitsynâ€ ™ s
In the First Circle thinks .
â€œIt gave me the chance to think.â€ � Assange , at least , has been writing .
When Google Met WikiLeaks tells the story of his â€œsecretâ€ � meeting in 2011 with Eric Schmidt , the executive chairman of Google .
It is presented as a summit of equals â€ “ futurology as practiced by two prophets .
But in an interview a day earlier , Schmidt had called Assange â€œvery paranoidâ€ � .
Assange said : â€œSchmidt is actually quite similar to me â€ “ a smart guy , a very smart guy , who grasps structures and systems quickly .
Only heâ€ ™ s very banal .
He lacks language .
He doesnâ€ ™ t have the capacity for a nuanced understanding of geopolitics.â€ � Assange
said , â€œIt really wasnâ€ ™ t personal , until yesterday.â€ � He drew up an image of Schmidtâ€ ™ s new book .
It is called How Google Works .
The cover is like Assangeâ€ ™ s cover â€ “ a mock Google homepage .
On Assangeâ€ ™ s , â€œIâ€ ™ m feeling evilâ€ � replaces â€œIâ€ ™ m feeling lucky.â€ � Assange said , â€œMine was leaked long before his came out .
Could it be a happy coincidence?â€ � Assange spoke of revolving doors and unkept promises .
He lamented the â€œstandardization of human behaviorâ€ � imposed by Google .
He attacked its â€œplayroom logos and curved fontsâ€ � , the kiddie aesthetic overlaying the corporate agenda .
Assange seemed offended by the unadultness of it all .
â€œOnly these banal tech reporters will write anything about it , â€ �
he said .
â€œNo one understood nuclear weapons either , at first , but like the internet they shaped geopolitics.â€ � Assange spoke to an audience that believed him .
â€œGoogle never collaborated with the NSA ,
â€ �
Schmidt said on Tuesday in response to Assangeâ€ ™ s claims .
â€œIn fact , weâ€ ™ ve fought very hard against what they did.â€
�
At Babycastles , Assange worried only about being â€œboring.â€ � Twenty minutes in , the camera pulled back to reveal MIA .
The provocateur and pop star sat alongside Assange and expressed her hope for his imminent freedom .
Assange quotes her lyrics in his book â€ “ â€œArmbone connects to the handbone / Handbone connects to the internetâ€ � â€ “ a mantra for the new paranoia .
MIA explained , â€œI was out living near burning man .
Eric Schmidt must have had a bad LSD trip and I tuned into it.â€ �
Then MIA wandered off .
Assange skipped over his own troubles
â€ “ the allegations of rape , the memoirs of the disaffected .
He took questions and subverted their premises .
What is a greater force for good , corporations or nations ?
â€œYouâ€ ™ re assuming a difference between the private sector and the state.â€ �
Was â€œparanoia a badge of honorâ€
� ?
The question came from the moderator , Daniel Stuckey of Motherboard .
â€œWell â€ ¦ Schmidt has a difficult job , â€ � Assange said .
Was he the only grown - up in the room ?
â€œHeâ€ ™ s so punk
, â€ � said Liz , a music journalist .
â€œHeâ€ ™ s steampunk , â€ � said Pamela Drew .
Said Nick , a student , of Assangeâ€
™ s plight :
â€œItâ€ ™ s more like Brave New World than 1984 .
Itâ€ ™ s not like these sexy YA dystopias.â€
�
The moderator took a survey â€ “ how many Google employees were in the house ?
No hands .
â€œIâ€ ™
ll offer them a deal , â€ � Assange said .
â€œTwenty percent off , and weâ€ ™ ll mail the book to you in a brown paper bag.â€ � Laughter â€ “ but could Assange hear it ?
His publisher , Colin Robinson , confirmed that Assange was for real ."
2014-10-19,"Last year , UK cinemagoers were treated to two competing accounts of the story of Julian Assange :
Bill Condonâ€ ™ s oddly inert drama The Fifth Estate , and Alex Gibneyâ€ ™ s more pointedly dramatic documentary We Steal Secrets : The Story of Wikileaks .
Although very different in form , content and , indeed , success ( Gibneyâ€ ™ s film was Bafta - nominated , Condonâ€ ™ s was hailed as one of the yearâ€ ™ s biggest flops ) , both movies wrestled with the conundrum of separating the cult of Assangeâ€ ™ s divisive personality from the significance of the information that he helped to publish â€ “ for better or worse .
Thereâ€ ™ s a similar tension at the heart of Citizenfour , which intimately documents whistleblower Edward Snowdenâ€ ™ s efforts to lift the lid on the intrusive post-9/11 US eavesdropping industry .
Yet unlike Assange ( who appears briefly ) , Snowden shows no signs of wanting to be the centre of any story ; on the contrary , he seems positively camera - shy as Oscar - nominee Laura Poitras captures him in a Hong Kong hotel room in 2013 , over eight tense days during which his revelations are first made public .
Accompanied by the contrastingly gregarious Glenn Greenwald and the Guardianâ€ ™ s meticulous Ewen MacAskill , Snowden attempts to weigh up the importance of standing up to be counted against the possibility of the story becoming about him , rather than his information .
With winning candour , he admits that he has no experience of the media and is eager to hand over decisions about what should be revealed , and when , to people whom he trusts to know better â€ “ another stark contrast with Assangeâ€ ™ s more egomaniacal approach .
Key to Snowdenâ€ ™ s trust is Poitras , who earned herself a place on the Department of Homeland Securityâ€ ™ s â€œwatch listâ€
� with 2006â€ ™ s
My Country , My Country ( about life under US occupation in Iraq ) and 2010â€ ™
s
The Oath ( filmed in Yemen and GuantÃ¡namo ) and here builds upon her 2012 short
The Program , wherein NSA whistleblower William Binney revealed how technology designed to gather foreign intelligence was used â€œto spy on US citizens without warrantsâ€ � .
An NSA contractor employed by Booz Allen Hamilton , Snowden became similarly alarmed that he was â€œdesigning systems to amplify state powerâ€ � .
Encrypted emails to Poitras led to clandestine encounters of the kind that normally only happen in spy movies , replete with coded exchanges ( â€œDo you know the restaurantâ€ ™ s opening hours?â€ � ) in exotic foreign locales .
After their secretive sojourn in Hong Kong , during which the bulk of Citizenfour was filmed , the various parties dispersed , with the now outlawed Snowden seeking refuge in Russia , Greenwald returning to Rio and Poitras heading to Berlin to complete her film in secrecy .
The filmâ€ ™ s
final stanza , which was carefully â€œredactedâ€ � until the New York premiere last Friday , reunites the central characters in Russia , where they share a broken conversation in which key words are scribbled on notepads rather than spoken aloud ( for fear of listening devices ) and then shredded before the cameraâ€ ™ s prying eyes .
John le CarrÃ
© couldnâ€ ™ t have made this stuff up .
As with so much of her previous work , Poitrasâ€ ™ s documentary dramatically straddles the divide between art and journalism , cinema and reportage .
The trailer for Citizenfour , which warns that â€œevery border you cross , every purchase you make , every call you dial ... is in the hands of a system whose reach is unlimited but whose safeguards are notâ€ �
, plays it as the most chilling thriller of the year , and thatâ€ ™ s no an idle boast ; there is tension here to rival any of executive producer Steven Soderberghâ€ ™ s taut dramas .
Outside of the interviews , Poitras presents us with lines of dot - dash lights that could be digital code , but gradually come into focus as the overhead illuminations of a long , dark tunnel â€ “ the rabbit hole down which we must travel .
An ominous , rumbling score adds menace , suspended chords and electronic creaks suggesting a descent into some Stygian world .
Even in the brightly lit hotel rooms , the sound continues to alarm , the shrieking bell of a suspiciously timed fire drill setting our subjectsâ€ ™ nerves on edge â€ “ and ours .
Revelations that every phone and mobile device can be remotely used as a bug ( at one point , Snowden hides beneath a cowl to protect his keystrokes ) crank up the tension further still ; when a mobile phone went off in the early screening I attended , the audienceâ€ ™ s annoyance was tempered by all - too - nervous laughter .
Iâ€ ™ m sure I wasnâ€ ™ t the only one who went home and took the battery out of their mobile .
At times I was reminded of Jafar Panahiâ€ ™ s
This Is Not a Film , which found the Iranian auteur covertly making movies while under house arrest in Tehran .
Elsewhere , there are echoes of The Internetâ€ ™ s Own Boy and the youthful altruism of Aaron Swartz ; one sequence in which Snowden attempts to disguise himself via the application of hair gel would not look out of place in a John Hughes movie , his now familiar tousled cut , specs and preppy smile suggesting a wide - eyed naivety at odds with his apparent understanding ( and acceptance ) of the magnitude of his actions .
Itâ€ ™ s a moment of light relief amid a movie of brooding darkness â€ “ bravely made and utterly engrossing .

2014-10-28,"Swedenâ€ ™ s chief prosecutor said on Tuesday she was seriously considering an invitation by the British government to question Julian Assange in London , before a court ruling in Sweden on whether to lift the warrant for his arrest .
The Foreign Office said on Tuesday it would welcome a request by the Swedish prosecutor Marianne Ny to question Assange inside the Ecuadorian embassy and would be happy to facilitate such a move , which is seen by Assangeâ€ ™ s lawyers as an important step towards breaking the deadlock surrounding the case .
The appeal court in Sweden is due to rule as soon as next week on a request by Assangeâ€ ™ s lawyers that the warrant against him be rescinded , but the timing of the Foreign Officeâ€ ™ s remarks appeared to be accidental .
Assange has sought political asylum in the Ecuadorian embassy , where he has lived for more than two years to avoid a perceived threat of extradition to the US for publishing military secrets .
Since 2010 Swedish prosecutors have been trying to question him about allegations of rape and sexual molestation , although he has not yet been charged .
â€œThese are matters for the [ Swedish ] prosecutor to decide on , but if she wished to travel here to question Mr Assange in the embassy in London , we would do absolutely everything to facilitate that .
Indeed , we would actively welcome it , â€ �
foreign minister Hugo Swire said on Tuesday in the House of Commons .
Ny said through a spokeswoman that the remarks were â€œall news to herâ€
� , and she would probably respond to them publicly within the next couple of days .
The argument that the prosecutor should interrogate Assange in London is a central element of his lawyersâ€ ™ appeal , because , they say , it demonstrates that the prosecutor has not conducted the case with sufficient â€œurgency or effectivenessâ€ � , thereby condemning Assange to indefinite â€œdeprivation of libertyâ€ � .
However , in documents submitted to the Appeal Court , the prosecutor states she has â€œcontinually , over the past two years , tested the conditions and the practical possibility for conducting the interrogations and other necessary investigative measures in Great Britainâ€ � .
Responding to a question from Anne McIntosh , Conservative MP for Thirsk and Malton , Swire said Ny was â€œquite rightly , a fiercely independent lady , and independent of the executiveâ€ � .
McIntosh said she and other Tory backbenchers saw the failure to question Assange in London as one of the barriers to justice in the case .
She had been moved to ask the question by concern from her constituents over the case of footballer Ched Evans , who is challenging his conviction for rape after serving two years in jail .
â€œI believe if [ Assange ] is innocent he should submit himself to the law , â€ �
she said .
Commenting on the response to her question , McIntosh added : â€œPresumably the prosecutor would have the time to pop over and speak to [ Assange ] before the Appeal Court ruling.â€ �
Swedish legal opinion at a senior level has this year swung against the prosecutorâ€ ™ s decision not to travel to London to interview Assange , with Anne Ramberg , head of the Bar Association , calling the current impasse a â€œcircusâ€ � .
Ramberg told the Guardian on Tuesday : â€œMany voices in Sweden take a view along the same lines [ as the Foreign Office ] .
It is time for this longstanding matter to be brought to a fair and proportionate end.â€ �
A spokeswoman for the Foreign Office said its willingness to help Swedish officials to question Assange was not a change of policy
but it was
â€œlikelyâ€
� that the message had not been made clear amid all the other questions about the case .
Details of any questioning â€œshould be agreed between the Swedish Prosecutor , Mr Assange and the Ecuadorian Embassyâ€ � , she said .
A spokeswoman for Swedenâ€ ™ s new justice minister Morgan Johansson declined to comment until the Appeal Court rules in the case ."
2014-11-13,"A Catholic activist who flagged his intention to confront US president Barack Obama during the G20 meeting in Brisbane is one of four people preemptively banned from the event .
Ciaron Oâ€ ™ Reilly , who was acquitted by an Irish court over the damaging of a US warplane en route to Iraq in 2003 , said police handed him a ban order on Thursday but could not give a reason .
Oâ€ ™
Reilly on Tuesday issued a press release saying he would call on Obama to pardon jailed US army whistleblower Chelsea Manning and end any plans to prosecute WikiLeaks publisher Julian Assange .
â€œI know
Julianâ€ ™ s
dad and Chelseaâ€ ™ s mother
so itâ€
™ s quite a personal connection I have with them really , so
I feel obliged to do some kind of action while Iâ€ ™ m here in Brisbane and the guy holding the keys to their bondage is in town ,
â€ � he told Guardian Australia .
Oâ€ ™
Reilly said it was â€œguessworkâ€ � whether it was this or his â€œhistory of non - violent civil disobedienceâ€
� that prompted the ban .
The peace activist served 13 months in jail , mostly in Texas , for his role in the â€œdisablingâ€ � of a B-52 bomber in upstate New York during the 1991 Gulf war .
Oâ€ ™
Reilly said WikiLeaksâ€ ™ s release of US diplomatic cables revealed that governmentâ€ ™ s annoyance at his acquittal in Ireland over the damaged warplane .
A notice addressed to Oâ€ ™ Reilly from police commissioner Ian Stewart said : â€œI have been provided with information about you and after considering the material , I am reasonably satisfied that you are a person who should be included on the prohibited persons listâ€ �
Oâ€ ™ Reilly likened the challenge of getting close to political leaders to the Michael Moore film Roger and Me .
â€œIâ€ ™ ve confronted George Bush Jr in Belfast , and Iâ€ ™ ve confronted Hillary Clinton in Dublin and Maggie Thatcher here in Brisbane in the 1980s ,
â€ � he said .
â€œSo itâ€ ™ s not impossible to get to these people and Iâ€ ™
ve got a bit of history of getting to places I should not have been .
â€œ(But ) as I said to the cops today , Iâ€ ™ m a pacifist so even if Iâ€ ™
m completely wrong about everything
, I canâ€ ™ t do too much harm , can I?â€
�
A police spokeswoman declined to comment on the decision to ban Oâ€ ™ Reilly .
But she said 15 people had been excluded from the event , including four â€œprohibitedâ€ � persons .
Oâ€ ™
Reilly said he would ask his lawyer tonight about whether to appeal against the order , which bans him from inner Brisbaneâ€ ™ s â€œdeclared zoneâ€ � and the University of Queensland where Obama will give a speech on Saturday .
â€œQueenslandâ€ ™
s got a long history of suppressing free expression like itâ€ ™ s doing today with the G20 but thereâ€ ™ s also a long history of people non - violently resisting that , â€ � he said ."
2014-11-17,"Julian Assangeâ€ ™ s two - year stay in the Ecuadorian embassy has inspired a new BBC4 comedy called Asylum .
Created by Fonejacker star Kayvan Novak and producer Tom Thostrup , according to the BBC Asylum â€œis a satirical comedy about a government whistleblower and a millionaire internet entrepreneur trapped together in a London embassyâ€ � .
Assange sought political asylum in the embassy in June 2012 to avoid a perceived threat of extradition to the US for publishing military secrets .
Swedish prosecutors want to question him about allegations of rape and sexual molestation , although he has not yet been charged .
Asylum will air early next year and is being made by 2LE , the independent production company behind prank E4 show The Work Experience .
Written by Thom Phipps and Peter Bowden , the comedy is part of a BBC season next year called Taking Liberties , celebrating 800 years of the Magna Carta and exploring democracy in the run - up to the general election .
The season will begin on 5 January with a four - part Radio 4 series on the Magna Carta , presented by Melvyn Bragg .
Other highlights include a day of live events under the title Democracy Day on 20 January â€ “ the 750th anniversary of Englandâ€
™ s first parliament â€ “ plus a four - part BBC2 series by acclaimed political documentary - maker Michael Cockerell called Inside the Commons , in which he gets unique access to the inner workings of the institution , from clerks to MPs .
BBC3â€ ™ s contributions include Magna Carta 2.0 , a documentary â€œpacked full of stunts , fun and comedyâ€ � from The Revolution Will Be Televised comedian Jolyon Rubenstein .

2014-11-18,"Nadezhda Tolokonnikova and Maria Alyokhina , two members of the Pussy Riot collective , have agreed to sit on the advisory board of an international whistleblower organisation of which Julian Assange is a trustee , after meeting the WikiLeaks founder at the Ecuadorian embassy in London .
The two women , who were imprisoned in Russia for protesting against Vladimir Putin and who are currently touring the UK , told reporters outside the embassy on Tuesday that they found they had â€œmore in common than we expectedâ€ � with Assange .
The Australian has not left the embassy since June 2012 after seeking political asylum in a bid to avoid extradition to Sweden to face accusations of sexual assault .
Assange had asked them to join the advisory board of the Courage Foundation , alongside the philosopher Slavoj Å½iÅ¾ek , the Pentagon Papers whistleblower Daniel Ellsberg and others , and they had accepted , the two women said .
The organisation , of which Assange is one of three trustees , raises funds for the legal defence of whistleblowers around the world , including Edward Snowden .
Asked if there was any contradiction in members of a feminist collective pledging their support for a man who is wanted over sexual assault allegations , Tolokonnikova , speaking through a translator , said : â€œWe did not review this charge that has been directed at him .
We do not think it is in relation to the things that he is doing right now.â€ � â€œWe also try to â€
¦ see the direction of oneâ€ ™ s intentions in the future , what he is trying to do and is doing right now , â€ � added Alyokhina .
Assangeâ€ ™ s legal team maintain that he has not been charged with any offence .
The women are in Britain to promote their campaign for prison reform in Russia , and an alternative news agency website called Mediazona , both of which they founded following their release from prison last December after 21 months in jail .
Alyokhina said they and Assange had a â€œhuge amount of things in commonâ€ � , particularly in relation to the Chelsea Manning case , which they considered â€œone of the most important cases in todayâ€ ™ s worldâ€ � .
The handful of news organisations invited to cover their visit to the embassy did not include RT , the Russian Kremlin - backed broadcaster which hosted Assangeâ€ ™ s chatshow
The World Tomorrow , which normally follows the Australianâ€
™ s movements closely .
Tolokonnikova and Alyokhina have been outspoken in their criticism of the channel during their visit , dismissing it as a source of pro - Putin propaganda and saying : â€œSome people on the left regard it as an alternative source of media â€ ¦ but leftists in the west should realise itâ€ ™ s in no way
a leftist channel.â€ �
They had raised the question of RT with Assange , said Alyokhina , â€œand obviously we disagree with Julian Assange on the RT issue , but it is enough that we definitely agree with each other on the most basic and important things.â€ �"
2014-11-18,"The winner Is Benedict Cumberbatch a bona fide box - office star ?
After disappointing returns for The Fifth Estate last year , the industry concluded that his star power alone wasnâ€ ™ t enough to propel audiences into a film featuring a character ( Julian Assange )
they didnâ€ ™ t like , didnâ€
™ t care about , or thought they knew plenty about already .
Then again , the list of actors able to deliver hits from any material is vanishingly small .
Hit movies invariably require the combination of the right actor in the right role , positioned for a defined audience .
The Imitation Game , evidently , brings together the actor , role and subject matter desired by every distributor and financier .
With a debut of Â£2.74 m ( including Â£47,000 in previews ) from 459 screens , delivering a robust average of Â£5,975 , the film has landed at the top end of industry expectations .
This is , after all , a second world war movie about a socially maladjusted maths boffin ( Alan Turing ) , rather than , say , a heroic tank commander played by Brad Pitt in Fury , to give a recent example .
The film doesnâ€ ™ t necessarily deliver the exciting action and inspiring bravery associated with the war - film genre .
Its thrills â€ “ a race against time to crack the Enigma code and defeat the Nazis â€ “ exist in a more cerebral space .
Apt comparisons for The Imitation Game are hard to make , but the movie Enigma , likewise concerning the Bletchley Park codebreakers , debuted in 2001 with Â£797,000 .
Despite the familiarity of the bestselling Robert Harris novel for the earlier film , audiences are showing stronger interest in a real - life character â€ “ whose tragic denouement gives The Imitation Game some real emotional purchase â€ “ than a fictional composite .
They may also be being drawn to the new filmâ€ ™ s cast , which features Cumberbatch alongside Keira Knightley , Matthew Goode , Mark Strong , Charles Dance and Rory Kinnear .
Other comparisons that might be made for The Imitation Game include The Kingâ€ ™ s Speech ( debut of Â£3.52 m , including Â£227,000 in previews ) and period spy thriller Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy ( Â£2.81 m ) .
Both these films likewise exceeded expectations .
Fury , incidentally , began with Â£2.69 m including Â£698,000 in previews .
The chart - topper Unsurprisingly , The Imitation Game failed to dethrone Christopher Nolanâ€ ™ s Interstellar from the top of the box - office .
The sci - fi epic fell a respectable 29 % from its opening weekend , and has now delivered Â£12.13 m after 10 days .
That compares with Â£14.71 m for Gravity after two weekends of play , and Â£14.20 m for Inception .
The film should continue playing to a highly motivated core audience in the coming weeks , but will face strong competition for the broader blockbuster - goer â€ “ and especially for women and teenagers â€ “ with the arrival on Thursday of The Hunger Games : Mockingjay â€ “ Part 1 .
The festive hit Not as beloved by critics , the Nativity !
franchise has become a regular feature of the pre - Christmas cinema offer , beginning in 2009 with the first of the series .
That one debuted with Â£793,000 from 346 cinemas .
Three years later , sequel Danger in the Manger kicked off with a sturdy Â£1.61 m from 435 venues .
Now third instalment Dude , Whereâ€ ™ s My Donkey ? !
begins with a slightly better Â£1.80 m from 453 locations .
The film has opened two weeks earlier in the calendar than its predecessors for the simple reason that Paddington has cheekily nabbed its traditional late - November date .
You might imagine the new Nativity ! might have suffered from landing a little before families are really focusing on Christmas , but that is evidently not the case .
In fact , assuming it remains in cinemas all the way up to Christmas Day , the film may benefit from the extra two weeks of play .
Nativity ! has traditionally enjoyed the virtue of being a genuinely home - grown alternative to Hollywood family films in the festive season , but this year shares that distinction not just with Paddington ( arriving 28 November ) , but also Get Santa
( released on 5 December ) .
Dude , Whereâ€ ™ s My Donkey ? !
director Debbie Isitt and backers eOne can take credit for proving that there is a viable and enduring audience for a British family film at Christmas .
The upscale smash Adding another Â£1.69 m in the past seven days , Mr Turner now stands at an impressive Â£4.38 m after just 17 days of play .
The third weekend saw it expand to 383 cinemas â€ “ much , much wider than any previous Mike Leigh film has ever reached in the UK .
The expansion saw the weekend screen average dilute right down to Â£1,937 â€ “ although that might be considered not bad for a film in its third week of play .
The film has now presumably reached its maximum breadth , and will start shedding those multiplex sites where the expansion was maybe a tad speculative .
The previous best for Mike Leigh was Vera Drake , with a Â£2.38 m lifetime gross .
Mr Turner is already nearly double that tally , and looks on course to triple it by the end of its run .
It now faces big competition from The Imitation Game for older , upscale audiences .
The quiet disposal If a tree falls in the forest and no one is there to witness it , does it make a sound ?
Third Person â€ “ the new film from Crash Oscarâ€“winner Paul Haggis starring Liam Neeson , Mila Kunis , Adrien Brody , James Franco , Olivia Wilde , Maria Bello and Kim Basinger â€
“ crept out at the weekend on 10 prints , grossing Â£2,300 .
The film premiered at the Toronto film festival in September 2013 , then waiting 14 months for a UK release .
The Guardianâ€ ™ s
Peter Bradshaw called it a â€œcar wreckâ€ � , a â€œdeeply dubious luxury - tourist fantasyâ€ � and â€œsupercilious , incurious and glibâ€ � .
One for Sony to forget ever happened , evidently .
The future For the first time in four weeks , takings are up ( by a modest 2 % ) on the same weekend last year , which saw Gravity , Thor : The Dark World and Philomena continue their lock on the box - office chart .
Overall , the current market ranks as almost the very definition of average , with takings down 2 % on what Rentrak calls its â€œRolling 52 Week Normâ€ � , the average weekend for the past year .
Grosses are now set to surge , with the arrival on Thursday of The Hunger Games : Mockingjay â€ “ Part 1 , the penultimate entry in the franchise .

2014-11-20,"Stockholmâ€ ™ s
appeal court has rejected a demand by Julian Assangeâ€ ™ s lawyers to lift the arrest warrant against him , leaving the WikiLeaks founder still facing extradition to Sweden should he renounce his asylum in Ecuadorâ€ ™ s
London embassy .
â€œIn making this assessment , account must be taken of the fact that Julian Assange is suspected of crimes of a relatively serious nature , â€ � the court said in a statement on Thursday .
A Swedish prosecutor first sought Assangeâ€
™ s arrest four years ago following sexual assault and rape allegations , which he denies .
â€œThere is a great risk that he will flee and thereby evade legal proceedings if the detention order is set aside .
In the view of the court of appeal , these circumstances mean that the reasons for detention still outweigh the intrusion or other detriment entailed by the detention order.â€ �
But the court also noted that Swedenâ€ ™ s investigation into Assange had come to a halt and prosecutorsâ€ ™ failure to examine alternative avenues of investigation â€œis not in line with their obligation â€ “ in the interests of everyone concerned â€ “ to move the preliminary investigation forwardâ€ � .
The ruling is expected to put pressure on prosecutors to find new ways to break the deadlock .
Per Samuelsson , one of Assangeâ€ ™ s lawyers in Stockholm , said the courtâ€ ™ s criticism of the prosecutor was aimed at her refusal to come to London to question Assange .
â€œThis is crucial because the court said we were right in the wording , but not in the courtâ€ ™ s actual decision , â€ � he said .
After the ruling he had spoken to Assange , who was disappointed but confident that they would prevail in the long run .
â€œSwedish and international law is on our side , â€ � Samuelsson said .
â€œThe ruling shows we are on the right track , but unfortunately the court of appeal did not have the courage to overturn the arrest warrant.â€ �
Asked what he meant by the need to pursue â€œalternative avenuesâ€ � of investigation
, Niclas WÃ¥gnert , the appeal court judge in the case , told the TT news agency :
â€œThatâ€ ™ s a matter for the prosecutor .
One way would be to interrogate him in London.â€ �
Following a rejection of their demands by a lower court in July , Assangeâ€ ™ s lawyers argued in submissions to the appeal court that a European arrest warrant issued in November 2010 was being employed as a â€œcoercive measureâ€ � against him because it could not be carried out , thereby condemning him to â€œdeprivation of libertyâ€
� in order to exercise his right to asylum .
The submission said that , rather than explore possible avenues to break the deadlock , the prosecutor had â€œviolated the principles of consideration urgency , and effectivenessâ€ � by refusing to interview Assange in the Ecuadorian embassy and â€œhiding behind the arrest warrantâ€ � as an excuse .
Britainâ€ ™ s
Foreign Office said last month it would â€œactively welcomeâ€ � a request by the prosecutor to question Assange inside the embassy and would â€œdo absolutely everything to facilitateâ€ � such a move .
The appeal court also rejected a demand from Assangeâ€ ™ s lawyers for the prosecutor to hand over 200 text messages sent by the WikiLeaks founderâ€ ™ s accusers around the time of his alleged crimes .
Assange has always claimed he is innocent and that he would be prepared to face a Swedish court were it not for a threat that he would be extradited to the US for political crimes .
Neither the US nor Swedish governments have responded to his requests for guarantees .
Assange has not been charged with any crime , but is being investigated over allegations of rape and sexual molestation .
In response to the appeal , the Swedish prosecutors in the case , Marianne Ny and Ingrid Isgren , said they accepted there was â€œa
temporary obstacleâ€ � to executing the arrest warrant , but that it was nonetheless essential to prevent Assange from evading justice .
His presence in the Ecuadorian embassy was voluntary and so did not constitute a deprivation of liberty , they said , thereby nullifying defence arguments about disproportionality .
The text messages contained sensitive information about the two women in the case , they said , and information had previously leaked on to the internet and led to the women being harassed .
There were , therefore , â€œgrave reasonsâ€ � to protect the messages , the prosecutors said .
Legal opinion in Sweden is sharply divided on the case , with some arguing that the deadlock must be broken , principally by the prosecutors travelling to London to interview Assange .
Politicians are reluctant to be seen to put pressure on prosecutors , while public opinion has wearied of the case .
Mats Larsson , a columnist for Expressen , Swedenâ€ ™ s largest tabloid , argued last month : â€œEveryone is tired of the Assange circus â€ ¦
it is high time it was resolved.â€ �"
2014-12-06,"Thatâ€ ™ s it from me , Aisha Gani , and this is the end of the event and day 2 of the Logan Symposium .
Issues ranged from protecting whistleblowers , methods of investigation , a speech from Daniel Ellsberg the Pentagon papers whistleblower , what we can expect in the future , strategies of the future and a live video appearance from Julian Assange .
Follow more coverage from the Guardian tomorrow .
Have a good evening !
And thatâ€ ™ s it for questions with Julian Assange .
I asked Julian Assange how the Guardian â€œtrappedâ€ � him in the UK .
He said he thought he had one newspaper , a decent newspaper in his corner , and thought he would have a significant chance in legal process .
Then he attacked the Guardian , alleging : I am sure senior Guardian staff who dealt with Assange will have a different version of events .
Assange is asked about the sexual allegations : â€œI wish people would understand the details , but no - one wants to report the details.â€ � â€œI have been detained for four years.â€ �
â€œThere is a growing realisation of how unfair it isâ€
� , he says .
â€œIn Sweden they have also come to greater realisationâ€ � , that the prosecution was in violation alleges Assange .
Assange asks :
Itâ€ ™ s extremely interesting that the details of the women in the case , they didnâ€ ™ t want to file a complaint , why arenâ€ ™ t those details reported in the UK ?
Here are a round - up of tweets : Julian Assange says he has an insight of the UK , and makes a dig at The Guardian : Being trapped in the UK by the Guardian newspaper â€ “
thatâ€ ™ s why I was hereâ€ �
Adding :
I had impression of being patted on the headâ€ �
On the court decision announced yesterday , Assange said he had not read it
but : Itâ€ ™ s no surprise .
I despair of the United Kingdom.â€
�
He adds : People born in the UK grow up in a very plastic class system , and itâ€ ™ s why oligarchs prefer to set up home in the UK.â€ � Assange says when Edward Snowden was given asylum , supporters were secretive , â€œbut it was speed which gave us the edgeâ€ � .
â€œAnd I think that is something to be optimistic about , â€ � Assange adds .
He says that yes , big organisations such as the NSA have the resources â€ “ but the bigger the organsation the more incompoetemt and useless they are .
So the ability to carry out an operation â€œwithout cocking it up is pretty lowâ€ � .
The Wikileaks founder says : Let us not think that the only way to be effective is to be secretive .
Speed and simultaneity are effective tools as well .
Hereâ€ ™ s a vine of Assange speaking to the audience via video - link : Assange begins to discuss international relations , and discusses the intervetion in Libya : â€œYes part of that was about expansionist pressure to grab Libyan oil .
But he asks â€œwhat is the purpose of the National Security Agency?â€ �
Itâ€ ™ s to achieve power , Assange says .
And to get these agencies need resources , according to the Wikileaks founder .
Assange says power is found in two ways : Agencies tell the establishment , we can protect you .
The other way is the appeal to greed .
Assange explains that broadly speaking is the business of securitisation and empire .
Adding : If we didnâ€ ™ t have a muslim extremist threat , those organisations would not go away .
They would simply roll over and find another excuse .
Julian Assange , editor - in - chief of website WikiLeaks , speaks to the auditorium via video - link from the Ecuadorian embassy .
He begins by asking the audience : How many prisoners in the audience ?
How many Muslim journalists in the audience ?
Assange then says that : â€œWhat is happening to the Muslim population is a travesty to the human population.â€
�
Appelbaum , 31 , tells the audience : â€œyou need to live in a free societyâ€ � , if you want to use an iPhone .
Which , â€œcurrently you donâ€ ™
tâ€ � .
He explains how the UK government has access to Apple data .
According to the cyber - security analyst , he says that people who have grown up post 9/11 only know a security state .
He adds that 1984 seems quite quaint now : Britain is a surveillance state .
Appelbaum , connected to Wikileaks , takes a dig at the Guardian saying that we take the security of our content management system ( CMS ) as seriously as we take the protection of our sources seriously .
I think the editors would have something to say about that ...
He recommends using a cryptophone rather than a cell - phone .
It works over Tor , and uses IP addresses from phone to phone .
We are joined by Jacob Appelbaum , an American independent computer security researcher and hacker .
He was employed by the University of Washington , and is a core member of the Tor project , a free software network designed to provide online anonymity .
He says : In Pakistan , a cell - phone is a drone magnet.â€ �
Or if youâ€ ™ re using someone elseâ€ ™ s phone regularly
, maybe you can get them killed instead.â€ �
He canâ€
™ t be in London as he has concerns for his safety , so heâ€ ™ s on video - link but not on Skype , which he calls â€œabsolutely f - ing garbageâ€ � : Annie Machon , former MI5 intelligence officer , says that currently under RIPA the product of electronic intercept can not be used against you in the court of law .
But a bugged device in your workstation for example , can be used .
Machon says that if intelligence security want to follow you , they wonâ€ ™ t have a guy in a grubby coat â€ “ there will be around 20 guys following you in a very sophisticated way .
You have to be paranoid to escape surveillance , according to Machon .
She says the most secure way is to write on a piece of paper and pass it under glass , then destroy the evidence .
Weâ€
™ re on the fourth session of the day and will have talks by : Annie Machon on operational security Sander Venema on security dilemmas in publishing leaks Jacob Appelbaum on anonymity and finally David Mirza Ahmad on adversary resistant computing
The veteran investigative journalist says that : Electonic eavesdropping is not new.â€ �
He explains how in the 1930â€ ™ s : The Supreme Court of the US was bugged by corporate Americaâ€ �
Hereâ€ ™ s a round - up of tweets reacting to Bergmanâ€ ™ s speech :
Lowell Bergman , who won the 2004 Pulitzer prize for public service and is the chair of investigative journalism at UC Berkeley , is now speaking .
He says : Always report against your story â€ “ see it from each side .
The reason why a story isnâ€ ™ t picked up is if it hasnâ€ ™ t received sufficient due diligence â€ “ and it hasnâ€ ™ t persuaded the sceptics .
Make sure you check your documents â€œdocuments
can lieâ€ �
Face to face is always best
Next up is Dutch photojournalist
Kadir van Lohuizen .
He talks about his international projects - from Greenland to Bangladesh .
The auditorium is shown images from the Bangladesh project , a country which faces rising sea - levels , glacial meltwater from the Himalayan mountains to its north , and a wall is being built between Bangladesh and India .
Kadir asks where will the people go ?
He has set up the Noor agency to cover stories visually , around the world .
Lewis says , as he outlines in his book 935 Lies , that the â€œbiggest lies in US history that cost the most livesâ€ � is actually the tobacco industry .
He says presidents , whether it was Jimmy Carter or Barack Obama , have helped facilitate its trade .
He adds that president Obama is spinning more than president Bush â€ “ there are fewer reporters in the White House now
â€ “ and this is a worrying trend .
Charles Lewis makes parallels between the coverage of Vietnam war and Iraq invasion : Charles Lewis is a Washington - based investigative journalist and is the founder of the Center for Public Integrity in the US .
Lewis is speaking about the invasion of Iraq and asks â€œwhat if the public donâ€ ™ t actually want to accept the truth?â€ � â€œAs late as 2012 60 % of republicans still think WMD were found in Iraq.â€ �
He adds thatâ€ ™ s when he realised there was a crisis in journalism .
The auditorium is filling up again

Iâ€ ™ m
Aisha Gani , reporter on the Guardianâ€ ™ s news desk and Iâ€ ™ ve been covering day 2 of the Logan Symposium â€
“ a conference on secrecy , surveillance and censorship .
You can follow my tweets : @aishagani .
The hashtag for the event is # LoganCIJ14 .
So far , we have covered whistleblowing and methods for investigation .
We also had a special speech from Pentagon papers whistleblower Daniel Ellsberg .
Weâ€ ™ ve finished the morning sessions now , and Iâ€ ™ ll be back liveblogging at 14:00 .
A
Here are some reactions on twitter to Daniel Ellsbergâ€ ™ s speech : Daniel Ellsberg , Pentagon papers whistleblower , says : I identified very much with Chelsea Manningâ€ �
Ellsberg says that three things matter when whistleblowing : It has to be in mass has to have documents timely
He says that Britainâ€ ™ s
Katharine Gun is the only mass whisteblower who did it very timely , who leaked the tricks used during the UN Iraq war vote .
Dutch writer Karin Spaink is speaking about the mayhem and mishap of medical records in the Netherlands .
Spaink speaks about a case of how a hacker was able to access medical records , and was able to change data .
She said some computers were still using Windows â€˜97 .
Some solutions include : Data hygiene Make data protected and encrypted medtronic pacemaker Hereâ€ ™ s a round - up of tweets on the Nicky Hager talk : Nicky Hager is an investigative journalist from New Zealand , and is the next speaker .
He says that the first thing police always look for in a search is your mobile phone .
He suggests that journalists and IT people need to work together more on projects .
Speakers Anne Cadwallader and Paul Oâ€ ™ Connor speak about the case of Patrick Finucane , who was a practising lawyer who frequently acted for prominent members of the IRA , and was murdered in his home in North Belfast by the loyalist paramilitary group , the Ulster Defence Association ( UDA ) on the evening of 12 February 1989 .
Hereâ€ ™ s the official report of the Patrick Finucane Review .
The report concluded that actions by employees of the State actively furthered and facilitated the murder of Patrick , and that in the aftermath there was relentless attempt to prevent justice and holding those responsible to account .
The speakers explain how there is much evidence in the National Archives and in security leak sources .
So hereâ€ ™ s the panel for the â€œmethods for investigationâ€ � session , with special guest Daniel Ellsberg ( centre ) , who leaked the Pentagon Papers to the New York Times strengthening public opposition to the Vietnam War in 1971 .
The coffee break is over and next up is a session on investigation methods .
Anne Cadwallader and Paul Oâ€ ™ Connor will talk about how â€œthe truth is out thereâ€ � Nicky Hager will speak about working with whistleblowers .
And Karin Spaink is to speak about medical records .
â€œThe best whistleblower is the one you donâ€
™ t know
aboutâ€ � , says Bea Edwards during the Q&amp;A , and she explains that this shows organisations have protected the identity of the individual well .
Hereâ€ ™ s a round up of tweets after the international defense of whistleblowers session : Bea Edwards says that : If we didnâ€ ™ t have whistleblowers in these various organisations we wouldnâ€ ™ t no they were happening .
Bea says that whistleblowers face incarceration and there are very few avenues for compensations or protection .
She adds that it has been the press who have best protected Edward Snowden , or people like Ben - Artzi .
Bea says we need credible non - governmental organisations working together , the press and the public and to not just address the crimes exposed but to protect the whistleblower â€ “ such as the Government Accountability Project in the US .
Bea gives the case study of Eric Ben - Artzi , former analyst at Deutsche Bank , who was black - listed for whistleblowing on international financial crimes .
The Wall Street whistleblower wanted to know : How does national law enforcement investigate multinational banking fraud ?
Here are some tweets from the auditorium : Bea Edwards , executive and international director of the US Government Accountability Project ( GAP ) , which is the nationâ€ ™ s leading whistleblower protection organisation , now provides the international defense of whistleblowers .
Bea is responsible for the organisationâ€ ™ s actions defending whistleblowers through the Congress , the media and the courts .
Whistleblower Eileen Chubb gives her testimony of what happens after she whistleblowed on the UK healthcare system .
Eileen says that : Your work place becomes a nightmare .
The fear of tomorrow is there.â€ �
â€œThe trust of the employer is bing lost and that is very hard to compensate .
Eileen says that if we donâ€ ™ t protect the protectors , nothing will change , and adds that , next time , I wouldnâ€ ™ t dial â€œPâ€ � for police , but Iâ€ ™ d dial â€œPâ€
� for Panorama.â€

2014-12-11,"Ben Miller , the Death in Paradise star and Doctor Who baddie , is to appear in the BBC4 comedy about a government whistleblower inspired by Julian Assangeâ€ ™ s two - year stay in the Ecuadorian embassy .
The BBC is billing Asylum as â€œa satirical comedy about a government whistleblower and a millionaire internet entrepreneur trapped together in a London
embassyâ€ � .
The fictional show has been created by Fonejacker star Kayvan Novak and producer Tom Thostrup .
Assange sought political asylum in the embassy in June 2012 to avoid a perceived threat of extradition to the US for publishing military secrets .
Swedish prosecutors want to question him about allegations of rape and sexual molestation , although he has not yet been charged .
Asylum will air in 2015 and is being made by 2LE , the independent production company behind prank E4 show The Work Experience .
Written by Thom Phipps and Peter Bowden , the comedy is part of a BBC season next year called Taking Liberties , celebrating 800 years of Magna Carta and exploring democracy in the run - up to the general election ."
2014-12-17,"A lawyer for Roman Polanski has mounted what could be the Oscar - winning film - makerâ€ ™ s final bid to overturn a three - decade - old sex charge that saw him flee the US in 1978 after admitting â€œunlawful sexual intercourseâ€ � with a 13-year - old girl .
Alan M Dershowitz , who has represented heiress Patty Hearst and WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange , is asking to represent the 81-year - old director of Chinatown and The Pianist in the Los Angeles county superior court .
A case was filed there on Monday , according to the New York Times .
Polanski has been living in Paris since fleeing the US to avoid a likely custodial sentence in 1978 .
However , a warrant remains in force ensuring he would be arrested if he returned to America .
As a French citizen he is unlikely to face extradition while on home territory but was arrested by officials in Poland in October following a US request and spent more than nine months under house arrest in Switzerland in 2009 and 2010 in similar circumstances .
Neither incident led to Polanskiâ€ ™ s extradition but the film - makerâ€ ™ s legal team say the US justice system has â€œdeliberately omitted the fact that Polanski has already served the term of imprisonment imposed by the trial judgeâ€ � in seeking to bring him back for sentencing .
The director is understood to be planning a trip to Poland to shoot a new film about 19th - century French artillery officer Alfred Dreyfus and wants to ensure he will not face legal consequences if he does so .
Dreyfus , an Alsatian Jew , was falsely accused of passing secrets to Germany in 1894 in a well - known historical episode that gave rise to suspicions of antisemitism in the French military establishment of the period .
The original 1977 incident involving Polanski , which sparked a media storm at the time , reportedly took place after the director booked 13-year - old Samantha Gaimer as a model for a Vogue photo shoot .
He is alleged to have given her champagne and the sedative quaaludes before having sex with her at the Mulholland Drive home of his friend Jack Nicholson .
Gaimer publicly forgave the director in 1997 after self - identifying as his victim and has since called for the case against him to be dismissed .
Polanski skipped the country after it became clear he could face a 50-year sentence , despite having already served 42 days behind bars as part of a 90-day plea bargain in which he accepted a charge of unlawful sexual intercourse with a minor that he had assumed deferred the possibility of further punishment .
The original judge in the case , Laurence J Rittenband , was accused of changing his mind in the 2008 documentary Roman Polanski :
Wanted and Desired , which has formed the basis of earlier attempts to free the director from the risk of further prosecution .
However , renewed publicity in 2009 surrounding Polanskiâ€ ™ s alleged mistreatment of Geimer - he was originally charged with rape and sodomy - saw the film - makerâ€ ™ s reputation in the US further damaged .
Polanskiâ€ ™ s legal team nevertheless argues that he is not a continuing flight risk and points out that he voluntarily agree to speak to authorities in Poland earlier this year .
A spokeswoman for the Los Angeles County district attorney , Jackie Lacey , declined when asked to comment on the case by the Times ."
2015-01-11,"Maybe itâ€ ™ s inevitable , now that Julian Assange , has spent almost 1,500 days in the bowels of the Ecuadorian embassy , that memories of how he came to be in there grow ever more hazy .
With a forgetfulness that , if genuine , demonstrates how rapidly the most preposterous inventions can acquire the status of fact , even his colleagues at WikiLeaks have convinced themselves that Assange was incarcerated by a British government determined to keep him quiet .
Among the more opportunistic tweets responding to the massacre in Paris , came this , from the WikiLeaks account : â€œDavid Cameron pontificates about freedom of speech while spending millions detaining # Assange without trial.â€ �
At this impressive rate of fabulation , the 2,000th day should see our unhappy visionary gagged in a dripping cell as he awaits the death sentence applied to all fugitives who dare speak freely in the Kafkaesque nightmare that is 21st - century Britain .
It would bear as much relation to the facts , after all , as the current myth of his forced detention without trial .
So , to recap : in June 2012 , Assange , founder of WikiLeaks , was in the UK , free to speak on any subject he liked , and fighting extradition from Britain to Sweden , where he faced allegations of sexual assaults on two women .
Preferring to break his bail conditions rather than clear his name in Sweden , he sought asylum in the Ecuadorian embassy , where he remains to this day .
It is a source of consternation , at least outside his support base , that the cost of policing the embassy so as to enforce the legal process should Assange ever emerge , has now exceeded Â£9 m .
Last November , an arrest warrant for Assange was upheld in a Swedish court .
In short , # Assange is not â€œdetainedâ€ � by anyone or anything other than his own reluctance to face questioning about alleged sex offences , in a country where extradition to the US is no more likely than it is here .
But maybe this confusion about his journey from free - speech celebrity to pallid hermit helps one understand why Assange , though accused of sex offences , has survived much of the public opprobrium , internet gossip and suspicion that dogs other individuals associated with accusations of sexual misconduct , such as the harassment expert Julien Blanc or the Lib Dem octopus , Lord Rennard .
To the contrary .
On the website where a petition denounces the footballer and convicted rapist Ched Evans , thousands demand the Nobel prize , along with freedom and protection , for Assange ; his admirers even attempted to kickstart funds for a statue , honouring the man who has portrayed his Swedish accusers as instruments in a smear campaign .
Other analysts , however , have detected enough evidence of female self - determination to attribute the womenâ€ ™ s hostility to everything from sexual jealousy to a bad case of radical feminism .
Clearly , Assangeâ€ ™ s
better - informed supporters , who include celebrities such as Lady Gaga , Arundhati Roy and Vivienne Westwood , will be aware of the Swedish allegations and have chosen , for one reason or another , to set them aside .
A similar immunity seems to have been conferred on Prince Andrew , following allegations of his sexual impropriety with a minor who worked for his American friend , a convicted paedophile .
Though â€œemphatically deniedâ€ � , with the extra benefit of a character reference from Andrewâ€ ™ s ex - wife , who was lent money by the paedophile , there has been no announcement of the type of legal manoeuvre that the similarly accused Alan Dershowitz is pursuing after allegations that he also took sexual advantage of the 17-year - old .
Yet Andrew , too , has so far escaped a petition objecting to him â€œassisting the economic success of our United Kingdomâ€ � , as the palace describes his various holidays .
Perhaps , as happened to the creepy Blanc when he attempted to visit the UK , some other country would be good enough to help out with a banning order .
If the difference between unproven allegations and , in Ched Evansâ€ ™ s case , a formal conviction , can satisfactorily explain this variability in public tolerance , the footballerâ€ ™ s supporters are surely entitled to compare his treatment unfavourably with , for example , that of Roman Polanski .
Why have opponents of Evansâ€ ™ s return to football , now or ever , not shown similar concern about the film directorâ€ ™ s rehabilitation ?
Polanskiâ€ ™ s return to Poland , for filming , has just prompted another US extradition request , that he be returned to face sentencing pending since 1978 , when he admitted unlawful sex with a 13-year - old .
It must help , of course , that successful film directors have not been classified , by whichever national committee rules on fitness for role - modelling , as officially inspirational .
Polanski , like his colleague Woody Allen , who embarked , in his mid-50s , on an affair with his partnerâ€ ™ s 19-year - old daughter , sister to three of his children , can not be accused of betraying impressionable fans , those millions of starstruck kiddies whose wee moral compasses are left spinning wildly when their idols fall short .
That responsibility is still monopolised , as repeatedly confirmed in ongoing Evans analysis , by the profession that is , for many of us , more strongly associated than any other â€ “ no disrespect to full - time pimps or Sun newspaper editors â€ “ with vulgarity , aggression , racism , irresponsibility and contempt for women .
The Professional Footballersâ€ ™ Associationâ€ ™ s
Gordon Taylorâ€ ™ s casual analogy between the plight of Evans , the convicted rapist , and that of the bereaved Hillsborough families
only confirms that the profession that gave us Rooneyâ€ ™ s
â€œauld
slapperâ€ �
, Sky Sportâ€ ™ s â€œdid you smash itâ€
� , and , yet more recently
, the Premier League Richard Scudamoreâ€ ™ s â€œbig - titted broadsâ€
� work - account remains institutionally unworthy of redemption , at least where women are concerned .
Maybe it is not irrationally high expectations of footballâ€ ™ s young ambassadors , so much as an evidence - based recoil from its culture , that has fuelled a special implacability towards Ched Evans , to the point of closing down his career .
His only hope of eventual re - employment in football , at this point , is not , surely , his future father - in - lawâ€ ™ s website , but either a ) an open letter from Naomi Wolf , feminist and champion of Julian Assange , or b ) an appearance by Whoopi Goldberg protesting that Evansâ€ ™ s was not â€œrape - rapeâ€ � .
Polanski also benefited from extensive celebrity support , including , when he was arrested in Switzerland in 2009 , a petition for his release signed by , among the British luminaries , Salman Rushdie , Sam Mendes , Stephen Frears , Terry Gilliam , Jeremy Irons , Emma Thompson and Tilda Swinton .
Everyone in international film - making , they said , wanted Polanksi â€œto know that he has their support and friendshipâ€ � .
Perhaps there should be one law for acclaimed intellectuals and another for men such as Ched Evans ?
But if not , the latter must have at least as good a case as Polanski for re - employment , once he has completed his sentence .
Alternatively , if a serious sex conviction should cost a footballer his entire career ( along with the professions routinely closed to sex offenders ) then a similar vigilance should , surely , be applied to discernible sleazebaggery in any other profession , from whistleblowing to royal work , where clemency might be mistaken for approval ."
2015-02-09,"Amal Clooney has joined a legal team representing 11 prisoners known as the â€œhooded menâ€ � who allege they were tortured by the British army at the start of the Northern Ireland Troubles .
She is working with other lawyers from Belfast , Dublin and London to persuade the European court of human rights to censure the UK over the menâ€ ™ s treatment and to officially brand it as torture .
Clooney , whose husband is Hollywood actor George , is an international human rights lawyer whose clients include WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange , who is fighting extradition to Sweden .
She has also represented the Greek state in its bid to force Britain to hand back the Parthenon marbles .
Clooney is expected to fly to Belfast soon for meetings with the legal firm heading up the hooded menâ€ ™ s case , Kevin Winters solicitors .
She will also meet the ex - prisoners in the city .
In 1978 the European court of human rights admonished Britain for its inhuman and degrading treatment of the 14 prisoners but fell short of finding the UK guilty of torture .
The techniques inflicted on the detainees included hooding suspects , putting them into stress positions , sleep deprivation , food and water deprivation and the use of white noise .
They were arrested as a result of the British policy of internment without trial in 1971 when thousands of suspects , mainly from Irelandâ€ ™ s nationalist - republican community , were rounded up .
A solicitor from the Belfast firm , Darragh Mackin , said : â€œWe think Amalâ€ ™ s track record speaks for itself , as do all of the counselsâ€ ™ CVs in this case .
It is an extremely rare application , an interstate case before the European court .
â€œTherefore it is very significant that we have people with the background and experience of Amal and the other barristers who are involved making this application.â€ �
In June last year an RTÃ‰ documentary called The Torture Files said documents uncovered from the UK national archive revealed that the government knew its core argument â€ “ that the effects of techniques used on the hooded men were not severe or long - lasting â€ “ was untrue ."
2015-02-10,"British sitcoms have a history of resorting to crude stereotypes when it comes to portraying foreign characters â€ “ 70s sitcoms such as It Ainâ€ ™ t Half Hot , Mum and Mind
Your Language are considered too racist to rebroadcast , even in these times of numerous re - run channels .
Some would argue that these stereotypes have now simply relocated from sitcoms to Top Gear , so
itâ€ ™ s perhaps surprising to find this weekâ€ ™ s schedules book - ended by comedies that feature foreign characters .
On Monday night BBC4 broadcast the first part of Asylum , a three - part farce inspired by Julian Assangeâ€ ™ s predicament , with Ben Miller as Dan Hern , a GCHQ analyst who , after leaking CIA secrets , takes refuge in the London embassy of a Latin American nation .
His protectors include Castillo , a suave diplomat , and Rosa , an attractive young woman .
And Friday sees the last part of the seventh series of Benidorm ( ITV , 9 pm ) , the Spanish holiday comedy which ( along with its generic ancestor Duty Free ) is among the small number of British sit - coms set abroad .
Asylum uses two tricks to claim diplomatic immunity against suggestions of international insensitivity .
The Latin American territory that grants sanctuary to Millerâ€ ™ s character is fictional , which means that any offence would have to be taken by â€ “ or protests would have to come from â€ “ a very large geographical region .
And , in a common contemporary solution to accusations of racism , the Latin Americans â€ “ acted by Kayvan Novak and Yasmine Akram - are smarter and classier than the English characters : the targets of most of the gags are the egotism and cowardice of Hern and Ludo Backslash , an inane hacker also seeking asylum ( played by Dustin Demri - Burns ) .
Itâ€ ™ s typical of the international dynamics
that , while Hern is desperate to seduce Rosa , she rejects his approaches with contempt in a reverse of the power relationship between , say , Basil Fawlty and his non - anglophone waiter , Manuel , played by Andrew Sachs .
It seems unimaginable now that a Spanish character as hapless as Manuel would be permitted in a new BBC comedy â€ “ and certainly not if played by a British actor .
In ITV peak - time , however , the descendants of Manuel still exist and â€ “ possibly rather depressingly for the Spanish ambassador to the UK
â€ “ are still occupying much the same line of work .
Benidorm has a Spanish bartender , Mateo ( Jake Canuso ) , just as Duty Free had a Spanish waiter called Carlos and the students in Mind
Your Language included Juan , a bartender from Spain .
Itâ€ ™ s unfair , though , to suggest that there has not been some progress in the depiction of the delivery of drinks by Spaniards on British television .
Mateo in Benidorm speaks much better English than Andrew Sachs was ever allowed to and , in an exchange at the start of Fridayâ€ ™ s episode , gets the better of his English boss in a conversation that turns on the correct useage of the word â€œwhatâ€ � â€ “ which feels like a knowing use of the translation of Manuelâ€ ™ s famous catch - phrase .
In both Benidorm and Asylum , the more careful writing of dialogue is complemented by the casting of actors who have at least some non - English heritage ( although not necessarily Spanish or Latin American ) and this should help the series avoid joining those 1970s xenophobia shows on the never - repeat shelf .
Asylum in particular , by showing foreigners becoming exasperated with the idiotic English , marks a significant entry in the embassy book of condolence for the sort of shows we used to make ."
2015-02-10,"There are some new sitcoms you approach with a dread sense of antici - pointment , already silently convinced they wonâ€ ™ t work
and you wonâ€
™ t laugh .
But my hopes were high for Asylum ( BBC4 ) , starring Ben Miller as Dan Hern , a Julian Assange - style whistleblower , holed up in a fictional London embassy and fighting extradition to the US .
It sounded like a fertile breeding ground for laughs : a frustrated idealist with a God complex , trapped in a claustrophobic setting , surrounded by characters with whom he otherwise wouldnâ€ ™ t choose to spend time .
That setup , a tight space with a trapped protagonist , worked for Porridge , Steptoe and Son , Red Dwarf ( in its early days , anyway ) and countless others .
But so much of the important groundwork is missing in this first episode that I found myself too busy mentally asking questions to actually laugh .
Itâ€ ™ s the casual lack of basic rules that leaves the Asylum universe only partially formed .
In this fictionalised version of the Assange story ( itâ€ ™ s exactly the same apart from the country attempting extradition ) , the characters keep mentioning the real Assange .
Why bother to create a fictionalised setting if youâ€ ™ re going to directly reference your real - life source material and draw everyoneâ€ ™ s attention to the similarities ?
Into this already frustrating set - up comes Dustin Demri - Burns ( from sketch show Cardinal Burns ) as non - specifically European super - hacker Ludo Backslash ( in a fluorescent bomber jacket to denote â€œcrazyâ€ � ) , who is on the run from various authorities for illegally file - sharing films .
The embassy officials , lead by co - creator of the show Kayvan Novak , offer Ludo refuge in order to reignite press interest in their tiny country and reinvigorate their international trade figures .
As a propeller tacked on to the plot , it phuts and splutters and quickly runs out of gas .
I just didnâ€ ™ t believe any of it .
It has been described in various quarters as a satire .
And while they do have one specific dig at Guardian journalists and their apparent fascination with celebrity , Iâ€ ™ m struggling to see who their target is .
The fickle media who tired easily of Assange once it became clear that he wasnâ€ ™ t going anywhere ?
The corrupt central American dictatorships so lazily depicted here ?
( They havenâ€ ™ t even bothered to give all the characters from the Democratic Republic of El Rica the same accent . )
The self - aggrandising Assange figure ?
Itâ€ ™ s not even clear whether Hern is high status brought low or just a deluded loser from the off .
And to surround him with an entirely unpleasant collection of supporting characters â€ “ the woman he fancies but who hates him , the embassy official who seeks only to profit from him , the other embassy official who wants to store asbestos in his bedroom
â€ “ is self - defeating .
There is no light and shade at all .
Asylum could be a good sitcom , but they need more than just a high - concept idea for a character in a place â€ “ â€œWouldnâ€ ™ t
it be funny if a self - proclaimed big head got grounded in what is essentially his childhood bedroom with no way of escape?â€ �
Because that rather singular situation was already handed to them on a plate .
You canâ€
™ t just add some occasionally funny lines , rooted in neither character nor place , to fill the time between the opening and closing titles and hope for the best .
It wonâ€ ™ t stand up .
And talking of making things stand up , culinary reformer Heston Blumenthal used the impending Valentineâ€ ™ s festivities as an excuse to explore the link between food and passions of the trouser in Hestonâ€ ™ s Recipe for Romance ( Channel 4 ) .
It followed the usual format of his cooking programmes in that he invited a select group of guests ( couples , this time ) to sample his show - off edible set - pieces , but he was to scientifically ( sort of ) measure how much more fruity they were feeling once
theyâ€ ™ d put their knife and fork together at the end of the feast .
To pad out the hour , there was a genuinely fascinating interview with a food historian who provided some delicious tit - bits about aphrodisiacs of yore .
Apparently , folk once believed that a gentlemanâ€ ™ s member was enlarged not by blood but wind , encouraging the eating of beans and pulses in order to achieve full stiffness .
It conjured a lovely Heath Robinson image involving valves and copper tubing .
His final menu included heavy use of chocolate , oysters and champagne , but with his added signature variation .
Surprise chili seeds hid in some courses and one course included live snakes to engender a â€œshared painâ€ � response , shown to bond people together .
He might as well have thrown bricks at their heads and told them the restaurant was on fire for all the fight or flight confusion that ensued .
It may not have been much fun to eat , but it was entertaining to watch ."
2015-02-24,"A prominent Australian anti - war activist , Ciaron Oâ€ ™ Reilly , has told a Brisbane court how â€œgood law breaking has led to good law makingâ€ � before becoming the only person convicted under G20 laws that no longer exist .
Oâ€ ™ Reilly pleaded guilty in the Brisbane Magistrates court on Tuesday to entering the restricted zone around the G20 meeting in November while being one of a handful of individuals pre - emptively banned from the area by police .
The activist â€ “ who had announced online his plans to confront the US president , Barack Obama , over the treatment of US army whistleblower Chelsea Manning and Wikileaks founder Julian Assange â€ “ was convicted but given no further punishment after spending 42 hours in custody after his arrest .
His lawyer Terry Fisher told the court the laws were no longer in operation and Oâ€ ™ Reillyâ€ ™
s only avenue of appealing the ban , which was never explained , had been the police commissioner who had applied it .
â€œAt one point
the magistrate acknowledged how well motivated I am [ but ] I still had to obey the law , â€ � Oâ€ ™ Reilly told Guardian Australia .
â€œI kind of interrupted him and said that in recent Queensland history , good law breaking has led to good law making in terms of civil liberties and other struggles in the past that have involved non - violent civil disobedience .
He kind of listened to that a bit .
â€œMy lawyer raised that I was the only person ever convicted of this charge and the legislation is redundant now .
â€œThe reason I plead guilty is I took legal advice , they convinced me
I didnâ€ ™ t have a leg to stand on â€ ¦ the legislation was so authoritarian and undemocratic
, â€ � he said .
â€œI think there was a lot of fear generated before the G20 and obviously yesterday with the prime ministerâ€ ™ s speech , itâ€ ™ s not over yet ,
thereâ€ ™ s more fear being generated
all the time.â€ � Oâ€ ™ Reilly came to prominence during the 1991 Gulf war when he served 13 months in jail , mostly in Texas , for his role in â€œdisablingâ€ � a B-52 bomber in upstate New York .
WikiLeaksâ€ ™ s release of US diplomatic cables revealed the US governmentâ€ ™ s annoyance at his acquittal in Ireland over another damaged warplane .
Oâ€ ™
Reilly said he believed he was the only person processed through special holding cells under the Brisbane supreme court built to accommodate hundreds of G20 arrests which did not eventuate .
â€œI think they were going to run a night court there
and I said I wouldnâ€
™ t cooperate with bail conditions so they then moved me from there to the watchhouse , â€ � he said .
â€œA few people were in the watchhouse for carrying masks and things like that.â€ �
That was despite senior police revising their interpretations of the some of the temporary G20 laws just before the event â€ “ including the blanket ban on protesters wearing masks in the city centre â€
“ after they were challenged by former solicitor general Walter Sofronoff ."
2015-02-25,"Julian Assange is taking his appeal to Swedenâ€ ™ s highest court in a final attempt to persuade a Swedish judge that the arrest warrant against him should be lifted .
His lawyers will ask Swedenâ€ ™ s supreme court on Wednesday to agree that the â€œsevere limitationsâ€ � on Assangeâ€ ™ s freedoms since he claimed asylum in the Ecuadorian embassy in London in 2012 to escape extradition to Sweden are unreasonable and disproportionate to the case .
In August 2010 , the WikiLeaks founder and campaigning journalist was accused by two women of rape and sexual molestation , but he has not been charged because the prosecutor insists she is unable to interview him about the allegations .
Prosecutor Marianne Ny has declined invitations by Assange to do so in London , where he has taken refuge in the embassy to avoid a perceived threat of extradition to the US for publishing military secrets .
Assange denies all the charges .
In November , Stockholmâ€ ™ s appeal court rejected Assangeâ€ ™ s case , saying there was a risk he would evade legal proceedings should the detention order be lifted .
The court also ruled that his confinement to the embassy was voluntary .
However , in the ruling , senior appeal court judge Nicklas
WÃ¥gnert noted the deadlock in the case and criticised the prosecution for failing to move the investigation forward .
â€œThat is a heavy obligation on the prosecutor ,
â€ �
Judge WÃ¥gnert told the Guardian after the ruling .
â€œIf Assange challenges the detention order again [ in the supreme court ]
, I believe the court will consider what measures the prosecutor has taken to move the preliminary investigation forward in between now and the next challenge.â€ �
A spokesperson for the prosecutor said she would â€œnot give detailsâ€ � about the investigation , and Per Samuelson , one of Assangeâ€ ™ s Stockholm lawyers , said he had heard nothing about any movement .
Swedish legal opinion at a senior level has swung against the prosecutorâ€ ™ s decision not to travel to London to interview Assange , with Anne Ramberg , head of the Bar Association , calling the current impasse a â€œcircusâ€ � .
â€œIt would of course after such a long time be sensible for the prosecutor to determine whether to prosecute , â€ � she said .
â€œThe Assange story has become a less than flattering adventure not only for the English courtsâ€ ™ handling of the case , but also for the Swedish prosecutor.â€ �
Stefan Lindskog , the president of the supreme court , told the Guardian he had faced criticism for being â€œtoo
outspokenâ€ � when in 2013 he described the case as â€œa messâ€ � and called for it to be â€œsolved practicallyâ€ � .
â€œTwo courts have held that there is a probable cause [ for prosecution ] as regards sexual molestation , but probable cause is a lower standard than beyond reasonable doubt , â€ �
Lindskog said in a speech in Adelaide , Australia , in April 2013 .
Judge Lindskog said he had left the case behind him and declined to comment further .
In October , the British Foreign Office said it would welcome a request by the Swedish prosecutor to question Assange inside the Ecuadorian embassy and would be happy to facilitate such a move .
Claes BorgstrÃ¶m , a lawyer for one of the women in the case , told the Guardian he believed the prosecutor had â€œsome material in the investigation that so far nobody knows about except for herâ€ � , which might explain her refusal to interview Assange in London .
Samuelson said these were â€œempty wordsâ€ � â€ “ â€œI
know there is no hard evidence against Julian Assange.â€
�
After the supreme court later on Wednesday receives the arguments from Assangeâ€ ™ s lawyers , it must decide whether to grant their request for the appeal to be heard .
While it is not essential for the court to request a response from the prosecutor , it has the powers to do so , said Charlotte Edvardsson , a registrar at the supreme court .
It has not yet been decided which judges will decide on the appeal , Edvardsson said .
It is likely that the court will find it sufficient to issue a written ruling rather than hold a public hearing .
Samuelson said defence lawyers had widened and deepened their arguments against the arrest warrant .
â€œWe have gone into greater detail on judgments and protocols of the European court of human rights , deepening our investigation beyond the boundaries of Swedish law and taken it much more into European law , â€ � he said .
If they lose the case in Sweden , Assangeâ€ ™ s lawyers are looking to appeal to the European court , where they say legal thinking on detention â€œspeaks
stronglyâ€ � in their favour .
Swedenâ€ ™ s interpretation that Assange is not deprived of his liberty appears to be at odds with ECHR jurisprudence , said Jennifer Robinson , an Australian lawyer for Assange .
In January , Sweden agreed at the United Nations to a request by Ecuador to consider taking â€œmeasures to limit the time of pretrial detention or the equivalent situation of deprivation of liberty without charges and for investigation purposesâ€ � .
Assange says that his asylum in the Ecuadorian embassy amounts to deprivation of liberty under Article 5 of the European convention on human rights .
Sweden also agreed to a request by Argentina to consider measures to ensure that a guarantee forbidding the rendering of a victim of persecution to their persecutor can be given to â€œany person under the control of the Swedish authorities while considered a refugee by a third countryâ€ � .
Assange has requested a guarantee from the Swedish state that he would not be extradited to the US should he agree to be questioned in Sweden .
Anders RÃ¶nquist , Swedenâ€ ™ s director - general for legal affairs , said he believed that these requests were inspired by the Assange case , and noted that Sweden had until 15 June â€œto think about itâ€ � .
However , there was â€œno general obligation under international law to recognise diplomatic asylumâ€ � , he added ."
2015-03-05,"The US government is conducting an active , long - term criminal investigation into WikiLeaks , a federal judge has confirmed in court documents .
Five years after Julian Assange and his team began publishing the massive dump of US state secrets leaked by an army intelligence analyst , two wings of the Department of Justice and the FBI remain engaged in a criminal investigation of the open - information website that is of a â€œlong - term durationâ€ � ,
â€œmulti - subjectâ€ � in nature and that â€œremains in the investigative stateâ€ � .
The disclosure was made in the course of a ruling from the US district court for the District of Columbia , the jurisdiction of which covers federal agencies , and underlines the Obama administrationâ€ ™ s dogged pursuit of WikiLeaks and its unprecedentedly aggressive legal campaign against official whistleblowers .
Judge Barbara Rothstein records that she had considered evidence from both the Justice Departmentâ€ ™ s criminal and national security divisions , as well as from the FBI â€ “ and that the government included seven declarations , three of them delivered to her in secret .
At the end of her deliberations , the judge reached the conclusion that â€œthis court is persuaded that there is an ongoing criminal investigationâ€ � .
Rothstein added that federal agencies had told the court that their inquiry into WikiLeaks was â€œseparate and distinctâ€ � from the prosecution of the army soldier who leaked the vast database of secrets , Chelsea Manning .
She was convicted under the Espionage Act and sentenced in August 2013 to 35 years in military custody .
WikiLeaksâ€ ™ s lawyer , Michael Ratner , said the disclosure was significant because , coming from such a high court , it left no doubt about the US governmentâ€ ™ s intentions .
â€œWe are talking about a serious , multi - subject long - term investigation of WikiLeaks and its people , â€ � Ratner said .
â€œThis confirms in spades that the US authorities are coming after WikiLeaks and want to close it down.â€ �
The court ruling arrived in response to a freedom of information request from the Electronic Privacy Information Center ( Epic ) .
About a year after the Manning leaks , Epic requested from the DoJ and FBI all records regarding any individuals who had been targeted for surveillance â€œfor support for or interest in WikiLeaksâ€ � .
In her ruling , the judge ordered the national security division of the DoJ to redouble its search of its files for documents that might fit the freedom of information request .
But she sided with the federal agencies in granting them an exemption to the rules , so that they did not have to hand over any material to Epic â€ “ on grounds that doing so might interfere with their law enforcement activities .
The FBI and criminal division argued before the court that the release of their files â€œwould allow targets of the investigation to evade law enforcementâ€ � .
Rothstein agreed that â€œthe governmentâ€ ™ s declarations , especially when viewed in light of the appropriate deference to the executive on issues of national security , may satisfy this burden.â€ � Assange , the WikiLeaks editor - in - chief who is currently living in the embassy of Ecuador in London after being granted asylum there , poured scorn on the judgeâ€ ™ s reference to â€œappropriate deference to the executiveâ€ � .
â€œMy God
, I know I am an Australian , but that doesnâ€ ™ t mean that WikiLeaks deserves a kangaroo court , â€ � Assange told the Guardian .
Some aspects of the FBIâ€ ™ s investigation into WikiLeaks have already become public .
In January 2011 it was revealed that the US government had ordered Twitter to hand over private messages from a then WikiLeaks volunteer , the Icelandic member of parliament Birgitta JÃ³nsdÃ³ttir .
Earlier this year , it emerged that a similar demand for information had been imposed on Google relating to three WikiLeaks staffers , including the British citizen Sarah Harrison .
The Obama administration has launched eight prosecutions under the 1917 Espionage Act â€ “ more than under all previous US presidencies combined .
John Kiriakou , a former CIA officer , was released from federal prison last month after almost two years behind bars for disclosing the identity of another covert operative ; in January , Jeffrey Sterling was convicted under the act of leaking information to a New York Times journalist relating to a secret CIA operation in Iran ."
2015-03-13,"Lawyers for Julian Assange have claimed victory after a Swedish prosecutor bowed to pressure from the courts and agreed to break the deadlock in the WikiLeaks founderâ€
™ s case by interviewing him in London .
Marianne Ny , who heads the investigation into accusations of rape , coercion and sexual molestation against Assange , made a formal request to interrogate him in the Ecuadorian embassy â€ “ the first sign of movement in a case that has been frozen since August 2012 .
The prosecutor will also ask the UK government and Ecuador for permission to carry out the interviews at the embassy in London , where Assange has been staying for more than two - and - a - half years to avoid extradition to Sweden , from where he fears being handed over to the US to face espionage charges .
Ny said she had changed her mind because the statute of limitations on several of the crimes of which Assange is suspected runs out in August 2015 .
â€œMy view has always been that to perform an interview with him at the Ecuadorian embassy in London would lower the quality of the interview , and that he would need to be present in Sweden in any case should there be a trial in the future .
This assessment remains unchanged , â€ �
Ny said in a statement .
â€œNow that time is of the essence , I have viewed it therefore necessary to accept such deficiencies to the investigation and likewise take the risk that the interview does not move the case forward , particularly as there are no other measures on offer without Assange being present in Sweden.â€ � Per Samuelson , a Stockholm lawyer for Assange , said : â€œIt is a victory for us .
We have been asking for this to happen for over four years .
That is the route to acquittal.â€ �
There were minor details to be discussed between Assange and the prosecutor over how the interrogations will be conducted , Samuelson said , â€œbut there are no major questions as I see itâ€ � .
Assange welcomed the development but was irritated it had taken so long , Samuelson said .
They are due to meet in London on Saturday .
The British Foreign Office said in November it would welcome a request by the Swedish prosecutor to question Assange inside the Ecuadorian embassy .
Ecuadorâ€ ™ s government has also repeatedly stated that it approves of such a step .
Assange has been wanted in Sweden since the accusations were made against him in August 2010 .
His lawyers , who are currently appealing against his arrest warrant in Swedenâ€ ™ s highest court , have complained bitterly about the prosecutorâ€ ™ s refusal to travel to London to speak to him â€ “ an essential step under Swedish jurisprudence to establish whether Assange can be formally charged .
The prosecutorâ€ ™ s refusal , they say , has condemned Assange to â€œsevere limitationsâ€
� on his freedom that are â€œdisproportionateâ€
� to the accusations against him .
Ny has objected that interrogating Assange abroad would be complicated and largely pointless because â€ “ should sufficient grounds emerge â€ “ he would still have to travel to Sweden for trial .
However , she is obliged to drop the case against him unless she believes there are reasonable grounds for suspicion of his guilt .
The prosecutorâ€ ™ s
apparent U - turn on Friday came just days after a supreme court judge in Stockholm wrote to the prosecutor general , directing him to give his opinion concerning Assangeâ€ ™ s appeal , â€œespecially regarding the investigatory procedure and the principle of proportionalityâ€ � .
Further pressure on the prosecutor came in November when the appeal court , while rejecting Assangeâ€ ™ s arguments , nonetheless directed sharp criticism at Ny for failing in her obligation to move the case forward .
Swedish legal opinion at a senior level has swung against the prosecutorâ€ ™ s position .
Anne Ramberg , the head of Swedenâ€ ™ s Bar Association , welcomed the decision to go to London , but added : â€œIt should have been taken long before.â€ � Karin Rosander , Nyâ€ ™ s spokeswoman , said the decision to go to London was entirely her own .
She said : â€œSwedish prosecutors are independent in their decision - making and nobody , not even the prosecutor general , can order a prosecutor what steps to take.â€ �
Elisabeth Massi Fritz , a lawyer for one of the women in the case , said she had changed her mind on questioning Assange in London , and her client had also requested the move .
â€œIf Swedish investigators and prosecutors are present when Assange is interviewed , then it will be a good interrogation of high quality ,
â€ � she said .
Last year , Fritz dismissed as â€œempty and ill - informed speculationâ€ � calls by Swedish politicians and top legal figures to go to London .
Questioning the prosecutorâ€ ™ s reluctance to travel to London , several Swedish legal figures have pointed to the occasion in 2012 when the entire Stockholm district court moved to Kigali for several weeks to interview witnesses to the Rwandan genocide , with more witnesses heard in Stockholm by video link from Kigali .
The proposed interviews in London will be conducted by the deputy prosecutor in the case , Ingrid Isgren , and a police investigator .
The statute of limitations on the rape accusations against Assange expires in August 2020 .
Swedenâ€ ™ s
supreme court is due to rule on the case later this month or next .
The prosecutorâ€ ™ s change of heart was â€œdemonstrably cynicalâ€ � in waiting until shortly before the statute of limitations expired to keep Assange â€œtrapped in the UKâ€ � , said journalist John Pilger for the Julian Assange Legal Defence Fund .
Ecuadorâ€ ™ s foreign ministry said in a statement : â€œWe welcome the decision of the Swedish authorities to finally interview Julian Assange in our London embassy .
The government of Ecuador has repeatedly made this offer since 2012 , when it granted asylum to Mr Assange .
â€œThis decision could have been taken from the beginning , and not only when the case is about to be subject to statute of limitation .
It is a great injustice that Mr Assange , due to the prosecutorsâ€ ™ failure to fulfil their duty , has been deprived of freedom without charge in the United Kingdom , and confined in our embassy for almost 1,000 days .
This amounts to a violation of his human rights , at great personal cost to him and his family.â€ � â€¢ This article was amended on 19 June 2015 to clarify quotes from Marianne Ny .

2015-04-16,"Some of the most senior judges in Britain withdrew from a legal conference in Glasgow after the founder of WikiLeaks , Julian Assange , was booked to speak by video - link .
Assange , who has been living at the Ecuadorian embassy in London since losing his legal challenge to an extradition request from Sweden in 2012 , spoke at a panel session of the Commonwealth Law Conference about surveillance and security on Wednesday .
Judges from Scotland , England and Wales and the UK supreme court had agreed to speak at or chair other sessions but withdrew â€ “ in some cases after arriving at the conference centreâ€ “ when they found out about Assangeâ€ ™ s appearance .
Among those to boycott the conference were the most senior judge in Scotland , Lord Gill , and two judges on the supreme court , Lord Neuberger and Lord Hodge .
Representatives of the judges said it would have been inappropriate for them to have attended , because of Assangeâ€ ™ s legal status .
A spokesperson for the Judicial Office for Scotland said : â€œThe conference programme was changed to include Mr Assangeâ€ ™ s participation at short notice and without consultation .
Mr Assange is , as a matter of law , currently a fugitive from justice , and it would therefore not be appropriate for judges to be addressed by him .
â€œUnder these circumstances , the lord president , Lord Gill , and the other Scottish judicial officeholders in attendance have withdrawn from the conference.â€ �
A spokesman for the UK supreme court added : â€œLord Neuberger and Lord Hodge share the concerns expressed by Lord Gill and his fellow senior Scottish judges regarding the late addition of Mr Assange to the conference programme .
â€œAs a result of this unfortunate development
, they trust that delegates will understand their decision to withdraw from the conference .
The justices took this action regretfully , as they value greatly the work of the Commonwealth Lawyers Association and the role of the conference as an important forum for sharing experiences and good practice across the legal profession.â€ �
A spokesman for judiciary of England and Wales said : â€œThe lord chief justice shares the concerns expressed by Lord Gill and Lord Neuberger in relation to the late change to the conference programme .
He agreed with the position taken by both , and the judges of England and Wales also withdrew from the conference .
The lord chief justice and the judiciary continue to express their strong commitment to the rule of law across the Commonwealth , and internationally.â€ �
More than 20 Commonwealth judges attended the session at which Assange spoke and listened to a discussion about legal professional privilege ."
2015-05-11,"Swedenâ€ ™ s highest court has thrown out Julian
Assangeâ€
™ s appeal against his arrest warrant , dashing his immediate hopes of an end to his three - year confinement in Ecuadorâ€ ™ s embassy in London .
His lawyers were , however , encouraged by a 4 - 1 decision by the judges , which a senior legal figure said indicated the court could still change its mind .
The WikiLeaks founder is wanted for questioning in Sweden following allegations of sex crimes that date from August 2010 .
But without a guarantee he would not be extradited to the US to face espionage charges , he has refused to travel to Sweden and in 2012 sought asylum in the Ecuadorian embassy .
Stockholmâ€
™ s supreme court said in its ruling on Monday : â€œThe public interest in the investigation continues to weigh heavily .
In view hereof , and the risk that Julian Assange may evade prosecution if the arrest warrant is lifted , continued detention is currently regarded as compatible with the principle of proportionality.â€ �
Per Samuelson , a lawyer for the 43-year - old Australian , condemned what he called a weak decision by the court , which he said had issued its ruling before the Assange team had made its final submission .
But the split decision suggests that the supreme courtâ€ ™ s position on proportionality is not set in stone , according to Anne Ramberg , the head of Swedenâ€ ™ s Bar Association .
â€œThe reasoning of the court indicates that it may take a different view with the passing of further time , â€ � she said .
Claes BorgstrÃ¶m , a lawyer for one of the complainants in the case , said he was very satisfied by the courtâ€ ™ s decision , but was surprisedone judge had dissented .
â€œIf Assange was suspected of a theft or another minor crime , proportionality would be different , but he is suspected of rape , a very severe crime , â€ �
BorgstrÃ¶m said .
An 11-month battle through Swedenâ€ ™ s courts has seen Assangeâ€ ™ s lawyers argue that his exile in Ecuadorâ€ ™ s embassy amounts to enforced and that the severe restrictions it places on his freedoms are disproportionate to the scale of the crimes of which he is accused .
Lower courts in Sweden have objected that Assangeâ€ ™ s confinement is self - imposed .
The supreme court backed the lower courts , stating that the fact of his residence in the embassy â€œcannot be given any importance in the assessment of proportionality â€ ¦ Julian Assangeâ€ ™ s freedom of movement can not be considered to be limited in practice in such a way that it is contrary to the European convention [ on human rights]â€ � .
The ruling does not include a legal explanation for this conclusion , which Samuelson said was â€œdisappointing and annoyingâ€ � .
But in an appendix to the ruling , Justice Svante Johansson issued a dissenting opinion in support of the appeal .
The arrest warrant was â€œin violation of the principle of proportionalityâ€ � , he said , and the reasons for continued detention did not â€œoutweigh the intrusion and inconvenienceâ€ �
it caused Assange .
Assangeâ€ ™ s lawyers said on Monday they would discuss their next steps .
Previously they said they were prepared to take their case to the European court of human rights , where they maintain that legal thinking on proportionality speaks in their favour .
Swedish prosecutors are now preparing to travel to London to question Assange , after Stockholmâ€ ™ s appeal court in November was sharply critical of their failure to move the case forward .
Assange has argued that the prosecutorâ€ ™ s repeated refusal to question him in London has condemned him to remain in legal limbo .
The supreme court also stated on Monday that the investigating authorities â€œmust examine what alternative investigative opportunities are available to drive the investigation forwardâ€ � .
A spokesperson for Marianne Ny , the prosecutor in the case , said she was waiting for formalities to be completed before conducting the interrogation , which is a necessary step towards formal charges .
Although Assange has not yet been formally charged â€ “ a process that occurs relatively late in the legal process under Swedish jurisprudence â€
“
the prosecutor is obliged to drop the case unless there are reasonable grounds for suspicion .
Assangeâ€ ™ s lawyers said on Monday they have the right to go though the entire legal process once again in the Swedish courts after the London interrogation has taken place , holding out the prospect of at least another year of legal wrangling .
In January , Swedenâ€ ™ s government agreed to examine whether it could issue a guarantee forbidding rendition of â€œany person under the control of the Swedish authorities while considered a refugee by a third countryâ€ � .
It is scheduled to issue a decision by 15 June .
As well as Johansson , the supreme court justices who ruled in the case were Ann - Christine Lindeblad , Gudmund Toijer , Ingemar Persson and Lars Edlund ."

2015-05-13,"Jarvis Cocker began stitching the words â€œcommon peopleâ€ � when he was on a train ; the human rights lawyer Clive Stafford Smith got his needle and thread out for â€œlaw of the landâ€ � while in GuantÃ¡namo Bay ; and Julian Assange had little choice but to embroider the word â€œfreedomâ€ � from his room in the Ecuadorian embassy .
All three are contributors to a work of art by Cornelia Parker that goes on display at the British Library on Friday : a 13-metre - long embroidery celebrating the Magna Carta by copying its Wikipedia article .
More than 200 people â€ “ including barons , lawyers , politicians , prisoners , writers and celebrities â€ “ contributed by stitching words and phrases that were significant to them .
â€œI wanted to create a portrait of our age , â€ � said Parker .
â€œAll these people have opinions about democracy and I thought carefully about the words they should stitch.â€ �
Parker got the idea quite straightforwardly after going online to Google â€œMagna Cartaâ€ � .
â€œThe first thing you get is the Wikipedia page
and I just got thinking that itâ€ ™ s an embroidery of history , really .
The page has been made by lots of different people and it is quite subjective ...
it is a peopleâ€ ™ s encyclopaedia .
I thought perhaps we should embroider the page.â€
�
Parker had the pageâ€ ™ s
text printed lightly on to fabric which was then cut up into more than 80 sections .
They were then sent off to 36 prisoners in 13 jails who embroidered the bulk of the text .
Nearly 200 gaps were left for other contributors to do their bit .
Parker said she sent or gave willing participants the fabric section , a needle and thread , and a choice of three stitches to use : back , cable and stem .
Among those rising to the challenge were Baroness Doreen Lawrence , who stitched the words â€œjusticeâ€ � , â€œdenialâ€ � and â€œdelayâ€ � in line seven of the tapestry ; the Wikipedia founder Jimmy Wales ( â€œuserâ€ ™ s manualâ€ � ) ; the former GuantÃ¡namo inmate Moazzam Begg ( â€œheld without chargeâ€ � ) ; and Paddy Hill , one of the men wrongly convicted of the Birmingham bombing ( â€œFreemanâ€ � ) .
The detailed , and far trickier , pictures on the Wikipedia page , such as a mural of Pope Innocent III and 13th - century documents from the British Library collection , were tackled by members of the Embroiderersâ€ ™ Guild , a national charity that promotes the craft .
Parker said she loves the idea of turning something digital into an analogue hand - crafted object .
â€œI wanted the embroidery to raise questions about where we are now with the principles laid down in the Magna Carta , and about the challenges to all kinds of freedoms that we face in the digital age.â€ �
Magna Carta ( An Embroidery ) was commissioned by the Ruskin School of Art at Oxford University in partnership with the British Library and is part of a wider programme of events marking the 800th anniversary of Magna Carta .
Parker said she was delighted with the end product and the contributions .
Some of the stitching is clearly better than others and some of the contributors admitted needing assistance â€ “ former home secretary Kenneth Clarke , for example , enlisted the help of his wife , Gillian .
There is even blood , supplied by the Guardian editor , Alan Rusbridger .
A metaphor for the lengths this organisation will go to in pursuit of truth and justice ?
â€œHe pricked his finger , â€ � said Parker .
â€¢ Magna Carta ( An Embroidery ) is on display 15 May-24 July at the British Library ."
2015-06-17,"A Swedish prosecutor has cancelled an appointment to interview Julian Assange at the Ecuadorian embassy in London , according to the Wikileaks founder , who has been living in the building for nearly three years to avoid extradition .
Assange said Marianne Ny had led his lawyers to believe that an appointment to take a statement from him would take place on Wednesday and described the cancellation as reckless .
But Ny said the meeting would have to be called off because she had not received official permission from Ecuador to enter its London embassy .
â€œSome formal approval has not come , and it is unclear when the matter can be resolved , â€ � the prosecutor Marianne Ny wrote to Assangeâ€ ™ s lawyers at 3.47pm on Wednesday , in email correspondence seen by the Guardian .
â€œIt is therefore no longer necessary to carry out investigative measures this week.â€ � Swedish prosecutors have been trying since 2010 to question Assange about allegations of rape and sexual molestation , although he has never been charged .
He entered the embassy three years ago on Friday and has remained there to avoid a perceived threat of being sent on from Sweden to the US for publishing military secrets .
Lawyers for Assange claimed a victory in March after Ny bowed to pressure from the courts and agreed to break the deadlock in the case by interviewing him in London .
Nyâ€ ™ s formal request to interrogate him in the Ecuadorian embassy was the first sign of movement in a case that has been frozen since August 2012 .
Assange said on Wednesday : â€œThis afternoon , the Swedish prosecutor Marianne Ny cancelled a prospective appointment to take my statement today .
We proposed the dates and Ny accepted them .
â€œProsecutor Ny led my lawyers to believe that the appointment was proceeding .
My lawyers had booked tickets and I have been put to considerable expense .
Last year , the Swedish court of appeal found that prosecutor Ny had breached her duty because she had refused to take my statement for four and a half years .
â€œThe prosecutor waited another seven months before finally accepting my offer to take my statement in London .
Today , I learned that the Swedish legal application to Ecuador , which is likely to take weeks , was only sent to Ecuador two days ago .
â€œTo behave in such a way seems reckless and it is hard to imagine that it was more than a public relations exercise .
It is impossible to maintain confidence in this prosecutor under such circumstances.â€ �
The foreign ministry of Ecuador issued a statement on Wednesday saying it had received a request at its Stockholm embassy on Friday 12 June from the prosecutor for legal assistance in carrying out the interrogation , and that it was considering this request .
Per Samuelson , a lawyer for Assange in Stockholm who had been due to fly to London on Tuesday night , said that Ingrid Isgren , a deputy prosecutor charged with conducting the interrogation , was already in London .
A spokesperson for the prosecutor said he was unable to confirm or deny that Isgren was in London , or that Ny had sent an email to Assangeâ€ ™ s lawyers calling off the interrogation .
â€œWe havenâ€
™ t cancelled any meetings , we have not confirmed any dates
â€
¦
We have said we will do everything to get this interview done before the end of July ,
â€ � he said .
Ny has previously said that she changed her mind about going to London because the statute of limitations on several of the crimes of which Assange is suspected runs out in August 2015 .
â€œMy view has always been that to perform an interview with him at the Ecuadorian embassy in London would lower the quality of the interview , and that he would need to be present in Sweden in any case should there be a trial in the future .
This assessment remains unchanged , â€ �
Ny said in a statement earlier this year .
â€œNow that time is of the essence , I have viewed it therefore necessary to accept such deficiencies to the investigation and likewise take the risk that the interview does not move the case forward , particularly as there are no other measures on offer without Assange being present in Sweden.â€ � â€¢ This article was amended on 17 June 2015 to clarify quotes from Marianne Ny .
The earlier version included the Guardianâ€ ™ s own translation from her statement in Swedish .
These have been replaced with an English version of the statement issued by Nyâ€ ™ s office ."
2015-06-21,"Saudi Arabia has warned its citizens to ignore thousands of its diplomatic documents leaked by the transparency site WikiLeaks , which give a rare insight into the kingdomâ€ ™ s habit of buying influence and monitoring dissidents .
The 61,000 Saudi cables , the first tranche of 500,000 promised by Julian Assange , the WikiLeaks founder , also show the countryâ€ ™ s sharp focus on its strategic rival Iran and the revolution in Egypt , and support for allies and clients in Lebanon , Iraq , Yemen and elsewhere in the Middle East .
Nothing yet published matches embarrassing revelations about the Saudis in WikiLeaksâ€ ™ 2010 release of US diplomatic documents , which reported King Abdullah calling to â€œcut off the head of the [ Iranian ] snakeâ€ � as well as drink- and drug - fuelled partying by minor royals in Jeddah .
But routine secret correspondence from the foreign ministry in Riyadh and embassies abroad , some from as recently as April this year , catalogues many of the preoccupations of the conservative monarchy , the worldâ€ ™ s biggest oil exporter , especially during the turbulent period of the Arab spring from early 2011 .
According to one document , Gulf states were prepared to pay $ 10bn ( Â£6.3bn ) to secure the release of the deposed Egyptian president Hosni Mubarak , which appears to support a previous claim about this by a leading Muslim Brotherhood politician .
A 2012 cable reveals concern that Iran was receiving â€œflirting American messagesâ€ � that suggested the US did not oppose a peaceful Iranian nuclear programme so long as it had guarantees , including from Russia .
Others from that period show Saudi plans for an anti - Iran satellite TV channel to broadcast in Persian from Bahrain , and plans to disrupt Iranian channels .
The cables show Riyadh often seems worried about any advantage for Tehran : one document explains that if an Arab summit conference were held as scheduled in Baghdad in 2012 , it would mean â€œhanding Iraq to Iranâ€ � .
Cables also show efforts to back opponents of Nouri al - Maliki , the then Shia prime minister of Iraq , who was close to Iran .
Correspondence from the embassy in Beirut shows contacts with the Lebanese Forces leader , Samir Geagea , over cash payments to ease financial problems .
Geagea had publicly defended Saudi Arabia and opposed president Bashar al - Assad of Syria , and generally shown â€œreadiness to do whatever the kingdom asks of himâ€ � , the cables say .
Al - Akhbar , the Beirut newspaper that is publishing the documents with WikiLeaks , is a supporter of Assad and Iranâ€ ™ s
Lebanese militia ally Hezbollah .
The documents examined so far do not mention Saudi backing for anti - Assad rebels , most likely because these are handled by the countryâ€ ™ s intelligence service .
Correspondence from the Saudi embassy in London shows filming of protesters and a discussion of legal action against the Guardian over an article by Saad al - Faqih , an Islamist .
An appearance by Faqih on Egyptâ€ ™ s ON TV channel brought a proposal to â€œfind out how to co - opt itâ€ � .
But the billionaire owner of the station , Naguib Sawiris , did not want to be â€œopposed to the kingdomâ€ ™ s
policiesâ€ �
and he ordered that Faqih never be interviewed again .
â€œThe extent of Egyptâ€ ™ s ruling establishmentâ€ ™ s self - prostitution to Saudi money is both embarrassing and unsurprising , â€ � commented the writer Iyad al - Baghdadi , in one of many weekend social media reactions since the documents were released .
Alaâ€ ™ a Shehabi , a Bahraini dissident concerned by the Saudi intervention in her country , called the trove a â€œrare insight into the most opaque regime in the worldâ€ � .
Toby Matthiesen , a Cambridge University academic , said : â€œFor Saudi experts there is little surprising so far â€ ¦
but the details will hurt a lot of corrupt people.â€
�
The documents include several references to â€œhostileâ€ � media .
An undated note describes the influence of journalists sympathetic to the Muslim Brotherhood on the Qatar - owned channel al - Jazeera , which has often fallen foul of the Saudis .
The papers also show how in 2010 they purchased hundreds or thousands of subscriptions to publications in Damascus , Abu Dhabi , Beirut , Kuwait , Jordan and Mauritania in order to secure favourable coverage .
Influence and money are recurring themes .
Reports from Sanaâ€ ™ a state that the proceeds of the sale of 3 m barrels of oil given to Yemen in 2012 never reached the countryâ€ ™ s treasury .
Another document accuses Qatar of paying a Yemeni sheikh to foment rebellion in the army and to prevent the 2012 presidential election of Abd Rabbu Mansour Hadi .
The Sydney Morning Herald found documents with instructions from the Saudi government to its Canberra embassy relating to the payment of large subsidies to prominent Arabic newspapers and media organisations in Australia .
The Sunday Times reported that a document in the cache showed Saudi Arabia was prepared to pay the BBC correspondent Frank Gardner Â£1 m in compensation after he was shot in Riyadh by al - Qaida .
Gardner told the newspaper the compensation never materialised .
On Sunday the Saudi foreign ministry spokesman Osama Nugali warned citizens not to â€œallow enemies of the state to achieve their intentions in regards to exchanging or publishing any documents , â€ � many of which , he said , had been â€œfabricated in a very obvious mannerâ€ � .
WikiLeaks did not say where it obtained the documents , but it referred in a press release to Riyadhâ€ ™ s statement in May that it had suffered a breach of its computer networks
â€ “ an attack later claimed by a group calling itself the Yemen Cyber Army .
The Guardian has not been able to independently verify the authenticity of the documents .
Reuters and the Associated Press contributed to this report ."
2015-07-03,"The French government has rejected an asylum request from Julian Assange , saying he is â€œnot in immediate dangerâ€ � while holed up in the Ecuadorian embassy in west London .
The WikiLeaks founder wrote an open letter to FranÃ§ois Hollande urging the French government to grant him refugee status , even though such a move would offer him no realistic chance of freedom .
In a statement issued by the Ã‰lysÃ © e palace , the president said : â€œFrance can not act on his request .
The situation of Mr Assange does not present an immediate danger.â€ � Assange could make no practical use of asylum status in France because he would be arrested if he tried to leave the Ecuadorian embassy where he has been residing for more than three years to avoid extradition to Sweden .
Swedish prosecutors have been trying since 2010 to question Assange about allegations of rape and sexual molestation .
Assange denies the claims .
Prominent French figures , including footballer Eric Cantona , and bestselling economist Thomas Piketty , appealed for France to grant Assange haven .
But Hollande rejected the plea , pointing out that Assange remained subject to a European arrest warrant .
In his letter to the president , published in Le Monde newspaper , Assange described himself as a â€œjournalist pursued and threatened with death by the United States authorities as a result of my professional activitiesâ€ � .
Assange , who turned 44 on Friday , fears extradition to Sweden could lead to him being transferred to the US to face trial over WikiLeaksâ€ ™ publication of classified US military and diplomatic cables published in the Guardian .
Last month , the Swedish prosecutor Marianne Ny cancelled an appointment to interview Assange at the embassy .
She said the meeting would have to be called off because she had not received official permission from Ecuador to enter its London headquarters .
Lawyers for Assange claimed a victory in March after Ny caved in to pressure from the courts and agreed to break the deadlock in the case by interviewing him in London .
Nyâ€ ™ s formal request to interrogate the WikiLeaks founder in the Ecuadorian embassy was the first sign of movement in a case that has been frozen since August 2012 ."
2015-07-23,"Ecuador and Sweden are in a tense diplomatic standoff over arrangements for Swedish prosecutors to interview Julian Assange in Ecuadorâ€ ™ s embassy in London , weeks before the statute of limitations on most of the sexual assault allegations against him are due to expire under Swedish law .
More than three years after the WikiLeaks founder sought asylum inside Ecuadorâ€ ™ s small , west London embassy , Sweden said its prosecutors were now ready to travel to interview him there , and that Ecuador was blocking progress by insisting the two countries must agree terms before it will allow the Swedes access .
Quito insists it is a requirement of Ecuadorean law that the two countries draw up a formal agreement before prosecutors can enter â€ ” which it argues could be a quick and straightforward process â€ ” and says that despite its repeated appeals to break the deadlock , the Swedes have left it to the very last minute to act .
Assange , 44 , is wanted in Sweden over four alleged offences of unlawful coercion , sexual molestation and rape , which he denies , after two women reported him to Stockholm police in 2010 .
He has not been charged with any offence .
The Australian asked Ecuador for asylum in June 2012 after losing his appeals to the UK courts .
Assange argues that going to Sweden would leave him vulnerable to onward extradition to the US , which is known to be investigating WikiLeaks over its publishing activities .
Both Assange and Ecuador have repeatedly asked Swedish prosecutors to interview him in London , a request that Ecuador says was rebuffed until it received a formal request from the Swedes in June .
The statute of limitation on the three lesser offences for which Assange is sought expires on 20 August .
Prosecutors would have another five years to investigate the fourth alleged offence of rape , however , meaning Assangeâ€ ™ s immediate position would not necessarily change .
In an interview with the Guardian , Ecuadorâ€ ™ s foreign minister , Ricardo Patino , expressed exasperation at Swedenâ€ ™ s position , saying : â€œI do not find it acceptable that ...
[ having ] finally decided to answer the calls during all these years to continue the case , they would expect the role of Ecuador would be limited to opening the doors of its embassy.â€ � Patino said his country couldnâ€ ™ t simply allow the Swedes access without prior discussion because of Assangeâ€ ™ s â€œextraordinaryâ€ � position as someone who has been granted asylum ; Ecuador would want to insist , for instance , on the presence of diplomatic staff in the interview , he said .
But despite Ecuador offering to meet â€œwith the stated and sincere objective of reaching a mutual understandingâ€ � , said Patino , â€œthere is a refusal to discuss on [ Swedenâ€ ™ s ] part .
This certainly hinders any progress .
Honestly , I do not know why .
Only Swedish prosecutors can give an answer.â€ � Swedenâ€ ™ s foreign ministry declined to comment .
But in a series of tense diplomatic exchanges seen by the Guardian , Stockholm is equally insistent that Ecuador is in fact the roadblock to progress , and that an agreement between the two countries before the interview , beyond the protocols established in international law , is unnecessary .
Should Ecuador continue to insist on it , Sweden argues , it will interpret the response as a refusal to grant access to Assange .
Prosecutor Marianne Ny , who is leading the investigation in Sweden , has insisted since 2010 that Assange would have to come to Sweden to be interviewed .
But she has come under increasing pressure in Sweden to break the deadlock , with Swedenâ€ ™ s supreme court writing to the countryâ€ ™ s prosecutor general in early March , pointedly asking his view on the investigation .
On 13 March Ny announced she would ask Ecuador for permission to conduct the interview in London .
Ecuador , however , says it received the first request for access , via its Stockholm embassy , on 12 June .
Five days later , Assange said the Swedes abruptly cancelled an interview in London that had been arranged for that day ; â€œSome formal approval has not come [ from Ecuador],â€ � explained Ny .
â€œThe prosecutorâ€ ™ s
view remains : the aim is to question Mr Assange at the Ecuadorian embassy in London as soon as possible , â€ � a Swedish spokesman said on Thursday .
Niklas WÃ¥gnert , the Stockholm appeal court judge who heard Assangeâ€ ™ s case in November , told the Guardian the continuing failure to interview the Australian in London might amount to â€œnew circumstancesâ€ � in the case , which would enable Assange to launch another appeal through the Swedish courts .
If Assange found himself facing only one outstanding charge , he added , it could be a factor for judges to weigh if the case came back to court .
â€œTime has gone by and nothing has happened â€ “ it would be up to the the courts to decide if [ a diplomatic dispute between Sweden and Ecuador ] would be a good enough explanation for the prosecutor not making progress in the case , â€ � he said ."
2015-08-11,"Sweden has offered to negotiate an agreement with Ecuador to enable Swedish prosecutors to interview Julian Assange in the Ecuadorian embassy in London , potentially ending the standoff between the two countries but almost certainly too late to prevent some allegations against the WikiLeaks founder from expiring .
Swedenâ€ ™ s government had agreed to open direct talks with Ecuador to explore the possibility of â€œa general agreementâ€ � on legal assistance in criminal matters , the Swedish justice ministry said .
â€œThe coming discussions will show if this is a way forward , â€ � said Cecilia Riddselius , the senior justice ministry official responsible for the case .
The move marks an apparent concession by Sweden after sharp official exchanges between the two countries in which each accused the other of blocking progress .
On Friday , Riddselius said demands by Ecuador were â€œin complete violation of our principles of justiceâ€ � .
Meanwhile , the British government has grown increasingly irked by the stalemate , which has cost the Metropolitan police more than Â£10 m in policing the embassy in Kensington .
â€œWe are frustrated that the interview has not yet taken place , â€ � the Foreign Office minister Hugo Swire said .
â€œThis remains a deeply unsatisfactory and costly situation.â€
� Swedenâ€ ™ s
justice ministry said it welcomed Ecuadorâ€ ™ s acceptance of its offer of negotiations , but the Guardian understands the ministry rejected a proposal by Quito to meet this week because officials were on holiday , and because it would take more than a few days to prepare the negotiations .
Assange is wanted for questioning over allegations of sex crimes in Stockholm in August 2010 , but has resisted extradition to Sweden citing fears that he could be transferred to the US to face espionage charges .
He has repeatedly requested that he be questioned in London .
He has not been charged with any offence .
Swedenâ€ ™ s prosecutor has faced pressure to interview Assange in London to make progress in the case , which has been deadlocked since Assange sought political asylum in the Ecuadorian embassy in June 2012 .
In March she dropped her objections , citing the impending expiry of the statute of limitations on most of the allegations as a reason for renewed urgency .
In April , Assange consented to the prosecutorâ€ ™ s conditions for an interview .
But as this monthâ€ ™ s deadline under the statute of limitations drew closer , progress towards a London interview was slow .
Sweden formally requested permission from Ecuador to enter the embassy only two months later , and an agreed date of 17 June to begin the questioning had to be cancelled at the last minute amid mutual accusations of blame for the delay .
The statute of limitations on allegations of unlawful coercion and one count of sexual molestation , made against Assange by two Swedish women , expires on Thursday , and on one count of sexual molestation next Tuesday .
Sweden made the offer last Thursday to negotiate with Ecuador , and Ecuador accepted it on Monday , Riddselius said .
â€œI do not know when the discussions will begin .
Undertaking a general agreement takes time and is normally a longer procedure.â€
�
Ecuador had insisted on negotiating a specific agreement with Sweden over the conditions for questioning Assange in the embassy , which would be contrary to the Swedish constitution , Riddselius said last week .
She said Quito had also demanded that Sweden confer upon Assange the same status of political refugee bestowed on him by Ecuador , which had created a fresh obstacle to agreement .
This appeared to prompt a statement by the Ecuadorian embassy on Monday : â€œAt no point has the Republic of Ecuador asked the Kingdom of Sweden to grant Mr Assange asylumâ€ � .
Riddselius said on Tuesday that Sweden had not altered its understanding of Ecuadorâ€ ™ s requests .
Ecuador had noted a â€œpositive change on the Swedish sideâ€ � during the last few weeks , according to a senior official at the countryâ€ ™ s foreign ministry .
Quito had therefore been surprised and disappointed by the rebuff it received from Sweden last week , according to people familiar with the situation .
â€œAfter the initial official correspondence from Sweden seemed to discard any possibility of maintaining an official dialogue on the matter , Swedenâ€ ™ s current inclination towards negotiating an agreement is perceived with optimism from our side , along with the hope that we can find a well overdue resolution to the Assange case , â€ � the foreign ministry official said .
â€œItâ€ ™ s unfortunate that those authorities havenâ€ ™ t responded favorably to our requests to meet during the nearly three years of Julian
Assangeâ€ ™ s
asylumâ€ � .
An outstanding allegation against Assange of â€œrape , less serious crimeâ€ � remains current under Swedish law until August 2020 ."
2015-08-13,"Julian Assange has criticised what he described as the incompetence of Swedenâ€ ™ s prosecutor after she dropped her investigation into some of the allegations of sexual assault against him due to the expiration of a five - year time limit for bringing charges .
Prosecutors will continue to pursue an interview with the WikiLeaks founder over an outstanding rape allegation .
â€œI am extremely disappointed .
There was no need for any of this , â€ � Assange said in a statement .
â€œI am an innocent man .
I havenâ€ ™ t even been charged .
From the beginning I offered simple solutions .
Come to the [ Ecuadorian ] embassy to take my statement or promise not to send me to the United States .
This Swedish official refused both.â€ �
The Swedish prosecutor , Marianne Ny , said she regretted leaving the investigation unfinished , but said she was forced to do so because Assange had refused to leave Ecuadorâ€ ™ s
London embassy , where he has taken refuge .
Two women made allegations against Assange five years ago in Stockholm , but no charges were brought because the prosecutor was unable to interrogate him after he challenged an extradition order and sought political asylum in the embassy in June 2012 .
Assange , who denies the allegations , believes that travelling to Sweden would leave him vulnerable to extradition to the US to face espionage charges .
His repeated requests to the Swedish government for a firm guarantee of his safety have been declined .
For more than four years Ny refused to go to London to interview Assange , but changed her mind in March after a Swedish court questioned her failure to make progress in the investigation .
Ny cited the impending expiry of the statute of limitations as a reason for the turnabout .
But it was June before the Swedish government made an official request to Ecuador to enter the embassy , and an agreed date to begin interrogation a week later had to be scrapped .
After a tense standoff in which each side blamed the other for delays , this week they agreed to formal talks over judicial cooperation , potentially breaking the deadlock â€ “ but not in time to prevent the time limit on most of the accusations running out .
â€œIt is still my hope to be able to conduct a hearing [ on the rape allegation ] since there is an ongoing dialogue on the issue between Sweden and Ecuador
, â€ �
Ny said in a statement .
Assange said : â€œShe has managed to avoid hearing my side of the story entirely .
This is beyond incompetence .
I am strong but the cost to my family is unacceptable.â€ �
Britain said on Thursday it would make a formal protest to the Ecuadorian government over its decision to provide asylum to Assange .
â€œEcuador must recognise that its decision to harbour Mr Assange more than three years ago has prevented the proper course of justice , â€ �
the Foreign Office minister Hugo Swire said in a statement .
The statute of limitations for an allegation of unlawful coercion and one case of sexual molestation expired on Thursday ; another allegation of sexual molestation expires on Tuesday .
The outstanding allegation of rape expires on 17 August 2020 .
Claes BorgstrÃ¶m , a Stockholm lawyer who represents one of the women whose allegations against Assange will now never be tested in court , said the woman was ambivalent about the situation .
â€œOn the one hand , she wanted Assange to face trial and answer for what he has done .
On the other , she wants to put this behind her.â€ � Helena Kennedy QC , a member of Assangeâ€ ™ s legal team , said he had spent more time in the embassy than he could ever spend in a Swedish prison , and the remaining allegation against him was â€œjust as unlikely to lead to convictionâ€ � .
â€œThe question remains whether we are dealing with incompetence or bad faith or an agenda set by other considerations .
I remain unconvinced that this prosecution has been about securing justice for women.â€ �"

The outstanding allegation of rape expires on 17 August 2020 .
In a statement on Wednesday , Assangeâ€ ™ s supporters said : â€œBy failing to take Assangeâ€ ™ s statement at the embassy , Swedish authorities have deprived him of the right to answer false allegations against him that have been widely circulated in the media , but for which he has not been charged .
If the case expires , that deprivation will become permanent , and no formal resolution will be available .

2015-08-25,"Oscar - winning director Laura Poitras is to focus on controversial WikiLeaks co - founder Julian Assange for a new series , set to preview at this yearâ€ ™ s New York film festival .
The Citizenfour film - maker will showcase Field of Vision : New Episodic Nonfiction , which will be a collection of her short works and will include a preview of her new TV series Asylum .
The series will focus on Assange as he publishes classified documents and seeks asylum at the Ecuadorian embassy in London .
Poitras started filming him in 2012 , before she made Citizenfour .
It was reportedly an early out - take of the footage , which was posted to the New York Times site , that caused Edward Snowden to contact her .
In July , Poitras claimed she had been the victim of â€œKafkaesque harrassmentâ€ � while making the series .
The 51-year - old director announced she was suing the US government for unreasonable border searches , some of which lasted for hours .
The programme is one of many announcements for this yearâ€ ™ s New York film festival , which also includes a documentary about Nora Ephron called Everything Is Copy , directed by her son .
Films previously confirmed for the festival include Steven Spielbergâ€ ™ s thriller Bridge of Spies and Danny Boyleâ€ ™ s Steve Jobs biopic .
This December will also see the release of Oliver Stoneâ€ ™ s Snowden , which casts Oscar - winner Melissa Leo in the role of Poitras .
The film also stars Joseph Gordon - Levitt , Nicolas Cage and Shailene Woodley .
The New York film festival runs from 25 September to 11 October"
2015-08-28,"Sweden will begin talks with Ecuador about Julian Assange on Monday , after Stockholm moved to break the deadlock over five - year - old rape allegations against him .
Sweden initially rejected a demand by Ecuador that the two countries establish a formal agreement on judicial cooperation before Swedish prosecutors could interrogate the WikiLeaks founder in Ecuadorâ€ ™ s embassy in London , saying it did not negotiate bilateral treaties .
But this month the government agreed to talks specifically to address the stalemate over Assange , who claimed asylum in the embassy in 2012 .
Two women made allegations against Assange five years ago in Stockholm , but no charges were brought because the prosecutor said she was unable to interrogate him .
Assange says he had no choice but to seek asylum as Sweden declined to guarantee that he would not be extradited to the US to face espionage charges if he travelled to Stockholm .
The political intervention by Sweden marks a new development in the case .
Swedish politicians have , with very few exceptions , insisted they must not interfere , saying it is a purely judicial matter .
â€œWe have agreed to what the Ecuadorians asked for , â€ � said Cecilia Riddselius , the Swedish justice ministry official responsible for the case .
â€œIt was a political decision to have this discussion .
â€œNormally ministers can not interfere in individual cases , it is part of our legal system , this is a strict rule .
At the same time , it is under the competence of the government to enter into agreements with other states .
A decision was taken to actually raise it to the level of the cabinet.â€ � Riddselius said the state secretary , Ann Linde , would open the negotiations on Monday on behalf of the justice ministry .
The justice ministryâ€ ™ s director general for international affairs , Anna - Karin Svensson , the foreign ministryâ€ ™ s director general for legal affairs , Anders RÃ¶nquist , and Riddselius herself would also be involved .
She said Ecuadorâ€ ™ s under - secretary of state FÃ © rnando Yepez Lasso would lead the talks for Ecuador .
Ecuadorâ€ ™ s embassy in Stockholm declined to comment , but said the makeup of its delegation was still being discussed .
â€œWe do not normally enter into bilateral agreements and encourage states to enter multilateral ones instead , â€ � Riddselius said .
â€œBut considering this specific case and our willingness to move the case forward , we are open to discuss this .
It will be a general agreement but we hope it will be applicable to the Assange case.â€ � Sexual assault accusations against Assange , who has not been formally charged with any crime , expired this month under Swedenâ€ ™ s statute of limitations .
In March Swedish prosecutors had pledged to interrogate Assange in London while the allegations were still current .
Assange condemned the â€œincompetenceâ€ � of Swedish authorities in failing to meet this deadline after he consistently demanded that prosecutors interview him in London so he could protest his innocence .
The outstanding rape allegation can be prosecuted until August 2020 .
The UK accuses Ecuador of preventing the proper course of justice by granting Assange asylum in London and is frustrated at the mounting costs of policing the embassy .
As recently as July , Sweden turned down a request from the UN to consider a guarantee that political refugees wanted for questioning would not face extradition to a third country .
Riddselius said that in her 20 years at the justice ministry she had never encountered a bilateral agreement of the kind that would be negotiated on Monday .
â€œIt is new ground , very unusual , it is something we try to avoid , â€ �
she said .
The negotiations would be complex , she said , and it was impossible to say how long they might take .
She said Sweden had drafted an agreement and respected Ecuadorâ€ ™ s need to examine it thoroughly and propose changes .
This article was amended on 30 August 2015 to correct the name of Swedish state secretary Ann Linde ."
2015-08-29,"Julian Assange has said he advised the NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden against seeking asylum in Latin America because he could have been kidnapped and possibly killed there .
The WikiLeaks editor - in - chief said he told Snowden to ignore concerns about the â€œnegative PR consequencesâ€ � of sheltering in Russia because it was one of the few places in the world where the CIAâ€ ™ s influence did not reach .
In a wide - ranging interview with the Times , Assange also said he feared he would be assassinated if he was ever able to leave the Ecuadorian embassy in London , where he sought asylum in 2012 to avoid extradition .
He accused US officials of breaking the law in their pursuit of him and his whistleblowing organisation , and in subjecting his connections to a campaign of harassment .
WikiLeaks was intimately involved in the operation to help Snowden evade the US authorities in 2013 after he leaked his cache of intelligence documents to Glenn Greenwald , then a journalist with the Guardian .
Assange sent one of his most senior staff members , Sarah Harrison , to be at Snowdenâ€ ™ s side in Hong Kong , and helped to engineer his escape to Russia â€ “ despite his discomfort with the idea of fleeing to one of the USâ€ ™ s most powerful enemies .
â€œSnowden was well aware of the spin that would be put on it if he took asylum in Russia , â€ � Assange told the Times .
â€œHe preferred Latin America , but my advice was that he should take asylum in Russia despite the negative PR consequences , because my assessment is that he had a significant risk he could be kidnapped from Latin America on CIA orders .
Kidnapped or possibly killed.â€ �
However , Assangeâ€ ™ s story appears to be at odds with reports from the time , which detail a plan hatched to whisk Snowden from Russia , where he was stuck in the transit area of Moscowâ€ ™ s Sheremetyevo airport after his US passport was revoked , and into political asylum in Ecuador .
In a statement issued as the drama unfolded , WikiLeaks said of Snowden : â€œHe is bound for the republic of Ecuador via a safe route for the purposes of asylum , and is being escorted by diplomats and legal advisers from WikiLeaks.â€ �
But the plan unravelled after Ecuadorâ€ ™ s president , Rafael Correa , declared invalid a temporary travel document issued by his London consul â€ “ in collaboration with Assange â€ “ after other Ecuadorean diplomats said in leaked correspondence that the Wikileaks founder could be perceived as â€œrunning the showâ€ � .
Correa went on to criticise the consul , Fidel Narvaez , telling the Associated Press that to have issued the document â€ “ which was thought to have been used by Snowden to travel from Hong Kong to Moscow â€ “ without consulting Quito was a serious error .
In his Times interview , Assange also outlined his own fears of being targeted .
He said that even venturing out on to the balcony of Ecuadorâ€ ™ s embassy in Knightsbridge posed security risks in the light of bomb and assassination threats by what he called â€œunstable peopleâ€ � .
He said he thought it was unlikely he would be shot , but that he worried that if he was freed he could be kidnapped by the CIA .
â€œIâ€ ™ m
a white guy , â€ � Assange said .
â€œUnless
I convert to Islam itâ€ ™
s not that likely that Iâ€ ™ ll be droned , but we have seen things creeping towards that.â€ � Ecuador granted the Australian political asylum in 2012 under the 1951 refugee convention .
He believed he risked extradition to the US from the UK and Sweden , where he is under investigation for his involvement with WikiLeaks .
He also faces extradition to Sweden for an investigation into an alleged rape .
He has remained in the embassy for nearly three years , with a round - the - clock police guard thought to have cost more than Â£11 m .
Assange believes his situation will be resolved in the next two years ."
2015-09-01,"Ecuadorian officials reportedly considered smuggling Julian Assange out of their embassy in London by disguising him in fancy dress , in one of a number of potential plots to evade police stationed outside .
It was also suggested the WikiLeaks editor - in - chief , who has been holed up in the embassy since 2012 , could hop across the Kensington rooftops to a helipad , or become lost in the crowds in Harrods , according to documents seen by Ecuadorian news site Focus Ecuador and Buzzfeed UK .
Another option for getting Assange out was to appoint him Ecuadorâ€ ™ s representative to the UN and hustle him out in an official car under the protection of diplomatic immunity .
A WikiLeaks representative declined to comment on the articles , while representatives for Assange and the Ecuadorian government have been approached for comment and the Guardian awaits a response .
Ecuador granted political asylum in 2012 to Assange , an Australian national , who faces extradition to Sweden over an investigation into allegations of rape and sexual assault .
He has chosen to remain in the embassy since then .
According to Focus Ecuador , the Ecuadorian intelligence services , known as Senain , spied on Assange in the embassy and compiled a report based on updates from internal staff .
As well as the various escape plots , the documents detail alleged clashes between Assange and embassy security staff and concerns raised about his mental health .
In September 2012 , three months after Assange first took up residency , it is said that a guard discovered him in the embassyâ€ ™ s off - limits secure control room , leading to a scuffle between the two men .
The guard and Assange both gave conflicting accounts of what happened .
In January 2013 , the security guard reported hearing a loud crash from Assangeâ€ ™ s room and later discovered a large , smashed bookshelf .
Images of the roomâ€ ™ s condition are included within the report .
The documents also note incidents when Assange would â€œshout and talk incoherentlyâ€ � at night and attributes this to stress .
The documents acknowledge Assangeâ€ ™ s situation and the â€œemotional imbalanceâ€ � it may cause but says officials can not allow attacks against personnel or equipment to occur .
â€œCounselling may be recommended , â€ � the report adds .
Ecuadorian officials acknowledged the heavy Met police presence at the embassy when considering smuggling Assange out in a diplomatic car .
It notes officers in the hall , on the stairs and at the exits of the lifts .
Sweden started talks with Ecuador this week to address the stalemate over Assange .
Two women made allegations against Assange five years ago in Stockholm , but no charges were brought because the prosecutor said she was unable to interrogate him .
Assange says he had no choice but to seek asylum as Sweden declined to guarantee that he would not be extradited to the US to face espionage charges related to WikiLeaks if he travelled to Stockholm ."
2015-09-17,"Ai Weiwei and Julian Assange have made what seem to be gestures of contempt for their critics in a selfie posted to an Instagram account .
The picture , which was uploaded to Aiâ€ ™ s Instagram account on Wednesday and is understood to have been taken inside the Ecuadorian embassy in west London , shows both men grinning impishly at the camera , left hands raised with their middle fingers extended .
Assange , head of the WikiLeaks whistleblowing website , has had refuge at the embassy since 2012 , because of the threat of being extradited to Sweden where he faces an arrest warrant relating to allegations of rape and sexual assault .
Assange also fears the possibility of onward extradition to the US , where authorities are believed to be building an espionage case against him for publishing secrets about the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan , and for obtaining US diplomatic cables , which embroiled the country in huge international scandals .
He could not be reached for comment on Thursday .
And a spokesperson for WikiLeaks could not say what he and Ai spoke about at the embassy .
The artist and dissident Ai was detained without charge in China for 81 days in 2011 , during a crackdown there on political activists .
The government also confiscated his passport , returning it in July , after which he travelled to German , and Britain , despite UK border authorities initially refusing him a visa .
The supposedly most egregious crime of Ai , a persistent critic of Chinaâ€ ™ s regime , was to have created an artwork composed of 9,000 childrenâ€ ™ s backpacks , as a commentary on the multiple school building collapses during the 2008 Sichuan earthquake , which killed thousands of pupils .
Ai also published the names of 5,000 of the dead schoolchildren , prompting authorities to shut down his blog , demolish his studio , investigate him on charges of pornography , bigamy , tax avoidance and foreign currency irregularities , and beat him until he suffered brain injury .
At the Royal Academy , in London , Ai currently has a retrospective , opening to the public on Saturday , featuring artworks dating to 1993 , the year he returned to Beijing after living in the US for 12 years ."

2015-09-30,"Laura Poitras doesnâ€ ™ t like to rest on her laurels .
Less than a year after winning a Pulitzer prize for reporting on Edward Snowdenâ€ ™ s NSA revelations and netting an Oscar for the ensuing documentary Citizenfour , sheâ€ ™ s back in the spotlight with Asylum : a new short - form episodic series .
In it she shadows Julian Assange as he publishes classified diplomatic cables and seeks asylum in Ecuadorâ€ ™ s London embassy .
Three episodes of her series , which serve as a prequel of sorts to Citizenfour , premiered on Sunday at the New York film festival .
The shorts â€ “ scored by Radiohead and Nine Inch Nails â€ “ were completed under the banner of Poitrasâ€ ™ s new visual journalism unit , Field of Vision , which she recently launched with fellow film - maker AJ Schnack and producer / writer Charlotte Cook , in collaboration with The Intercept , the adversarial journalism website she co - founded in 2014 with Jeremy Scahill and Glenn Greenwald .
Both are funded by billionaire Pierre Omidyarâ€ ™ s
First Look Media .
Field of Vision aims to commission 40 to 50 original episodic and individual short - form nonfiction films each year .
At Sundayâ€ ™ s premiere , Field of Vision not only screened the Asylum episodes , but also unveiled five additional commissioned shorts , some of which are now available to stream online .
Standouts were
Kirsten Johnsonâ€ ™ s
The Above , which ominously contrasts surveillance blimps in Afghanistan and the US , and Heloisa Passosâ€ ™
s moving Birdie , about a homeless fruit vendor and his two dogs trying to get by on the bustling streets of Rio ( Poitras says Birdie will get follow - up installments ) .
Dressed all in black and seated in the sleek offices of The Intercept in Manhattan the morning after the premiere , Poitras speaks excitedly of how Field of Vision came about : â€œI wanted to be able to hire a team of people who would be commissioning videos
â€ “ visual journalism â€ “ to see the range of peopleâ€ ™ s skills and talents within the non - fiction community.â€
�
It was while working on the final edit of Citizenfour that she enlisted Schnack and Cook to help her with the venture .
Together , the three assigned stories from around the globe that they felt merited a platform , to directors of their choosing .
The results make up what they dub â€œthe first seasonâ€ � .
A second batch of shorts is set to debut in early 2016 .
Poitras stresses that Field of Vision is first and foremost â€œfilm - maker drivenâ€ � .
She and her co - creators stay true to that mission by entrusting their commissioned film - makers with telling the story the best way they see fit .
Directors retain copyright ; and should they choose to extend the short into a feature , they can do so without interference .
Contributors are paid out of the budgets Poitras and co allocate for each individual project .
And while the shorts that have premiered so far are all commissioned works , theyâ€ ™ re open to receiving pitches from film - makers unfamiliar to them .
The existence of Field of Vision was only made public earlier this month , shortly before the NYFF event was announced .
Schnack says they kept the news under lock and key to avoid building hype â€ “ and potentially failing to deliver on it : â€œWe wanted to be more just like , â€˜OK here we go , and in just a few weeks youâ€ ™ ll start to see the work.â€ ™ â€ �
He neednâ€ ™ t have worried .
Field of Vision is a bracing initiative that takes the documentary form into new and exciting directions .
The five shorts that screened on Sunday were all unequivocally strong , as were the first few episodes of Asylum .
Field of Visionâ€ ™ s impact has yet to be assessed , but itâ€ ™ s hard not to feel that Poitras , Schnack and Cook are on to something huge .
â€œI
think creatively it opens up possibilities that maybe werenâ€ ™ t there before , â€ � says Poitras .
â€œWeâ€ ™ d rather take risks and learn from them if things donâ€
™ t work , than not take risks .
Thereâ€ ™ s no reason to not take risks.â€ �
Cook adds : â€œFeature films are a huge commitment .
We really hope film - makers use this [ new format ] to play around with the art form and try different things , things they might not normally do.â€ �
Despite their excitement over the possibilities of visual journalism , Poitras , Schnack and Cook shot down the notion that short - form film is the way of the future .
â€œThe future is a more fluid landscape , â€ � says Cook .
â€œWe now live in a world with so many different opportunities and different ways of consuming film - making .
Weâ€
™ re just glad to be a part of trying new things in that way.â€ �
Poitras insists that she still loves long - form storytelling , and that sheâ€ ™ s in no way trying to change that with Field of Vision .
In fact , sheâ€ ™ s working out how Asylum might work as a feature .
The director is still in the process of shadowing Assange , who remains under house arrest at Ecuadorâ€ ™ s London embassy .
â€œTo begin with something from the past and bring it to present day has really been interesting , in terms of narrative , â€ �
Poitras says of Asylum .
â€œItâ€ ™ s not necessarily what I had planned when I began filming with him.â€ �
For upcoming projects , Poitras says sheâ€ ™ s intent on including the talents of high - profile narrative voices .
She confirms that House of Cards show - runner Beau Willimon has agreed to direct something (
â€œHeâ€ ™ s a huge documentary fanâ€ � ) , and that sheâ€ ™ s had discussions with the Bourne Ultimatum director Paul Greengrass , about contributing .
She also has her sights set on Jean - Pierre and Luc Dardenne , the brothers behind the Palme dâ€ ™ Or winning dramas Lâ€ ™ Enfant and Rosetta .
â€œThereâ€ ™ s a kind of urgency in the way they tell stories â€ “ itâ€ ™ s very influenced by non - fiction storytelling , â€ � she says of the pair .
On top of launching Field of Vision and completing Asylum , Poitras is in the midst of preparing for an exhibition at New Yorkâ€ ™ s Whitney Museum of Art , set to open early next year .
This marks her second collaboration with the Whitney : her films about politics post-9/11 featured in the 2012 Whitney Biennial .
For the showcase , sheâ€ ™ s creating an installation of immersive environments that build upon the themes she explored in her trilogy of films ( My Country , My Country , The Oath and Citizenfour ) , about NSA surveillance and post-9/11 America .
Says Poitras : â€œIâ€ ™ m not going to have a lot of downtime between then and now , but itâ€ ™ s super exciting.â€ �

2015-10-12,"Scotland Yard has called off its multimillion pound 24-hour surveillance of the Ecuadorian embassy where Julian Assange has been living for 40 months , having decided the operation is â€œno longer proportionateâ€ � .
The WikiLeaks founder , an Australian national , sought political asylum at the embassy in June 2012 to avoid extradition to Sweden , where prosecutors want to question him over rape allegations .
In August they dropped their investigation into two other claims â€ “ one of sexual molestation and one of unlawful coercion â€ “ because they ran out of time to question him .
Metropolitan police officers have maintained a constant watch of the embassy in Knightsbridge , central London , at a cost of at least Â£11.1 m , according to figures released by Scotland Yard in June .
A statement from the Metropolitan Police Service ( MPS ) on Monday said the operation to arrest Assange continued
but it was â€œno longer proportionate to commit officers to a permanent presenceâ€ � .
â€œThe MPS will not discuss what form its continuing operation will take or the resourcing implications surrounding it ,
â€ � it continued .
â€œWhilst no tactics guarantee success in the event of Julian Assange leaving the embassy , the MPS will deploy a number of overt and covert tactics to arrest him.â€
� Kristinn Hrafnsson , a spokesman for WikiLeaks , said he did not know why the police had abandoned its 24-hour presence .
â€œMy interpretation is that it has not been lifted .
They are calling off the uniformed presence but escalating the covert operation and will arrest him if he steps out off the embassy.â€ � A reduced police presence â€œdoes not fundamentally change the situationâ€ � .
Hrafnsson speculated that the move might be a way of moving the costs of the uniformed presence , which infuriated the public , to the covert operation .
He added that the move comes ahead of an expected ruling by the UN working group on arbitrary detention , which he expected to find in favour of Assange .
In its statement , Scotland Yard said there was no â€œimminent prospect of a diplomatic or legal resolution to this
issueâ€ � .
â€œLike
all public services , MPS resources are finite ,
â€ � the statement said .
â€œWith so many different criminal , and other , threats to the city it protects , the current deployment of officers is no longer believed proportionate.â€ �
WikiLeaks earlier reacted to the announcement by tweeting : Two women made allegations against Assange five years ago in Stockholm , but no charges were brought because the prosecutor said she was unable to interrogate him .
A European arrest warrant was issued in December 2010 and he is now subject to arrest under the Bail Act for failing to surrender to custody on 29 June 2012 for removal to Sweden .
Assange believes he had no choice but to seek asylum as Sweden declined to guarantee that he would not be extradited to the US to face espionage charges related to WikiLeaks if he travelled to Stockholm .
Ecuadorian officials reportedly considered smuggling Assange out of the embassy by disguising him in fancy dress , allowing him to hop across the Kensington rooftops to a helipad , or become lost in the crowds in Harrods , according to documents seen by the Ecuadorian news website Focus Ecuador and BuzzFeed UK .
Another possibility for getting Assange out was purportedly to appoint him Ecuadorâ€ ™ s representative to the UN and hustle him out in an official car under the protection of diplomatic immunity ."

2015-10-15,"Ecuador has requested that WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange be allowed â€œsafe passageâ€ � out of the countryâ€ ™ s London embassy to a hospital for a medical examination .
Ecuadorâ€ ™ s foreign ministry said on Wednesday it had made the request so that Assange , who has been living for 40 months inside its London embassy , could undergo an MRI scan to investigate pain in his shoulder .
At present , he faces arrest if he leaves the embassy .
â€œWe did ask the British government for a safe passage for humanitarian reasons in coordination with Ecuador , so that Julian Assange can get an MRI , â€ � the foreign minister , Ricardo PatiÃ±o , told a briefing in Quito .
â€œThe reply we have had from Britain is that he can leave whenever he likes for any medical care he might need but the European arrest warrant for Assange is still valid .
In other words , he can leave â€ “ and we will put him in jail , â€ � PatiÃ±o added .
The WikiLeaks founder , an Australian national , sought political asylum at the embassy in June 2012 to avoid extradition to Sweden , where prosecutors want to question him over rape allegations .
In August they dropped their investigation into two other claims â€ “ one of sexual molestation and one of unlawful coercion â€ “ because they ran out of time to question him .
The development comes after Scotland Yard called off its multimillion - pound 24-hour surveillance of the embassy earlier this week , having decided the operation was â€œno longer proportionateâ€ � .
The Foreign Office said in a statement on Wednesday night : â€œThe Ecuadorian government have informed us that Mr Assange requires a medical assessment .
â€œThere is no question that the British authorities would in any way seek to impede Mr Assange receiving medical advice or care .
We have made this clear to the govt of Ecuador.â€ �
Asked if Assange would be arrested if he left the embassy to visit a hospital a Foreign Office spokesperson said that it was a matter for the police .
Speaking earlier on Wednesday on Ecuadorian TV , PatiÃ±o said Britain should grant Assange safe passage so he could leave the embassy .
He added that the British authorities should make this gesture so Assange â€œcan benefit from the right of asylum that we have granted him , as should be done in a respectful international relationshipâ€ � .
The WikiLeaks Twitter account linked to a statement saying that the source of the shoulder pain being experienced by Assange could only be diagnosed with hospital equipment that could not be brought into the embassy due to size and weight .
It added that Ecuador wrote to the Foreign Office on 30 September 2015 to request that Assange be permitted to go to the hospital under conditions agreed upon by the UK and Ecuador .
The allowance would be for a few hours to allow Assange to be able to have medical tests and to diagnose the cause .
It said that the Foreign Office had replied on 12 October that it would not permit the â€œsafe passageâ€ � to the hospital for purposes of medical tests ."
2015-10-15,"The Metropolitan police have confirmed that their officers would arrest the WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange if he left the Ecuadorian embassy in London to go to hospital for a medical examination .
Ecuadorâ€ ™ s foreign minister , Ricardo PatiÃ±o , said Assange , who has been living in the embassy for more than three years , should be given safe passage to hospital for an MRI scan to help diagnose a pain in his shoulder .
The Foreign Office said Assange , who is subject to a European arrest warrant over an allegation of rape in Sweden , will not be prevented by the British authorities from receiving medical treatment .
But it said questions over his arrest were a matter for the Met , which this week scaled back its costly 24-hour surveillance of the embassy .
Scotland Yard confirmed that Assange would face arrest if he stepped outside the embassy , even if a mobile MRI scanner were parked outside the building in Knightsbridge , central London .
Assange , an Australian national , sought political asylum at the embassy in June 2012 to avoid extradition to Sweden .
His American lawyer , Carey Shenkman , accused Britain of forcing Assange to â€œchoose between the human right to asylum and the human right to medical treatmentâ€ � .
At a press conference in Wednesday in the Ecuadorean capital , Quito , PatiÃ±o read from a letter by Assangeâ€ ™ s doctor .
The Justice for Assange Campaign released an edited version of the letter , dated 14 August .
It quoted Dr Wood as saying : â€œHe has been suffering with a constant pain to the right shoulder region for the past three months [ since June 2015 ] .
There is no history of acute injury to the area .
[ ... ] I examined him and all movements of his shoulder ( abduction , internal rotation and external rotation ) are limited due to pain .
I am unable to elicit the exact cause of his symptoms without the benefit of further diagnostic tests , [ including ]
MRI.â€ �
The full text of the letter has not been released .
A source at the Foreign Office confirmed that the Ecuadorian ambassador to Britain raised Assangeâ€ ™ s medical concerns at a meeting with British officials last month .
But it is understood that the Foreign Office has not received a copy of the doctorâ€ ™ s note .
Medical experts said Assange would have to leave the embassy to get an MRI scan , but a mobile scanner could be driven to the street outside the embassy .
Prof Stephen Keevil , a former president of the Institute of Physics and Engineering in Medicine ( IPEM ) and head of magnetic resonance physics at Guyâ€ ™ s and St Thomasâ€ ™ NHS foundation trust , said : â€œAn MRI scanner is a big piece of kit .
It is not something you could carry into the building itself.â€ �
But he added : â€œThere are portable MRI scanners in the back of trucks and there are companies who provide mobile MRI services .
I donâ€
™ t know what the surroundings of the embassy are like , but if thereâ€ ™ s a delivery entrance it would be perfectly possible to drive a truck with an MRI scanner in it and he [ Assange ] could walk in .
Hospitals hire them on a daily basis .
â€œThey probably cost in the order of thousands of pounds per day to hire , but not tens of thousands .
I appreciate that if he had to come out of the embassy on to public ground to get there then that would be a problem.â€ �
Asked whether Assange would be allowed to leave the embassy to enter a mobile MRI scanner , a spokesman for the Met said its operation to arrest Assange continued .
It said : â€œShould he leave the embassy , the [ Met ] will make every effort to arrest him .
However , it is no longer proportionate to commit officers to a permanent presence.â€ �
Keevil pointed out that it might be possible to assess Assangeâ€ ™ s condition using ultrasound equipment , which could be taken into the embassy .
â€œObviously there are other technologies that are more portable , ultrasound being the obvious one , â€ � he said .
â€œA quick look - see with ultrasound might be useful , but if the clinical view is that MRI is needed , that would not be supportable.â€ �
A IPEM spokesman said an MRI scan would provide higher - resolution images and in general depict soft tissue problems more clearly than ultrasound ."
2015-10-19,"Lawyers for Julian Assange say they are considering launching a fresh appeal against his Swedish arrest warrant , following the publication of correspondence between prosecutors in Britain and Sweden .
The Wikileaks founderâ€ ™ s legal team say the documents show Britainâ€ ™ s Crown Prosecution Service and Marianne Ny , the prosecutor in Sweden seeking Assangeâ€ ™ s extradition , were â€œmore interested in winning the case [ against him ] than finding the truthâ€ � following Assangeâ€ ™ s arrest in 2010 .
Sweden sought Assangeâ€ ™ s extradition following allegations of rape and sexual assault against two women in Stockholm in August 2010 .
He sought asylum in the Ecuadorean embassy in London in June 2012 , after losing his appeal against extradition .
The statute of limitations on several of the alleged crimes has since expired , leaving only one allegation outstanding .
Assange denies the accusations and has not been charged .
The correspondence was among a number of documents obtained by the Italian newspaper Lâ€ ™ Espresso following freedom of information requests in Sweden .
In one email , dated 25 January 2011 , a CPS lawyer called Paul Close writes to Nyâ€ ™ s office repeating his advice that â€œin my view it would not be prudentâ€ � for Swedish prosecutors to question Assange in the UK over the accusations , rather than insisting on his extradition to Sweden .
â€œEven if the defendant was to consent to such an interview on a mutually agreed basis , the defence would without any doubt seek to turn the event to its advantage , â€ � he writes .
â€œIt would inevitably allege it was conclusive proof that the Swedish authorities had no case whatsoever against him , and hence the interview was in the hope he would make a full and frank confession â€
¦
Thus I suggest you interview him only on his surrender to Sweden and in accordance with Swedish law.â€ �
In another email dated 13 January , Close had assured Ny and a colleague , Ola Lofgren
, â€œplease do not think that the case is being dealt with just as another extradition requestâ€ � .
Per Samuelsson , who represents Assange in Sweden , told the Guardian he believed the emails were a â€œsignificant developmentâ€ � , because they were â€œan apparent example of a prosecutor giving another prosecutor advice in order to diminish the rights of the defendantâ€ � .
He said they exposed what he argued was Swedenâ€ ™ s true motivation in refusing to interview Assange in the UK at that stage .
â€œThe official explanation was that the quality of the interrogation would be too poor , â€ �
he said .
â€œWe never believed in that , and consistently questioned it .
Now we suspect â€ ¦ the true reason was they were afraid to interrogate Assange
was because it would give him a platform to defend himself.â€ �
He said they were considering whether to ask for Ny to be replaced as prosecutor .
A spokeswoman for Ny said she was on holiday and her deputy , Ingrid Isgren , had â€œno informationâ€ � on the case before 2013 .
But a CPS spokesman said that , when the advice was given in 2011 , â€œwe were following due process and advice was being given to facilitate that request .
We could not have anticipated later developments , and in particular that Mr Assange would fail to surrender when the courts ordered his extradition to Sweden.â€ �
He said it was â€œentirely proper that the CPS , when acting for requesting authorities , advise them on all relevant aspects of their extradition request , which can include judicial cooperation.â€ �
Asked what Close had meant when he wrote that this was not â€œjust another extradition caseâ€ � , the spokesman said some of its cases â€œstand out because of the nature of the offence , the identity of the requested person , or the complexity of the case , for example .
These cases may require greater resources in terms of time and expertise.â€ � Assange has still not been questioned over the allegations .
Ny attempted to interrogate him in the embassy in June , but Ecuador said it could not facilitate the visit because it had not been notified in time , and because it required a bilateral agreement to be in place between the two countries .
After a long period of stalemate , the two countriesâ€ ™ judicial authorities are now in discussions over the arrangements by which they could agree access to the embassy for Swedish prosecutors .
In August the Foreign Office minister Hugo Swire said the government was â€œfrustrated that the interview has not yet taken place .
This remains a deeply unsatisfactory and costly situation.â€ �
A spokesman for the Foreign Office said Swire had been referring to the circumstances after Assange entered the embassy , rather than to the period covered by the emails ."
2015-10-23,"Following an unprecedented referendum of its members , the Cambridge Union will offer a platform to Julian Assange for a talk on 11 November via video link from the Ecuadorian Embassy .
The vote was decisive : 76.9 % of the 1,463 votes cast were in favour , while 23.1 % voted no to the question â€œDo
you agree that the Cambridge Union should host Julian Assange via video link on November 11th at 7pm?â€
�
This is the first time such a vote has taken place in the societyâ€ ™ s 200-year history .
The decision to invite the Wikileaks founder has been heavily criticised by womenâ€ ™ s representatives at Cambridge University including the student union womenâ€ ™ s officer , Charley Chorley .
It has also led to the resignation of Helen Dallas , womenâ€ ™ s officer of the Cambridge Union , the universityâ€ ™ s prestigious debating and social society .
Explaining her departure , Dallas cited exclusion from key meetings in the lead up to the invitation .
She felt her position as womenâ€ ™ s officer was â€œbeing treated as a public relations post for decisions made without my consultation ...
Consequently my post , and the voice of women within the union , were undermined.â€ � Oliver Mosley , union president , told the Guardian that he agreed mistakes had been made around Dallasâ€ ™ s inclusion in meetings and added that :
â€œItâ€ ™ s fair to say [ the debate ] has encouraged more speech than we expected.â€ �
Chorley says : â€œBy inviting Assange , the union reveals its inability to attract new , provocative , diverse speakers .
It demonstrates its skewed priorities which have , for years , alienated women and minorities.â€ �
The vote comes in the wake of several decisions at UK universities to deprive controversial speakers of publicity through a â€œno platformâ€ � policy .
Journalist Rod Liddle is a vocal critic of the policy , raising concerns about the state of freedom of speech at UK universities .
He told the Guardian : â€œEverybody should be allowed to speak on our university campuses .
In a sense , thatâ€ ™ s what we have them for .
The Wikileaks founder has been accused of rape by two women , but evaded extradition by Swedish law enforcement by seeking asylum at the Ecuadorian embassy in London .
The deadline for charges has since expired , but the Swedish authorities are still seeking an interview with Assange .
He and his supporters argue he has been available for interview at the embassy throughout the controversy .
Mosley said that it was Assangeâ€ ™ s â€œunique positionâ€ � of not having faced a judicial process that made the referendum necessary , and said the union was â€œa freedom of speech societyâ€ � .
The author and ex - MP Louise Mensch , who recently spoke at the Cambridge Union , argued it was wrong to call a referendum : â€œI would simply have invited Assange .
Yet I would not have allowed him to speak unchallenged .
I would have had questions and answers rather than a speech .
Five - minute opening statement , and for the next half - hour , one question then a three - minute response.â€ �
She added : â€œThe president should bear resignations with equanimity .
He is right to allow free speech.â€ �

2015-12-12,"The WikiLeaks founder , Julian Assange , may be questioned in London within days about alleged sexual offences after Ecuador indicated it had reached a bilateral deal with Sweden .
Assange has been wanted for questioning by Swedish authorities since 2010 , but was granted asylum by Ecuador and has been in the countryâ€ ™ s London embassy for more than three years .
In April , the activist said he consented to the Swedish prosecutorâ€ ™ s conditions for the interrogation procedure to take place in the Kensington embassy .
The agreement refers specifically to Assange and Swedenâ€ ™ s intention to question him in London and will come into effect â€œin
the coming daysâ€ � , a statement from the Ecuadorian foreign ministry said .
Assangeâ€ ™ s Swedish lawyer , Per Samuelson , told the Guardian that Sweden needed to formally approve the deal and he understood those discussions would take place on Thursday .
Negotiations began in June this year between Ecuadorâ€ ™ s acting foreign minister , Xavier Lasso , and the Swedish justice ministryâ€ ™ s international affairs chief , Anna - Carin Svensson .
The Ecuadorian government statement said : â€œThe agreement , without any doubt , is a tool that strengthens bilateral relations and facilitates , for example , the execution of such legal actions as the questioning of Mr Assange , isolated in the Ecuadorian embassy in London.â€ � The deal would ensure â€œthe implementation and enforcement of national legislation and principles of international law , particularly those relating to human rights , to further the full exercise of national sovereignty in any event of legal assistance that may be required between Ecuador and Swedenâ€ � .
The agreement would be the final step towards interviewing Assange in London , with a request to the UK for legal assistance having already been granted , according to previous statements from the Swedish prosecutorâ€ ™ s office .
Assange sought refuge at the embassy in June 2012 after losing his final legal attempt to avoid extradition .
Swedenâ€ ™ s director of public prosecutions , Marianne Ny , said in March this year that she would allow Assange to be interviewed in London if agreement could be reached with Ecuador .
Two women made allegations against Assange five years ago in Stockholm , but no charges have been brought because the prosecutor has been unable to interrogate him .
Assange denies the offences and claims that if he surrendered to Swedish custody he would be indicted for espionage by the US for his work with WikiLeaks , which has released millions of classified documents .
In August , Swedish prosecutors announced they were dropping their investigation into two allegations of sexual molestation and one of unlawful coercion , as the statute of limitations had run out .
Investigations into the outstanding allegation of rape continue , and the statute of limitation for that will not expire for another four and a half years .
The Metropolitan police recently announced the end of permanent patrols outside the embassy , which had been in place since Assange arrived , because they were â€œno longer proportionateâ€ � ."

2016-01-15,"Swedish prosecutors will be allowed to question the WikiLeaks founder , Julian Assange , at the Ecuadorean embassy in London , the South American nationâ€ ™ s foreign minister , Ricardo Patino , has said .
Assange has been living in the west - London building since seeking refuge in 2012 as he awaited extradition to Sweden to face prosecutors over rape allegations .
Patino told the Ecuadorean radio station Publica that the country was accepting Swedenâ€ ™ s request to interrogate Assange â€œas long as the sovereignty of the Ecuadoran state and the laws in the constitution are respectedâ€ � , the Associated Press reported .
He suggested that Swedish authorities could provide their Ecuadoran counterparts with the questions and they could be asked in the presence of a Swedish prosecutor .
Later on Friday , Kristinn Hrafnsson , a spokesman for WikiLeaks , told the Guardian that Assange welcomed the â€œopportunity to deliver his statement to the prosecutorâ€ � .
â€œJulian has been offering his statement to the prosecutor by various means for five years [ in total ] and for three - and - a - half years since he went into the embassy â€ “ whether via videolink or by the prosecutor coming to London , â€ � he said .
â€œLetâ€ ™ s hope [ the interview ] can be carried out as soon as possible .
Julian is very eager to get his point of view into the investigation.â€ �
Assangeâ€ ™ s extradition to Sweden was allowed by the British courts in 2012 after a lengthy legal battle .
In June that year , the WikiLeaks founder , who was on bail after losing his supreme court case â€ “ his final legal recourse in Britain against extradition â€ “ fled to the small embassy building behind Harrodâ€ ™ s , in Londonâ€ ™ s Knightsbridge .
He and his supporters feared that the efforts to send him to Sweden were a pretext to his onward extradition to America , where they believed he would be charged over the posting of classified documents on the WikiLeaks website .
He has not been charged by the Swedish authorities and can not be , under the countryâ€ ™ s laws , without a formal interview taking place first .
The Swedish Prosecution Authority said in December last year that it was making a renewed request for permission to interview Assange in London .
Permission to do so had been granted by the British authorities in June .
â€œWhen all necessary permits and arrangements are ready , the interview will be performed by the supporting prosecutor to the case , chief prosecutor Ingrid Isgren , together with a police investigator , â€ � the Swedish authority said ."
2016-01-31,"Before Julian Assange , the WikiLeaks founder , and Edward Snowden , the intelligence whistleblower , there was Katharine Gun .
Not so many people remember the unassuming British woman who once risked it all to take a stand against the US war machine , but that is about to change .
The former GCHQ employee will be played by Natalie Dormer , star of The Tudors and Game of Thrones , in a film that continues the big screenâ€ ™ s love affair with spies and journalists .
Gun was a young Mandarin specialist at the British governmentâ€ ™ s eavesdropping agency in Cheltenham .
In early 2003 she received an email asking her and her colleagues to help the US government spy on UN security council delegations in New York .
It was a critical moment , as Washington was seeking UN backing for its invasion of Iraq .
Gun decided the world had to know , whatever the cost to her life and career .
She leaked the memo to the Observer and was arrested , lost her job and faced trial under the Official Secrets Act .
Thirteen years later , as bloodshed continues in Iraq , the almost forgotten story is to be brought to a new audience in Official Secrets , a movie co - starring Paul Bettany and Martin Freeman as Observer journalists who reported the dirty tricks scandal , along with Anthony Hopkins as a retired general and Harrison Ford as a veteran CIA agent .
It will chart Gunâ€ ™ s unlikely bid â€ “ courageous self - sacrifice to supporters , treachery in the view of critics â€ “ to block George W Bush and Tony Blairâ€ ™ s march to war .
â€œItâ€
™ s really surreal ,
â€ �
Gun , 41 , who was born in Taiwan and studied Mandarin and Japanese at Durham University , said last week .
â€œIt already feels like such a long time ago , like almost a different person , but to have it brought to the big screen â€ “ it will still be really weird.â€ �
For director Justin Chadwick , whose credits include The Other Boleyn Girl and Mandela :
Long Walk to Freedom , there will be the challenge of turning spycraft and journalism into drama .
Film - makers keep trying , but some are more successful than others .
The Watergate - inspired All the Presidentâ€ ™ s Men is still widely regarded as the gold standard depiction of investigative reporting , while Spotlight , about the Boston Globeâ€ ™ s exposÃ © of priests involved in sexual abuse , is nominated at this yearâ€ ™ s Oscars .
But The Fifth Estate , which starred Benedict Cumberbatch as Assange , was a flop in 2013 , costing $ 28 m to make and taking only around $ 6 m worldwide .
Oliver Stoneâ€ ™ s biopic of Snowden , played by Joseph Gordon - Levitt , was meant to have been released by now but has been pushed back .
Unlike many whistleblowers who leak thousands of documents after the event , Gun was intervening in an active operation and trying to stop a war with just one email .
The US National Security Agency memo told employees of GCHQ to gather â€œthe whole gamut of information that could give American policymakers an edge in obtaining results favourable to US goals or to head off surprisesâ€ � .
This included a focus on the â€œswing
nationsâ€ � on the security council :
Angola , Cameroon , Chile , Bulgaria and Guinea â€œas well as extra focus on Pakistan UN mattersâ€ � .
Gun did not hesitate .
She printed off the memo , put it in her handbag and took it home .
â€œI saw the email and my gut reaction was pretty instantaneous , that it was highly explosive information and that it should be out in the public domain , â€ �
she recalled .
â€œEverybody would agree that at the time â€ “ the build - up to the invasion â€ “ the public mood across the globe was very much against an invasion , and thatâ€ ™ s how I felt as well .
There were no grounds for it , and I really felt that people needed to know what was going on behind the scenes to get a really clear picture of where our governments were taking us.â€ � The Observer had controversially declared its support for the war , but it verified the leak and published the story on 2 March 2003 , causing an international storm .
The US and UK had to give up on securing a direct UN mandate for attacking Iraq and instead launched airstrikes on 19 March , with far - reaching consequences that included a chaotic insurgency and saw the rise of Islamic State .
Gun reflected : â€œI think the film is important because the issues still havenâ€ ™ t gone away and itâ€ ™ s a good opportunity to focus peopleâ€ ™ s minds not only on that specific period in time but also on the ramifications of that invasion and how the ripple effect has carried on to this day .
The violence , the refugee crisis , Isis â€
“ theyâ€ ™ re all intertwined in many ways.â€ � Intriguing questions remain over who ultimately authorised the NSAâ€ ™ s request and whether it was carried out by GCHQ staff .
Based on Marcia and Thomas Mitchellâ€ ™ s bestselling book , The Spy Who Tried To Stop A War : Katherine Gun and the Secret Plot to Sanction
the Iraq Invasion , the film will try to fill some of the gaps and trace the political forces that led to the conflict .
Gun said : â€œThere was certainly something going on at very senior levels .
We know that Tony Blair was principally concerned about his reputation , about the legality of the war .
The whole thing stinks to high heaven .
I know people have tried to make citizensâ€ ™ arrests on Tony Blair and so on , but really
itâ€
™ s time the international criminal court has some guts and charges white war criminals .
They need to face justice just like other war criminals .
I would support Bush and Blair being impeached.â€

The personal cost to her was immense .
After the story broke , she owned up to her bosses and was arrested .
The governmentâ€ ™ s decision to charge her came as a â€œshockâ€ � , she recalled , and she faced a possible jail term .
But as she sat in the Old Bailey awaiting the first day of her trial in 2004 , the case was suddenly dropped after the prosecution withdrew its evidence .
Some believe the government was anxious to avoid the embarrassment of a lengthy court case as , in the absence of weapons of mass destruction , its argument for going to war was beginning to unravel .
Gun has since kept a low profile and now lives in Turkey with her husband and seven - year - old daughter .
She applauded Assange and Snowden for resisting an ever - worsening climate of official secrecy and has never regretted what she did .
â€œIt most certainly did change my life completely , but
of course you donâ€ ™ t know how things would have panned out otherwise because I didnâ€
™ t travel down that road .
Itâ€ ™ s been a completely different trajectory from what I envisaged , but Iâ€ ™ m still here and just trying to lead a relatively normal life.â€ �
This will also be a newspaper film .
Bettany , whose CV includes A Beautiful Mind , Iron Man and Wimbledon , plays Martin Bright , the Observer journalist who came into possession of the NSA memo after meeting a contact in a cafe .
Bright , now 49 , from north London , said : â€œI was , I have to admit , sceptical .
It was essentially just a sheet of paper with some words typed on it , but I had a feeling that it looked like it wasnâ€ ™ t made up.â€
�
So he and two colleagues , Ed Vulliamy and Peter Beaumont , worked their contacts for a long time to stand the story up .
â€œBy the time we published
we were 99 % sure , but we were still having some steers from official sources that this might be a sophisticated Russian forgery , and you have to remember the time this was happening was extremely fraught ...
There are a lot of risks involved and if you get something like this wrong , and if it had been a forgery or attempt to discredit the Observer , it would have been terrible for all of us.â€ � Bright , now a political commentator and founder of a youth employment charity , admires Gunâ€ ™ s determination to expose wrongdoing .
â€œIâ€ ™
ve always felt it was an act of immense bravery for a young woman to take the decision to leak a document of such intense sensitivity , â€ � he said .
â€œThis was , at the time , the highest - level leak ever.â€
�
Screenwriters Sara and Gregory Bernstein , a California - based husband and wife , said they were drawn to the story by the courage of people like Gun and Bright and his colleagues .
â€œOf
course , once we started investigating further , we knew we had not only characters , but an explosive story .
The facts here demonstrate how vulnerable we are when government officials knowingly twist information to satisfy an agenda they may sincerely believe is important.â€ �
The script had circulated in Hollywood for years , but producer Elizabeth Fowler is confident that shooting will begin in April or May , with 33-year - old Dormer in the role of Gun .
It is , she believes , a tale that needs to be told .
â€œIt is ultimately a very heroic story about a young woman who finds the courage and has the moral compass to do the right thing , solely at risk to her , â€ �
she said .
â€œRisk only :
no gain .
I think thatâ€ ™ s a tremendously inspiring thing .
She said , â€˜Iâ€ ™ ve only ever followed my conscienceâ€ ™ .
Every time I hear that , tears spring up.â€ �"
2016-02-04,"A United Nations panel has decided that Julian Assangeâ€ ™ s three - and - a - half years in the Ecuadorian embassy amount to â€œarbitrary detentionâ€ � , leading his lawyers to call for the Swedish extradition request to be dropped immediately .
A Swedish foreign ministry spokeswoman confirmed that the UN panel , due to publish its findings on Friday , had concluded that Assange was â€œarbitrarily detainedâ€ � .
The WikiLeaks founder sought asylum from Ecuador in June 2012 to avoid extradition to Sweden to face questioning over rape and sexual assault allegations , which he denies .
The panelâ€ ™ s findings were disclosed to the Swedish and British governments on 22 January , and will be published on Friday morning .
Their judgment is not legally binding but can be used to apply pressure on states in human rights cases .
Anna Ekberg , spokesperson for the Swedish foreign ministry , said : â€œThe UN working group on arbitrary detention has concluded that Mr Assange is arbitrarily detained .
The working groupâ€
™ s
view differs from that of the Swedish authorities .
We will forward a reply to the working group tomorrow .
It will be more clear tomorrow why we reject the working groupâ€ ™ s
conclusions.â€
�
Assangeâ€ ™ s Swedish lawyer , Per Samuelson , said earlier that if the working group found in his favour , â€œthere is only one solution for Marianne Ny [ the Swedish prosecutor seeking Assangeâ€ ™ s extradition ] , and that is to immediately release him and drop the caseâ€ � .
Samuelson added : â€œIf he is regarded as detained , that means he has served his time , so I see no other option for Sweden but to close the case.â€
�
Assangeâ€ ™ s lawyers demanded assurances from the UK that he would not be arrested and subjected to extradition proceedings to face potential prosecution over WikiLeaksâ€ ™ publishing activities .
The British Foreign Office said it would not pre - empt the panelâ€ ™ s findings , but said in a statement : â€œWe have been consistently clear that Mr Assange has never been arbitrarily detained by the UK but is , in fact , voluntarily avoiding lawful arrest by choosing to remain in the Ecuadorian embassy .
â€œAn allegation of rape is still outstanding and a European arrest warrant in place , so the UK continues to have a legal obligation to extradite Mr Assange to Sweden.â€
�
In a statement issued by WikiLeaks on Twitter , Assange said that if the UN panel rejected his claim , he would voluntarily walk out of the embassy on Friday and accept arrest â€œas there is no meaningful prospect of further appealâ€ � .
He added : â€œHowever , should I prevail and the state parties be found to have acted unlawfully , I expect the immediate return of my passport and the termination of further attempts to arrest
me.â€ �
Neither Sweden nor the UK will be compelled to take any action , but a source familiar with the working group said that if the governments choose to ignore the decision , it could make it difficult for them in future to bring pressure on other countries over human rights violations .
Assangeâ€ ™ s lawyers had appealed to the UN panel claiming that his stay in the embassy was arbitrary because he had been unable to exercise his right to asylum , arguing : â€œThe only way for Mr Assange to enjoy is right to asylum is to be in detention .
This is not a legally acceptable choice.â€ �
They also argued that UK law had changed since 2012 , which meant that if arrested today he would no longer be liable to extradition under the European arrest warrant .
Melinda Taylor , an Assange legal spokeswoman , said the Australian had not yet been formally informed by the panel of its findings , but â€œif it finds that the standard for arbitrary detention is met , we would expect his release and compensationâ€ � .
In addition to Sweden dropping the extradition request , she called for the UK to return Assangeâ€ ™ s passport and give him assurances that he would not be subject to arrest for a potential further extradition request by the US .
Assange and WikiLeaks have been the subject of a secret grand jury investigation in Virginia that has been looking into whether to prosecute them over the US cable disclosures , and the Australian fears that he could become immediately subject to a second extradition process even if Sweden drops its inquiry .
â€œIf one of the orders is that he should be released and his liberty should be assured , we would obviously look to the UK to make sure that it is effective and not illusory , that itâ€ ™ s not just liberty for five seconds , but liberty that is meaningful , â€ �
Taylor said .
British police ended the costly 24-hour guard of the Knightsbridge embassy last October , but the building remains under covert surveillance .
A Metropolitan police spokesman said on Thursday : â€œThe operation to arrest Julian Assange does continue and should he leave the embassy the MPS will make every effort to arrest him.â€ �
Sweden and Ecuador have been locked in lengthy negotiations over arrangements to allow Swedish prosecutors to interview Assange in the embassy .
Ecuadorâ€ ™ s foreign minister said last month that the country would allow access for questioning , but Sweden later said its request had been rejected â€œon formal groundsâ€ � .
It is considering whether to submit a fresh request .
Samuelson said his client still hoped to clear his name .
â€œThis does not mean that the question of interrogation will be over .
We still want an interrogation to take place so that Mr Assange can clear his name and show everyone that he is innocent .
â€œThe difference is that he will no longer be in custody in absentia and thus be able to use his asylum outside of the embassy .
If Assange is regarded as detained he has already served the time so to speak so Marianne Ny should drop the case
altogether.â€
�
Last August Sweden dropped part of its investigation into Assange after the statute of limitations on allegations of sexual assault expired .
It is still seeking to interview him on one outstanding allegation of rape .
The accusations were made by two women in Sweden in 2010 , but no charges have been brought .
At the Ecuadorian embassy , the WikiLeaks spokesman Kristinn Hrafnsson said that if Assangeâ€ ™ s claim through the UN was successful he planned to appear by videolink at a press conference in west London on Friday .
â€œIf he loses , as he says , heâ€ ™ ll just walk out of there , â€ �
Hrafnsson told the Guardian , as he left the embassy building after around three hours of discussions with Assange .
â€œThe process has been going on for 18 months , the UK government has made submissions to the working group so it has accepted its authority ,
â€ � Hrafnsson said .
â€œWhat signal does it send that the UK and Sweden would ignore this UN body ?
It would completely destroy its authority .
Are they willing to set that precedent ?
Egypt has not accepted its findings with regard to the detention of its former president [ Mohammed Morsi ] - is that the standard the UK wants to hold?â€ �
Assangeâ€ ™ s health is fragile from the effects of living inside for more than three years but Hrafnsson said he was busily preparing for Friday .
â€œHowever
the decision goes , it is an extremely important moment for him .
Hopefully itâ€ ™ s the end of the road.â€ �"
2016-02-04,"What has the United Nations said about Julian Assange ?
A specialist body based in Geneva , the UN working group on arbitrary detention ( UNWGAD ) has published its long - awaited report on complaints by Julian Assange , the WikiLeaks founder , that he is effectively being detained illegally in the Ecuadorian embassy in Knightsbridge .
Assange is wanted for questioning in Sweden for alleged sex offences ; he has not been charged .
Why has the UN decided that Assange is subject to â€˜arbitrary detentionâ€ ™ ?
Much of the report focuses on criticism of the Swedish prosecutorâ€ ™ s failure to question Assange in the UK and give the Australian an opportunity to provide a full statement to investigating officers .
The UNWGAD finding says that the methods used in the protracted criminal investigation , which has been going on since 2010 , are disproportionate .
Who was on the UN panel and how did it work ?
The chair and rapporteur of the UN working group on arbitrary detention is a South Korean academic , Seong - Phil Hong , who has worked as a conciliator for the World Bank and also dealt with North Korean human rights and the issue of enforced sexual slavery during the second world war .
The other members of the panel are from Mexico , Benin , Australia and Ukraine .
The Australian member of the panel recused herself from the decision because Assange is an Australian citizen .
The panel is authorised to investigate complaints from individuals as well as carrying out reports on whether countries are adhering to international legal obligations on detention .
Among its recent high - profile decisions was one last autumn , which concluded that Mohammed Nasheed , the former president of the Maldives , who was sentenced to 13 years in prison after being found guilty of terrorism , did not receive a fair trial .
Was it a unanimous decision ?
Unusually , the five - member UN panel failed to agree among themselves .
As well as the Australian member who stood down , another member , the Ukrainian legal academic Vladimir Tochilovsky , produced a dissenting report in which he concluded that Assange was a â€œself - confinedâ€ � fugitive .
He added : â€œAssange fled [ police ] bail in June 2012 and since then stays at the premises of the embassy using them as a safe haven to evade arrest.â€ �
What will be the effect of the report ?
Both the UK and Swedish governments have said they will not comply with the UNWGAD finding because it interferes with the legitimate workings of the European arrest warrant that Assange is circumventing by remaining inside the Ecuadorian embassy .
â€œThis changes nothing , â€ � the UK government responded .
â€œWe completely reject any claim that Julian Assange is a victim of arbitrary detention.â€ �
How embarrassing is this for the UK ?
Even though both Sweden and the UK intend to ignore the report , it is nonetheless highly embarrassing for two active upholders of the UN and the international rule of law to be subjected to such harsh criticism by such an influential UN body .
It sets an undesirable precedent for other states to defy UN decisions .
What do other international lawyers think of the development ?
Mark Ellis , executive director of the London - based International Bar Association , said : â€œThe information seems to suggest that the UN panel has found in Assangeâ€ ™ s favour .
That decision would seem to contradict a fairly extensive legal process both in the UK and in Sweden .
Itâ€ ™ s important to maintain adherence to rule of law principles and ensure that individuals have to abide by legal rulings .
Itâ€ ™ s surprising to think that Assange could be exempted from those principles .
The ruling by the UN panel is not binding on British law .
â€œIt would , however , provide Assange with support for his claim that he should not be extradited .
Iâ€ ™ m sure the UK is trying to figure a way out .
It would be difficult for me to think that there should be an exception [ from the European arrest warrant ] for this case.â€ �
Kirsty Brimelow QC , of Doughty Street Chambers , an expert in international law tribunals , said : â€œA finding by UNWGAD against the UK is not binding .
It has no enforcement power .
However , a finding that the UK has acted in a way which is inconsistent with relevant international standards should not be ignored by the UK .
The UK should not act contrary to international law.â€ �"
2016-02-04,"The UN Working Group on Arbitrary Detention has played a valuable role in highlighting unjust and improper imprisonment , often of political prisoners .
Only last October , it condemned the Maldives courts for imprisoning the first democratically elected president , Mohamed Nasheed , on terrorist charges without a fair trial .
In 2007 , it condemned the house arrest of Aung San Suu Kyi .
But its latest opinion , which is expected to be formally published tomorrow , that the WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange is being detained arbitrarily , is simply wrong .
He is not being detained arbitrarily .
Three - and - a - half years ago , he sought refuge in the Ecuadorian embassy in order to avoid extradition to Sweden to face allegations of sex offences .
He had fought extradition through every court , and at each his case was rejected .
â€œArbitraryâ€ �
detention means that due legal process has not been observed .
It has .
This is a publicity stunt .
Three of the four alleged offences , dating back to 2010 , now took place too long ago for Mr Assange to face prosecution .
But there is an outstanding accusation of rape that the Swedish authorities can pursue until 2020 .
It is true that he has never been charged , as his lawyers have argued .
But that is because Swedish legal procedure requires an interview to take place before any decision to prosecute : since Mr Assange left Sweden in 2010 before he could be questioned and has resolutely refused to return , no such interview has taken place .
There are continuing negotiations between the Swedish , British and Ecuadorian authorities to arrange for an interview to take place in the embassy to where Mr Assange fled in August 2012 .
It may soon actually happen .
Mr Assange , who invited the UN panel to examine his case in 2014 , knew the outcome in advance .
That may account for his offer to give himself up to the British authorities if its opinion went against him .
He will hope that its findings allow him to claim some kind of moral victory , and strengthen his call that the Swedish authorities drop their investigations .
But he would still face arrest in the UK : he was granted bail while he fought extradition to Sweden and he broke his bail conditions , at great expense to those friends and supporters who had backed him financially , by fleeing to the Ecuadorian embassy .
No doubt the conditions of his self - imprisonment are unpleasant ; they are certainly severely limiting .
But it is possible to sympathise with his circumstances , and to applaud his role in the WikiLeaks revelations that exposed embarassing and sometimes illegal US activity that were published in the Guardian ( while deploring his later decision to dump many more , unmediated , on the web ) without accepting his right to evade prosecutorsâ€ ™ questions about the allegation that he committed a serious criminal offence .
He has always argued that it is not the sex offence inquiries that he is avoiding , but extradition from Sweden to the US .
Chelsea Manning , the soldier who originally downloaded the material and leaked it to Mr Assange , is serving a long sentence in military detention .
There are indications that WikiLeaks is in the US justice departmentâ€ ™ s sights : itâ€ ™ s been confirmed that a grand jury is investigating ; no indictment has been made public , but that does not mean there is none .
Equally , the justice department could decide to make a distinction between government employees and military personnel who had a duty to protect classified information , and those who , like Mr Assange , published it .
But WikiLeaks was founded on exposing those who ignored the rule of law .
Surely its editor - in - chief should recognise his duty to see it upheld ."
2016-02-04,"WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange says he will walk out of the Ecuadorian embassy in London if a United Nations panel rules against his claim that he is being illegally detained .
Assangeâ€ ™ s rise to prominence and the decisions that led to his three - and - a - half years in the embassy have made legal history in courts around the world .
The circumstances that led to his time in the embassy are bound to his work as the founder of WikiLeaks and the publication of hundreds of thousands of US files that have revealed countless diplomatic , military and political scandals around the world .
The outcome of the UN decision on Friday may well bring us closer to the last step in the long saga .
Hereâ€ ™ s a brief guide to how Assange got here , and what could happen next .
Why canâ€ ™ t Assange leave the Ecuadorian embassy ?
Assange sought asylum in the embassy after entering it in June 2012 following a series of dramatic legal challenges through British courts to a European arrest warrant sought by Sweden .
He is technically free to leave but says he can not because he is in breach of a European arrest warrant that was granted to extradite him to Sweden , and faces arrest if he does so .
Why was the arrest warrant sought ?
Has Assange been charged in Sweden ?
Assange has not at any point been charged with an offence under Swedish law .
He was sought for questioning by Swedish authorities in relation to complaints of sexual assault raised by two women in 2010 .
Swedish authorities at the time sought to interview him in person in Sweden over the complaints , and refused to accept his offer of a statement from Britain .
Assange had raised repeated concerns about Swedish demands that he be questioned in person over the allegations , fearing he may be extradited to the US .
A US grand jury investigation is still believed to be underway following WikiLeaksâ€ ™ s publication of vast caches of US military and diplomatic files including the Afghan war diary and US diplomatic cables .
As a result of the failure of his legal challenges to the arrest warrant , and his concerns about possible further extradition to the US , Assange opted to seek asylum in the Ecuadorian embassy rather than comply with the order .
What is the United Nations working group on arbitrary detention ?
Can it force British authorities to let Assange walk free ?
The working group is a UN body set up to investigate the lawfulness of state detention on individuals .
It can take on cases to determine whether a person has been detained arbitrarily having regard to various international law instruments .
Assangeâ€ ™ s legal counsel has submitted that his time in the Ecuadorian embassy has not been by his choice , and should be considered arbitrary detention .
They have argued the flawed arrest warrant sought against him has led to Assange being unable to access the full benefits of asylum afforded to him by Ecuador .
The submissions state : â€œIf all the names , details and events were redacted , it could be distilled to the simple and irrefutable fact that a political refugee , who has never been charged , has been deprived of their liberty for nearly four years , and confined in a very small space for over two years .
The matter has come to a head because his mental and physical health are imperilled.â€
�
Like many international bodies , the UN working group does not have binding powers that would force British authorities to allow Assange to walk free .
However , the decision may prove an important tool for pressuring the British and Swedish governments to allow Assange to leave the embassy .
It could also be persuasive in any further challenge sought in the European court of human rights .
What will happen if Assange loses and leaves the embassy ?
If Assange were to walk outside the embassy after the UN ruling was handed down , he is likely to be arrested on the spot by British authorities .
He could still then be extradited to Sweden for questioning .
If he wins , Assange will still have to weigh up further legal options , or use the UN decision to continue to pressure the British government to allow him to leave the embassy ."

2016-02-05,"A UN panel may have found that Julian Assange is subject to â€œarbitrary detentionâ€ � and called for him to be allowed to walk free , but the WikiLeaks founder remains exactly where he has been for the past 44 months
â€ “ inside Ecuadorâ€ ™ s
London embassy and locked in a three - nation war of words .
Britain and Sweden immediately rejected the UN report , which declared that Assange had been â€œarbitrarily detainedâ€ � since his arrest in 2010 and during his lengthy stay in the embassy , where he sought asylum in June 2012 .
The British foreign secretary , Philip Hammond , described the findings as â€œridiculousâ€ � and the Australian as a â€œfugitive from justiceâ€ � .
However , the panelâ€ ™ s findings , leaked on Thursday and published in full on Friday morning , were a welcome victory for Assange , and a moment he intended to savour fully .
At 4.01pm he emerged on to the balcony of the west London embassy to greet a crowd of several hundred supporters and journalists , pausing first , just briefly , to glance at the sky he has rarely seen for more than three years .
â€œHow sweet it is , â€ � said Assange , holding aloft a copy of the UN report while supporters shouted : â€œWe love you , Julian!â€ �
It had been , he said , â€œa victory of historical importanceâ€ � , and a decision reached after a process to which both Britain and Sweden had made submissions .
â€œThey lost .
UK lost ; Sweden lost.â€ � The Swedish government , however , has insisted the report changes nothing , and that it can not interfere in an independent prosecutorâ€ ™ s ongoing attempt to extradite Assange for questioning over an allegation of rape dating from 2010 , which he denies .
Meanwhile , for Ecuador â€ “ the Australianâ€ ™ s (
mostly ) willing host â€ “
the findings meant it was time for the two countries to allow Assange to walk free , and to compensate both him and them for the lengthy period he has been holed up in one of its few rooms .
At times , Assange was in magnanimous mood .
Having initially accused Hammond of insulting the UN with comments that were â€œbeneath the stature that a foreign minister should express in this situationâ€ � , he later described him as a â€œperfectly nice personâ€ � whose comments were â€œmerely rhetoricâ€ � .
Britain had not appealed against the findings of the UN working group on arbitrary detention , he said , â€œbecause they knew they would loseâ€
� .
But there were dark warnings for those he said were responsible for â€œdepriv[ing ] my children of their father for five and a half yearsâ€ � .
â€œA lot of people have very long memories about the parties that have committed injustices in this case .
Inevitably , those people will face the consequences of their actions.â€ �
Only a single , persistent heckler interrupted the mood .
â€œCan someone close that person up?â€ � asked Assange .
Shouts of â€œYes!â€ � came in response .
After exhausting all his legal options in the UK and Sweden some time ago , there is no question that the report represents a boost for Assangeâ€ ™ s legal team .
Reaching their conclusion by a three - to - one majority after a fifth member recused herself , the panel called on the Swedish and British authorities to end Assangeâ€ ™ s â€œdeprivation of libertyâ€ � , respect his physical integrity and freedom of movement , and offer him compensation .
Assange , they found , had been unable â€œto access the full - intended benefitâ€ � of the asylum status granted by Ecuador , and â€œthe continuing and disproportionate denial to him of such access
â€ ¦ had become cumulatively harsh and disproportionateâ€ � .
In particular , the panel offered an excoriating critique of Swedenâ€ ™ s prosecution process , which they said had been in a state of â€œindefinite procrastinationâ€ � .
With Quito and Stockholm still unable to agree on arrangements to allow Swedish prosecutors access to the London embassy , Assange has yet to be interviewed over the alleged offences .
Britain said on Thursday it was â€œdeeply frustratedâ€ � by the deadlock .
But for all Assangeâ€ ™ s jubilation , he remains in the embassy , the extradition warrant still stands , and Britain and Sweden remain adamant that the report changes nothing .
Assange also remains fearful of a potential future extradition to the US , where a secret grand jury has been looking into whether to prosecute him over WikiLeakâ€ ™ s publishing activities .
British lawyers lined up on Friday to dismiss the panelâ€ ™ s findings , with Dominic Grieve , who was attorney general in 2012 when Assange entered the embassy , calling it â€œan extraordinary documentâ€ � and â€œvery far - fetchedâ€ � .
Ken Macdonald QC , the former director of public prosecutions , described the findings as â€œbeyond parodyâ€ � .
â€œJulian Assange is wanted in connection with a grave sexual offence in a country that has a fair - trial justice system consistent with the highest international standards .
Instead of cooperating with the Swedish authorities , as he should have done , Mr Assange has chosen to hole up in a foreign embassy , deliberately frustrating a serious criminal investigation .
To describe his situation as â€˜arbitrary detentionâ€ ™ is ludicrous.â€ � Elisabeth Massi Fritz , the lawyer for the Swedish woman whom Assange is accused of raping , said the UN panel had â€œa lack of understandingâ€ � that rape â€œis one of the most serious abuses and violations of human rightsâ€ � .
It was â€œinsulting and offensiveâ€ � , she said , to her client to suggest a rape suspect should be compensated for withholding himself from justice for more than five years .
But the former chair of the UN working group , Mads Andenas , defended its finding , saying : â€œThere is no doubt that the normal course of action for the Swedish authorities would have been to interview Assange in London .
The extradition request was disproportionate.â€
�
So what happens next in the extraordinary , seemingly irresolveable drama of Julian Assange ?
At a press conference earlier in the day , one of his lawyers , Melinda Taylor , said that if Sweden and Britain were not prepared to act , Assange might consider applying again to the Swedish courts , â€œto see how they will enforce or apply the findings of the working groupâ€ � .
The European court of human rights was another option , she said , although the Strasbourg court confirmed on Friday that an application lodged by Assange in November against the UK and Sweden had been declared inadmissible the following month .
Speaking on the balcony , Assange dropped heavy hints about breaches of the convention against torture .
â€œIf this illegal , immoral , unethical detention continues , there will be criminal consequences for the parties involved.â€ �"
2016-02-05,"We are now closing this blog after Julian Assangeâ€ ™ s impromptu victory celebration on the balcony of the Ecuadorian embassy , his home for the past five and a half years .
Thank you for reading .
The indefatigable Jessica Elgot has just filed from the embassy on Assangeâ€ ™ s impromptu victory celebration .
Julian Assange has declared he is â€œtoughâ€ � enough to withstand longer confinement in the Ecuadorian Embassy , but demanded the UK and Sweden heed the UNâ€ ™ s opinion that he is arbitrarily detained in an impassioned speech to supporters and media crowded around the balcony of the Ecuadorian embassy in Knightbridge .
In the 12-minute speech , Assange said his legal team would now examine if there were â€œcriminal consequencesâ€ � for the parties who he said continue to deny him his freedom , citing the UN Convention Against Torture .
Activists and supporters played peace songs as a warm up act for the WikiLeaks founder , as the rumour spread that he would be appearing on the embassy balcony .
He appeared a minute past 4 pm , in the grey suit and yellow tie he wore at an earlier press conference .
â€œHow sweet it is , â€ � he said .
â€œThis is a victory that can not be denied.â€ �
In the fading afternoon light , he thanked the jurists and the legal team that decided in his favour , before pausing for several moments to collect this thoughts , staring into the crowd .
â€œThe UN had made a statement that is legally binding , â€ � he said , to shouts of â€˜yes!â€ ™ from the supporters who had linked arms and formed a protective barrier in front of the balcony between Assange and the media .
â€œThere have been comments made by Hammond , foreign minister of this country , that this changes nothing , â€ � Assange continued .
â€œHammond may be a perfectly nice person but his comments are merely rhetoric .
â€œHe doesnâ€ ™ t state that the UK will refuse to accept the authority of the Working Group of arbitrary detention .
The UK and Sweden were party to a 16-month process , we made submissions , the UK responded to those submissions .
They lost!â€ � Assange described himself as having been arbitrarily detained for five and a half years , a comment which provoked the ire of a passer - by , who yelled repeatedly will you be here for another five and a half years?â€
�
The heckler persisted for a minute or two before Assange said : â€œcan someone close that person
up?â€ � to cheers from his supporters .
â€œThis is a free country mate ,
â€ � the man shouted back .
Assange ended his speech with an appeal to authorities to consider the impact the last five years had had on his family .
â€œI am tough , I can take it .
But what right does the government have to deny my children their father for five and a half years ?
My children are completely innocent .
They are not in the business of holding governments to account , they are in the business of being children .
They need their father back.â€ �
â€œThere are good people in the UK government , in the Foreign Office , in the British police , the Swedish foreign ministry , the US state department and even the US military , and it is partly due to these good people and their ongoing support that has led to this victory .
These people understand that history is on their side and I am very grateful.â€ �
Assangeâ€ ™ s appearance lasted about 10 minutes .
When he first appeared , his supporters shouted : â€œWe love you.â€ � and â€œJulian your friends are you.â€ �
He held up a copy of the UN as he spoke as if it was a badge of vindication .
His first words were : â€œHow sweet it is .
This is a victory that can not be denied .
It is a victory of historical importance for me , my family , my children and for the independence of the UN system.â€ �
The UN document was not just a visual prop .
He read its conclusion declaring that deprivation of his liberty was arbitrary , which was greeted by cheers .
And then he asked what right the British , Swedish and US governments had to deny his children of their father .
Assange has appeared on the balcony of the Ecuadorian embassy clutching a copy of the UN report - there had been rumours that he would .
He repeats much of what he said before in the videolink , but then goes into quite an emotional tirade about how his children have been deprived of their father for five and a half years .
â€œMy children are completely innocent parties , they are not in politics , they are not into holding governments to account .
Itâ€ ™ s time they had their father back .
That will happen , â€ �
he says to cheers from the crowd below and to the odd heckler .
At one point he says : â€œcan anyone close that person downâ€ � .
He went on to say that there would consequences for the governments that have put him in his predicament .
â€œThere will be criminal consequences for those parties involved , â€ � he said .
Hereâ€ ™ s a summary of where things stand : A UN panel has found that WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange has been arbitrarily detained by the UK and Sweden for more than five years and should be released immediately with compensation .
The panel calls on the Swedish and British authorities to end Assangeâ€ ™ s â€œdeprivation of libertyâ€ � , respect his physical integrity and freedom of movement and offer him compensation .
Assange welcomed the finding as a â€œvindication.â€ �
He said it was â€œnow a matter of settled lawâ€ � .
Speaking via Skype from the Ecuadorian embassy where he remains holed up , he added : â€œWe have today a really significant victory that has brought a smile to my face and I hope many others as well.â€ �
Ecuador welcomed the UN panelâ€ ™ s finding .
Foreign minister , Ricardo PatiÃ±o , said : â€œIt is time for both governments ( Britain and Sweden ) to correct their mistake , time for them to allow Julian Assange his freedom , time for them to end this arbitrary detention and furthermore compensate the damage done to this man.â€ � The British government said it would contest the decision .
Foreign secretary Philip Hammond said it was â€œflawed in lawâ€ � and â€œfrankly ridiculousâ€ � .
Assanged dismissed Hammondâ€ ™ s comments as â€œinsultingâ€ � .
The Swedish government also rejected the panelâ€ ™ s findings .
It said : â€œMr Assange is free to leave the Embassy at at any point .
Thus , he is not being deprived of his liberty due to any decision or action taken by the Swedish authorities.â€ � Christophe Peschoux , a senior official at the UNâ€ ™ s commision for human rights said the UK had had two months to contest the panelâ€ ™ s 3 to 1 finding .
He said it was â€œvery unusualâ€ � for such a panel ruling not to be unanimous .
Dominic Grieve , the former attorney general who was in post when Assange first entered the Ecuadorian embassy , dismissed the UNâ€ ™ s panelâ€ ™ s ruling as â€œvery far - fetchedâ€ � .
But Roland Adjovi SÃ¨tondji , one of the three members of the UN panel who backed the finding has defended the opinion .
â€œThe working group was of the view that this was a lengthy process that jeopardised his right to a fair trial , â€ � he said .
Thereâ€ ™ ll be more on the Julian Assange section of the Guardianâ€ ™ s site .
The online book maker Paddy Power is offering odds of 14 - 1 for Julian Assange to walk away from the Ecuadorean Embassy a free man this month .
Paddy Power is also taking bets on how Assange will make his exit from the Embassy .
â€œA tenner on a Taxi at 13 - 2 would return more than enough to cover his fare!,â€ � it says .
When will Assange get out ?
7 - 2 2017 or later 6 - 1 March 14 - 1 8 - 29 February 100 - 1 Before 8 February The Guardianâ€ ™ s former investigations editor David Leigh , who worked with Assange on publication of leaded US embassy cables before falling out with the Wikileaks founder , urges us to remember the whistleblower Chelsea Manning .
Leigh says it is Manning , who was sentenced to 35 years for leaking the cables , who is the real political prisoner .
Ecuador has welcomed the UN panelâ€ ™ s finding .
Foreign minister , Ricardo PatiÃ±o , said Assange must be allowed to go free .
â€œIt is time for both governments ( Britain and Sweden ) to correct their mistake , time for them to allow Julian Assange his freedom , time for them to end this arbitrary detention and furthermore compensate the damage done to this man , â€ � PatiÃ±o told a press conference acoording to AFP .
He added : â€œWeâ€ ™ ve said it from the beginning , but now weâ€ ™ re not the only ones .
This is obvious political persecution .
That has been absolutely demonstrated.â€ � â€œWhat more do they want to be accused of before they start to rectify their error?â€
� he told South American broadcaster Telesur , in reference to Britain and Sweden .
Patino said Ecuador was analysing its next steps .
On Thursday Ecuador said it deserved compensation for housing Assange in its London embassy .
â€œThat shows we were right , after so many years , â€ � Ecuadorâ€ ™ s President Rafael Correa told a news conference in Quito in reference to the panelâ€ ™ s anticipated finding .
â€œBut who is going to compensate the harm that has been done to Julian Assange and to Ecuador ?
Do you know how much it costs to maintain security at the embassy?â€ �
he asked .
â€œWe experienced spying attempts and lots of other things.â€
�
The UN Working Group on Arbitrary Detention recommended that Assange be entitled to compensation , but it said nothing about Ecuadorâ€ ™ s costs of housing him .
Patino said Assange was welcome to remain in the embassy .
â€œThe basis on which we granted him asylum remains in place ,
â€ �
Patino told reporters .
The word from the Ecuadorian embassy is that Assange may soon make an appearance on the balcony .
Reuters has a live feed from outside the building .
Roland Adjovi SÃ¨tondji from Benin , one of the three members of the UN panel who backed the finding has defended the opinion .
Speaking on BBC Radio 4â€ ™ s
World at One programme he said : â€œWe saw this time he has been in the embassy as a continuation of two obvious detention situations .
He [ Assange ] was detained first in a British prison for 10 days , before being released on house arrest for almost two years.â€ � SÃ¨tondji added : â€œIn any criminal justice there is an obligation of timely process .
This investigation has been going on for five years and there is no charges , there is no indictment of Julian Assange until now .
The working group was of the view that this was a lengthy process that jeopardised his right to a fair trial.â€ �
Asked to respond to the foreign secretaryâ€ ™ s claim that finding was â€œridiculousâ€ � , SÃ¨tondji said â€œobviously I canâ€ ™ t share that view , but I donâ€ ™ t have to comment on state authorityâ€ ™ s views.â€ �
How did the UN get it so wrong on Julian Assange ? asks Joshua Rozenberg .
First , they said he had been detained in prison for 10 days in 2010 â€œat the very beginning of the episode that lasted longer than five yearsâ€ � .
They claimed â€œthe arbitrariness is inherent in this form of deprivation of libertyâ€ � .
This is palpably absurd .
Assange was detained pending possible extradition .
If his detention had been arbitrary he could not have challenged it , and been released on bail .
But that not was what happened .
The three - and - a - half years he has spent as a fugitive from justice can not affect the lawfulness of his original imprisonment .
According to the working group , his 10 days in prison was followed by 550 days of house arrest .
He suffered â€œharsh restrictionsâ€ � , including tagging and restrictions on staying out overnight .
Harsh restrictions ?
And then we get to the fatal flaw .
The working group considers that Assangeâ€ ™ s stay at the embassy â€œshould be considered as a prolongation of the already continued deprivation of libertyâ€ � .
Its members provides no justification for this leap of logic .
Assangeâ€
™ s argument is that he was granted â€œdiplomaticâ€ � immunity by Ecuador .
But the UK does not recognise the notion that a state can merely designate as a diplomat anyone , of whatever nationality , and they are then exempt from the general law .
Fortunately , the working group does not seem to have been taken in by this notion .
Instead , the majority base their opinion on the length of time that has passed , as if to say that a fugitive is entitled to avoid justice by merely hiding away for a few years .
If Assange is extradited to Sweden and charged with rape , there is no reason why he should not receive a fair trial .
Any disadvantage he may suffer through the delay is entirely down to him .
He has not been subjected to arbitrary detention .
The idea that he should receive compensation for hiding himself away in Knightsbridge â€ “ as the working group says â€ “ simply heaps offensiveness on absurdity .
Dominic Grieve , the former attorney general who was in post when Assange first entered the Ecuadorian embassy , dismissed the UNâ€ ™ s panelâ€ ™ s ruling as â€œvery far - fetchedâ€ � .
Speaking on BBC Radio 4â€ ™ s
World at One programme he said : â€œI find the opinion a very extraordinary document.â€
�
He said the main criticisms were aimed at the Swedish rather than British authorities , but added : â€œWhat it effectively says in relation to the United Kingdom is that we ought no longer to be extraditing Mr Assange to Sweden because in 2014 we changed our own laws under the anti - social behaviour , crime and policing act to change some of rules on which extradition should take place , and youâ€ ™ ll appreciate that Mr Assange was extradited under the earlier regime but of course it doesnâ€ ™ t apply retrospectively .
Then there is a quite an astonishing argument that the whole process has been arbitrary .
They suggest he was held under house arrest for 550 days when in fact he was subject to bail conditions and I seem to recollect living in a rather large house in Suffolk where he was obliged to report to the police on a daily basis .
The reason why the whole thing lasted 550 days is because he spent those 550 days challenging his extradition to Sweden and taking the matter all the way to the Supreme Court .
â€œHe voluntarily took the decision to go to the Ecuadorian embassy and indeed he could leave the Ecuadorian embassy at any time of his choosing .
And when he left it he would have the full protection of our English legal system which would enable him to challenge the decision .
â€œIt is not that Iâ€ ™ m saying there may not be some points to be looked at , but the suggestion that he has been the subject of arbitrariness seemed to be very far fetched.â€ � Peter Tatchell , the prominent human rights activist , has joined the swelling numbers of Assange supporters outside the Ecuadorian embassy , writes Jessica Elgot .
He was highly critical of the Swedish prosecutor Marianne Ny and the delay in questioning Assange at the embassy .
Swedish and Ecuadorian legal teams only last month reached agreement which would allow the interview to take place .
Tatchell said : â€œThe Swedish prosecutor kept imposed many unreasonable conditions .
It is a key principle of justice that it should not be delayed .
If the Swedish prosecutor decides to interview him here and finds there is credible evidence to charge him , then he should of course face justice , but if there isnâ€ ™ t ...
â€ � Tatchell , who has visited Assange on several occasions , called the WikiLeaks founder â€œa realistâ€
� about his prospects of leaving the embassy a free man .
â€œBut he is hopeful that justice will eventually prevail .
David Cameron is consistently condemning , rightly , countries who do not respect the UN .
Now his government is doing exactly the same.â€ �
Hereâ€ ™ s the start of Esther Addleyâ€ ™ s
first take on Assangeâ€
™ s remarks : Julian Assange has accused Britainâ€ ™ s foreign secretary , Philip Hammond , of insulting the United Nations in his response to a panel finding that Assangeâ€ ™ s circumstances amount to â€œarbitrary detentionâ€ � .
Hammond called the panelâ€ ™ s finding â€œridiculousâ€ � and said the Wikileaks founder was a â€œfugitive from justiceâ€ � .
Assange said the remarks were â€œbeneath the stature that a foreign minister should express in this situationâ€ � .
Assange said of the panelâ€ ™ s finding : â€œThis is the end of the road for the legal arguments that have been put forward by Sweden and the UK.â€
� Appearing at a west London press conference by videolink from the Ecuadorian embassy , where he has remained since seeking asylum in 2012 , Assange said that if Sweden and the UK continued to dispute the report , â€œthe diplomatic effect is that it will become difficult for [ the two countries ] to be treated seriously as international playersâ€ � .
Lord Macdonald QC , the former Director of Public Prosecutions , condemned the UN panel report as misguided , writes Owen Bowcott .
He told The Guardian : â€œThis report is beyond parody .
Julian Assange is wanted in connection with a grave sexual offence in a country that has a fair trial justice system consistent with the highest international standards .
Instead of cooperating with the Swedish authorities , as he should have done , Mr Assange has chosen to hole up in a foreign embassy , deliberately frustrating a serious criminal investigation .
â€œTo describe his situation as â€˜arbitrary
detentionâ€ ™ is ludicrous .
Rather than expecting Swedish prosecutors to visit him at his leisure in his hiding place , Mr Assange should recognise that he is not above the law , give himself up and answer the allegations he faces .
The United Nations Panel on Arbitrary Detention has embarrassed itself and all those concerned about real injustices in the world .
Back at the Frontline club , where the press conference is still going on , Melinda Taylor confirms that Assange wonâ€ ™ t be walking out of the Ecuadorian embassy .
â€œMr Assange will not be walking out because of a risk [ of being extradited ] to the United States .
It is a risk that hasnâ€ ™ t been addressed by Sweden and the United Kingdom , â€ �
she said .
Jessica Elgot has more from the Assange supporters gathering at the Ecuadorian embassy : The WikiLeaks supporters who have kept vigil for Julian Assange since he arrived at the Embassy are a close bunch , with many arriving at midday for moral support as Assange prepared to address the Frontline club via video link .
Homemade posters have been put up on the White iron bars at the front of the embassy and on the railings of the flats facing it .
Addressing the press pack through a megaphone , former Spanish teacher Elsa Collins said the UK government was detaining Assange illegally .
â€œThe UK government is breaking international law , they try to say they abide by United Nations but they do not .
He has been deprived of all human rights .
UK and Sweden must be held accountable .
This is not a democracy if they arrest Julian Assange .
We demand our governments obey international law.â€ � Andrew Sparrow has more on Downing Street condemnation of the UN panelâ€ ™ s finding .
A spokesman for the prime minister said : â€œItâ€ ™ s ridiculous .
Thereâ€ ™ s an arrest warrant out for [ Assange ] .
He has never been arbitrarily detained in this country .
It is entirely his choice to remain in the Ecuadorian embassy and he is avoiding lawful arrest by choosing to remain there.â€ �
The spokesman also said that the people on the UN panel were lay people rather than lawyers , and that every time Assange had challenged the legal process in court , in every legal jurisdiction , he had lost .
The Swedish has issued an arrest warrant for Assange in connection with some very serious offences , the spokesman went on , and Britain would put that warrant into effect if it could .
â€œUltimately it is a question for Mr Assange why has has chosen to detain himself in this way , â€ � the spokesman said .
Hereâ€ ™ s a summary of where things stand : A UN panel has found that WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange has been arbitrarily detained by the UK and Sweden for more than five years and should be released immediately with compensation .
The panel calls on the Swedish and British authorities to end Assangeâ€ ™ s â€œdeprivation of libertyâ€ � , respect his physical integrity and freedom of movement and offer him compensation .

He said it was â€œvery unusualâ€ � for such a panel ruling not to be unanimous .
The first writeups of Assangeâ€ ™ s statement are coming in .
The first take of the Press Assoication picks up on his criticism of the British foreign secretary , Philip Hammond : WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange remained inside the Ecuadorian Embassy today , launching an attack against the Government for its â€œinsultingâ€ � response to a UN working group report on his detention .
Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond branded the working groupâ€ ™ s findings on the â€œarbitrary detentionâ€ � of Mr Assange as â€œfrankly ridiculousâ€ � and said the Australian was â€œhiding from justiceâ€ � .
He spoke out after the UN panel had ruled Mr Assange was being â€œarbitrarily detainedâ€ � in the Ecuadorian embassy in London - and called for him to be paid compensation .
The UN Working Group on Arbitrary Detention said the Swedish and British authorities should end Mr Assangeâ€ ™ s â€œdeprivation of libertyâ€ � and respect his physical integrity and freedom of movement .
Mr Assange spoke via Skype to a press conference in London , saying the UN report had brought a smile to his face , and insisting his detention had now been formally ruled as unlawful .
He said comments by Mr Hammond were â€œbeneathâ€ �
the ministerâ€ ™ s stature and insulting to the UN .
Meanwhile , the Associated Press highlighted Assangeâ€ ™ s assessment of the UN panelâ€ ™ s decision : Julian Assange says a U.N. panelâ€ ™ s finding that he has been arbitrarily detained is a â€œvindication.â€ � The WikiLeaks founder says it is â€œnow a matter of settled lawâ€ � that he has been wrongly detained .
Assange spoke to journalists by video from the London embassy of Ecuador , where he has been holed up for 3Â½ years to avoid extradition to Sweden for questioning about alleged sexual offenses .
Assange said Britain and Sweden can not appeal the panelâ€ ™ s finding , but Britain has already indicated it will challenge .
Hereâ€ ™ s audio of the full 10 minute response from Assange .
Hereâ€ ™ s a video clip of Assangeâ€ ™ s response .
Assange closed by saying : I would like to say thank you , that I miss my family .
That we have today a really significant victory that has brought a smile to my face
and I hope many others as well .
Assange thanked the UN for â€œproducing this verdictâ€ � .
He said it would help his case for freedom but was also an important ruling generally on arbitrary detention .
Assange thanks his lawyers .
Assange said that if the UK and Sweden continued to undermine the panelâ€ ™ s finding they would be hit diplomatically .
â€œWe have now a victory , and decided law on this case , â€ � he said .
Assange insisted the panelâ€ ™ s findings were legally binding .
The panel was a higher body than national law , he said .
Assange also described Philip Hammondâ€ ™ s comments as insulting and beneath a foreign secretary .
He said Hammondâ€ ™ s claim that the finding was ridiculous was just for â€œdomestic consumptionâ€ � .
Assange claimed there was no appeal against the panelâ€ ™ s decision ; it was a matter of â€œsettled lawâ€ � .
Earlier the UN said Sweden and the UK had two months to contest the findings .
But Assange said : â€œThe time for appeal is over.â€ � Assange appears via videolink : â€œToday that detention without charge has been found to be unlawful .
I consider the outcome a vindication.â€ �
Taylor says the panel recommendation of compensation for Assange highlights that he has become a victim of his whistleblowing .
Taylor says that the indefinite detention of Assange is a form of â€œmental tortureâ€ � .
Melinda Taylor says the finding affirms that Assange has been a victim of a miscarriage of justice .
â€œHe has been detained for five years , one month and 29 days , â€ �
she says .
â€œIf you have no effective freedom , then you are detained ... yet Sweden and the UK refused to acknowledge that , â€ � she added .
Lawyer Jennifer Robinson described the finding as â€œresounding victory for Mr Assangeâ€ � .
The Frontline club press conference is about to get under way .
Assange supporters are sitting in front of a big screen where the Wikileaks founder is expected to appear via Skype .
John Jones QC , Melinda Taylor , Jennifer Robinson and Baltasar Garzon will give presentations before Assange is due to appear .
Downing Street has echoed Hammondâ€ ™ s line on the panelâ€ ™ s finding .
David Cameronâ€ ™ s spokesman said : â€œItâ€ ™ s ridiculous .
Thereâ€ ™ s a European arrest warrant out for him .
He has never been arbitrarily detained in this country .
â€œItâ€ ™ s entirely his choice to remain in the Ecuadorian embassy and he is avoiding lawful arrest by choosing to remain there.â€ �
The Guardianâ€ ™ s Esther Addley is in prime position for the Assange press conference at the Frontline club .
Hereâ€ ™ s footage of the foreign secretary , Philip Hammond , describing the finding as â€œflawed in lawâ€ � and â€œfrankly ridiculousâ€ � .
Ecuadorâ€ ™ s foreign minister , Ricardo PatiÃ±o , says his government will give its response at 7 am local time ( midday UK time ) .
The respected international lawyer , Philippe Sands , doesnâ€ ™ t think much of the panelâ€ ™ s finding .
Neither does the legal commentator Joshua Rozenberg .
The Daily Mash pokes fun at the panelâ€ ™ s finding .
A Man who has been waiting for his Argos purchase for more than 15 minutes is being detained in violation of his human rights , the UN has ruled .
Tom Logan was given his ticket for a Nespresso coffee machine at 9.46am , but is still confined within the store at 10.02am with no end to his ordeal in sight .
Variations on the same gag abound .
Jessica Elgot reports live from the press scrum at the Ecuadorian embassy : The back streets of luxury apartments behind Harrods department store which look on to the front of the Ecuadorian embassy are once more crammed with the international press , two or three deep back from the kerb .
Reporters are here from the US , Sweden , Australia , Germany and Russia , among others , hoping that Julian Assange may stride out for an impromptu speech from the famous balcony , though there is no indication he will .
A police van moved to the front of the balcony in the last few hours , though police have not regularly been stationed here since the Met downgraded their presence at the embassy last year , with the operation having cost the taxpayer more than Â£12 m .
Among the crowds of photographers , around a dozen Assange supporters have been here throughout the morning .
Jim Curran , a former railway engineer and WikiLeaks supporter , who has visited the embassy almost every day since Assange entered , said at one point the vigil had numbered 150 , but people slowly drifted away .
Curran said he did not expect to see Assange appear today .
â€œMany people wanted to be here , but they have jobs , students are at university , itâ€ ™ s not really surprising , â€ �
he said .
Assangeâ€ ™ s barrister Geoffrey Robertson has urged the UK and Swedish authorities to abide by the panelâ€ ™ s finding .
Speaking to BBC News he said : â€œSweden has acted contrary to international law .
Sweden is bound morally by this judgment so obviously in order to enforce it , Britain should get together with Sweden and find a way out .
And perhaps compensate the Ecuadorians for putting up Julian Assange .
That is the result of Britainâ€ ™ s commitment to international law.â€ �
Philip Hammond also dismissed the panelâ€ ™ s finding as â€œflawed in lawâ€ � .
Hereâ€ ™ s audio of his statement :
The Guardianâ€ ™ s
Jessica Elgot has joined the media scrum outside the Ecuadorian embassy .
A Guardian editorial on the panelâ€ ™ s finding agrees with the Hammondâ€ ™ s assessment .
It says the panelâ€ ™ s opinion is â€œsimply wrongâ€ � :
â€œ[Assange ] is not being detained arbitrarily .
Three - and - a - half years ago , he sought refuge in the Ecuadorian embassy in order to avoid extradition to Sweden to face allegations of sex offences .
He had fought extradition through every court , and at each his case was rejected .
â€œArbitraryâ€ �
detention means that due legal process has not been observed .
It has .
This is a publicity stunt .
It is possible to sympathise with his circumstances , and to applaud his role in the WikiLeaks revelations that exposed embarassing and sometimes illegal US activity that were published in the Guardian ( while deploring his later decision to dump many more , unmediated , on the web ) without accepting his right to evade prosecutorsâ€ ™ questions about the allegation that he committed a serious criminal offence .
He has always argued that it is not the sex offence inquiries that he is avoiding , but extradition from Sweden to the US .
Chelsea Manning , the soldier who originally downloaded the material and leaked it to Mr Assange , is serving a long sentence in military detention .
There are indications that WikiLeaks is in the US justice departmentâ€ ™ s sights : itâ€ ™ s been confirmed that a grand jury is investigating ; no indictment has been made public , but that does not mean there is none .
Equally , the justice department could decide to make a distinction between government employees and military personnel who had a duty to protect classified information , and those who , like Mr Assange , published it .
But WikiLeaks was founded on exposing those who ignored the rule of law .
Surely its editor - in - chief should recognise his duty to see it upheld .
Foreign secretary Philip Hammond has rejected the panelâ€ ™ s opinion as a â€œridiculousâ€ � .
He said : â€œIt is right the he [ Assange ] not be allowed to escape justice .
This is frankly a ridiculous findingâ€ � .
Speaking at a joint press conference with his Iranian counterpart in London , Hammond said Assange was in fact â€œhiding from justiceâ€ � .
On whether the panelâ€ ™ s finding was legally binding Peschoux answer was also nuanced .
He said : â€œThe working group is issuing an opinion , because it is working group it is not a court , so it is not issuing rulings .
The working group is the highest UN authoritative body to deal with disputes between a person who is in detention and authorities detaining them ...
The opinion is legally binding to the extent that it is based on international human rights norms which have been ratified by states.â€ �
Hereâ€ ™ s audio of that UN press conference in Geneva .
Peschoux opened with the cryptic statement : â€œThe panel has decided that the detention [ of Assange ] maybe legal but it is arbitrary.â€ �
Baffled reporters were told to look at the details of the opinion to understand what that meant .
Peschoux said it was â€œvery unusualâ€ � for such a panel ruling not to be unanimous .
He said they were usually based on consensus .
Three of the five member panel supported the ruling .
One member dissented , an Australian member of the panel absented herself as she shares Assangeâ€ ™ s nationality .
Peschoux said the UK and Sweden had two months to contest the panelâ€ ™ s 3 to 1 ruling .
Christophe Peschoux , a senior official at the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights , insists that the panelâ€ ™ s finding is in effect legally binding because its based on international human rights law .
Speaking in Geneva he said it was up to Britain and Sweden to decide on what level of compensation Assange should be offered .
The former chair of the UNWGAD panel , the Norwegian lawyer Professor Mads Andenas , told Owen Bowcott that the expert lawyers and members of the group had come under considerable political pressure from the US and UK when compiling the highly critical report .
Andenas completed his term in office last summer but was involved in earlier stages of compiling the report on Assangeâ€ ™ s arbitrary detention .
He endorsed the broad result of the findings released on Friday .
â€œIâ€ ™ m absolutely convinced that [ the panel ] has been put under very string political pressure , â€ � he said .
â€œThis is a courageous decision which is important for the international rule of law .
â€œThis is a clear , and for people who read it , an obvious , decision .
Itâ€ ™ s an outcome of a judicial process in which Sweden and the UK have taken part .
It was before a specialist body at the UN , the only UN body dealing with arbitrary detention.â€ �
There was a clear finding under Article Nine of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights that Assange is subject to arbitrary detention , he explained .
â€œIf this finding had been made against any other country with a human rights record that one does not wish to compare oneself with , then these states [ Sweden and UK ] would have made it clear that the [ offending ] country should comply with the ruling of the working group .
Itâ€ ™ s not a good thing for any country to get a ruling for arbitrary detention against it .
â€œFor the international human rights system to function , states must abide by the rulings .
Thereâ€ ™ s no other way to deal with it .
If the state is in violation of international law , itâ€ ™ s for the state to find ways to give effect to the [ panelâ€ ™ s ]
decision.â€ � Swedenâ€ ™ s
ministry for foreign affairs has released a three - page letter rejecting the panelâ€ ™ s findings .
It seized on the dissenting opinion from one of the panelâ€ ™ s five members .
Here are the key passages : In its opinion , the Working Group considers that the current situation of Mr. Assange , staying within the confines of the Embassy of the Republic of Ecuador in the United Kingdom , has become a state of an arbitrary deprivation of liberty in contravention of international human rights obligations .
To begin with , the Government notes that one of the five members of the Working Group has expressed an individual dissenting opinion , arguing that Mr. Assange fled the bail in June 2012 and since then stays at the premises of the Ecuadorian Embassy using them as a safe haven to evade arrest .
According to the dissent , such premises of self - confinement can not be considered as places of detention for the purposes of the mandate of the Working Group .
In addition , it is contended that the Working Group is not competent to consider situations that do not involve deprivation of liberty and that issues related to fugitivesâ€ ™ self - confimement , such as asylum and extradition , do not fall into the mandate of the Working Group .
The Government does not agree with the assessment made by the majority of the Working Group .
As elaborated in the Swedish Governmentâ€ ™ s communication to the Working Group , the main reasons for this are the following .
In light of the safeguards contained in the Swedish extradition and EAW procedures against any potential extradition in violation of international human rights agreements , the Government reiterates its position that Mr. Assange does not face a risk of refoulement contrary to international human rights obligations to the United States from Sweden .
In any case , no request for extradition regarding Mr. Assange has been directed to Sweden .
Moreover , Mr. Assange has chosen , voluntarily , to stay at the Ecuadorian Embassy and Swedish authorities have no control over his decision to stay there .
Mr. Assange is free to leave the Embassy at any point .
Thus , he is not being deprived of his liberty there due to any decision or action taken by the Swedish authorities .
The Government therefore refutes the opinion by the Working Group that Sweden has violated articles 9 and 10 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and articles 7 , 9(1 ) , 9(3 ) , 9(4 ) , 10 and 14 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights .
Furthermore , in Sweden any decision regarding the preliminary investigation , for example regarding detention in absentia , is taken by independent judicial authorities .
The Swedish Government may therefore not interfere in an ongoing case handled by a Swedish public authority .
This follows from the Swedish Instrument of Government and basic principles of the rule of law .
The Swedish Office of the Prosecutor and the courts are thus independent and separated from the Government .
As to the request by the Working Group that the Government of Sweden and the Government of the United Kingdom assess the situation of Mr. Assange ( para . 100 of the opinion ) , it should be emphasised that regular contacts between the two countries take place , primarily in order to facilitate the preliminary investigation by the Swedish Office of the Prosecutor .
It should also be pointed out that an agreement on mutual legal assistance in criminal matters between Ecuador and Sweden entered into force on 22 December 2015 .
It may finally be noted that the Government has transmitted the opinion of the Working Group to the Office of the Prosecutor and relevant courts , for their information .
Former British diplomat Craig Murray points out that Sweden and the UK are in dodgy company by challenging the UN panel .
In a blogpost he writes : Julian Assange has never been charged with any offence .
His detention has been unlawful since his very first arrest in the United Kingdom in 2010 .
There has never been any genuine attempt by the Swedish authorities to investigate the allegations against him .
Those are the findings of the United Nations .
The UK and Swedish governments both participated fully , and at great expense to their taxpayers , in this UN process which is a mechanism that both recognise .
States including Iran , Burma and Russia have released prisoners following determination by this UN panel , which consists not of politicians or diplomats but of some of the worldâ€ ™ s most respected lawyers , who are not representing their national governments .
Countries who have ignored rulings by this UN panel are rare .
No democracy has ever done so .
Recent examples are Egypt and Uzbekistan .
The UK is putting itself in pretty company .
It would be an act of extraordinary dereliction by the UK and Swedish governments to accept the authority of the tribunal , participate fully in the process , and then refuse to accept the outcome .
The UN is about to give a press briefing in Geneva on the panelâ€ ™ s findings .
You can follow it here ...
The Guardian legal affairs legal editor , Owen Bowcott has been going through the panelâ€ ™ s full report .
He points out that much of the criticism in it is directed at the methods adopted by the Swedish prosecutors .
The report states : â€œThere has been a substantial failure to exercise due diligence on the part of the concerned states ( Sweden and UK ) with regard to the performance of the criminal administration ....
After more than five yearsâ€ ™ of time lapse , [ Assange ] is still left even before the stage of preliminary investigation with no predictability as to whether and when a formal process of any judicial dealing would commence .
â€œDespite that it is left to the initial choice of the Swedish prosecution as to what mode of investigation would best suit the purpose of criminal justice , the exercise and implementation of the investigation method should be conducted in compliance with the rule of proportionality , including undertaking to explore alternative ways of administering justicâ€ � .
The dissenting panel member was the Ukrainian lawyer Vladimir Tochilovsky .
The UNâ€ ™ s high commission for human rights insists that the panelâ€ ™ s ruling is â€œlegally bindingâ€ � .
It put out this press release explaining the panelâ€ ™ s ruling .
WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange has been arbitrarily detained by Sweden and the United Kingdom since his arrest in London on 7 December 2010 , as a result of the legal action against him by both Governments , the United Nations Working Group on Arbitrary Detention said today .
In a public statement , the expert panel called on the Swedish and British authorities to end Mr. Assangeâ€ ™ s deprivation of liberty , respect his physical integrity and freedom of movement , and afford him the right to compensation Mr. Assange , detained first in prison then under house arrest , took refuge in Ecuadorâ€ ™ s
London embassy in 2012 after losing his appeal to the UKâ€ ™ s Supreme Court against extradition to Sweden , where a judicial investigation was initiated against him in connection with allegations of sexual misconduct .
However , he was not formally charged .
â€œThe Working Group on Arbitrary Detention considers that the various forms of deprivation of liberty to which Julian Assange has been subjected constitute a form of arbitrary detention , â€ � said Seong - Phil Hong , who currently heads the expert panel .
â€œThe Working Group maintains that the arbitrary detention of Mr. Assange should be brought to an end , that his physical integrity and freedom of movement be respected , and that he should be entitled to an enforceable right to compensation
, â€ � Mr. Hong added .
In its official Opinion , the Working Group considered that Mr. Assange had been subjected to different forms of deprivation of liberty : initial detention in Wandsworth Prison in London , followed by house arrest and then confinement at the Ecuadorean Embassy .
The experts also found that the detention was arbitrary because Mr. Assange was held in isolation at Wandsworth Prison , and because a lack of diligence by the Swedish Prosecutorâ€ ™ s Office in its investigations resulted in his lengthy loss of liberty .
The Working Group established that this detention violates Articles 9 and 10 of the Universal Declaration on Human Rights , and Articles 7 , 9(1 ) , 9(3 ) , 9(4 ) , 10 and 14 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights .
The Opinions of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention are legally - binding to the extent that they are based on binding international human rights law , such as the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights ( ICCPR ) .
The Swedish governemnt has also rejected the panelâ€ ™ s finding .
In a statement posted by BuzzFeedâ€ ™ s James Ball , it said : â€œMr Assange has chosen , voluntarily , to stay at the Ecuadorian Embassy and Swedish authorities have not control over his decision to stay there .
Mr Assange is free to leave the Embassy at at any point .
Thus , he is not being deprived of his liberty due to any decision or action taken by the Swedish authorities .
The government there refutes the opinion of the working group.â€ �
The UK government has confirmed that it will formally contest the opinion of the UN panel .
In a statement the Foreign Office said : â€œThis changes nothing .
We completely reject any claim that Julian Assange is a victim of arbitrary detention .
The UK has already made clear to the UN that we will formally contest the working groupâ€ ™ s opinion .
â€œJulian Assange has never been arbitrarily detained by the UK .
The opinion of the UN Working Group ignores the facts and the well - recognised protections of the British legal system .
He is , in fact , voluntarily avoiding lawful arrest by choosing to remain in the Ecuadorean embassy .
An allegation of rape is still outstanding and a European Arrest Warrant in place , so the UK continues to have a legal obligation to extradite him to Sweden .
As the UK is not a party to the Caracas Convention , we do not recognise â€˜diplomatic asylumâ€ ™ .
â€œWe are deeply frustrated that this unacceptable situation is still being allowed to continue .
Ecuador must engage with Sweden in good faith to bring it to an end .
Americas Minister Hugo Swire made this clear to the Ecuadorean Ambassador in November , and we continue to raise the matter in Quito.â€ � James Ball , a former Wikileaks and Guardian staffer now at Buzzfeed , claims that the panel essentially ruled that Assangeâ€ ™ s detention was â€œarbitraryâ€ � because of the time taken over his extradition case .
Free speech campaigners have been quick to welcome the UN panelâ€ ™ s finding .
Anthony D. Romero , executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union , said : â€œIn light of this decision , itâ€ ™ s clear that any criminal charges against Mr. Assange in connection with Wikileaksâ€ ™ publishing operations would be unprecedented and unconstitutional .
Indeed , even the prolonged criminal investigation of Wikileaks itself has had a profound chilling effect .
The Justice Department should end that investigation and make clear that no publisher will ever be prosecuted for the act of journalism.â€ �
In its statement , the committee said that one of its members , Leigh Toomey , an Australian , had declined to take part in the inquiry because she is an Australian citizen , Owen Bowcott points out One of the other members had disagreed with the finding .
The statement said : â€œGiven that Mr. Assange is an Australian citizen , one of the members of the Working Group who shares his nationality recused herself from participating in the deliberations .
Another member of the Working Group disagreed with the position of the majority and considered that the situation of Mr. Assange is not one of detention and therefore falls outside the mandate of the Working Group.â€ �
Only three of the five member panel therefore supported the finding against the UK and Sweden .
Assange is due to give a press conference at noon to respond to the panelâ€ ™ s findings .
The Guardianâ€ ™ s legal affairs editor Owen Bowcott points out that the UNWGAD findings have no binding impact on UK law and can not overrule the court - sanctioned procedure for removing Assange , under a European arrest warrant , to face justice in Scandinavia .
But in a Facebook video the UNâ€ ™ s Christophe Peschoux argues that the panels decisions are â€œindirectly but still legally binding on the relevant authoritiesâ€ � .
Welcome to live coverage of the aftermath of a UN panelâ€ ™ s call on the Swedish and British authorities to end Julian Assangeâ€ ™ s â€œdeprivation of libertyâ€ � .
Hereâ€ ™ s the full text of a statement by the UNâ€ ™ s working group on arbitrary detention .
On 4 December 2015 , the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention ( WGAD ) adopted Opinion No . 54/2015 , in which it considered that Mr. Julian Assange was arbitrarily detained by the Governments of Sweden and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland .
In that opinion , the Working Group recognized that Mr. Assange is entitled to his freedom of movement and to compensation .
The application was filed with the Working Group in September 2014 .
The Opinion 54/2015 was sent to the Governments of Sweden and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland on 22 January 2016 in accordance with the Working Groupâ€ ™ s Methods of Work .
Given that Mr. Assange is an Australian citizen , one of the members of the Working Group who shares his nationality recused herself from participating in the deliberations .
Another member of the Working Group disagreed with the position of the majority and considered that the situation of Mr. Assange is not one of detention and therefore falls outside the mandate of the Working Group .
In mid-2010 , a Swedish Prosecutor commenced an investigation against Mr. Assange based on allegations of sexual misconduct .
On 7 December 2010 , pursuant to an international arrest warrant issued at the request of the Swedish Prosecutor , Mr. Assange was detained in Wandsworth Prison for 10 days in isolation .
Thereafter , he was subjected to house arrest for 550 days .
While under house arrest in the United Kingdom , Mr. Assange requested the Republic of Ecuador to grant him refugee status at its Embassy in London .
The Republic of Ecuador granted asylum because of Mr. Assangeâ€
™ s fear that if he was extradited to Sweden , he would be further extradited to the United States where he would face serious criminal charges for the peaceful exercise of his freedoms .
Since August 2012 , Mr. Assange has not been able to leave the Ecuadorian Embassy and is subject to extensive surveillance by the British police .
The Working Group considered that Mr. Assange has been subjected to different forms of deprivation of liberty : initial detention in Wandsworth prison which was followed by house arrest and his confinement at the Ecuadorian Embassy .
Having concluded that there was a continuous deprivation of liberty , the Working Group also found that the detention was arbitrary because he was held in isolation during the first stage of detention and because of the lack of diligence by the Swedish Prosecutor in its investigations , which resulted in the lengthy detention of Mr. Assange .
The Working Group found that this detention is in violation of Articles 9 and 10 of the UDHR and Articles 7 , 9(1 ) , 9(3 ) , 9(4 ) , 10 and 14 of the ICCPR , and falls within category III as defined in its Methods of Work .
The Working Group therefore requested Sweden and the United Kingdom to assess the situation of Mr. Assange to ensure his safety and physical integrity , to facilitate the exercise of his right to freedom of movement in an expedient manner , and to ensure the full enjoyment of his rights guaranteed by the international norms on detention .
The Working Group also considered that the detention should be brought to an end and that Mr. Assange should be afforded the right to compensation .
Assange is expected to demand that Sweden and the UK lift any threat of arrest to allow him to walk free from Ecuadorâ€ ™ s embassy in London .
Assange has not set foot outside the cramped west London embassy building since June 2012 , when he sought asylum from Ecuador in an attempt to avoid extradition to Sweden .
The Australian is wanted for questioning over an allegation of rape dating to 2010 , which he denies .
Christophe Peschoux from the UN said the panelâ€ ™ s decisions were legally binding ."
2016-02-05,"It must be appalling to find yourself subjected to arbitrary detention .
You would have no power to challenge said detention .
You would have no idea when , if ever , you would be set free .
And that concept is reflected in the first of five definitions offered by the UN working group on arbitrary detention : â€œwhen it is clearly impossible to invoke any legal basis justifying the deprivation of libertyâ€ � .
But that was not the reason they gave for their opinion that Julian Assange has been arbitrarily detained in the Ecuadorian embassy .
His detention fell foul of their third definition ; when â€œnon - observance ... of the international norms relating to the right to a fair trial ... is of such gravity as to give the detention an arbitrary characterâ€ � .
That opinion was backed by three of the five members of the working group .
A fourth felt she could not take part because she , like Assange , is an Australian .
So it fell to the fifth member of the group , Vladimir Tochilovsky , to point out the flaw in the majorityâ€ ™ s reasoning .
They had assumed that Assange had been â€œdetained in the embassy of Ecuador by the authorities of the United Kingdom , â€ � the Ukrainian lawyer wrote .
In fact , the Wikileaks founder had fled bail in June 2012 and used the embassy â€œas a safe haven to evade arrestâ€ � .
Fugitives often do that , Tochilovsky pointed out .
But â€œpremises of self - confinement can not be considered places of detention for the purposes of the mandate of the working groupâ€
� .
That is so self - evidently true that it seems hard to believe the majority could have been persuaded otherwise .
Assange has always been free to leave the embassy at any time .
Of course , he knew he would be arrested for breach of his bail conditions .
Of course , he knew he would face extradition to Sweden .
Of course , he knew that he might face extradition to the United States once proceedings in Sweden were at an end .
But that does not mean he was detained , and still less that his detention was of an arbitrary character .
How , then , did the majority of the working party get it so wrong ?
First , they said he had been detained in prison for 10 days in 2010 â€œat the very beginning of the episode that lasted longer than five yearsâ€ � .
They claimed â€œthe arbitrariness is inherent in this form of deprivation of libertyâ€ � .
This is palpably absurd .
Assange was detained pending possible extradition .
If his detention had been arbitrary he could not have challenged it , and been released on bail .
But that not was what happened .
The three - and - a - half years he has spent as a fugitive from justice can not affect the lawfulness of his original imprisonment .
According to the working group , his 10 days in prison was followed by 550 days of house arrest .
He suffered â€œharsh restrictionsâ€ � , including tagging and restrictions on staying out overnight .
Harsh restrictions ?
And then we get to the fatal flaw .
The working group considers that Assangeâ€ ™ s stay at the embassy â€œshould be considered as a prolongation of the already continued deprivation of libertyâ€ � .
Its members provides no justification for this leap of logic .
Assangeâ€
™ s argument is that he was granted â€œdiplomaticâ€ � immunity by Ecuador .
But the UK does not recognise the notion that a state can merely designate as a diplomat anyone , of whatever nationality , and they are then exempt from the general law .
Fortunately , the working group does not seem to have been taken in by this notion .
Instead , the majority base their opinion on the length of time that has passed , as if to say that a fugitive is entitled to avoid justice by merely hiding away for a few years .
If Assange is extradited to Sweden and charged with rape , there is no reason why he should not receive a fair trial .
Any disadvantage he may suffer through the delay is entirely down to him .
He has not been subjected to arbitrary detention .
The idea that he should receive compensation for hiding himself away in Knightsbridge â€ “ as the working group says â€ “ simply heaps offensiveness on absurdity ."
2016-02-05,"The declaration of the UN working group on arbitrary detention that WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange is being detained arbitrarily finds no support from the British press .
The Times , the Guardian , Daily Telegraph , Daily Mirror and the Sun carried leading articles on Friday all gave the decision short shrift .
Assange , who has spent the best part of four years holed up in Ecuadorâ€ ™ s
London embassy , â€œis not the victim of a cruel British judiciary or a vindictive Swedish prosecutor
, â€ � said the Times .
It argued that Assange , in seeking to avoid questioning in connection with an alleged rape in Sweden , has no right to claim political asylum .
The UN body had â€œnaively swallowed Mr Assangeâ€ ™ s cock - and - bull version of his voluntary withdrawal from the worldâ€ � , said the Times , going on to criticise the UNâ€ ™ s human rights record .
The Telegraph through the UN had been â€œhijacked by the Julian Assange circusâ€
� and , in so doing , had placed Britain â€œin the same bracket as Saudi Arabia , Burma and Egypt for adopting a cavalier approach to incarceration.â€ �
It believed Assangeâ€ ™ s supporters , who â€œwould normally insist that any allegation of sexual assault should be thoroughly investigated , â€œsubscribe to the fanciful notion that Mr Assange is effectively a prisoner of conscience escaping the proxy clutches of the Americans , who want to pursue him for leaking their state secrets.â€ �
The Guardian contended that it â€œis simply wrongâ€ � to say that Assange is being detained arbitrarily and viewed the manâ€ ™ s latest manoeuvre as â€œa publicity stunt.â€ � Assange will hope that the UNâ€ ™ s findings will allow him to claim some kind of moral victory , and strengthen his call that the Swedish authorities drop their investigations , said the paper , but he would still face arrest in the UK for breaking his bail conditions .
Conscious of its part in publishing the Wikileak revelations , the paper said it was possible to applaud Assangeâ€ ™ s role in the exposure of embarrassing and sometimes illegal US activity ,
â€œwithout accepting his right to evade prosecutorsâ€ ™ questions about the allegation that he committed a serious criminal offence.â€ �
It concluded : â€œWikiLeaks was founded on exposing those who ignored the rule of law .
Surely its editor - in - chief should recognise his duty to see it upheld.â€
�
The Mirror thought the UN had â€œlost the plotâ€ � in perversely deciding that Assange had been unlawfully detained .
It â€œdoes itself a disservice with this ridiculous finding , â€ � said the paper , arguing that Assange â€œshould still go to Sweden.â€
�
The Sun called Assange â€œa cowardly egomaniacâ€ � and â€œsnivelling creepâ€ � while urging the government to treat the UN decision with contempt .
It continued : â€œOnly leftie conspiracy loons believe the Swedes are chasing him on behalf of the US .
In 2020 , the rape claims expire .
Long before then , we hope , the deteriorating health he has brought on himself will smoke him out of his dingy hidey - hole.â€ �
As for the Daily Mail , it made its view known through its news report headline : â€œNow meddling UN says Britain has â€˜held Assange illegallyâ€ ™ â€ � .
Cartoonists in both the Times and the Mail , Peter Brookes and Mac respectively , came up with the same joke by imagining that Lord Lucan was also hiding in the Ecuadorian embassy ."
2016-02-05,"Julian Assange has accused Britainâ€ ™ s foreign secretary , Philip Hammond , of insulting the United Nations in his response to a panel finding that Assangeâ€ ™ s circumstances amount to â€œarbitrary detentionâ€ � .
Hammond called the panelâ€ ™ s finding â€œridiculousâ€ � and said the WikiLeaks founder was a â€œfugitive from justiceâ€ � .
Assange , who fled to the Ecquadorian embassy in 2012 to avoid extradition to Sweden to face allegations of rape and sexual assault , said the remarks were â€œbeneath the stature that a foreign minister should express in this situationâ€ � .
Assange said the panelâ€ ™ s finding was a â€œsweetâ€ � victory and added : â€œThis is the end of the road for the legal arguments that have been put forward by Sweden and the UK.â€ �
As anticipated , the finding by the Geneva - based UN panel criticised legal action against Assange by the UK and Sweden and blamed them for preventing him from leaving the Ecuadorian embassy in Knightsbridge .
The panel called on the Swedish and British authorities to end Assangeâ€ ™ s â€œdeprivation of libertyâ€ � , respect his physical integrity and freedom of movement and offer him compensation .
The report said : â€œThe working group considered that Mr Assange has been subjected to different forms of deprivation of liberty : initial detention in Wandsworth prison , which was followed by house arrest and his confinement at the Ecuadorian embassy .
â€œHaving concluded that there was a continuous deprivation of liberty , the working group also found that the detention was arbitrary because he was held in isolation during the first stage of detention and because of the lack of diligence by the Swedish prosecutor in its investigations , which resulted in the lengthy detention of Mr Assange.â€ � Appearing at a west London press conference by videolink from the Ecuadorian embassy , where he has remained since seeking asylum in 2012 , Assange said that if Sweden and the UK continued to dispute the report , â€œthe diplomatic effect is that it will become difficult for [ the two countries ] to be treated seriously as international playersâ€ � .
He said they could become subject to penalties â€œup to and including sanctionsâ€ � , though that would be a matter for the UN .
Later , Assange appeared on the balcony of the Ecuadorian embassy clutching a copy of the UN report .
â€œHow sweet it is .
This is a victory that can not be denied .
It is a victory of historical importance for me , my family , my children and for the independence of the UN system.â€ � Assange declared he was â€œtoughâ€
� enough to withstand longer confinement in the Ecuadorian embassy , but demanded the UK and Sweden heed the UNâ€ ™ s opinion that he is arbitrarily detained .
Assange said his legal team would now examine if there were â€œcriminal consequencesâ€ � for the parties who he said continue to deny him his freedom , citing the UN Convention Against Torture .
At one point during his 12-minute appearance , as he was being heckled from the street , he said : â€œCan someone close that person up?â€ � Baltasar GarzÃ³n , a Spanish judge who heads Assangeâ€ ™ s international legal team , said the arrest warrant against his client was now â€œempty and voidâ€ � .
GarzÃ³n , who came to prominence in 1998 when he issued an arrest warrant for Chileâ€ ™ s former president Augusto Pinochet , said any continuation of Assangeâ€ ™ s confinement â€œbecomes a form of tortureâ€ � .
Speaking at a joint press conference with his Iranian counterpart in London , Hammond forcefully rejected the findings of the UN panel .
â€œThis is frankly a ridiculous finding by the working group and we reject it.â€ �
He pointed out that the panel was made up of lay people , not lawyers .
The British government added in a statement : â€œThis changes nothing .
We completely reject any claim that Julian Assange is a victim of arbitrary detention .
The UK has already made clear to the UN that we will formally contest the working groupâ€ ™ s opinion.â€ �
It said Assange was â€œvoluntarily avoiding lawful arrestâ€ � by remaining in the Ecuadorian embassy .
The UN committee said one of its members , Leigh Toomey , had declined to take part in the inquiry because she , like Assange , is an Australian citizen .
One of the other members , Vladimir Tochilovsky , a Ukrainian lawyer , had disagreed with the finding .
Only three of the five - member panel therefore supported the finding against the UK and Sweden .
Ken Macdonald QC , a former director of public prosecutions in the UK , condemned the UN panel report as misguided .
He told the Guardian : â€œThis report is beyond parody .
Julian Assange is wanted in connection with a grave sexual offence in a country that has a fair trial justice system consistent with the highest international standards .
Instead of cooperating with the Swedish authorities , as he should have done , Mr Assange has chosen to hole up in a foreign embassy , deliberately frustrating a serious criminal investigation .
â€œTo describe his situation as â€˜arbitrary
detentionâ€ ™ is ludicrous .
Rather than expecting Swedish prosecutors to visit him at his leisure in his hiding place , Mr Assange should recognise that he is not above the law , give himself up and answer the allegations he faces .
The United Nations panel on arbitrary detention has embarrassed itself and all those concerned about real injustices in the world.â€ �
The Swedish foreign ministry said : â€œThe [ Swedish ] government does not agree with the assessment made by the majority of the working group .
In light of the safeguards contained in the Swedish extradition and [ European arrest warrant ] procedures against any potential extradition in violation of international human rights agreements , the government reiterates its position that Mr Assange does not face a risk of refoulement [ removal ] contrary to international human rights obligations to the United States from Sweden .
â€œIn any case , no request for extradition regarding Mr Assange has been directed to Sweden .
Moreover , Mr Assange has chosen , voluntarily , to stay at the Ecuadorian embassy and Swedish authorities have no control over his decision to stay there .
Mr Assange is free to leave the embassy at any point .
Thus , he is not being deprived of his liberty there due to any decision or action taken by the Swedish authorities.â€ � Anthony Romero , executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union , said the UN panelâ€ ™ s findings should force the US government to end its investigations into Assange over the Wikileaks disclosures : â€œIn light of this decision , itâ€ ™ s clear that any criminal charges against Mr Assange in connection with WikiLeaksâ€ ™ publishing operations would be unprecedented and unconstitutional .
â€œIndeed , even the prolonged criminal investigation of WikiLeaks itself has had a profound chilling effect .

2016-02-05,"Julian Assange will demand on Friday that Sweden and the UK lift any threat of arrest to allow him to walk free from Ecuadorâ€ ™ s embassy in London , after a United Nations panel found that his three - and - a - half year confinement at the embassy in London amounted to â€œarbitrary detentionâ€ � .
Swedenâ€ ™ s foreign ministry confirmed on Thursday that the UN panel , which will publish its findings on Friday , had decided in favour of the WikiLeaks founder and found that he was â€œarbitrarily detainedâ€ � .
Assange has not set foot outside the cramped west London embassy building since June 2012 , when he sought asylum from Ecuador in an attempt to avoid extradition to Sweden .
The Australian is wanted for questioning over an allegation of rape dating to 2010 , which he denies .
The findings of the UN working group on arbitrary detention ( UNWGAD ) are not legally binding , but can be used to apply pressure on states in human rights cases .
The British and Swedish governments were informed of the working groupâ€ ™ s conclusion on 22 January .
Both indicated on Thursday that they do not accept its findings .
Anna Ekberg , spokesperson for the Swedish foreign ministry , said : â€œThe UN working group on arbitrary detention has concluded that Mr Assange is arbitrarily detained .
The working groupâ€
™ s
view differs from that of the Swedish authorities .
We will forward a reply to the working group [ on Friday ] .
It will be more clear tomorrow why we reject the working groupâ€ ™ s
conclusions.â€
�
The British foreign office said it would not â€œpre - emptâ€ � the panelâ€ ™ s report but said in a statement : â€œWe have been consistently clear that Mr Assange has never been arbitrarily detained by the UK but is , in fact , voluntarily avoiding lawful arrest by choosing to remain in the Ecuadorian embassy .
â€œAn allegation of rape is still outstanding and a European arrest warrant in place , so the UK continues to have a legal obligation to extradite Mr Assange to Sweden.â€ �
A spokesperson for the Swedish Prosecution Authority said that the countryâ€ ™ s Supreme Court found in May 2015 that Assange â€œshould still be detained in his absenceâ€ � , and that the UNWGAB finding â€œhas no formal impact on the ongoing investigation , according to Swedish lawâ€ � .
Assange issued a statement via Twitter early on Thursday saying that if the five - person panel found against him , he would voluntarily walk out of the embassy and offer himself for immediate arrest , â€œas there is no meaningful prospect of further appealâ€ � .
â€œHowever , should I prevail and the state parties be found to have acted unlawfully , I expect the immediate return of my passport and the termination of further attempts to arrest me.â€
�
He is expected to appear by videolink at a press conference on Friday to call for the threat of arrest and extradition to be lifted .
Assangeâ€ ™ s Swedish lawyer , Per Samuelson , said that if the working group found in his favour , â€œthere is only one solution for Marianne Ny [ the Swedish prosecutor seeking Assangeâ€ ™ s extradition ] , and that is to immediately release him and drop the caseâ€ � .
Samuelson added : â€œIf he is regarded as detained , that means he has served his time , so I see no other option for Sweden but to close the case.â€
�
Assangeâ€ ™ s lawyers also want assurances from the UK that , even if the Swedish prosecution were to be dropped , he would not be arrested and subject to a second extradition to the US .
Assange and WikiLeaks have been the subject of a secret grand jury investigation in Virginia that has been looking into whether to prosecute them over the whistleblowing websiteâ€ ™ s US cable disclosures .
Melinda Taylor , a legal spokeswoman for Assange , said they had â€œevery reason to believeâ€
� that the US would seek Assangeâ€ ™ s extradition .
â€œIf one of the orders is that he should be released and his liberty should be assured , we would obviously look to the UK to make sure that it is effective and not illusory
â€ “ that itâ€ ™ s not just liberty for five seconds , but liberty that is meaningful.â€

In the past , the UNWGAD has highlighted the plight of significant international figures , including the formerly imprisoned Myanmar politician Aung San Suu Kyi .
The UN panel declined to take a view on the detention of Saddam Hussein in Iraq by the US forces in 2006 but eventually said that his former minister , Tariq Aziz , was being arbitrarily detained .
In 2008 , an UNWGAD report declared that Mustafa Abdi , a Somalian convicted rapist who was held in immigration custody in the UK for several years after the end of his sentence had been subject to arbitrary detention .
The European court of human rights subsequently agreed and awarded Abdi compensation .
Mark Ellis , executive director of the London - based International Bar Association , said a finding by the UN panel in Assangeâ€ ™ s favour â€œwould seem to contradict a fairly extensive legal process both in the UK and in Swedenâ€ � .
Ellis added :
â€œItâ€ ™ s important to maintain adherence to rule of law principles and ensure that individuals have to abide by legal rulings .
Itâ€ ™ s surprising to think that Assange could be exempted from those principles .
The ruling by the UN panel is not binding on British law .
â€œIt would , however , provide Assange with support for his claim that he should not be extradited .
Iâ€ ™ m sure the UK is trying to figure a way out .
It would be difficult for me to think that there should be an exception [ from the European arrest warrant ] for this case.â€ �"
2016-02-07,"Iâ€ ™ ve never met Julian Assange ; and those Guardian friends who have say Iâ€ ™ ve had a lucky escape .
Heâ€ ™ s clearly a bit of pain to deal with .
( Season with whatever further frailties you wish . )
But the deluge of adjectives and animosity dumped at the embassyâ€ ™ s door after last weekâ€ ™ s UN arbitrary detention decision seems over - ripe , going on rank .
Of course you can roll Swedish allegations and deportation decisions together in best â€œrule of lawâ€ � fashion : but the UN working group took all that into account .
Here on home turf , papers are fighting to protect Freedom of Information from anally retentive bureaucracies .
Information , we say , sets us free .
But who charts the boundaries between what may safely be deemed free and what must be wrenched from the jaws of officialdom ?
The plain fact is that free means really free : and Assange helped set that benchmark .
The UN remembers as much .
It remembers the imperatives of freedom we seem to forget ."
2016-02-10,"Julian Assange should leave the Ecuadorian embassy in London and submit himself to a Swedish arrest warrant over allegations of rape to bring an end to â€œthis
whole sorry
sagaâ€ � , the prime minister has said .
David Cameron dismissed as â€œridiculousâ€ � the findings of a UN panel that the WikiLeaks founder had been subject to arbitrary detention as he said that Assange had in fact detained himself .
â€œWhat he should do is come out of that embassy and face the arrest warrant that is against him , â€ �
Cameron told MPs .
â€œHe is being asked to stand trial in Sweden , a country with a fair reputation for justice and he should bring to an end this whole sorry saga.â€ � The Geneva - based UN working group on arbitrary detention had called on Britain and Sweden to end Assangeâ€ ™ s â€œdeprivation of libertyâ€ � .
The countries last week rejected the findings by the panel , which said that Assange had been arbitrarily detained since his arrest in 2010 and during his stay at the Ecuadorian embassy in the Knightsbridge area of central London , where he sought asylum in June 2012 .
Assange is wanted for questioning over an allegation of rape in 2010 , which he denies .
The prime minister criticised the findings of the UN panel after Victoria Atkins , the Conservative MP for Louth and Horncastle , who is a barrister , asked him about the â€œnonsensical decisionâ€ � in Assangeâ€ ™ s favour and the Â£12 m cost of policing the Ecuadorian embassy .
Atkins asked the prime minister : â€œJulian Assange is accused of rape and is on the run .
Despite this a UN panel nobody has ever heard of declared last week that he has been arbitrarily detained and somehow deserving of compensation .
Does [ the prime minister ] agree with me that this was a nonsensical decision , that Mr Assange should hand himself over to the Swedish prosecutors and that if anyone is deserving of compensation it is the British taxpayer who has had to pay Â£12 m to police his Ecuadorian hideout.â€ �
Cameron said : â€œI think this was a ridiculous decision .
Youâ€ ™ ve got a man here with an outstanding allegation of rape against him .
He barricaded himself into the Ecuadorian embassy and yet claims he was arbitrarily detained .
The only person who detained himself was himself.â€ �
A senior Labour source agreed the Swedish allegation should be investigated .
The source said : â€œI think the UN panel and the governmentâ€ ™ s position is something we havenâ€ ™ t particularly commented on .
The big concern is the amount of money being spent on the standoff .
I donâ€
™ t think anyone disagrees that the Swedish allegation needs to be investigated.â€
� Cameronâ€ ™ s remarks about Assange on Wednesday came after a relatively pedestrian session of prime ministerâ€ ™ s questions in which Jeremy Corbyn challenged him over the housing crisis .
The prime minister delivered his strongest response to Angus Robertson , the SNP leader at Westminster , who warned that the Treasury is prepared to penalise Scotland to the tune of Â£3bn in a proposed new fiscal framework .
As new taxation powers are devolved to Holyrood , a system has to be negotiated for a proportional drop in the Scottish block grant .
Warning that Scotland would be facing a financial calamity on independence day next month had the SNP won the referendum , Cameron told Robertson : â€œNo one is keener on agreement than me .
I want the SNP here and in Holyrood to have to start making decisions .
Which taxes are you going to raise , what are you going to do with benefits ?
I want to get rid of this grievance agenda and let you get on with the governing agenda
and then we can see what you are made of.â€ �"
2016-02-10,"Two in three Britons reject the finding of a UN panel that Julian Assange is being arbitrarily detained , according to a national opinion poll .
Lawyers on the UNâ€ ™ s panel on arbitrary detention last week found that the WikiLeaks founder , 44 , had been arbitrarily detained by the UK and Sweden for more than five years and should be released immediately with compensation .
The panelâ€ ™ s
findings , leaked last Thursday and published in full the following morning , were a welcome victory for Assange , but officials from both governments immediately rejected the decision .
Now YouGovâ€ ™ s polling suggests that a majority of the British public supports Philip Hammond , the British foreign secretary , in his dismissal of the findings as â€œridiculousâ€ � and â€œflawed in lawâ€ � .
According to the pollsters , 66 % of British people agree with the statement that Assange has been â€œvoluntarily avoiding lawful arrest by choosing to remain in the Ecuadorian embassyâ€ � since June 2012 .
Just 14 % â€ “ fewer than one in six â€
“ of respondents said they agreed that Assange â€œhad been deprived of his liberty for an unacceptable length of timeâ€ � .
One in five said they didnâ€ ™ t know .
A majority of the UNâ€ ™ s working group on arbitrary detention , a panel of international lawyers , had found that Assange had been unlawfully detained by the British and Swedish governments since his first arrest in the UK on 7 December 2010 and subsequent detention in Wandsworth prison .
Assangeâ€ ™ s extradition had been sought by authorities in Sweden on allegations of rape and sexual misconduct dating back to mid-2010 .
However , when he exhausted all his possibilities of appeal against extradition , he sought asylum in the Ecuadorian embassy .
He has denied the accusations against him and said he fears that if he was extradited to Sweden he would be further extradited to the US .
It is believed that a secret grand jury investigation is preparing to charge him over publishing secret details of US diplomacy and the brutal methods used by its armed forces in the Iraq war .
The US government under Barack Obama has already targeted a number of whistleblowers with espionage charges , including Chelsea Manning , the US army intelligence analyst who leaked millions of documents to WikiLeaks and is now serving a 35-year sentence .
YouGovâ€ ™ s polling also found that the British public are increasingly negative towards Assange .
His net favourability â€ “ the difference between favourable and unfavourable scores â€ “ has fallen from -11 in 2013 to -26 in 2016 .
Kristinn Hrafnsson , the WikiLeaks spokesman , said that UK public opinion had been shaped by attacks on Assange and the UN finding by officials and the press .
He said : â€œThe opinion is not surprising when the UK government calls the UNâ€ ™ s finding â€œridiculousâ€ � and the press almost unanimously attacks it .
The Guardian rejected it editorially on Friday morning , even before the UN arguments in the case where announced.â€ � â€œWhat is surprising is that the determination to deprive Mr Assange of justice runs so deep , that parties are willing to undermine and attempt to destroy , the credibility of UN mechanisms , instrumental in international battle for human rights.â€ �
Meanwhile , the Swedish prosecutor heading a preliminary investigation into the rape allegation against Assange , Marianne Ny , has said she is preparing a new application to interview him at the Ecuadorian embassy .
Ny said : â€œIn relation to the report which was released last week , I can state that it does not change my earlier assessment in the preliminary investigation.â€ �"
2016-02-24,"Britainâ€ ™ s defiance of the UN investigation into Julian Assange sets a dangerous precedent for upholding international law , a former United Nations official has warned .
Prof Mads Andenas , who chaired the UN working group on arbitrary detention ( UNWGAD ) , has criticised the governmentâ€ ™ s dismissal of the report on the WikiLeaks founder .
His warning comes as Assangeâ€ ™ s lawyers pressed the Swedish authorities to overturn the arrest warrant for the Australian , who has been in the UK resisting removal to Stockholm since 2010 .
Assange , who has sought asylum in the Ecuador embassy , is wanted in Sweden for questioning over rape and sexual assault allegations , which he denies .
This month , the UNWGAD formally found that he has been subject to arbitrary detention , partially on the grounds that Swedish prosecutors used disproportionate methods , including a European arrest warrant , rather than initially interviewing him in the UK .
Philip Hammond , the UK foreign secretary , dismissed the UN report as â€œridiculousâ€ � , called it â€œflawed in lawâ€ � and described Assange as a fugitive from justice .
Many senior British lawyers supported his defiance and stressed that the report was not binding on the UK courts .
But Prof Andenas , who chaired the early stages of the UNWGAD inquiry into Assange and is now a visiting fellow at the University of Oxford , told the Guardian : â€œRulings by the UNWGAD are not always followed by states , but rarely do they result in such personal attacks as made by UK politicians after the Assange opinion .
â€œI know that the words used by the foreign secretary and the prime minister were not the ones provided by the the civil servants advising on human rights and international law .
The UK politicians aimed at weakening the authority of the UN body for short - term opportunistic gain .
â€œI fear that these politicians have weakened the international communityâ€ ™ s possibility to protect some of the most vulnerable victims of human rights violations .
Their words have circulated among the states responsible for the worst human rights violations .
The words of these UK politicians will cost life and human suffering .
â€œThe UK may lobby for some support when the matter is reported to the UN Human Rights Council , but the UK will certainly be criticised by other states for its response , and clearly deserve that .
The damage done to the UK in the UN and its moral authority in human rights issues is another matter , but there is no doubt about the damage done to the authority of the UK.â€ �
Andenas is not the only international lawyer to express concerns about the UK response .
Dinah PoKempner , general counsel of Human Rights Watch , described as â€œdeplorableâ€ � the â€œrhetorical parries from the UK and Swedish governments , who both stated not just disagreement , but that the UNWGAD opinion would have absolutely no effect on their actionsâ€ � .
She added : â€œThis is not what one expects from democratic governments who usually support the UN mechanisms and international law.â€ �
The UK government said at the time : â€œThis changes nothing .
We completely reject any claim that Julian Assange is a victim of arbitrary detention .
The UK has already made clear to the UN that we will formally contest the working groupâ€ ™ s
opinion.â€ �
The UNWGAD was made up a five - person panel .
Three members supported the report , one dissented and the fifth member , an Australian , excused themselves from the procedure ."
2016-03-01,"Supporters of the WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange have published an open letter signed by 500 prominent artists , Nobel prize winners and human rights organisations accusing the UK and Sweden of undermining the UN .

Several Nobel prize winners including the Argentinian Adolfo PeÌ � rez Esquivel and the Northern Irish peace activist Mairead Maguire , as well as the film director Ken Loach , the musician Brian Eno , the author Naomi Klein , Prof Noam Chomsky and the journalist John Pilger have added their name to the letter .

The international letter declares : â€œWe â€ ¦ condemn the reactions of the governments of Sweden and the United Kingdom to the finding by UNWGAD that Julian Assange is arbitrarily detained .
The governments of Sweden and the United Kingdom are setting a dangerous precedent that undermines the United Nations human rights system as a whole .
â€œWe urge Sweden and the United Kingdom to respect the binding nature of the human rights covenants on which the decision is based , including the international covenant on civil and political rights ; as well as the independence , integrity and authority of the office of the high commissioner for human rights and the working group on arbitrary detention.â€ �
The letter calls on both governments to comply with the UN groupâ€ ™ s findings and â€œensure the right of free movement of Mr Assange and accord him an enforceable right to compensationâ€ � .
Among the signatories is Prof Mads Andenas , the Norwegian former chair of UNWGAD .
The letter was organised by the Justice for Assange website .
The letter is headed :
â€œFive hundred human rights organisations , Noble [ sic ] prize winners , jurists â€ ¦ condemn Sweden and UK over reaction to UNWGAD Assange findings.â€
�
The letter was presented to a session of the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva on Tuesday .
The UK has said it will challenge the WGAD opinion .
â€œIt is extraordinary that so many NGOs have called on governments to act , â€ � said Alfred de Zayas , the UNâ€ ™ s independent expert on democracy and equality .
â€œAlready we have seen the British government response to the Assange UNWGAD case being cited in Sri Lanka and the Maldives to justify non - compliance with UNWGAD decisions and UN commitments like investigating war crimes , â€ � said Jen Robinson , a member of Assangeâ€ ™ s legal team in Geneva ."
2016-03-24,"The British government has formally asked a United Nations panel to review its finding that Julian Assange is â€œarbitrarily detainedâ€ � in the Ecuadorian embassy in London , calling the opinion â€œdeeply flawedâ€ � .
In its first formal response to the finding of the UN working group on arbitrary detention , which published its opinion in February , the Foreign Office confirmed it would contest the finding , saying : â€œThe original conclusions of the UN working group are inaccurate and should be reviewed.â€ �
In a statement , the Foreign Office minister Hugo Swire said : â€œWe want to ensure the working group is in possession of the full facts .
Our request for a review of the opinion sets those facts out clearly .
â€œJulian Assange has never been arbitrarily detained by the UK , and is in fact voluntarily avoiding lawful arrest by choosing to remain in the Ecuadorian embassy .
The UK continues to have a legal obligation to extradite him to Sweden.â€
�
The WikiLeaks founder has been confined to the embassy in London since July 2012 , when he sought asylum in a bid to avoid extradition to Sweden over sexual assault allegations , which he denies .
The international panel said on 4 February that it believed Assangeâ€ ™ s confinement was arbitrary because of the length of time in bringing his case to resolution , citing in particular a â€œlack of diligence by the Swedish prosecutor in its investigationsâ€ � .
The government argues that the panel is not a judicial body and its findings are therefore not binding .
â€œThe working groupâ€
™ s opinion is deeply flawed and Mr Assange has never been the subject of arbitrary detention , â€ � it said .
â€œHis human rights have been protected throughout the process and will continue to be protected if and when he is extradited to Sweden.â€
�
Speaking shortly after the working groupâ€
™ s findings were published , Philip Hammond , the foreign secretary , described them as ridiculous and said Assange was hiding from justice .
Assange accused Hammond of insulting the UN , saying : â€œThis is the end of the road for the legal arguments that have been put forward by Sweden and the UK.â€ � Responding to the government statement , Melinda Taylor , a legal adviser to Assange , told the Guardian : â€œThe fact that they have submitted this request for reconsideration undermines their previous assertion that they werenâ€ ™ t in any way bound to comply with its opinion.â€ �
She said that all the points made by the Foreign Office had been known to the working group before it gave its original opinion , and the UK had every opportunity to make its case and correct any factual errors before the opinion was published .
â€œIn the absence of any objective basis to seek reconsideration , this rebuttal appears to be an attempt to publicly undermine the working groupâ€ ™ s opinion , â€ �
she said .
The panelâ€ ™ s decision on whether or not to review its opinion will be made during its next session , beginning 18 April , the Foreign Office said ."
2016-04-06,"A leading media lawyer has claimed that celebrities have been given carte blanche to use their children to prevent stories about their sex lives being published , after a court upheld an injunction against the Sun on Sunday .
The court of appeal ruled last month that the story about a threesome involving a â€œwell - knownâ€ � individual , who is in an open relationship , should not be published in part because of the impact on the coupleâ€ ™ s children .
Mark Stephens , who represented Julian Assange during his fight against extradition to Sweden on sexual assault charges , told Radio 4â€ ™ s Media Show that the â€œwatershedâ€ � ruling meant celebrities could use their children to prevent a free press .
â€œOne of the problems we have is that effectively what weâ€ ™ ve got is a watershed moment , an inflection moment , â€ � said Stephens .
â€œThe rich and famous with children are now going to be able to put forward the saccharine images ...
their primped and preened images by their spin doctors and the public wonâ€ ™ t be able to have them gainsaid by the free press.â€ �
â€œNow we are seeing children thrown under the bus , the legal bus , to prevent stories coming out .
It seems to me not without notice that one of the judges was a family law judge and therefore brought that very perspective of the children.â€ �
â€œThe message to celebrities that goes out is that if you are going to have a mÃ
© nage Ã trois or an open relationship
make sure youâ€ ™ ve got children.â€ �
However , Sara Mansoori , another lawyer who has represented phone - hacking victims at the Leveson inquiry into the media said the ruling would not be an invitation for celebrities to put their children in the public eye .
â€œItâ€ ™ s an important factor , it depends on the age of children , it depends on the circumstances of each case .
The courts are going to take that into account , â€ � she said .
â€œI think the courts will look at each case individually , and if you are using your children to that end you will be able to protect yourselves behind them .
â€œBut I think the courts will look at various factors relating to the children , the ages of the children and how it was likely to affect them .
In this case itâ€ ™ s said they were likely to find it on the internet and suffer harassment in due course.â€ �
Mansoori had earlier drawn attention to the judgeâ€ ™ s ruling that the celebrity in question had also previously indicated an open relationship with his partner , meaning the Sun on Sunday story would not be at odds with the persona presented to the public ."

Poitras , who profiled another celebrated data warrior , Edward Snowden , in Citizenfour , filmed with Assange in 2010 ( although the pair are reportedly not now on good terms ) .
Her film â€ “ originally entitled Asylum â€ “ is said to cover the period when the WikiLeaks data dumps were triggering international outrage .
The Directorsâ€ ™ Fortnight also features work by a clutch of high - profile international auteurs , including new films by the 87-year - old Chilean director Alejandro Jodorowsky ( with Endless Poetry , described as â€œan ode to the search for beautyâ€ � ) , Pablo LarraÃ­n ( who reunites with Gael GarcÃ­a Bernal for political thriller Neruda ) , and Paul Schrader ( with Dog Eat Dog , an adaptation of Ed Bunkerâ€ ™ s novel ) .

2016-05-11,"Michael Ratner , the civil and human rights attorney who represented Julian Assange and WikiLeaks in the US , died Wednesday at age 72 , leaving behind an outsized legacy of advocacy for whistleblowers and US government detainees .
â€œAs an attorney , writer , speaker , educator , activist ...
Michael Ratnerâ€ ™ s passion was not just for the law but for the struggle for justice and peace , â€ � said the Center for Constitutional Rights , a not - for - profit legal advocacy organization where Ratner worked to bring cases for 45 years .
â€œMichael dedicated his life to the most important fights for justice of the last half century.â€ �
Ratner joined CCR in 1971 after graduating from Columbia law school , just a week before the famous prisoner revolt at the Attica correctional facility in upstate New York .
The case of the Attica brothers versus then governor Nelson Rockefeller would be Ratnerâ€ ™ s first for the organization .
A tireless critic of extraordinary rendition and indefinite detention throughout the post-9/11 war on terror , Ratner was co - counsel in a 2004 suit filed on behalf of captives at GuantÃ¡namo Bay that reached the supreme court .
In a landmark decision , the justices decided in Rasul v Bush that detainees did have the right to challenge their detention and that US courts have the jurisdiction to hear those complaints in the case of foreign nationals .
Ratner was also a founding member of the GuantÃ¡namo Bay Bar Association , a group of more than 500 attorneys who provided pro - bono representation to detainees , an effort CCR calls â€œthe largest mass defense effort in US historyâ€ � .
Long before the war on terror , Ratner took up the cause of GuantÃ¡namo detainees in the 1990s , winning the closure of a detention camp set up exclusively for holding HIV - positive Haitian refugees .
During his career , Ratner sued three US presidents : Ronald Reagan , Bill Clinton and George W Bush , and passionately argued for the impeachment of the latter for warrantless surveillance , torture , misleading Congress about the Iraq war , and violating the constitutionâ€ ™ s separation of powers .
Ratner returned to Columbia as an adjunct professor , also teaching at Yale during his career and serving as president of the National Lawyers Guild from 1982 to 1983 .
Ratner published several legal books and received awards for excellence from Trial Lawyers for Public Justice and the Columbia Law School Public Interest Law Foundation .
A sometimes contributor to the Guardian , which first reported the NSA surveillance revelations made by Edward Snowden , Ratner was a frequent defender of whistleblowers against US national security secrecy .
Opining on the legal status of Snowden , Chelsea Manning , and his client , WikiLeaks founder Assange , Ratner said all of them â€œdid their civic duty by disclosing information on government overreaching .
They all exhibited great moral courage in doing so .
And they all deserve far more than unfair imprisonment and exile for the service they have done for the American people and for people all around the world.â€ �
In its statement , CCR said : â€œMichaelâ€ ™ s leadership and generous spirit have shown the way for new generations of social justice lawyers ,

Tomorrow we carry on his work.â€ �"
2016-05-11,"Among all the talk of whistleblowers as heroes - Edward Snowden , Chelsea Manning , Julian Assange , the Panama Papers leaker - one is rarely mentioned .
Mordechai Vanunu came to Britain in 1986 to tell the Sunday Times the story of the nuclear weapons facility at Dimona in the Negev desert in southern Israel .
Walking around London , frustrated by the time the newspaper seemed to be taking to run his story , he was lured by â€œCindyâ€ � , a woman from Mossad .
They flew together to Italy where he was kidnapped , drugged , and smuggled out of the country to Israel .
He was sentenced to 18 years in jail for revealing details of Israelâ€ ™ s clandestine nuclear weapons programme .
He spent more than a decade in solitary confinement .
He was released in 2004 but banned from speaking to foreigners without official permission , and prevented from leaving the country .
Last Sunday Vanunu , now 61 , was charged with violating the terms of his release .
He was charged with meeting two Americans at a hotel in east Jerusalem in 2013 without seeking permission to do so , with moving apartments in 2014 without notifying the police , and in 2015 for giving an interview to Israelâ€ ™ s Channel 2 TV in which he disclosed what was described as â€œclassified information that was cut out by the censorsâ€ � .
As the Israeli newspaper , Haaretz , pointed out , the information divulged by Vanunu was not new , as he had previously discussed it in the media .
But the conditions of his release forbid him from passing on any classified information , even if it has previously been published .
Israel has never acknowledged that it has a nuclear arsenal , instead maintaining a policy of â€œnuclear ambiguityâ€
� while vowing that it would not be the first to use nuclear weapons in the Middle East .
It is widely reported to have at least 80 nuclear weapons .
Vanunuâ€ ™ s continuing persecution seems to be nothing short of vindictive .
It is a touch ironic that nuclear weapons are supposed to deter .
Surely , they can only do this if their possession is avowed ."
2016-05-19,"Julian Assange , the Wikileaks founder who is still confined to the Ecuadorian embassy in London , would find life no easier under a President Hillary Clinton , according to the journalist , hacker and WikiLeaks representative Jacob Appelbaum .

Clintonâ€ ™ s office was in no mood to rethink their strategy when it came to Assange .

Hillary Clintonâ€ ™ s office some time after the Cablegate , â€ � Appelbaum said .
â€œHe let me know that Clinton did not like Julian or myself .
I think that if Hillary Clinton were to run for president , she would continue to assert her political will and bitterness about the exposure of diplomatic cables that documented crimes.â€ �
Poitras began filming Risk before she started work on Citizenfour , her Oscar - winning film about Edward Snowden .
In Risk , Poitras follows Assange in the aftermath of the US diplomatic leaks as he learns of the accusations of sexual molestation and one of rape against him by two Swedish women that were , he believes , part of a smear campaign .
The film shows Assange after he sought refuge from extradition in the Ecuadorian embassy , holding WikiLeaks meeting , working out with a boxing trainer and being interviewed by Lady Gaga .
In October 2014 , the New Yorker published an article suggesting that Assange had grown disillusioned with Poitras , thinking her timid .
Asked by a Cannes audience member if reports of friction between the pair were true , Poitras questioned their source , before criticising the mainstream media for being distracted by minor details .
â€œWhen
I first started doing the reporting on Edward Snowdenâ€ ™ s documents , one of the first things the mainstream media did was a comparison [ with WikiLeaks whistleblower
Chelsea Manning],â€ �
she said .
â€œItâ€ ™ s a move by the mainstream media to try and separate people .
Edward Snowden came very much after Chelsea Manning .
Itâ€ ™ s not about comparing the two , itâ€ ™ s about looking at what theyâ€ ™ re actually revealing.â€
�
â€œJulian is a political prisoner who has been demonised in the press , â€ � said Appelbaum to applause .
â€œThereâ€ ™ s a real split between journalists who are working to reveal information and journalists who are propagandists .
And in the United States most of the journalists are propagandists .
Theyâ€ ™ re stenographers for the state.â€
�
The pair were joined on stage by Sarah Harrison , a journalist and legal researcher who is a close confidante of Assangeâ€ ™ s .
She wore a T - shirt that read : â€œLiberate
Assange.â€
�
She noted that 28 May will be Assangeâ€ ™ s 2,000th day in exile , cited a recent UN report that called the UKâ€ ™ s detention of Assange â€œarbitraryâ€ � , and called for his immediate release .
â€œHeâ€ ™ s been in that space for four years , â€ �
she said .
â€œThink of that when youâ€ ™ re out in the Cannes sunshineâ€ � ."
2016-05-19,"For a few minutes in Laura Poitrasâ€ ™ s new film , Julian Assange gets the most terrific grilling .
â€œDo
you ever feel like just fucking crying ,
â€ �
heâ€ ™ s asked , â€œeven when youâ€ ™ re happy?â€ �
Also : â€œWhatâ€ ™ s your favourite food?â€
�
And : â€œWho is actually after
you?â€ �
But these teasers come not from the director , but guest questioner Lady Gaga , who rocks up at the Ecuadorian embassy in 2012 to interrogate her hero .
She shoots proceedings herself , proffers PR advice before they start : â€œPut on a dirty fucking T - shirt ,
â€ � she instructs , baulking at his suit , â€œlike a rebel.â€
�
He does .
No one who speaks to the subject in this documentary â€ “ in the flesh , at least ; thereâ€ ™ s a few slightly sticky phonecalls
â€ “ is anything other than on - side ( rumours of a rift between Assange and Poitras may be much exaggerated ) .
But if they must be adoring , better they are asinine , also .
For it is under the dopey gaze of Gaga that this slipperiest of contemporary icons slides furthest off - message .
Assange runs through the dozen or more agencies formally in pursuit ( helpfully summarised by a yawny Gaga as â€œa lot of fucking peopleâ€ � ) .
He says self - pity is a waste of time ; he never weeps .
And then he says , very seriously : â€œLetâ€ ™ s not pretend for a moment Iâ€ ™ m a normal personâ€ � ; this in response to the favourite food question , which gets you wondering exactly which takeaways are on his speed - dial .
Although Poitras must ask a few herself , we never see or hear her , and her presence â€ “ post -
The Oath ( her road - to - GuantÃ¡namo study ) , post -
Citizenfour ( Oscar - winning Snowden film )
â€ “ is increasingly less that of a journalist and more as a collaborator ; a fellow target of government antipathy .
So what we have here is an embedded report that sacrifices impartiality for access .
But what access .
Some scenes play like an early adaptation of the Jonathan Frazen novel Purity , about the messianic head of a WikiLeaks - ish company populated by earnest coders and a flood of female recruits .
A haircut comes with a dozen cooing spectators .
Early moments at Ellingham Hall in Norfolk have strange echoes of Peterâ€ ™ s
Friends , with the wine and the Aga , the fresh - cut flowers and the cliquey giggles .
There are confabs on the forest floor ; shots of him looking soulful in his sunnies on the shingle .
This detail is gold dust .
And listening to Assange explain how his missives can be intercepted through overhead power cables , even those allergic canâ€ ™ t fail but be impressed .
He speaks with an arrogance backed by intelligence , a conceit moderated by some stubby measure of self - awareness .
And yet there is a problem : this is a passive hero , for all his keyboard - tapping , trapped in an inert , finger - twiddling narrative .
Risk has little of the shivery thrill of Citizenfour , with its claustrophobic focus and tight timeframe .
Poitras milks what cinematic agency she can from his rare trips out
â€ “
thereâ€
™ s a lovely overhead shot of Assange exiting the courts , Amal Clooney by his side ,
crowds parting , a plaintive version of I Shall Be Released strummed out by some supporters .
We watch as Assange dons leathers , earrings , coloured contact lenses and dyes his hair , goatee included ( think ginger goth David Brent ) , then goes for a Bourne - esque race round town on a motorbike .
Yet mostly itâ€ ™ s a film of chat and interiors , and for all the sad shots of Assange gasping for air by an open window in the embassy , audience pity is trumped by hunger for dramatic engagement .
Poitras must recognise this , for she splices his story with that of a couple of footsoldiers : WikiLeaksâ€ ™ spokeswoman Sarah Harrison , now stuck in Europe , and similarly exiled tech expert Jacob Appelbaum .
Appelbaum talks casually of crypto - wars and cyber - punks before heading to a conference in Egypt and unleashing both barrels on the heads of firms including TE Data .
It backed Mubarak by censoring Twitter , he says , then tried to capitalise on the new regime by suggesting the firmâ€ ™ s message was freedom .
A lynching looks likely ; then the crowd rise up in support .
Itâ€ ™ s knife - edge stuff , which gives the film a jolt of fire and rage .
And this loose - cannon element is why the scenes that linger longest involving Assange are those in which friendly fire is suddenly lobbed in his direction .
There is Gaga , with her slack - jawed scattershot , and there is also his QC , Helena Kennedy , who advises against his dismissing the Swedish extradition as a â€œmad feminist conspiracyâ€ � .
He nods :
â€œnot publiclyâ€
� , at least .
She eyerolls .
Then , later , he tells Poitras it would be in his accusersâ€ ™ interests to drop the case .
If they proceed , â€œtheyâ€ ™ ll be reviled forever by a large segment of the worldâ€ ™ s
populationâ€ � .
It sounds like a threat , yet it is meant as candid truth - telling .
And it is here that Poitrasâ€ ™ s ability to broadcast private sentiment in a film deemed fit for public consumption pays highest dividends ."
2016-05-20,"Julian Assange , his white - blond mop of hair cut and dyed a dusty orange , puts coloured contact lenses in .
He pulls on biker leathers , hides his face behind a helmet and takes his motorcycle for a ride .
Assange is in disguise , in one of his last moments of freedom before he enters the Embassy of Ecuador .
There , after seeking asylum from extradition , the man who helped leak more than 250,000 confidential US State Department documents will stay .
Who knows for how long ?
The wider story is well known .
But the details â€ “ the contact lenses , that dye job â€ “ come from an embedded source .
Documentarian Laura Poitras , the film - maker Edward Snowden contacted when he decided to blow the whistle on the NSAâ€ ™ s surveillance practices , had exclusive access to Assange and Wikileaks at the time the US began what she describes as â€œa full - force attackâ€ � on the organisation .
Poitras presents her insiderâ€ ™ s account of the WikiLeaks saga in Risk , a documentary that premiered this week at the Cannes film festival .
Shot before , during and after the Snowden revelations , it is a partial reveal of the reveal .
It brings the viewer into the room with the team of journalists , activists and hackers who helped â€ “ based on the leaks by Chelsea Manning and with the assistance of the Guardian â€ “ to expose exactly how scrutinised we are by the state .
The film fleshes out what we already know .
Although it features a series of intimate moments ( Assange having his hair cut by the rest of the Wikileaks team , Assange boxing with a trainer in the kitchen of the Ecuadorian embassy ) , Risk also shows a side of Assange that we have come to expect : the measured stoic , the placid pragmatist .
A man capable of exhibiting extreme bravery and breezy arrogance simultaneously .
â€œHe has a pretty extraordinary ability to withstand stress , â€ � says Poitras .
â€œNot that many people could withstand the pressure that heâ€ ™ s living under .
He has to be able to hold it together , and he manages to.â€ �
In the later stages of the film , as the Ecuadorian embassy becomes his home , and then a sort of prison , we see Assangeâ€ ™ s pseudo - celebrity creep into effect .
Poitras films him being visited and interviewed by the pop star Lady Gaga .
Each is fascinated by the other , without really understanding what makes them tick .
Assangeâ€ ™ s celebrity is complicated , says Poitras .
She says thereâ€ ™ s a danger that focusing on those who leak information can start to obscure the importance of the information itself .
â€œIt came up with Snowden , â€ � she says .
â€œHe said he didnâ€ ™ t want to be the story , but when somebody does something that generates that much media attention , they often do .
Then the mainstream media fails to look at the actual reporting : what [ the leaks ] actually show .
That said , I make documentaries about people , so I guess
Iâ€
™ m guilty of that as well.â€
�
In 2013 Poitras travelled to Hong Kong to film a video of Snowden â€ “ published by the Guardian â€ “ that would reveal his identity .
She won an Oscar for Citizenfour , her subsequent documentary about him .
In that film , she supplied narration , reading some of the first emails that Snowden had sent to her expressing his wish to go public .
In Risk , Poitras is not an active player , but she does have a stake in the game .
She leaves moments in when the team speak to her .
She believes it is important to acknowledge that her presence affects what she films .
She also believes that a similar kind of exposure would be healthy for the Guardian too .
â€œWikileaks and Snowden â€ “
the Guardian is related to both of those stories ,
â€ � she says .
â€œI think the Guardian , in its reporting of them , should maybe add a disclaimer , because itâ€ ™ s a participant .
Thatâ€ ™ s why I chose to leave myself in , so the audience doesnâ€ ™ t think that Iâ€ ™ m forgotten , behind the camera.â€ �
Poitras , who has made films about al - Qaida , GuantÃ¡namo Bay and the US military in Iraq , has been on the US terrorist watchlist since around 2006 .
â€œI
havenâ€
™ t taken the same risks as the people Iâ€ ™ ve documented , but the film is founded on a risk , â€ � she says .
â€œI was advised not to go to Hong Kong , not to bring a camera to Hong Kong , but I decided it was a risk worth taking.â€ �
Her role in these two huge stories will be amplified again later this year , when Oliver Stoneâ€ ™ s biopic , Snowden , hits cinemas .
Poitras , who is being played by Melissa Leo , seems wary of Hollywood fictionalisation , but is withholding judgment until she sees the film .
â€œOne of my favourite films ever is
All the Presidentâ€ ™ s
Men , â€ � she says .
â€œItâ€ ™ s great cinema
thatâ€ ™ s based on real life .
Thatâ€ ™ s the quality of the film , not the act of fictionalisation .
Show me a good film!â€ �"
2016-06-12,"Julian Assange , the founder of WikiLeaks , has said his organisation is preparing to publish more emails Hillary Clinton sent and received while US secretary of state .
Clinton , the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee , is under FBI investigation to determine whether she broke federal law by using her private email in sending classified information .
A new WikiLeaks release of Clinton emails is likely to fan a controversy that has bedevilled her campaign and provide further ammunition for Donald Trump , her Republican presidential rival , who has used the issue to attack her .
Assangeâ€
™ s comments came in an interview on ITVâ€ ™ s Peston on Sunday .
â€œWe have upcoming leaks in relation to Hillary Clinton â€
¦
We have emails pending publication , that is correct , â€ � Assange said .
He did not specify when or how many emails would be published .
WikiLeaks launched a searchable archive in March of 30,322 emails and email attachments sent to and from Clintonâ€ ™ s private email server while she was secretary of state .
The 50,547 pages of documents are from 30 June 2010 to 12 August 2014 , and 7,570 of the documents were sent by Clinton , who served as secretary of state from 2009 to 2013 .
Assange , a trenchant Clinton critic , said she was receiving constant personal updates on his situation .
The WikiLeaks founder has been confined to the Ecuadorian embassy in London since July 2012 , when he sought asylum to avoid extradition .
Assange is wanted in Sweden over allegations of rape dating from 2010 , which he denies , but he has not been charged .
A Stockholm district court upheld an arrest warrant against the Australian last month , saying there was still â€œprobable cause for suspicionâ€ � against him .
Assange said it was highly unlikely that the US attorney general , Loretta Lynch , would indict Clinton .
â€œSheâ€
™ s not going to indict Hillary Clinton , thatâ€ ™ s not possible .
Itâ€ ™ s not going to happen .
But the FBI can push for concessions from a Clinton government , â€ �
he said .
He has attacked Clinton as a â€œliberal war hawkâ€ � , claiming that WikiLeaks had published emails showing her to be the leading champion in office to push for the overthrow of Muammar Gaddafi in Libya , despite Pentagon reluctance .
â€œThey predicted that the postwar outcome would be something like it is â€ ¦
she has a long history of being a liberal war hawk ,
â€ � he said .
He also accused Google last week of helping Clinton in her presidential campaign , lumping together two of his bugbears .
Google â€œis intensely aligned with US
exceptionalismâ€ � and its employees will likely be rewarded if Clinton wins the presidential election
come November , Assange told an international media forum in Moscow .
His attacks on Clinton may be dismissed as highly partial , but the email controversy continues to dog her .
An internal report last month found she had broken several government rules by using a private server rather than more secure official communication systems .
The 78-page investigation by the inspector general of the state department singled out several previously unknown breaches while Clinton was secretary of state , including the use of mobile devices to conduct official business without checking whether they posed a security risk ."
2016-06-20,"Ecuador has received a formal request from the Swedish authorities to interview Julian Assange , inside its London embassy , in a potential breakthrough to the long - running saga .
The WikiLeaks founder , 44 , is wanted for questioning over a 2010 rape allegation in Sweden , which he has always denied .
He has been living inside Ecuadorâ€ ™ s UK mission for four years in a bid to avoid extradition to Sweden , saying he fears he would then be transferred to the US to face political charges for orchestrating leaks of diplomatic cables .
Ecuador has been asking throughout Assangeâ€ ™ s stay that he be interviewed inside the embassy , and said it welcomed the apparent Swedish â€œchange of heart , and signs of a new political willâ€ � .
Ecuadorâ€ ™ s foreign minister , Dr Guillaume Long , said on Monday , however , that the country may require fresh legal assurances before it allows Swedish prosecutors access .
The Swedish attorney general made a formal request that was being considered , Long said .
Long also asked why the UK was unwilling to accept a February ruling by a UN working group that Assange was being arbitrarily detained .
The UK Foreign Office minister Hugo Swire , who met Long on Monday , has called for the UN decision to be reviewed , pointing out that Assange was staying in the embassy voluntarily , and that the UK had a legal duty to extradite him to Sweden .
Britain claims the UN decision is flawed and has no legal status .
The UN found that Sweden was not being diligent enough in its prosecution , including its failure at the time to offer to interview him in the embassy .
Long said : â€œInterviewing Mr Assange inside the embassy has been Ecuadorâ€ ™ s request for four years .
Over 1,400 days we have been asking the Swedes to come and interrogate him in our embassy .
So it is welcome there has been change of heart and some sign of political will .
â€œBut since November 2010 and March 2015 Sweden made 44 such requests to other countries to interview suspects in other cases .
So it is very common and could be easily done , but we faced total refusal for years.â€ �
Long said Ecuadorâ€ ™ s legal department needed to examine the request , and must also view it in the context of the UN ruling and the lack of sworn guarantees from the US .
Ecuador would also want assurances that the UK would not seek to prosecute Assange for avoiding arrest .
Some in the Foreign Office fear a permanent impasse between the UK and Ecuador , and that Assange will stay in the embassy until 2020 , by which time a statute of limitations applies under Swedish law on the rape case .
â€œI do not think waiting for another four years is a solution .
That would be quite wrong , â€ �
Long said .
â€œAssange is suffering deteriorating health , he has a small space and little light .
It is an embassy under siege .
It is very difficult to make a phone call , the internet collapses the whole time , pictures are taken as people enter and leave the building.â€ �
There will be presidential elections in Ecuador in 2017 , and although the current leader , Rafael Correa , has stated that he will stand aside after 10 years in office , Long said he was â€œpretty
confidentâ€ � his Allianza Pais party would be re - elected , bucking the trend for leftwing Latin American governments to fall or come under intense popular pressure .
Long said the Correa government was still relatively popular , â€ “ despite the slump in commodity prices and allegations of civil liberties abuse , partly because the country had suffered so much political instability before .
â€œWhat is amazing about Correa is that after 10 years in office , he remains consistently popular , â€ � he said .
He said inequality remained the driving issue that all governments had to confront in Latin America .
â€œMost of Latin Americaâ€ ™ s problems , social economic or political , derive from inequality and any government that does not tackle that issue is not tackling Latin Americaâ€ ™ s main problem , â€ �
he said .
â€¢ This article was amended on 21 June 2016 to correct a quote from Ecuadorâ€ ™ s foreign minister ; he said Assange had been in the embassy for 1,400 days , not 4,400 ."
2016-09-07,"Swedenâ€ ™ s court of appeal will debate on Friday whether to grant Julian Assange an open court hearing in his renewed campaign to rescind the arrest warrant against him .
The prosecutors in the case , Marianne Ny and Ingrid Isgren , took the unusual step of holding a press conference in Stockholm on Wednesday â€œto give a snapshot of the investigationâ€ � , although they stressed that they did not have anything new to say in the case .
The prosecutors are waiting for Ecuador to grant them a date to interview Assange in the Ecuadorian embassy in London , where the WikiLeaks founder took refuge more than four years ago to avoid a perceived threat of extradition to face espionage and other charges in the US .
Ny refused to interrogate Assange at the embassy but changed her mind in March last year after criticism from the appeal court .
After a first appeal against the arrest warrant was rejected by Swedenâ€ ™ s supreme court last year , Assangeâ€ ™ s lawyers launched a fresh effort to have the arrest warrant rescinded when the United Nations working group on arbitrary detention ruled that Assangeâ€ ™ s situation amounted to a deprivation of liberty and demanded that the UK and Sweden ensure Assangeâ€ ™ s safety and compensate him for the period of his detention .
Documents submitted by Assange to the appeal court include an assessment of his physical and mental health by Dr Michael Korzinski , a clinical specialist in trauma .
Assange is expected to argue that conditions inside the embassy are in certain ways worse than those of a conventional prison , with the potential to cause â€œsevere harmâ€ � both physically and mentally .
The appeal court judges Jan Ã – hman , Kerstin Elserth and Jonas HÃ¶gstrÃ¶m will hear a presentation of Assangeâ€ ™ s appeal by the legal clerk Ã
… sa Linghede in Stockholm on Friday , starting at 9 am ."
2016-09-08,"That Ant and Dec are set to sign a Â£30 m three - year deal locking them in to ITV is no huge surprise .
The pair are incredibly important to the channel , fronting many of its biggest shows .
And , as one source told the Guardian , when you are expecting at some point to sell up in a deal valued in the region of Â£10bn , a few million here or there to secure on of your biggest assets is no big deal .
However , it does highlight the inflation in pay for the biggest names .
Itâ€ ™ s clear for instance that the mind - boggling sums Amazon reportedly paid for the Grand Tour was as much about hosts Jeremy Clarkson , James May and Richard Hammond as it was the tech companyâ€ ™ s desire for a show about cars .
Which brings us back to that trioâ€ ™ s former home â€ “ the BBC .
The beebâ€ ™ s protestations about being forced to reveal star pay havenâ€

2016-10-12,"The questioning of Julian Assange by Swedish prosecutors at the Ecuadorean embassy in London has been postponed until mid - November .
Ecuadorâ€ ™ s attorney general said on Wednesday that the long - awaited interview , due to take place on Monday , would be delayed until 14 November to ensure that Assangeâ€ ™ s legal team could attend .
Assange has been confined to the embassy since June 2012 , when he sought and was granted asylum by Ecuador .

2016-10-17,"Julian Assangeâ€ ™ s internet was cut off by Ecuador , WikiLeaks has said , deflecting blame from the US and British governments , which have sparred with Assange for releasing sensitive material .
Ecuador has reiterated its determination to protect Assange despite the internet link of the WikiLeaks founder being â€œintentionally severedâ€ � , as WikiLeaks said .
An early morning tweet on Monday accused a â€œstate partyâ€ � of being responsible for shutting down internet access to Assange , who has been living inside the Ecuadorian embassy in London for over four years .
The tweet said the group had â€œactivated the appropriate contingency plansâ€ � .
WikiLeaks did not immediately release more information about the incident , and the tweet attracted a storm of comments and speculation on social media from across the world .
These ranged from concerns for the Australianâ€ ™ s health to support for any move to stop the activities of the group .
Many felt it was no coincidence that the internet was cut just after WikiLeaks had released another batch of emails from the campaign manager of the US presidential candidate Hillary Clinton .
The anti - secrecy organisation released three transcripts on Saturday of Clintonâ€ ™ s paid Goldman Sachs speeches , which her campaign team had long refused to release .
The transcripts show how she bantered with the investment bankâ€ ™ s executives , which is likely to fuel fears among liberal Democrats that she is too cosy with Wall Street .
The Clinton camp has neither confirmed nor denied the leaked emails are authentic .
There have been no indications they are fake .
It has now been confirmed that neither Clintonâ€ ™ s team nor any political party was responsible for Assange losing his internet access .
Assange is wanted for questioning in Sweden over a sex allegation , which he denies , but he believes that if he leaves the embassy he will be extradited to the US for questioning over the activities of WikiLeaks .
It is not yet known what Ecuadorâ€ ™ s motivation was for cutting his Wi - Fi .
A source in the Ecuadorian government told the Press Association : â€œWe donâ€ ™ t respond to speculation circulating on Twitter .
Ecuador will continue to protect Julian Assange and uphold the political asylum granted to him in 2012.â€ �"
2016-10-18,"Ecuador has confirmed that it has temporarily cut off internet access in its embassy in London to Julian Assange , the founder of the whistleblowing site WikiLeaks , over fears that he was using it to interfere in the US presidential election .
The move followed the publication of leaked emails by WikiLeaks , including some from the Democratic National Committee ( DNC ) released just before the partyâ€ ™ s convention in July , and more recently a cache of emails from the account of Hillary Clinton campaign adviser John Podesta .
On Tuesday , officials released a statement saying that the government of Ecuador â€œrespects the principle of non - intervention in the internal affairs of other statesâ€ � and had cut off the internet access available to Assange because â€œin recent weeks , WikiLeaks has published a wealth of documents , impacting on the US election campaignâ€ � .
The statement also reaffirmed the asylum granted to Assange and reiterated its intention â€œto safeguard his life and physical integrity until he reaches a safe placeâ€ � .
Assangeâ€ ™ s internet access was cut off on Monday morning .
It was not immediately clear who was responsible , though a tweet from the siteâ€ ™ s official account claimed it had been â€œintentionally severedâ€ � by a â€œstate partyâ€ � .
It is not known who perpetrated the hacks that brought the emails to WikiLeaks .
Assangeâ€ ™ s organization styles itself a whistleblowing outfit and claims not to do or encourage any hacking itself .
Yet cybersecurity experts have linked the hack of the DNC emails to hackers tied to the Russian government , leading many â€ “ including Clintonâ€ ™ s campaign manager , Robby Mook â€ “ to allege that Russia is using both hackers and Assange as tools to help rig the presidential election in favor of Donald Trump .
On Saturday , the anti - secrecy organisation released three transcripts of Clintonâ€ ™ s paid Goldman Sachs speeches , which her campaign team had long refused to release .
The transcripts show how she bantered with the investment bankâ€ ™ s executives , which is likely to fuel fears among liberal Democrats that she is too cosy with Wall Street .
WikiLeaks was responsible for the release , in collaboration with several news organizations including the Guardian , of an explosive set of documents leaked by US army private Chelsea Manning , including a video titled Collateral Murder that showed a US air crew killing Iraqi civilians .
Manning , who leaked the information , is currently in military prison .
Assange has been confined to the Ecuadorian embassy in London since June 2012 , when he sought and was granted asylum by Ecuador .
Assange is wanted for questioning in Sweden over an allegation of rape in August 2010 , which he denies .
The Australian WikiLeaks founder has claimed he could be transferred to the US to face potential espionage charges arising from WikiLeaksâ€ ™ publishing activities .
Swedish prosecutors had been due to question Assange at the embassy this week , but last week Ecuadorâ€ ™ s attorney general said the long - awaited interview would be delayed until 14 November to ensure that Assangeâ€ ™ s legal team could attend .
The interview will be conducted by an Ecuadorian prosecutor , based on a list of questions from the Swedish chief prosecutor and a police investigator , who will be present .
The Ecuadorians will later report the findings to Sweden ."

Hillary Clintonâ€ ™ s US election campaign .
Ecuador confirmed late on Tuesday that it had intervened at the weekend to temporarily restrict Assangeâ€ ™ s internet access , pointing to a â€œwealthâ€ � of WikiLeaks publications â€œimpacting on the US election campaignâ€ � as the reason .
WikiLeaks has released successive dumps of damaging material over recent months from inside the Democratic party and the Clinton campaign , which the US government has blamed on Russian state hacking .
â€œThe government of Ecuador respects the principle of non - intervention in the internal affairs of other states , â€ � Ecuadorâ€ ™ s
foreign ministry said in a statement .
â€œIt does not interfere in external electoral processes , nor does it favour any particular candidate.â€
�
The statement , in which Ecuador stressed that it â€œdoes not yield to pressure from other statesâ€ � , followed claims by WikiLeaks that John Kerry , the US secretary of state , had requested a private meeting with Ecuador last month â€ “ during a visit to Colombia to show support for a peace deal with leftwing rebels â€ “ specifically to ask the country to block Assange .
The US state department also denied the claim , saying reports of the meeting were â€œsimply untrueâ€ � .
â€œWhile our concerns about WikiLeaks
are longstanding , any suggestion that secretary Kerry or the state department were involved in shutting down WikiLeaks is false , â€ � State Department spokesman John Kirby said in a statement .
His deputy , Mark Toner , added later that Kerry had not even met with the Ecuador delegation during the talks .
â€œThere just was no meeting , â€ � he said .
â€œThey didnâ€ ™ t discuss any of this stuff.â€ �
The confirmation that Ecuador had shut down the internet at least put to rest one bizarre rumour , which surfaced after the Baywatch actress Pamela Anderson visited Assange in the embassy on Saturday , telling reporters she had brought him a vegan sandwich from Pret a Manger .
Three WikiLeaks tweets after her visit , labelled â€œpre - commitmentsâ€ � and containing strings of code , led to a brief , feverish conspiracy theory that Assange could be dead â€ “ with some even pointing to the sandwich as a possible culprit
â€ “ before the site explained its connection had been â€œintentionally severed by a state partyâ€ � .
Neither WikiLeaks nor Ecuadorâ€ ™ s foreign ministry responded to requests for comment on Wednesday , and it is unclear whether Assange will have been able to restore his internet access independently .
The journalist John Pilger , a close ally and frequent visitor of Assange in the embassy , told the Guardian that Assange â€œwill have a contingencyâ€ � , and stressed that WikiLeaks was bigger than its founder .
â€œI
canâ€
™ t imagine that the restrictions will stop the leaks or deter WikiLeaks and Assange , â€ � he said .
â€œThe significance of the action by Ecuador , which is clearly under pressure , is to show how frightened the US establishment is of further revelations reaching the public about its preferred presidential candidate.â€ �
WikiLeaks said it had â€œactivated the appropriate contingency plansâ€ � , and has continued to tweet links to its stream of damaging email leaks , most recently from the personal email account of the chairman of Clintonâ€ ™ s election campaign , John Podesta .
They included transcripts from speeches made to Goldman Sachs bankers in which she avoided any direct criticism of Wall Street , raising questions of an overly cosy relationship with the banking establishment .
But for a man who can not move beyond a handful of rooms in what is , in essence , a modest apartment , even the temporary loss of his connection with the outside world will be a significant blow and troubling development .
Ecuadorâ€ ™ s move to silence him points starkly to frustrations at some of Assangeâ€
™ s activities while on diplomatic premises .
Periodic rumours have emerged of strains between Assange and his Ecuadorean hosts in the more than four years he has lived in the embassy .
Confidential embassy documents leaked to Buzzfeed News last year revealed Assange had a late - night scuffle with a security guard in the embassy who said he had found the Australian tampering with security equipment in its secure room ( Assange said the guard had accosted him ) .
The documents also showed that embassy staff painstakingly monitor Assangeâ€ ™ s movements
â€ “ referring to him as â€œMr
Guestâ€ � â€ “ and contained references both to the stressful situation in which he lives and his â€œevident angerâ€
� and â€œfeelings of superiorityâ€ � .
Asked about occasional strains to the relationship , Pilger said : â€œWhen I met Ecuadorâ€ ™ s foreign minister and other officials not long ago , they spoke highly of Assange and Ecuadorâ€ ™ s commitment to protect him .
I have always regarded this small countryâ€ ™ s decision to give him asylum and refuge as a rare example of principle and courage.â€ �
For the foreseeable future , US election or not , Assange is unlikely to be going anywhere .
Sweden is still seeking to extradite him over a rape allegation that he denies , and he says that he could face onward extradition to the US , where WikiLeaks is being investigated over the Cablegate releases in 2010 .
â€œEcuador granted political asylum to Julian Assange in 2012 based on his legitimate fears of political persecution , â€ � the countryâ€ ™ s statement said , adding that it â€œreaffirms the asylum granted to [ him ] and reiterates its intention to safeguard his life and physical integrity until he reaches a safe placeâ€ � ."
2016-10-22,"Once widely maligned for leaking state secrets , Julian Assange , the founder of WikiLeaks , continues to win favor with the US right over the release of hacked emails from Hillary Clintonâ€ ™ s presidential campaign .
On Friday night , the Fox News personality Sean Hannity and David Duke , a US Senate candidate in Louisiana and former Ku Klux Klan grand wizard , became the latest to offer their support .
In response to a tweet from the Nebraska Republican senator Ben Sasse that was critical of the Clinton leaks , Hannity praised Assange and WikiLeaks for having â€œdone the USA a great serviceâ€ � by exposing â€œgovernment corruptionâ€ � and cybersecurity weakness .
Duke , meanwhile , posted an image of Assange with the caption â€œHEROâ€ � in the red and blue posterized style made famous by the artist Shepard Faireyâ€ ™ s 2008 depiction of Barack Obama .
Dukeâ€ ™ s expressions of support for Donald Trump have caused difficulties for the Republican presidential candidate .
WikiLeaks , which Assange founded in 2006 , has been posting daily batches of emails from Clintonâ€ ™ s campaign chair , John Podesta , seemingly in an attempt to harm Clintonâ€ ™ s electoral chances .
Among other things , the leaks have shown communications with journalists that were meant to be kept secret , political advice about rivals within and without the Democratic party , and details of the candidateâ€ ™ s paid speeches to Wall Street firms .
Clinton has raised questions about the possible involvement of Russian hackers in obtaining the documents â€ “ the US government has accused Russia of being behind the hacks against the Democratic National Committee â€ “ and what it would mean if Vladimir Putinâ€ ™ s government were trying influence the race .
Trump has said information disclosed in the leaks ought to disqualify Clinton from the presidential election .
Some observers believe Assange is personally antagonistic to Clinton , who was secretary of state when the US began investigating him for potential crimes under the Espionage Act .
WikiLeaks came to prominence in 2010 for a massive dump of diplomatic cables and army reports related to the Iraq and Afghanistan wars provided to media outlets including the Guardian by an American soldier , Chelsea Manning .
At the time , Hannity suggested that â€œpeople might dieâ€ � because of the leaks .
On Friday , he tweeted : â€œAnd I have said on radio and TV that my original fears were wrong .
My biggest fear was people would die as a result .
Listen , watch learn.â€ � Since 2012 , Assange has been running WikiLeaks from the Ecuadorian embassy in London , after applying for political asylum .
He is wanted in Sweden for rape , an accusation he links to a conspiracy to extradite him to the US to face charges .
This week , the Ecuadorian embassy said it had removed his internet access .
The US and Ecuador denied that they had conspired to do so ."

And finally ... Speculation about Donald Trumpâ€ ™ s post campaign career if he loses the US election has centred around some sort of TV network and forays by his allies into Facebook live streaming have given us a hint at what it might look like .
However , if the latest attempt - Live from Trump Tower , is anything to go by , they may have to do a lot more to become the darling of the alt - right .
As our reviewer put it : â€œThere is no discernible entertainment value to be had in Live from Trump Tower , unless your idea of a good time is significantly less professional than InfoWars , but with fewer insane people removing articles of clothing.â€ �"
2016-11-02,"A key confidante of Donald Trump has provided new details about the â€œmutual friendâ€ � of Julian Assange who served as a back channel to give him broad tips in advance about WikiLeaksâ€ ™ releases of emails to and from key allies of Hillary Clinton .
Roger Stone , a longtime unofficial adviser to the Republican presidential nominee , was briefed in general terms in advance about the sensitive and embarrassing leaked Democratic emails by an American libertarian who works in the media on the â€œopinion sideâ€ � , he told the Guardian in an interview .
Stone claims his American source , whom he declined to identify , has met with Assange , the WikiLeaks founder , in London and is a â€œmutual friendâ€ � of Stone and Assange .
The WikiLeaks source , Stone said , is not tied in any way to the Trump campaign but has served as a back channel for Stone , who is an outside adviser to the Republican presidential candidate , allowing the adviser to tweet and comment very broadly prior to some key WikiLeaks disclosures .
A source close to Trump Tower also told the Guardian that Stone once boasted to him of meeting with Assange himself and told the source , who is active in GOP political circles , that WikiLeaks would be â€œcoming down like a ton of bricksâ€ � on Clinton .
Stone adamantly denied meeting with Assange ( â€œYour source is bullshitting uâ€ �
he wrote in an email ) or having any direct contact with Assange or anyone with WikiLeaks .
Despite Stoneâ€ ™ s advance tweets and comments about some major WikiLeaks disclosures â€ “ including recent ones in October relating to Clinton campaign chair John Podesta and the Clinton Foundation â€ “ the self - styled â€œrabble rouserâ€ � and onetime Watergate dirty tricks operative said the FBI had not contacted him in its investigation into the illegal computer hacking of private Democratic emails , and he was not worried .
â€œThere is nothing to investigate , â€ � Stone said .
The Obama administration has accused Russia of being the source of the hack .
But Stoneâ€ ™ s tweets and comments about forthcoming WikiLeaks releases have put him in the media spotlight and is just one of the controversial ways he has played a role as an outside Trump booster and adviser , after a several - month stint last year as a key campaign insider .
In August , well before WikiLeaks released Podestaâ€ ™ s emails , Stone tweeted : â€œTrust me , it will soon [ be ]
Podestaâ€ ™ s time in the barrel.â€
�
After thousands of Podestaâ€ ™ s emails were published last month , Podesta told reporters : â€œItâ€ ™ s a reasonable conclusion that Mr Stone had advanced warning and the Trump campaign had advanced warning about what Assange was going to do.â€ �
In response to Podestaâ€ ™ s comments , Stone told the conservative Daily Caller : â€œIâ€ ™ ve admitted Iâ€ ™ ve been in communication with Assange through an intermediary ,
â€ � adding : â€œThey
donâ€ ™ t tell me what theyâ€ ™ re going to release.â€ �
Likewise in August , Stone told a Florida audience : â€œI actually have communicated with Assange .
I believe the next tranche of his documents pertain to the Clinton Foundation but thereâ€ ™ s no telling what the October surprise may be.â€ �
Last month , WikiLeaks released thousands of internal emails about the Clinton Foundation , including ones alleging a gender pay gap .
But Stone dismissed suggestions by Podesta and some congressional Democrats that he may have played a role in WikiLeaks releases or the hacking , stressing that he has no financial or client ties to Russia .
Stone , who said he talked to Trump about once a week on average , is a regular on Infowars and other conservative talk radio shows , pushing conspiracy theories and espousing the unsubstantiated view , as Trump does , that the elections are rigged .
â€œThe entire election has been rigged , including the debates , â€ �
Stone told the Guardian .
Given that premise , Stone has been leading a controversial exit poll project in nine cities that has been attacked as potential â€œvoter suppressionâ€ � by independent experts , spawned a lawsuit from Democrats , and prompted one GOP operative who knows Stone to exclaim : â€œItâ€ ™ s right out of a Roger playbook as an example of voter suppression.â€ �
Moreover , Stone said he â€œtotally supportsâ€
�
Trumpâ€ ™ s position of waiting until after the election to say whether he will accept the results if he loses .
â€œIt will depend solely on whether the election has been fairly conducted.â€ � â€œRoger operates by a different set of rules , and his object is to disrupt , â€ �
Peter Kelly , a former lobbying partner and a Democrat , told the Guardian .
â€œHe traffics in the unusual.â€
�
Stone was a junior figure in Richard Nixonâ€ ™ s dirty tricks operation during the presidentâ€ ™ s re - election campaign in 1972 when , aged only 19 , he pulled off two political scams , according to the 1973 congressional hearings on Watergate , hiring a GOP operative to infiltrate the campaign of Democrat George McGovern and making contributions to Republican Pete McCloskey in the name of the Young Socialist Alliance .
After Stoneâ€ ™ s covert operations were revealed , he was sacked from his job on Senator Bob Doleâ€ ™ s staff .
He has a tattoo of Nixonâ€ ™ s face on his back .
Several unsuccessful attempts were made to contact Assange for comment on any direct or indirect contact with Stone he may have had ."

2016-11-14,"A senior Swedish prosecutor has begun interviewing Julian Assange at Ecuadorâ€ ™ s embassy in London , six years after a woman in Stockholm accused the WikiLeaks of rape .
Ingrid Isgren ,
Swedenâ€ ™ s deputy chief prosecutor , arrived at 9.30am on Monday at the central London embassy where Assange has been confined since June 2012 .
Assange sought asylum from Ecuador to avoid extradition to Sweden over the accusation , which he denies .
Isgren was greeted by dozens of photographers , international TV crews and a small number of the Australianâ€ ™ s supporters , who unfurled banners and chanted their support .
She paused briefly for photographs but did not speak to reporters .
Prosecutors have said they will not comment while the investigation is ongoing .
Three days have been set aside for the interview , which is being conducted by an Ecuadorian prosecutor , following a list of questions submitted earlier this year by the Swedish prosecution authority .
Isgren is allowed to ask Assange to clarify his answers , but not to put additional questions , and will receive a written transcript of the exchanges from Ecuador after the interview has concluded .
Her office has said it will seek to take a DNA sample from Assange if he agrees .
Assangeâ€ ™ s Swedish lawyer , Per Samuelson , said he had been barred from the interview .
â€œEcuador refuses to let me in and insists that the questioning will continue without my presence , against my clientâ€ ™ s wishes to have me there ,
â€ � he told Reuters .
Samuelson said he still hoped to be admitted if the interview continued , â€œbut a good chunk of questioning has already taken place , as far as I understandâ€ � .
In a statement released on Monday night , WikiLeaks said there had been â€œnumerous irregularitiesâ€ � in the Swedish investigation .
â€œUnfortunately , the irregularities with procedure have continued today , â€ �
it said , citing the fact that Samuelson had not been permitted to attend , which it called a â€œclear breach of processâ€ � .
It said Assange â€œfelt compelled to participate even with these problemsâ€ � .
Swedenâ€ ™ s investigation of the rape accusation has been locked in stalemate since he fled to the embassy .
Prosecutors initially insisted he would have to travel to Sweden to be interviewed , but Assange refused , arguing that it would put him at risk of onward extradition to the US for potential prosecution over WikiLeaks publications .
Prosecutors finally agreed to questioning in London after coming under increased pressure in Sweden to move the case forward .
In November 2014 , Swedenâ€ ™ s appeal court rejected Assangeâ€ ™ s appeal against the warrant but criticised the countryâ€ ™ s chief prosecutor , Marianne Ny , over her failure to examine alternative avenues of investigation .
The court upheld the warrant again upheld in September this year .
In February , a UN panel said Assangeâ€ ™ s continued presence at the embassy amounted to â€œarbitrary detentionâ€ � .
An investigation into separate sexual assault allegations a second Swedish woman made against Assange had to be dropped last year after the deadline to bring charges expired .
The human rights campaigner Peter Tatchell joined the Australianâ€ ™ s supporters outside the embassy .
He said he was appalled that it had taken Swedish prosecutors six years to come to interview him .
â€œI have always said that Julian Assange should answer the serious sex allegations .
For the last six years he has been willing to answer those allegations .
He has never been charged with any offence , â€ � Tatchell said .
There was no sign of the WikiLeaks founder , but his pet cat , which has its own Twitter account , @EmbassyCat , appeared at the window wearing a fake collar and tie ."

2016-11-22,"One of the webâ€ ™ s most virulent incubators of fake news stories about the US election has begun a crackdown on conspiracy theories and â€œoutlandish or unverified claimsâ€ � .
Moderators on a Reddit group r / the_donald , which became a focal point for supporters of Donald Trump during the election , explained on Tuesday morning that they had been removing some posts about two conspiracy theories because they were â€œdrowning out thoughtful discussion or Trump related contentâ€ � .
The two theories concern false claims of a pedophile ring run from a pizza restaurant tangentially linked to Hillary Clinton and suggestions that Julian Assange , currently holed up in the Ecuadorian embassy in London , has disappeared .
In a post addressed to r / the_donaldâ€ ™ s almost 300,000 subscribers , referred to as Centipedes , moderator IFIFIFOKIEDOKE explained that those running the subreddit were also concerned about â€œshills and trollsâ€ �
posting outlandish claims to discredit the moderators themselves .
â€œA hot topic lately has been how we as a moderation team have handled some sensitive topics such as pizzagate and the alleged disappearance of Julian Assange .
We are well aware that the community wants us to promote awareness of these two topics ( among others ) and we have heard your feedback and concerns about what is perceived as censorship , â€ � the moderator wrote .
â€œI will do everyone a favor and be completely transparent â€ “
yes , we remove quite a bit of this content .
Why ?
The vast majority of what gets posted here in regards to these topics is simply concern trolling about us not giving them sticky space , outlandish and unverifiable claims , or illegal content .
We also allow a portion of it to remain on the sub , though we do not provide it sticky space.â€ �
â€œAdditionally , we have detected ( more than a few times ) shills and trolls intentionally piggybacking on these controversial topics to slander and attack our community .
They want to paint us as lunatics and turn our community against the moderators â€ ¦
This strain of trolls have successfully created a narrative or idea that we are censoring these topics.â€

The rise of fake news has become a cause of concern for much of the media , and outgoing president Barack Obama , following the surprise election win for Trump .
Many have focused on the role of Facebook , which recently announced that it was acting to address its fake news problem .
But sites such as Reddit often play a key role in seeding stories that find a larger audience on other social networks .
Despite being smaller than many of Redditâ€ ™ s communities , r / the_donald has consistently been ranked as among the most active and less than two weeks ago it helped disseminate false claims that people were being bussed in to attend an anti - Trump protest in Austin , Texas .
Trump himself has taken the sub - Reddit seriously , hosting an Ask Me
Anything session for its users in July during which he answered 13 questions .
Though the post on r / the_donald suggests its moderators want to limit the amount of unverified content in that particular group , the moderators are clear they are not objecting to it being hosted elsewhere on Reddit .
In the post they say that they will direct users to threads dedicated to the two conspiracies , and they are also planning to set up a dedicated subreddit with â€œthe overall theme of investigating corruption in politicsâ€ � ."
2016-11-29,"The WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange has no â€œquick way outâ€ � of the Ecuadorean embassy in London where he took refuge more than four years ago , Ecuadorâ€ ™ s prosecutor has said .
An Ecuadorean state attorney accompanied by a Swedish prosecutor questioned Assange at the embassy on 14 November over allegations that he committed rape in Sweden in 2010 .
Ecuadorâ€ ™ s prosecutor , Galo Chiriboga , said Ecuadorean officials would send the official transcript of Assangeâ€ ™ s evidence to Swedish authorities â€œin mid - Decemberâ€ � .
Assange , who is Australian , has said he fears deportation to Sweden and the United States , where he could be charged for the publication of hundreds of thousands of secret US diplomatic cables .
â€œFour years have passed and we are only at this stage , but that is no longer attributable to Ecuador , it is attributable to Swedish prosecutors .
I do not think there is a quick way out , â€ � Chiriboga said .
Assange , who has denied the rape charges , is also wanted by British authorities for violating the conditions of his house arrest , which he fled to seek refuge at the embassy .
Ecuadorâ€ ™ s foreign minister , Guillaume Long , has said Assange should receive guarantees that he will not be extradited if he faces justice in Sweden .
A DNA sample had been taken by British police from Assange at the embassy for Swedish prosecutors to use in their investigation against him , Chiriboga said .
â€œTherefore Sweden will now have to request that DNA sample from the British police , â€ � the prosecutor said .

2016-12-07,"A lawyer acting for the woman who made rape allegations against Julian Assange has accused him of â€œviolatingâ€ � her client in the media , after the WikiLeaks founder released a statement detailing answers he gave to Swedish investigators .
Assange on Wednesday thumbed his nose at Swedish officials , who he says have robbed him of his freedom for six years , by releasing the answers he gave to them under questioning at Ecuadorâ€ ™ s London embassy last month .
The statement sets out for the first time a detailed account by Assange of his encounter with the woman in August 2010 .
Elisabeth Massi Fritz , the lawyer for the accuser , said
Assangeâ€ ™ s decision to release details of their relationship in the statement was â€œunfortunateâ€ � .
She later accused Assange of â€œviolatingâ€ � her client in the media .
â€œAssange seems to be desperate .
As soon as he has something to say he calls the media and is conducting the investigation through the media , â€ � she told the Swedish broadcaster SVT .
â€œThe only thing I can say is that Assange has low credibility , which we will prove when we prosecute .
I expect the prosecutor to issue charges .
I also expect Assange to stop violating my client in the media .
She has suffered more than enough for six years.â€
�
The transcript of a police interview with the woman was leaked to the media in December 2010 , which the Australian , who has not been charged with any crime , says helped to establish an aura of guilt around him .
Since then , Assange has repeatedly asked to be allowed to tell his side of the story to prosecutors , but until recently they insisted he come to Sweden for questioning .
Assange has been confined to Ecuadorâ€ ™ s
London embassy since June 2012 after claiming asylum to avoid extradition over the allegations .
â€œI am now releasing my statement to the public , â€ � Assange said in a letter accompanying the document on Wednesday .
â€œThe reason is simple .
I want people to know the truth about how abusive this process has
been.â€ � The release of the statement was expected to prompt dismay in Sweden , where prosecutorsâ€ ™ desire for personal aspects of the case to remain confidential has led them to deny Assange access to evidence against him because of the risk that it might become public .
In correspondence with Ecuador over the conditions of Assangeâ€ ™ s interrogation , the Swedish prosecutor in the case , Marianne Ny , insisted the proceedings remain private to protect the plaintiff .
A spokesperson for Ny told the Guardian she was awaiting the formal report on the interviews from Ecuador , due this month , before deciding on her next step .
The statement , which Assange read out to investigators in response to their questioning , contains a sustained attack on the prosecutor , for whom he claims the interview in London was â€œsimply a ruse to tick a box to ensure the technical possibility to indict meâ€ � .
Under Swedish law , an interview with the suspect is an essential step before issuing charges .
The statement fleshes out Assangeâ€ ™ s argument that he is at risk of extradition from Sweden to the US to face espionage charges â€ “ and potentially a life behind bars .
Last week the UNâ€ ™ s working group on arbitrary detention rejected an appeal by the UK against its February ruling that the risks facing Assange if he left the embassy meant his situation amounted to a prolonged deprivation of liberty â€œin breach of the principles of reasonableness , necessity and proportionalityâ€ � .
Until now , Assange has not described his sexual encounter with his accuser .
He has not publicly apologised to her or tried to mitigate the distress she says she has been caused .
Assangeâ€ ™ s statement says that , owing to US hostility towards WikiLeaks , his bank cards were blocked after his arrival in Sweden in the summer of 2010 at the peak of the Pentagonâ€ ™ s conflict with him over the release of a trove of diplomatic and military documents .
He says this made him highly dependent on the hospitality of others .
The woman â€œappeared to be sympathetic to my plight and also appeared to be romantically interested in meâ€ � , Assange told prosecutors .
â€œShe was not close to people I was close to , so it seemed that those who meant me harm would be unlikely to try to find me by monitoring her movements.â€ �
She â€œmade it very clear that she wanted to have sexual intercourseâ€ � with Assange and placed his hands on her breasts while in a cinema , he continued .
â€œI felt concerned about the intensity of [ her ] interest and I also deeply loved another woman , which played on my mind and left me emotionally distracted.â€ �
The intensity of her interest made him fear how she might react if she felt he was rejecting her , he said .
He claimed he later discovered she had collected dozens of photos of him in the weeks before they met , her Flickr photo account filled with â€œpages and pagesâ€ � of photos of Assange .
After they had unprotected sex , she wanted him to have a test for sexually transmitted diseases , the statement continues .
â€œWe were in agreement and arranged to meet the following day in the nearby park around lunchtime , when I would have time to get tested .
She said she was fine and seemed at ease .
You can imagine my disbelief when I woke the next morning to the news that I had been arrested in my absence for â€˜rapeâ€ ™ and that police were â€˜huntingâ€ ™ all over Stockholm for me.â€ � Assange claims that text messages sent by the woman at the time â€ “ access to which his lawyers were allowed only briefly and early in the case â€ “ show she was not asleep during the sex .
According to the transcripts leaked to the Guardian in 2010 , the woman told police she met Assange at a seminar at which he was speaking , and afterwards went to the cinema with him , where they kissed in the back row .
Two days later , she arranged to meet him and they went to her flat .
They started to have sex , she said , but she moved away because Assange had not wanted to wear a condom , and he fell asleep .
She told police they later had sex at least once when he had â€œunwillinglyâ€ � worn a condom , but the following morning , after she had gone to buy breakfast and then climbed back into bed and fallen asleep , she had woken to find him having sex with her without a condom .
According to the statement , she told him : â€œYou better not have HIV , â€ � and he answered : â€œOf course not , â€ �
but â€œshe couldnâ€ ™ t be bothered to tell him one more time because she had been going on about the condom all night .
She had never had unprotected sex before.â€

The statement says she bought the morning - after pill and took an STD test but when she telephoned Assange asking him to be tested he said he didnâ€ ™ t have the time .
Assange has made no secret of his contempt for the Swedish prosecutor , but his decision to release his side of the story appears calculated to place further pressure on Ny to end the stalemate in the case , either by issuing a rape charge â€ “ and implicitly explaining the evidence for the charge â€ “ or lifting the arrest warrant against him .
â€œIn the past the prosecution has fed partial information to tabloids that politically oppose me , â€ � Assange said .
â€œIt is better that my statement , which I am happy with , and which makes it obvious to all that I am innocent , sees the light in full.â€ �"
2016-12-07,"Julian Assange has thumbed his nose at Swedish investigators , who he says have robbed him of his freedom for six years , by releasing the answers he gave to them under questioning in Ecuadorâ€ ™ s London embassy last month .
The decision to issue the statement , which contains for the first time a detailed account by the WikiLeaks founder of his encounter with a woman in August 2010 who made rape allegations against him , marks a fresh twist in a case in which Assange claims an early leak of information from the Swedish police has shaped opinion .
The transcript of a police interview with the woman was leaked to media in December 2010 , which the Australian , who has not been charged with any crime , says helped to establish an aura of guilt around him .
Since then , Assange has repeatedly asked to be allowed to tell his side of the story to prosecutors , but until recently they insisted he come to Sweden for questioning .
Assange has been confined to Ecuadorâ€ ™ s cramped London embassy since June 2012 , after claiming asylum to avoid extradition over the allegations .
â€œI am now releasing my statement to the public , â€ � Assange says in a letter accompanying the document .
â€œThe reason is simple .
I want people to know the truth about how abusive this process has
been.â€ �
The release of the statement is likely to be met with dismay in Sweden , where prosecutorsâ€ ™ desire for personal aspects of the case to remain confidential has led them to deny Assange access to evidence against him , because of the risk that it might become public .
The move was condemned by Elisabeth Massi Fritz , the lawyer for Assangeâ€ ™ s accuser , who said that his decision to release details of their relationship the statement was â€œunfortunateâ€ � .
She later accused Assange of â€œviolatingâ€ � her client in the media .
â€œAssange seems to be desperate .
As soon as he has something to say he calls the media and is conducting the investigation through the media , â€ � she told Swedish broadcaster SVT .
â€œThe only thing I can say is that Assange has low credibility , which we will prove when we prosecute .
I expect the prosecutor to issue charges .
I also expect Assange to stop violating my client in the media .
She has suffered more than enough for six years.â€ �
In correspondence with Ecuador over the conditions of Assangeâ€ ™ s interrogation , the Swedish prosecutor in the case , Marianne Ny , insisted the proceedings remain private to protect the plaintiff .
A spokesperson for Ny told the Guardian she was awaiting the formal report on the interviews from Ecuador , due this month , before deciding on her next step .
The statement , which Assange read out to investigators in response to their questioning , contains a sustained attack on the prosecutor , for whom he claims the interview in London was â€œsimply a ruse to tick a box to ensure the technical possibility to indict meâ€ � .
Under Swedish law , an interview with the suspect is an essential step before issuing charges .
The statement fleshes out Assangeâ€ ™ s argument that he is at risk of extradition from Sweden to the US to face espionage charges â€ “ and potentially a life behind bars .
Last week , the UNâ€ ™ s working group on arbitrary detention rejected an appeal by the UK against its February ruling that the risks facing Assange if he leaves the embassy mean his situation amounts to a prolonged deprivation of liberty â€œin breach of the principles of reasonableness , necessity and proportionalityâ€ � .
Until now , Assange has not described his sexual encounter with his accuser .
He has not publicly apologised to her or tried to mitigate the distress she has been caused .
Assangeâ€ ™ s statement says that , owing to US hostility towards WikiLeaks , his bank cards were blocked after his arrival in Sweden in the summer of 2010 at the peak of the Pentagonâ€ ™ s conflict with him over the release of a trove of diplomatic and military documents .
This made him highly dependent on the hospitality of others .
The woman â€œappeared to be sympathetic to my plight and also appeared to be romantically interested in meâ€ � , Assange told prosecutors .
â€œShe was not close to people I was close to , so it seemed that those who meant me harm would be unlikely to try to find me by monitoring her movements.â€ �
She â€œmade it very clear that she wanted to have sexual intercourseâ€ � with Assange and placed his hands on her breasts while in a cinema , he continued .
â€œI felt concerned about the intensity of [ her ] interest and I also deeply loved another woman , which played on my mind and left me emotionally distracted.â€ �
The intensity of her interest made him fear how she might react if she felt he was rejecting her , he said .
He claimed he later discovered she had collected dozens of photos of him in the weeks before they met , her Flickr photo account filled with â€œpages and pagesâ€ � of photos of Assange .
After they had unprotected sex , she wanted him to have a test for sexually transmitted diseases , the statement continues .
â€œWe were in agreement and arranged to meet the following day in the nearby park around lunchtime , when I would have time to get tested .
She said she was fine and seemed at ease .
You can imagine my disbelief when I woke the next morning to the news that I had been arrested in my absence for â€˜rapeâ€ ™ and that police were â€˜huntingâ€ ™ all over Stockholm for me.â€ � Assange claims that text messages sent by the woman at the time â€ “ access to which his lawyers were allowed only briefly and early in the case â€ “ show that she was not asleep during the sex .
â€œI was certain [ she ] was not asleep .
I was also certain she expressly consented to unprotected sex before such intercourse started.â€
�
The woman has insisted that a prerequisite of intercourse was that a condom be used .
He claims the texts also show that the woman said at the time she â€œdid not want to put any charges on Julian Assangeâ€ � , but that â€œthe police were keen on getting their hands on himâ€ � and that she was â€œshocked when they arrested himâ€ � because she â€œonly wanted him to take a testâ€ � .
According to the transcripts leaked to the Guardian in 2010 , the woman told police she met Assange at a seminar at which he was speaking , and afterwards went to the cinema with him , where they kissed in the back row .
Two days later , she arranged to meet him and they went to her flat .
They started to have sex , she said , but she moved away because Assange had not wanted to wear a condom , and he fell asleep .
She told police they later had sex at least once when he had â€œunwillinglyâ€ � worn a condom , but the following morning , after she had gone to buy breakfast and then climbed back into bed and fallen asleep , she had woken to find him having sex with her without a condom .
According to the statement , she told him : â€œYou better not have HIVâ€ � and he answered â€œOf course not , â€ � but â€œshe couldnâ€ ™ t be bothered to tell him one more time because she had been going on about the condom all night .
She had never had unprotected sex before.â€

The statement says that she bought the morning after pill and took an STD test but when she telephoned Assange asking him to be tested he said he didnâ€ ™ t have the time .

And finally ... In a blatant blowing of the Guardianâ€ ™ s own trumpet , weâ€ ™ d like to draw your attention to the fact we won three prizes at the British Journalism Awards on Tuesday night , including best investigation for the Panama Papers ."
2016-12-24,"Julian Assange , the founder of WikiLeaks , has offered guarded praise of Donald Trump , arguing the president - elect â€œis not a DC insiderâ€ � and could mean an opportunity for positive as well as negative change in the US .
Assange described his feelings about the US election results in an interview as â€œmixedâ€ � before going on to sharply criticize Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton and providing a more ambivalent assessment of Trumpâ€ ™ s ascent to the White House .
â€œHillary Clintonâ€ ™ s election would have been a consolidation of power in the existing ruling class of the United States , â€ � Assange told the Italian newspaper la Repubblica .
â€œDonald
Trump is not a DC insider , he is part of the wealthy ruling elite of the United States , and he is gathering around him a spectrum of other rich people and several idiosyncratic personalities.â€ �
He added : â€œThey do not by themselves form an existing structure , so it is a weak structure which is displacing and destabilising the pre - existing central power network within DC .
It is a new patronage structure which will evolve rapidly , but at the moment its looseness means there are opportunities for change in the United States : change for the worse and change for the better.â€ �
In the week leading up to the election , Assange used his whistleblowing website to publish a cascade of emails connected to the Democratic party and the Clinton campaign .
The releases were highly damaging to Clinton , and US intelligence officials now believe they were hacked by Russia and passed to WikiLeaks to boost Trumpâ€ ™ s bid for the White House .
Assange has repeatedly declined to be drawn on the source of the hacked emails he published .
Roger Stone , a longtime Republican operative and associate of Trump , said in August that he had been in communication with Assange over an â€œOctober
surpriseâ€ � to foil Clinton .
WikiLeaks began publishing emails hacked from the Democratic National Committee and the email account of Clintonâ€ ™ s campaign chairman , John Podesta , in October .
It is impossible to know how much the email disclosures affected the outcome of the race , but there is little doubt the revelations harmed Clintonâ€ ™ s prospects during the crucial last weeks of the campaign .
Assange made the disclosures from the Ecuadorean embassy in London , where he has been hold up for more than four years , claiming asylum to avoid extradition to Sweden , where prosecutors are investigating allegations of rape against him .
Assange denies the accusations .
Some of the earliest and most high - profile WikiLeaks revelations , including those based on leaks by Chelsea Manning , occurred when Clinton was secretary of state .
â€œHillary Clinton and the network around her imprisoned one of our alleged sources for 35 years , Chelsea Manning , tortured her according to the United Nations , in order to implicate me personally , â€ � Assange claimed in the interview .
He went on to accuse Clinton of being the â€œchief proponent and architectâ€ � of the military intervention in Libya , which he claimed had created instability throughout the region and the refugee crisis in Europe .
Appearing to suggest the disclosures in the run - up to the election were a form of payback , he added : â€œIf someone and their network behave like that , then there are consequences .
Internal and external opponents are generated .
Now there is a separate question on what Donald Trump means.â€ �
The la Repubblica interviewer noted that most of Wikileaks biggest revelations concerned what she described as â€œUS human rights abusesâ€
� .
Asked why human rights abuses in China and Russia had not produced similar leaks , and what could be done to â€œdemocratise information in those countriesâ€ � , Assange said there was already a â€œvibrantâ€ � Russian media which included critics of the Kremlin .
He said : â€œIn Russia , there are many vibrant publications , online blogs , and Kremlin critics such as [ Alexey ] Navalny are part of that spectrum .
There are also newspapers like â€œNovaya Gazetaâ€ � , in which different parts of society in Moscow are permitted to critique each other and it is tolerated , generally , because it isnâ€ ™ t a big TV channel that might have a mass popular effect , its audience is educated people in Moscow .
So my interpretation is that in Russia there are competitors to WikiLeaks.â€ �
In addition , he claimed â€œno WikiLeaks staff speak Russian , so for a strong culture which has its own language , you have to be seen as a local player.â€ �
Dozens of journalists have been killed in Russia in the past two decades , and Freedom House considers the Russian press to be â€œnot freeâ€ � and notes : â€œThe main national news agenda is firmly controlled by the Kremlin .
The government sets editorial policy at state - owned television stations , which dominate the media landscape and generate propagandistic content.â€ �
This article was amended on 29 December 2016 to remove a sentence in which it was asserted that Assange â€œhas long had a close relationship with the Putin regimeâ€ � .
A sentence was also amended which paraphrased the interview , suggesting Assange said â€œthere was no need for Wikileaks to undertake a whistleblowing role in Russia because of the open and competitive debate he claimed exists thereâ€ � .
It has been amended to more directly describe the question Assange was responding to when he spoke of Russiaâ€ ™ s â€œmany vibrant publicationsâ€ � ."
2017-01-04,"Leading Republicans broke with Donald Trump on Wednesday after the president - elect appeared to put more faith in WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange than in US intelligence agencies .
The sharp differences on a highly charged national security issue are the latest sign that matters of intelligence and policy towards Russia reflect a deep fault line in Trumpâ€ ™ s relationship with the Republican party establishment .
The House speaker , Paul Ryan , called Assange â€œa sycophant for Russiaâ€ � on a conservative radio show and GOP Senator Tom Cotton told MSNBC that he had â€œa lot more faith in our intelligence officers serving around the world â€ ¦ than I do in people like Julian Assange â€ � .
The comments followed tweets from Trump on Wednesday morning in which he approvingly repeated Assangeâ€ ™ s claim that the Russian state was not the source of the hacked emails from the Democratic National Committee and the Clinton campaign chairman , John Podesta , published by Wiki Leaks during the election .
â€œJulian Assange said â€˜a 14 year old could have hacked Podesta â€ ™ â€ “ why was DNC so careless ?
Also said Russians did not give him the info !
â€ �
one Trump tweet said .
Another quoted Assange as describing US media coverage on the issue as â€œvery dishonestâ€ � .
Trump added : â€œMore dishonest than anyone knows.â€ �
The tweets referred to an interview with Assange conducted by Fox News commentator Sean Hannity , a vocal Trump supporter , in the Ecuadorean embassy in London , where the Australian computer expert and transparency advocate has been living for more than four years , since sexual assault allegations were made against him in Sweden .
He denies the allegations and has not been charged with any crime .
Assange is also under US criminal investigation for the publication of large numbers of classified US documents by WikiLeaks , an act characterised for many years by Republican and many Democrat leaders as an act of aggression against the US .
In the interview , Assange said : â€œOur source is not the Russian government and it is not a state party.â€ � US intelligence agencies have suggested that Russia passed the hacked material to WikiLeaks through intermediaries .
Asked about the Trump tweets , the president electâ€ ™ s spokesman , Sean Spicer said the president - elect â€œwas stating what Assange is stating publicly and looking forward to [ a forthcoming intelligence ] briefing to discuss all of these matters.â€ �
Last month Obama deported 35 Russian diplomats in response to the election hacking , in a move criticised as premature by the Trump team .
The president elect praised Vladimir Putin for not taking retaliatory measures , saying : â€œI always knew he was very smart!â€ �
Trump has said he would make public new facts over election hacking known only to him either on Tuesday or Wednesday this week .
The spat is being played out at a time when one investigation into Russian hacking of the US election is nearing completion and another is just beginning .
Both have the potential to undermine the legitimacy of the Trump presidency .
An intelligence community review of the evidence is expected to be delivered to Obama on Thursday and will form the basis for a briefing for Trump from top intelligence officials on Friday .
Meanwhile , hearings begin on Russian cyber - attacks on Thursday in the Senate Armed Services Committee , chaired by John McCain , a Republican with hardline views on Russia .
McCain called the alleged Russian cyber - attacks â€œan act of warâ€ � on Wednesday .
â€œIâ€
™ m not saying itâ€ ™ s an atomic attack , â€ � he said .
â€œIâ€
™ m just saying that when you attack a nationâ€ ™ s fundamental structure , which they are doing , then itâ€ ™ s an act of war.â€ � Trumpâ€ ™ s support for Assange has not led to break with all his Republican allies .
Sarah Palin said on Wednesday that she now regretted her attacks on Assange in 2010 after he published leaked documents from her time as governor of Alaska .
â€œHe is an anti - American operative with blood on his hands .
His past posting of classified documents revealed the identity of more than 100 Afghan sources to the Taliban , â€ �
she said at the time .
â€œWhy was he not pursued with the same urgency we pursue al - Qaeda and Taliban leaders?â€ �
Palin now says she has changed her mind since WikiLeaks published Democratic Party emails .
â€œThe media collusion that hid what many on the Left have been supporting is shocking .
This important information that finally opened peopleâ€ ™ s eyes to democrat candidates and operatives would not have been exposed were it not for Julian Assange ,
â€ � she wrote on Facebook .
The Republican foreign policy establishment however , has been more resistant to such whiplash changes in views and allegiances .
Many senior figures are uneasy about Trumpâ€ ™ s open feud with the US intelligence community .
On Tuesday , the president elect trolled the US agencies , going so far as putting the word intelligence in quote marks .
â€œThe â€˜Intelligenceâ€ ™ briefing on so - called â€˜Russian hackingâ€ ™ was delayed until Friday , perhaps more time needed to build a case .
Very strange!â€ � he said on Twitter .
In response , intelligence officials briefed correspondents that the plan had always been for the Russian briefing to take place on Friday , and referred to his remarks as â€œadversarialâ€ � ."
2017-01-04,"In two morning tweets , Donald Trump took the side of WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange on the key question of whether election - related emails published by Assange came from Moscow ( which happens to be the CIAâ€ ™ s opinion ) .
Where does the president - electâ€ ™ s apparent sympathy for an erstwhile public enemy come from ?
No saying â€ “ but
Trump pal Sean Hannity has for months given Assange favorable coverage for WikiLeaksâ€ ™ subversion of Democrats .
House speaker Paul Ryan called Assange â€œa sycophant for Russiaâ€ � on a conservative radio show and GOP senator Tom Cotton told MSNBC that he had â€œa lot more faith in our intelligence officers serving around the world â€ ¦ than I do in people like Julian Assangeâ€ � .

2017-01-11,"Julian Assange , the founder of WikiLeaks , has taken part in an online interview session in which he faced questions from the public on subjects ranging from his relationship with Russia to whether he was , in fact , still alive .
Assange , who sought political asylum at the Ecuadorian embassy in London and who has been living there since 2012 , participated in the Reddit Ask Me Anything ( AMA ) event on Tuesday .
He has faced criticism for what critics have alleged was interference in the US election .
WikiLeaks published batches of information about the Democratic nominee , Hillary Clinton , which some believe cost her the US presidential election .
In the AMA , some questions about links to Russia , WikiLeaksâ€ ™ s ethics and relationship with Fox News were either ignored or given one - word answers .
Velocity_Rob summed up the frustration expressed by some users .
â€œFor someone who claims theyâ€ ™ re all about transparency and openness , your answers here really donâ€ ™ t live up to those lofty ideals .
Terse one - word answers , ignoring really pertinent questions , what exactly is the point of this AMA ?
LameMeme did receive an answer to the question : â€œPlease address the allegations that WikiLeaks has a friendly relationship with Russia and can not be considered objective with their leaks and their agenda .
The timeline that makes these allegations seem plausible : 10/26/10 - WikiLeaks ready to drop a bombshell on Russia 11/01/10 - Russiaâ€ ™ s FSB to WikiLeaks : We Can Destroy You 1/20/11 - Julian Assange gets Russian visa

you are so adamant that Russia was not involved in the recent leaks that played a major role in the US presidential election , it would be helpful if you can make a compelling case for why Americans should trust you over their own intelligence agencies whose reason for existence is to defend the US against foreign threats and who are saying the opposite about Russian involvement.â€ � Assange gave a substantial reply which included : â€œWikiLeaks has published more than 10 m million documents over 10 years .
We have a 100 % accuracy rate on authenticating our publications
â€
¦ WikiLeaks has published more than 800,000 documents that relate to Russia or Vladimir Putin .
Most of those are critical.â€
�
Gddboygb , another participant , also received a substantial reply for the query : â€œPeople frequently group you together with Edward Snowden because youâ€ ™ ve both released classified American documents .
But your motivations and [ philosophies ] couldnâ€ ™ t be more different .
Snowden claims to fight for privacy .
Heâ€
™ s called privacy the bedrock of freedom , that one can not be free without privacy .
â€œYou have called privacy obsolete and unsustainable .
Youâ€ ™ ve said that privacy has no inherent value .
You appear to believe privacy and freedom are incompatible , that you can not be free if others can keep secrets from you .
Youâ€ ™ ve published the credit card numbers , social security numbers , medical information , and sexual preferences of individuals of zero public interest .
Two of your most recent publications are the personal Gmail inboxes of civilians , exactly the sort of thing Snowden has tried to protect .
Can you convince me that youâ€ ™ re right and Snowdenâ€ ™ s wrong?â€ � Assange replied in part : â€œEdward has been a very important voice in talking about the importance of different aspects of them , but he has had no control .
The result is that more than 97 % of the Snowden documents have been censored .
Enormously important material censored and while there have been some good journalists working on them , and I think Glenn Greenwald is one of the best journalists publishing in the United States , you have to have hundreds of people and engineers working on material like this to understand what is going
on.â€

Assange closed the session by addressing rumours that he was no longer alive or had been kidnapped .

An earlier version said LameMeme and Gddboygb did not receive replies to their questions .
That was incorrect , and the replies from Assange have been added ."
2017-01-18,"A lawyer for Julian Assange has indicated that the WikiLeaks founder is ready to face extradition to the US after Barack Obama commuted the sentence of US army whistleblower Chelsea Manning .
Assange has been holed up at the Ecuadorian embassy in London since claiming asylum there in 2012 .
He has refused to meet prosecutors in Sweden , where he remains wanted on an allegation of rape , which he denies .
He has repeatedly said he fears extradition to the US on espionage charges if he leaves the embassy , though at the moment the only public extradition ruling against him comes from Sweden .
Assange welcomed Obamaâ€ ™ s decision to free Manning , who passed 700,000 documents , videos , diplomatic cables and battlefield accounts to WikiLeaks .
â€œYour courage and determination made the impossible possible , â€ � Assange said in a statement thanking campaigners for their efforts to get her released .
He did not mention a pledge made last week that he would agree to US extradition if Obama granted clemency to Manning : But Melinda Taylor , who serves on Assangeâ€ ™ s legal team , said he would not be going back on his word .
â€œEverything that he has said heâ€
™ s standing by , â€ � she told the Associated Press .
The WikiLeaks Twitter accounted also suggested its founder was ready to go to the US :
The White House insisted on Tuesday that Assangeâ€ ™ s offer to submit to extradition if Obama â€œgrants
Manning clemencyâ€ � did not influence the US presidentâ€
™ s action .
â€œThe presidentâ€ ™ s
decision to offer commutation was not influenced by public comments by Mr Assange or the WikiLeaks organisation , â€ � the White House official said .
â€œI have no insight into Mr Assangeâ€ ™ s travel plans .
I canâ€ ™ t speak to any charges or potential charges he may be facing from the justice department.â€ �
In his statement , Assange said Manning should never have been convicted and described her as â€œa hero , whose bravery should have been applauded not condemnedâ€ � .
Assange went on to demand that the US government â€œimmediately end its war on whistleblowers and publishers , such as WikiLeaks and myselfâ€ � .
Another lawyer for Assange , Barry Pollack , did not address whether Assange intended to come to the US .
â€œFor many months , I have asked the DoJ to clarify Mr Assangeâ€ ™ s status .
I hope it will soon ,
â€ �
he said in a statement .
â€œThe Department of Justice should not pursue any charges against Mr Assange based on his publication of truthful information and should close its criminal investigation of him immediately.â€
�
The justice department has never announced any indictment of Assange and it is not clear that any charges have been brought under seal .
The department , in refusing to turn over investigative documents sought by Manning under the Freedom of Information Act , has acknowledged that the FBI is continuing to investigate the publication of national security information on WikiLeaks arising from Manningâ€ ™ s disclosures .
â€œThat investigation concerns potential violations of federal criminal laws , in the form of serious threats to the national security , and the investigation continues today , â€ � department lawyers wrote in a court filing last year .
â€œFrom the terms of her request , it is clear that Manning seeks to obtain documents concerning that investigation.â€
�
Separately , the FBI is also investigating Russian meddling through hacking in the US presidential election .
Hacked emails from top Democratic officials and Hillary Clinton campaign aides were posted on WikiLeaks in the final weeks of the presidential race .
With the commutation coming just days before Obama leaves office , any decision on whether to charge or seek to extradite Assange will now fall to the Trump administration ."
2017-01-19,"WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange has said he stands by his offer to travel to the US following Barack Obamaâ€ ™ s decision to release whistleblower Chelsea Manning from prison .
Speaking from the Ecuadorian embassy in London during a web broadcast on Thursday , Assange said there were many discussions about his future that could happen before Manning left prison in May , adding : â€œI have always been willing to go to the United States provided my rights are respected.â€ � Assange has been living in the embassy since claiming asylum there in 2012 .
He has refused to meet prosecutors in Sweden , where he remains wanted on an allegation of rape , which he denies , and has repeatedly said he fears extradition to the US on espionage charges if he leaves the embassy .
At the moment , the only public extradition ruling against him comes from Sweden .
WikiLeaks tweeted last week that Assange would agree to US extradition if Obama granted Manning clemency .
Asked during a web broadcast on Thursday if he would now leave the embassy , Assange said : â€œI stand by everything I said , including the offer to go to the United States if Chelsea Manningâ€ ™ s sentence was commuted.â€ � Assange said there had been a seven - year - long attempt to build a prosecution against him and WikiLeaks in the US and his name was on several warrants and subpoenas .
â€œAs of this year
, it is active and ongoing ,
â€ � he said .
â€œIf
it takes me going to United States to somehow flush out this case and get the DoJ
[ Department of Justice ] to either make a charge or extradition or to drop it
, then we are interested in looking at that as well.â€ �
He said it remained to be seen whether the DoJ under Donald Trump would treat his case differently from Obamaâ€ ™ s administration .
The US justice department has never announced any indictment of Assange and it is not clear that any charges have been brought without becoming a matter of public record .
The department , in refusing to turn over investigative documents sought by Manning under the Freedom of Information Act , has acknowledged that the FBI is continuing to investigate the publication of national security information on WikiLeaks arising from Manningâ€ ™ s disclosures .
The governmentâ€ ™ s refusal to confirm or deny the existence of charges is a â€œdeliberate attempt by the Department of Justice to keep me and WikiLeaks in a state of uncertainty , abusing the process for psychological gains , â€ � Assange said .
Earlier this week , the White House insisted that Assangeâ€ ™ s offer to submit to extradition if Obama granted Manning clemency had no bearing on the US presidentâ€ ™ s action .
â€œI have no insight into Mr Assangeâ€ ™ s travel plans , â€ � a White House official said .
â€œI
canâ€
™ t speak to any charges or potential charges he may be facing from the justice department.â€ �
Obama used his final hours in the White House to allow Manning to go free nearly 30 years early .
The 29-year - old transgender former intelligence analyst in Iraq was sentenced in 2013 after a military court convicted her of passing more than 700,000 documents , videos , diplomatic cables and battlefield accounts to WikiLeaks .
She said she did so to raise awareness about the impact of war .
During Thursdayâ€ ™ s web broadcast , Assange said Trumpâ€ ™ s impact on global relations was â€œvery interestingâ€ � adding : â€œHis behaviour is [ that of ] someone whoâ€ ™ s not a diplomat at all , making inflammatory statements about what he really thinks â€ ¦ From WikiLeaksâ€ ™ perspective , we like to see this churn and invigoration and everything being reconsidered.â€ �"
2017-01-24,"Julian Assange has said Barack Obamaâ€ ™ s decision to grant whistleblower Chelsea Manning clemency was a bid to â€œmake life hardâ€ � for him .
In an interview with the Australian current affairs programme
The Project , the WikiLeaks founder also qualified his pledge to accept extradition to the US if Manning was granted clemency .
After Manningâ€ ™ s sentence was commuted last week , a member of Assangeâ€ ™ s legal team said he would not go back on his word .
But Assange said in the pre - recorded interview with The Projectâ€ ™ s host , Waleed Aly , that any possible extradition would be dependent on striking a deal with the US justice department .
He said his team had sought to engage with the Department of Justice to determine their intentions with the ongoing case and if â€œthere is some way you guys can drop itâ€ � .
Assange is the subject of an espionage investigation in the US , though the justice department has never announced any indictment and no charges have been brought against him .
In the full interview posted online on Wednesday morning , Assange said the case was â€œan outrageous , bullshit case against a publisherâ€ � .
â€œWe say the thing should have been dropped years ago , it should be dropped right now , it should have been dropped under the Obama administration , it should be dropped under the Trump administration , but so far itâ€ ™ s not been dropped .
So what do we do ?
â€œI was willing to do anything possible to try and encourage Barack Obama to do the right thing and give Chelsea Manning clemency , which he did in the end , for a variety of reasons.â€ � Assange has been living in the Ecuadorian embassy in London since claiming asylum there in 2012 , and has refused to travel to meet prosecutors in Sweden , where he is wanted on a rape allegation , which he denies .
He has repeatedly said he fears extradition to the US on espionage charges if he leaves the embassy , though at the moment the only public extradition ruling against him comes from Sweden .
In a tweet on 13 January , Assange pledged to travel to the US if Manning â€ “ who passed 700,000 documents , videos , diplomatic cables and battlefield accounts to WikiLeaks â€ “ was granted clemency .
The White House has insisted that Assangeâ€ ™ s offer did not influence Obamaâ€ ™ s decision to grant Manning clemency , which Assange disputed on The Project .
â€œIn the end , Barack Obama â€ “ wanting , I guess , to look tough â€ “ said that my offer had nothing to do with Chelsea Manning being granted clemency , so there is no quid pro quo , â€ �
he said .
Questioned by Aly over the apparent new terms in his offer to be extradited , Assange said he had not mentioned them before â€œbecause Iâ€ ™ m not an idiotâ€ � .
â€œWe had a major strategic victory in liberating Chelsea Manning â€ ¦
but , of course , saying Iâ€ ™ m willing to accept extradition doesnâ€ ™ t mean
Iâ€ ™ m saying that Iâ€ ™ m willing to be a complete idiot and throw all my lawyers away and so on , â€ � he said .
â€œWe are going to have a discussion with the DoJ about what that looks like .
The ball is in their court.â€ � Assange said Obama had commuted Manningâ€ ™ s sentence to get back at him .
â€œWhatâ€ ™ s the result ?
It is going to make life hard for Assange because either he will be extradited to the US or we will show him [ to be ] a liar .
Therefore , it is OK to pardon Chelsea Manning â€ “
thatâ€
™ s what happened.â€ � Assange also responded to claims that WikiLeaks cost Hillary Clinton the US presidency by publishing emails connected to the Democratic party before the election .
US intelligence officials believe the release was hacked by Russia and passed to WikiLeaks to boost Donald Trumpâ€ ™ s bid for the White House .
Assange has repeatedly declined to be drawn on the source of the emails he published .
Asked by Aly whether he could be â€œ100 %
certainâ€ � that there was no involvement from the Russian state at any stage in the emailsâ€ ™ transmission to WikiLeaks
, Assange replied : â€œI can state clearly , and have stated clearly , that our source is not a member of the Russian government.â€ �
He accused Aly and other members of the media of â€œshifting goalpostsâ€ � after demanding that he tell them whether the emails were from the Russian government .
â€œI am not saying anything else other than what we have said , because we canâ€ ™ t play 20 questions about our sources .
We canâ€ ™ t eliminate this or that.â€ �
In the full interview , Assange said speculation over WikiLeaksâ€ ™ sources distracted from its publications and â€œcreates a kind of hysteria that could lead to warâ€ � .
He said WikiLeaks itself had played less of a role in the outcome of the US election than the emails sent by Clinton and John Podesta , her campaign chair .
â€œThat is what flipped the election , their own words .
The American people listened to their words and didnâ€ ™ t like it .
Thatâ€ ™ s whatâ€ ™ s being argued about.â€ �
He added that it was â€œhypocriticalâ€ � for Democrats who had applauded WikiLeaksâ€ ™ revelations about George W Bush â€œto be absolutely savage and disgustingâ€ � over its publication of Clintonâ€ ™ s emails .
In the full interview , he denied that his aversion to Clinton was personal .
â€œShe fit a particular position within the professional neoliberal establishment of Washington DC .
If she wasnâ€ ™ t in that slot , somebody else would be in that slot .
â€œI think sheâ€ ™ s a bit like me in some ways .
Sheâ€ ™ s a bit wonkish , sheâ€ ™ s a little bit awkward .
She likes a fight , she keeps going.â€ �
He said he thought he â€œwould rather get along withâ€
�
Clinton , if she were not a â€œwar criminalâ€ � .

2017-02-09,"Julian Assange will be given a monthâ€ ™ s notice to leave the Ecuadorian embassy if the countryâ€ ™ s main opposition candidate wins the presidency in next weekâ€ ™ s election .
In an interview with the Guardian , Guillermo Lasso , of the rightwing Creo - Suma alliance , said it was time for the WikiLeaks founder to move on because his asylum was expensive and no longer justified .
â€œThe Ecuadorian people have been paying a cost that we should not have to bear , â€ �
he said during an interview in Quito .
â€œWe will cordially ask SeÃ±or Assange to leave within 30 days of assuming a mandate.â€ �
That possibility is still some way off .
In the most recent poll , Lasso is seven points behind the ruling party candidate LenÃ­n Moreno , but the former banker has been gaining ground ahead of the first round of voting on 19 February and is widely tipped to force a runoff .
Even if there is no change in power in Quito , however , it seems increasingly likely that Assange will soon be moving from the cramped embassy in Knightsbridge that has been his refuge for more than four and a half years .
Although the current government has maintained its position of solidarity , all involved have grown increasingly frustrated with a situation that Ecuadorâ€ ™ s top diplomat described as â€œsomething out of a John le CarrÃ
© novelâ€
� .
â€œOur staff have been through a lot .
There is a human cost , â€ � said the foreign minister , Guillaume Long .
â€œThis is probably the most watched embassy on the planet.â€ � British police and intelligence have kept the embassy under close surveillance since Ecuador granted asylum in June 2012 to prevent Assangeâ€ ™ s extradition to Sweden for questioning about a sexual assault accusation .
The South American country accepts the WikiLeaks leaderâ€ ™ s argument that the Swedish extradition request was a ruse aimed at eventually getting him into US jurisdiction , where he said he would face political persecution and mistreatment similar to that suffered by whistleblower Chelsea Manning .
Since then , he has not left the building , which has given him less scope for movement than that of many convicted prisoners .
â€œItâ€ ™ s a very precarious position , â€ �
Long said .
â€œIn terms of his physical comfort we have done all we can â€
¦
But there is no access to an outside space .
There is no patio or garden so he has mostly spent four and a half years on the first floor of a building in London , where there is not much light , especially in winter.â€ � Assange occupies one of four office rooms in the embassy .
Although he has described a family - like relationship with the staff and gets frequent visits from celebrity supporters , tensions occasionally emerge .
During the US presidential election , the foreign ministry temporarily cut its guestâ€ ™ s internet access after WikiLeaks acted as a conduit for leaked emails from the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clintonâ€ ™ s campaign adviser .
This suspension followed verbal warnings .
â€œWe wanted to be clear that our sovereign space was not being used for interference in the election of another country , â€ � Long explained .
The foreign minister expressed sympathy for Assange , but also frustration at the slow pace of judicial negotiations with Sweden and the punitive stance of the UK government , which has cut many bilateral ties and is suspected of a hand in the unusually frequent breakdowns of the embassyâ€ ™ s telephone and broadband systems .
But after a long standstill , things have picked up pace .
Last November , Assange was interviewed in the Ecuadorian embassy in the presence of a Swedish prosecutor .
In January â€ “ after Barack Obamaâ€ ™ s decision to release Manning â€ “ Assange restated his willingness to face justice in the US if his rights were respected .
For the Ecuadorian foreign minister , the goodbye can not come too soon .
â€œWe would like the next step to be tomorrow , â€ � he said and called for the Swedish courts to accelerate matters .
â€œWe hope they are as swift as possible because this has been going on for far too long.â€ �"
2017-03-05,"Roger Stone , a former adviser to Donald Trump , wrote on Saturday night that he had a â€œperfectly legal back channelâ€ � to Julian Assange , whose organization WikiLeaks published emails related to Hillary Clintonâ€ ™ s presidential campaign that intelligence agencies say were hacked by Russian intelligence .
Stone then deleted the message .
While tweeting his support of the presidentâ€ ™ s unsubstantiated claims that Barack Obama tried to undermine the Trump campaign , Stone directed a series of angry and abusive messages at a scientist who questioned him .
In one post , later deleted , Stone said he had â€œnever denied perfectly legal back channel to Assange who indeed had the goods on # CrookedHillaryâ€ � .
He also invited challengers to file libel suits against him , saying : â€œBring it !
Would enjoy crush u in court and forcing you to eat shit â€ “
you stupid ignorant ugly bitch!â€
�
Stone sent similar , profanity - laced messages to other critics of the president , including author JK Rowling , whom he suggested should take refugees and migrants into her own home .
Stone then deleted the tweets .
Hours later , he added : â€œJust nothing better than calling out liberal jerk offs on Twitter .
We won , you lost .
Youâ€ ™ re done!â€ �
A political operative whose work with the Republican party dates back to the days of Richard Nixon â€ “ whose face is tattooed on Stoneâ€ ™
s back
â€ “ Stone reportedly retains ties to the president , though he officially left Trumpâ€ ™ s campaign in late 2015 .
In an interview last week with Breitbart News , the site previously run by Steve Bannon , now Trumpâ€ ™ s chief strategist , Stone was described as one of Trumpâ€ ™ s â€œpolitical mentorsâ€ � and someone who â€œremains one of his closest confidantesâ€ � .
Last fall , US intelligence agencies formally accused the Kremlin of trying to interfere in the 2016 election , and in January reported that Russiaâ€ ™ s intent was to help Trumpâ€ ™ s campaign defeat Clinton .
Part of that covert effort , the agencies said , was to hack into the emails of the Democratic party and Clintonâ€ ™ s campaign chairman , John Podesta .
Those emails were then released by WikiLeaks over several months of the campaign .
Assange , who has spent four years living in the Ecuadorian embassy in London to avoid extradition to Sweden over rape allegations , has denied that Russian agents provided the emails .
During the campaign last August , Stone was recorded on video telling a group of Florida Republicans :
â€œI actually have communicated with Assange.â€ � â€œI believe the next tranche of his documents pertain to the Clinton Foundation , but thereâ€ ™ s no telling what the October surprise may be ,
â€ � he said .
He then seemed to preview the WikiLeaks dump of Podesta emails , writing on Twitter : â€œTrust me , it will soon the Podestaâ€ ™ s time in the barrel.â€ �
In October , he told a local CBS reporter about â€œa back - channel communication with Assange , because we have a good mutual friendâ€ � .
â€œThat friend travels back and forth from the United States to London and we talk , â€ � Stone said .
In an interview with CBS last week , Stone denied having any â€œdirect conversationsâ€
� with Assange and added : â€œNor did I have advance knowledge of either the matter of his subsequent disclosures , or who he did or did not hack.â€
�
The FBI is reportedly investigating Stone , along with former Trump campaign chief Paul Manafort , former adviser Carter Page and former national security adviser Michael Flynn , for possible contacts with Russian officials .
In an interview with the Guardian last month , Stone called for an unbiased investigation into such alleged links , saying : â€œThe president should tell his attorney general that either he finds proof of this , or he puts it to bed and announces none of it happened.â€ �
He added : â€œI would relish the opportunity to testify in public under oath on this issue.â€ � Stone also denied that he had any contact with Russian officials during or after the campaign .
â€œThere was no collusion , â€ � he said .
â€œI have had no connection with the Russians .
If the government has evidence that I was colluding with the Russians in Donald Trumpâ€ ™ s campaign , they should indict me immediately.â€
�
In a separate interview with CBS this week , Stone said that the investigation was biased .
â€œItâ€ ™ s a witch - hunt , â€ � he said .
â€œI
know it is.â€ �"
2017-03-08,"What has happened ?
WikiLeaks , the whistleblowing website run by Julian Assange , has released a cache of documents it calls â€œVault 7â€ � , which contains details of hacking tools used by the CIA .
What is in â€˜Vault 7â€ ™ ?
WikiLeaks said 7,818 web pages and 943 attachments were published , but were just the first part of more material to come .
WikiLeaks said it has an entire archive of data consisting of several million lines of computer code .
The documents appear to date between 2013 and 2016 .
WikiLeaks described them as â€œthe largest ever publication of confidential documents on the agencyâ€ � .
The files describe CIA plans and descriptions of malware and other tools that could be used to hack into some of the worldâ€ ™ s most popular technology platforms .
The documents showed that the developers aimed to be able to inject these tools into targeted computers without the ownersâ€ ™ awareness .
The files do not describe who the prospective targets might be , but the documents show broad exchanges of tools and information between the CIA , the National Security Agency and other US federal intelligence agencies , as well as intelligence services of close allies Australia , Canada , New Zealand and the United Kingdom .
What does this mean the CIA can do ?
A broad range of devices are targeted by the agency .
A lot of attention is focused on breaking into general - purpose computing devices , including PCs and smartphones , with malware that affects iOS and Android phones referred to in the text , as well as Windows and Linux computers .
The tools described would allow the CIA to take almost complete remote control of a userâ€ ™ s phone , turning it into a complete spying device reporting back to the agency .
But it would only do so on the most important targets , since each time the agency uses the malware , it runs the risk of being discovered , prompting manufacturers to release a fix to prevent future attacks from succeeding .
Exactly that happened in August 2016 , when Apple issued a global iOS update after three attacks implemented to try and break into the iPhone of an Arab human rights activist were discovered .
The documents also include discussions about compromising some internet - connected Samsung televisions to turn them into listening posts .
That hack , like many others , would only work in an extremely targeted manner : it requires physical access to the TV in question , since the malware is loaded via a USB port .
One other document discusses hacking vehicle systems , appearing to indicate the CIAâ€ ™ s interest in hacking recent - model cars with sophisticated onboard computer systems .
Why am I hearing names like Weeping Angel and Nandao ?
The purported CIA documents range from complicated computer coding to organisational plans to sarcastic comments about the toolsâ€ ™ effectiveness .
The comments paint a picture of an agency filled with fairly typical developers , who like to share emojis , discuss the best text editors , and make pop culture references in their code .
Some of the tools in the release were named after alcohol references , including Bartender , Wild Turkey and Margarita .
Others referenced popular movies , including Fight Club and Talladega Nights .
One hacking tool , codenamed RickyBobby , after the character who is a race car driver in Talladega Nights , was purportedly used to upload and download information â€œwithout detection as malicious softwareâ€ � .
The Samsung malware , developed in conjunction with Britainâ€ ™ s GCHQ , is called Weeping Angel , apparently named after a Doctor Who villain .
Whoâ€ ™ s behind the leak ?
WikiLeaks said the material came from â€œan isolated , high - security networkâ€ � inside the CIAâ€ ™ s
Center for Cyber Intelligence , the spy agencyâ€ ™ s internal arm that conducts cyber offence and defence .
It said the documents were â€œcirculated among former US government hackers and contractors in an unauthorised manner , one of whom has provided WikiLeaks with portions of the archiveâ€ � .
It did not make it clear who was behind the leak , leaving several possibilities : espionage , a rogue employee , a theft involving a federal contractor or a break - in of a staging server where such information may have been temporarily stored .
Is there more coming from â€˜Vault 7â€ ™ ?
Wikileaks has promised further releases of information in the future , but has given no date to expect them , nor said what might be contained in them .
The organisation has also suggested that some of the data redacted from the initial release , such as all of the actual computer code , might be released down the line , once it has determined whether it poses a risk .
How has the CIA and US government responded to the release ?
A spokesman for the CIA said the agency would not comment â€œon the authenticity or content of purported intelligence documentsâ€ � .
Trump administration spokesman Sean Spicer declined comment as well .
What have the manufacturers of the targeted devices said ?
Apple , one of numerous tech companies whose devices appear to have been targeted , released a statement late on Tuesday saying many of the vulnerabilities described by the documents were already fixed as of the latest version of its iOS mobile operating system , and aimed to reassure customers that it was working on patching the rest of the holes .
It said : â€œWhile our initial analysis indicates that many of the issues leaked today were already patched in the latest iOS , we will continue work to rapidly address any identified vulnerabilities , â€ �
it added .
â€œWe always urge customers to download the latest iOS to make sure they have the most recent security updates.â€ �
Microsoft and Samsung both said they looking into the reports .
The maker of the secure messaging app Signal said the purported tools described in the leaked documents appeared to affect usersâ€ ™ actual phones , but not its software designs or encryption protocols .
The manufacturer of the popular Telegram mobile messaging app said in a statement that manufacturers of mobile phones and their operating systems , including Apple , Google and Samsung , were responsible for improving the security of their devices .
It said the effort will require â€œmany hours of work and many security updatesâ€ � and assured its customers : â€œIf the CIA is not on your back , you shouldnâ€ ™ t start worrying yet.â€ �
Am I at risk of being spied on ?
Unlike the NSA , which practices on large - scale â€œSIGINTâ€ � , or signals intelligence , the CIA tends to focus on targeted surveillance .
The cost of carrying out the attacks described is high , and each time they are used risks them being rendered useless if they are discovered and fixed .
That means that itâ€ ™ s unlikely the CIA is using such techniques to hack millions of TV sets at once â€ “ not least because that particular hack requires physical access to the TV .
The Agencyâ€ ™ s need for targeted attacks on smartphones and other devices is in part due to the general success in encrypted communications .
Despite carefully - phrased claims from Wikileaks , the documents contain no indication that encrypted messaging apps such as WhatsApp and Signal have been broken .
But if the phone they are running on is compromised at the root level , even the most secure app canâ€ ™ t guarantee its users safety .
As a result , encrypted communication developers are hailing the leaks as evidence of their success .
â€œUbiquitous [ end - to - end ] encryption is pushing intelligence agencies from undetectable mass surveillance to expensive , high - risk , targeted attacks , â€ �
Open Whisper Systems said in a tweeted statement on Tuesday .
â€œThe story isnâ€ ™ t about Signal or WhatsApp , but to the extent that it is , we see it as confirmation that what weâ€ ™ re doing is working.â€ �
Is there anything I can do to help ensure privacy ?
Security researcher Matt Blaze shared his tips on Twitter : â€œWhat can you do as a user to defend ?
Boring stuff .
Keep your software up to date .
Donâ€ ™ t run unneeded apps.â€ �
But , most important of all : â€œDonâ€ ™ t become a CIA target.â€ �"
2017-03-10,"WikiLeaks founder Julian Assangeâ€ ™ s pledge to help Silicon Valley technology companies patch the bugs outlined in leaked CIA files
has been met with skepticism from the security community .
Assange said he would contact technology companies to privately supply technical details of the hacking techniques and security vulnerabilities that were redacted from the cache of classified documents released to the public .
â€œWe have decided to work with them , to give them some exclusive access to some of the technical details we have , so that fixes can be pushed out , â€ � Assange said in a news conference streamed from the Ecuadorian embassy in London , where he has claimed diplomatic asylum since 2012 .
But members of the security community have dismissed Assangeâ€ ™ s hyperbole around the CIA files
â€ “ collectively nicknamed â€œVault 7â€ � â€ “ which he described as â€œexceptional from a political , legal and forensic perspectiveâ€ � .
Ryan Kalember , SVP of Cybersecurity Strategy at Proofpoint , disagreed . â€œThereâ€ ™ s
nothing earth - shattering , â€ � he said , pointing out that many of the operating systems mentioned in the documents are quite old and have already been updated .
â€œIt seems like the CIA was doing the same stuff cybersecurity researchers do , which is compile lists of vulnerabilities and try to figure out which ones are being exploited in the wild and which ones could
be.â€ � Itâ€ ™ s not clear at this point
how many , if any , of the vulnerabilities are genuine â€œzero - daysâ€ �
â€ “ those not yet known to vendors , named after the number of days they have to fix them .
Kalember said that the so - called Weeping Angel hack , which uses malware to spy on Samsung smart TVs , has been shown at security conferences for a couple of years and requires physical access to the device .
â€œThe CIA should be embarrassed that they lost control of this cache , but they should also be embarrassed if this is their level of technical sophistication , â€ � said another another security researcher , who did not want to be named .
â€œWhat they have is pretty unimpressive.â€ �
Both said that the vulnerabilities detailed in the documents are likely to have already been patched by the companies .
Apple and Google have both publicly stated this is the case .
There could be more to come , however : Assange has emphasized that the data cache released on Tuesday is only a portion of the total leaked information WikiLeaks holds .
â€œThe fact that Julian Assange is offering to selectively disclose vulnerability information to affected companies is better than revealing it to all and sundry , but it depends on the veracity , accuracy and currency of that information , â€ � said BullGuard CEO Paul Lipman .
â€œI donâ€
™ t think WikiLeaks is the first stop for tech companies looking to solve vulnerabilities , â€ � he added .
How do the CIA files compare with the revelations contained in the NSA leaks from whistleblower Edward Snowden ?
â€œItâ€ ™ s apples and oranges , â€ � said Kalember .
â€œThe Snowden leaks were not only technically interesting but contained a lot of novel stuff that was not known at all.â€ �
He said that with Vault 7 , he and other members of the cybersecurity community have spent a lot of time â€œlaughing about funny things on the CIAâ€ ™
s
intranetâ€ � ( like this collection of emoticons ) rather than â€œdebating anything interesting from a tech perspectiveâ€ � .
Some researchers were skeptical of WikiLeaksâ€ ™ motives , pointing to apparent ties between the whistleblowing organization and Russia â€ “ despite Assangeâ€ ™ s denial .
â€œEverything they have done over the last few months suggests they are operating as a front for a different leaker
[ Russia],â€ � said Kalember .
He said that the possible Russian ties as well as WikiLeaksâ€ ™ track record of publishing identifying information about people ( known as â€œdoxxingâ€ � )
â€
“ including millions of women in Turkey â€ “ and threats to make an online database of all verified users on Twitter â€
“ has diminished confidence in the organization .
â€œNo one in the information security community really trusts him and his motives , â€ �
he said .
At the press conference , Assange attempted to counter accusations that he or WikiLeaks had ties to Russian intelligence agencies , describing his operation as â€œa neutral , digital Switzerlandâ€ � .
WikiLeaksâ€ ™ promotion of the CIA files has placed emphasis on a group at the agency called Umbrage , which collects a library of attack techniques produced in other states including , the press release stated , the Russian Federation .
â€œWith Umbrage and related projects the CIA can not only increase its total number of attack types but also misdirect attribution by leaving behind the â€˜fingerprintsâ€ ™ of the groups that the attack techniques were stolen from ,
â€ �
WikiLeaks said .
This could be interpreted as an attempt by WikiLeaks to undermine the attribution of the DNC hack to the Russians â€ “ something that the international security community almost unanimously agrees on .
â€œThey place a lot of emphasis on the fact that the CIA could be using malware to achieve its ends and leave trails that point to people in different directions .
Everybody does this , but itâ€ ™ s not going to genuinely undermine proper attribution , â€ � he said .
That hasnâ€ ™ t stopped conservative media figures from embracing the conspiracy theory , amplified by a flood of Twitter bots spouting memes and a similar narrative .
â€œI think at this point
Assange is effectively acting in the service of the Russian government , whether intentionally or not , â€ � said Kalember ."
2017-03-10,"Asked what heâ€ ™ d been doing in Londonâ€ ™ s Ecuadorian embassy on Thursday , Nigel Farage gave a chilling answer : he couldnâ€ ™ t remember .
God , poor Nigel .
Iâ€ ™ m sure that heâ€ ™ s not the first person to find themselves in a room with Julian Assange with no memory of how they got there .
Clearly , the imperative at that point is to get your stuff together and find the door to daylight as quickly as possible .
For some observers , of course , the mere thought of Farage and Assange even sharing a postcode in any capacity is sufficient to render the locale a Chernobyl - style exclusion zone .
To adapt Obi - Wan Kenobi on the destruction of Alderaan : I felt a great disturbance in Knightsbridge .
It was as if millions of oligarchs and Saudis and the Candy brothers cried out in terror , and were suddenly silenced .
Still , one gets on with oneâ€ ™ s day as best as one can .
Given Farageâ€ ™ s recent obsession with sexual assaults in Sweden , there has been some waspish speculation that he wished to speak to an alleged perpetrator thereof .
If not , the meeting serves as a reminder that Farage doesnâ€ ™ t actually give a thousandth as much of a toss about women being sexually assaulted as he says .
If it wasnâ€ ™ t that , perhaps Farage and Assange discussed their mutually French - sounding surnames , which â€ “ obviously through no fault of their own â€ “ always feel slightly fancy , in that way that Americans say â€œArndreaâ€ � and â€œArnaâ€ � .
( In an amusing instance of affectation - upmanship , Assange claims his derives from an ancestor who was a Taiwanese pirate . )
Or perhaps Nigel is acting as a conduit for communications between Julian and his would - be love interest and occasional embassy visitor Pamela Anderson , like the kid in The Go - Between who never has quite the right togs for the elevated milieu in which he suddenly finds himself .
Certainly , Farage is essaying insouciance poorly .
â€œI never discuss where I go or who I see , â€ � said Nigel , who only the other day tweeted a photo captioned â€œDinner with the Donaldâ€ � .
You do read those stories of cults controlling their victims by telling them they have to repeat a certain mantra thousands of times a day .
Perhaps that accounts for Nigelâ€ ™ s mentions of Trump , which are fast approaching blink - frequency .
And so to the US president , to whose assistance a WikiLeaks dump has once again sprung this week .
In a curious case of synchronicity , Julian seems to provide whenever Trump needs him most , like the presidentâ€ ™ s personal vigilante ( or vigilauntie , in the refined pronunciation ) .
A floundering Sean Spicer is like the twatsignal to him .
Thus any number of Trump intelligence controversies were this week obscured by WikiLeaks dropping the biggest ever leak of confidential documents on CIA hacking .
Alas , even this wasnâ€ ™ t enough to prevent Spicer from being flustered at being asked if Farage was at the Ecuadorian embassy on Trump business .
Spicer doesnâ€
™ t focus on matters â€œacross
the pondâ€ � , he gibbered , and canâ€ ™ t be expected to keep up with the movements of â€œrandom foreign leadersâ€ � .
As non - denials go , it was fairly perforated .
Farage , meanwhile , used the interest generated by his visit to tell a TV interviewer that the one thing he and Trump have in common is that â€œweâ€ ™ re probably the two most vilified people in the westâ€ � .
God , yes â€ “
itâ€ ™ s like
Lindsay Lohan might say about BeyoncÃ © : weâ€ ™ ve both taken so much stick .
Either way , youâ€ ™ ll note Farage does increasingly seek to present himself as an international man of mystery , whose birthday present from Brexit financier Arron Banks will probably be a silver cigarette case engraved with the legend â€œTrouble
O Sevenâ€ � .
As Nigel once sighed wistfully of his sugar daddy Banks : â€œItâ€ ™ s refreshing to meet someone who knows how to enjoy life , as he certainly does in spades.â€ �
As for Nigelâ€ ™ s personal Zarathustrian journey , he is certainly trying to live as his fantasy version of himself .
â€œI want my life back , â€ � was his perma - refrain on his most recent farewell tour from the Ukip leadership .
But for all the tinny bravado , Farage seems to be held back â€ “ and , rather poignantly , only by himself .
Consider Brexit , an outcome for which he fought for 25 years of his life , often in a highly isolated position with the establishment telling him it was hopeless .
Yet Farage now feels so unworthy of his success that he speaks of the victory almost exclusively as a precursor to Trump , at whose feet he has worshipfully laid it .
Or consider his personal life .
After years fielding awkward questions about his marriage , he is now separated and now has some younger French woman living in his London house ( a former waitress who he fashioned â€ “ the manner of a Eurosceptic Henry Higgins â€ “ into the head of a Brussels thinktank ) .
Yet despite claiming to be â€œretiredâ€ � , Farage seems to spend as much time as possible away from this house , instead of â€ ¦ well .
The lexicography of the â€œalt - rightâ€ � interests me about as much as the lexicography of Paul Merson .
But if I stooped to knowing what a â€œbeta
cuckâ€
� was
, I rather worry that Iâ€ ™
d think Farage was one .
Perhaps the Ecuador embassy visit has something to do with last weekâ€ ™ s
diplomatic news â€ “ namely , that Banks and co have taken a five - year lease on a house in Washington DC , which they are calling the â€œalternative British embassyâ€ � .
This is to be used as a US base for Nigel to anxiously await Trumpâ€ ™ s summons .
It might seem anachronistic in the age of mobile phones , but the entire arrangement reminds me of that character in Woody Allenâ€ ™ s Play
It
Again , Sam â€ “ who is so panicked about missing the big phone call that he leaves needy details of his every movement :
â€œLet me tell you where you can reach me , George .
Iâ€ ™ ll be at 362 - 9296 for a while ; then Iâ€ ™ ll be at 648 - 0024 for about 15 minutes ; then Iâ€ ™ ll be at 752 - 0420 ; and then Iâ€ ™ ll be home , at 621 - 4598 .
Yeah , right George ,
bye - bye.â€ �
Another character remarks tartly : â€œThereâ€ ™ s a phone booth on the corner .
You want me to run downstairs and get the number ?
Youâ€ ™ ll be passing
it.â€
�
I am picturing Banks suggesting dinner in Georgetown , only for Nigel to say :
â€œBetter not â€ ¦ just in case Donald â€ ¦
[ trails off weakly]â€ �
Thinking of this house
, I suppose itâ€ ™ s possible that Farage and Assange were discussing some kind of Trump - sanctioned Embassybnb arrangement , whereby Assange can get away for a bit of house arrest in another city â€ “ in this case , the â€œalternative British embassyâ€ � in Washington .
So : we have a three - bedroom house with four principals ( Farage , Assange , Banks and his comms guy Andy Wigmore ) , and a supporting cast that includes Pamela Anderson and half the West Wing .
As various TV satirists keep wondering rather ruefully : whither comic fiction in the malarially real age of Trump ?"
2017-03-11,"Nigel Farageâ€ ™ s
social call on Julian Assangeâ€ ™ s hideaway in the Ecuadorian embassy was a clarifying moment that ought to have flooded light on a dark world .
To those who are willing to see , it revealed that far left and far right are now one movement .
â€œAll isms are wasms , â€ � quipped a Foreign Office wag as fascism and communism united in the Hitler - Stalin pact .
That wasnâ€ ™ t true in 1939 , when Berlin and Moscow found their shared belief in the â€œismâ€ � of totalitarianism was greater than the difference between left and right , and isnâ€ ™ t true now .
There is an â€œismâ€ � â€ “ illiberalism â€ “ an ideology that has been growing for years .
Do not underestimate its force .
Illiberals now control the White House and the Kremlin .
You can track their influence in the Brexit rightâ€ ™ s contempt for education and expertise and the Labour leftâ€ ™ s alliances with the counter - Enlightenment .
The old division between left and right makes as little sense now as it did in 1939 .
To realise its futility consider that in conventional terms Farage is a politician who manoeuvres in the grey zone before the right and the far right .
He exploits chauvinism and plays on racial fears but is always careful not to incite violence directly .
Assange is a man of what I once called the Chomskyan left and what modern critics call the regressive left .
He is against the west , often for good reasons .
Like so many of his kind , however , he will then ally with any force , however reactionary , which opposes the west as well .
The supposed political differences between the closet racist and alleged rapist in no way prevented them becoming chums .
Why would they ?
Farage is an inspiration to and friend of Donald Trump .
He admires
Putinâ€ ™ s contempt for human rights and his hatred of the EU .
If Wikileaks were dedicated to exposing injustice wherever it occurred , I would have no difficulties with it .
But in characteristic regressive style Assange provides support services to the gangster capitalists of the new Russian empire .
He proved his loyalty when he published hacked emails from the Clinton campaign , thus helping Putin and Farageâ€ ™ s preferred candidate win the US presidency .
Extremes merge .
Red bleeds into black .
Everywhere , the institutions of liberal society are denounced as a lying conspiracy , the better for illiberal movements to propagandise their own vast lies .
You catch the futility of the old labels if you can manage to sit through All Governments Lie , which had its London premiere last week .
It is an unintentionally fascinating piece of propaganda because any one of at least three dictatorial or otherwise illiberal movements might have made it .
The camera pans over the offices of the New York Times , CNN and the Washington Post , making sure that the viewer knows that liberal organisations rather than Fox News or Breitbart are the liarsâ€ ™ accomplices .
The work of a Donald Trump supporter , perhaps , determined to expose liberal globalists ?
But then the producers try to persuade the audience that there is a monolith called â€œthe mediaâ€ � .
This idea made little sense in the 20th century , for what did journalists at the New Yorker or Financial Times have in common with journalists on the National Enquirer or Sun ?
Nothing that anyone could see .
It is a blatant falsehood now that the web allows billions to produce their own media .
Nevertheless , the fantasy of â€œthe mediaâ€ � is popular with Russian propagandists .
They want to say that the â€œRussophobicâ€ � and monolithic western media are biased against them because they hate Russians , rather than because of the policies and practices of the Putin tsarocracy .
â€œNews outlets are more propagandistic than journalistic , â€ � a lugubrious voice explains , before the camera cuts to a distinguished - looking gentleman who opines that the elite in Britain and the US maintain power by controlling â€œattitudes and opinionsâ€ � .
The distinguished - looking gentleman is Noam Chomsky expounding on an old theme : his propaganda model of journalism .
Rather than looking at why revolutionary socialism failed , Chomsky and his many adherents on the defeated radical left say the masses are brainwashed into voting against their interests by journalists , who are under the control of rich proprietors and advertisers .
All journalists , that is .
Not this or that news organisation but the media as a malign totality .
I have many objections to the view that democratic consent is
â€œmanufacturedâ€ � .
The strongest was provided by the supposedly brainwashed US electorate last November .
Trump received just two endorsements from the editorial boards of Americaâ€ ™ s 100 largest newspapers .
He still won .
Needless to add , Chomsky has now joined Assange , Farage and Trumpâ€ ™ s march on Moscow and makes a mockery of his supposed opposition to propaganda by appearing on Putinâ€ ™ s propaganda networks .
Trumpâ€ ™ s victory has not only disproved the conspiracy theories of the defeated of the 20th century , it has shown how useful they can be to victors of the 21st .
Putin and Trump want to cast themselves as victims , the better to justify their aggression .
The fantasy of a monolithic media manufacturing falsehoods serves a dual purpose : it blackens truthful accounts of their crimes and corruptions and justifies their lies .
Supporters who are primed to believe fact - checking is an illusion and all objective evidence is contaminated will happily believe that Russian - backed rebels in Ukraine did not shoot down a Malaysian jet or that Obama ordered taps on Trumpâ€ ™ s phone .
If I had been writing a year ago , I would have concluded with wet words on the need for liberal societies to examine their faults .
We must , I would have said with a pious air , understand why we have gone so badly wrong that men like these can come to power .
And of course we should .
But concerned platitudes about the need to redress liberal failures miss that Putin , Trump , Farage , Assange and their many imitators are not always brainwashing their followers in a Chomskyan fashion .
Their admirers positively welcome their tearing up of the old rules on honesty in public discourse , their contempt for facts , for human rights , for foreigners and all others who can be defamed by a demagogue on the make .
They want a strongman who can pummel his enemies .
They are entertained by his brags and impressed by how well he cheats .
Many of the men among them revel in a leader who can boast about grabbing pussy or will pass a law allowing them to beat their wives .
Many of the women want a real man in charge .
As I keep saying , the problem is not the liars , it is the millions who want to be lied to ."
2017-03-31,"For Ecuadorâ€ ™ s 15 million inhabitants , Sundayâ€ ™ s presidential election runoff will pose a fundamental question : whether to continue with a leftwing government that has reduced poverty but also brought environmental destruction and authoritarian censorship , or to take a chance on a pro - business banker who promises economic growth but is accused of siphoning money to offshore accounts .
But they are not the only ones for whom the result will be critically important .
Thousands of miles away , in the countryâ€ ™ s tiny embassy in central London , Julian Assange will be watching closely to see if his four and a half years of cramped asylum could be coming to an abrupt , enforced end .
Guillermo Lasso , the businessman and leading opposition candidate , has vowed that if he wins , the WikiLeaks founderâ€ ™ s time in the embassy will be up .
Lasso has said he would â€œcordially ask SeÃ±or Assange to leave within 30 days of assuming a mandateâ€ � , because his presence in the Knightsbridge embassy was a burden on Ecuadorian taxpayers .
His government opponent , Lenin Moreno , has said Assange would remain welcome , albeit with conditions .
â€œWe will always be alert and ask Mr Assange to show respect in his declarations regarding our brotherly and friendly countries , â€ � Moreno said .
The most recent polling showed Moreno at least four percentage points ahead of his rival , though earlier polls had Lasso in the lead , and many analysts caution that the results are within the margin of error .
Could this weekend really trigger the beginning of the end for Assangeâ€ ™ s extraordinary central London refuge ?
Neither Lassoâ€ ™ s victory , nor precisely what he would do if he won , are certain ( he later softened his position to say Assangeâ€ ™ s status would be â€œreviewedâ€ � ) .
But the Australianâ€ ™ s legal team are nonetheless extremely worried .
â€œWe are obviously very concerned that any candidate would threaten to undermine the protection that the Ecuadorian state has granted Julian , â€ � said Jennifer Robinson , a barrister at Doughty Street Chambers who is a member of Assangeâ€ ™ s UK legal team .
â€œNo government should play politics with the granting of asylum .
Itâ€ ™ s a legal protection provided for under international law , Ecuador has granted that protection , they have recognised him as a refugee , and now they have obligations to protect him whatever happens in the elections.â€ �
Assangeâ€ ™ s team are reluctant to be drawn on what legal avenues they might be able to pursue , but he is understood to have instructed lawyers in Quito , while others are looking at whether they may have potential options through the Inter - American and European courts of human rights .
However , according to Arturo Moscoso , an Ecuadorian lawyer and academic : â€œNo organisation , no law and no person can prevent the president from revoking the status of political asylum.â€ �
Assangeâ€ ™ s asylum was granted by a presidential decree and could just as easily be removed by one , he said .
There are not thought to be further possible options open to Assange through the UN , after the UK and Sweden categorically rejected a finding by a UN working group that the Australianâ€ ™ s time in the embassy , where he first sought asylum in July 2012 , amounted to â€œarbitrary detentionâ€ � .
â€œMr
Assange is not , and never has been , a victim of arbitrary detention , â€ � said a Foreign Office spokesman this week .
â€œHe entered the Ecuadorian embassy of his own volition and is free to leave whenever he wishes.â€ �
British authorities are equally adamant that , should Assange leave the embassy under any circumstances , he will be immediately arrested and sent to Sweden , which has been seeking to extradite him over an allegation of rape dating from 2010 , which Assange denies .
After years of stalemate between Sweden and Ecuador , Assange was finally interviewed by Swedish prosecutors inside the embassy late last year ; Ecuador submitted a report to Sweden in early January which was sent for translation .
It is understood to have been submitted to Assangeâ€ ™ s Swedish lawyers , though they are still waiting for the translation of some parts .
Prosecutors say they â€œwill now analyse the report and will thereafter decide what further investigative measures may be takenâ€ � .
Robinson said : â€œIt was the end of November when Julian was questioned after a delay of six years â€ ¦ and weâ€ ™ re still waiting for a decision on whether [ Sweden ] are going to pursue the allegations .
Itâ€ ™ s just unacceptable.â€
�
Without a decision to drop the potential prosecution , Assange ( who surrendered his Australian passport when he was initially arrested in the UK in 2010 ) would be flown immediately to Stockholm , where it is likely he would be subject to a hearing over whether he should be detained â€ “ bail does not exist in Sweden .
â€œThe prosecutor would have to convince the Stockholm district court that he posed a flight risk , or that there was a risk of collusion , â€ � said Daniel Roos , a criminal defence lawyer in Helsingborg .
If Assange was judged a flight risk , he would be placed with other detainees ( though Sweden never gives information about their whereabouts ) .
Any contact with the outside world would require permission from prison authorities .
To call someone , for instance , Assange would need first to send the authorities a letter asking permission to do so .
â€œIt is an alien system from any outsiderâ€ ™ s point of view , â€ � said Roos .
A finding that Assange was at risk of collusion could bring even tougher conditions â€ “ isolation for 23 hours a day , with permission to speak only to his lawyers .
If he was detained , prosecutors would be obliged to indict within 14 days , but there is no legal regulation on how long detention can continue .
In a complicated investigation the detention is usually three to nine months , but in the Assange case the investigation appears to be mostly complete .
Per Samuelson , one of Assangeâ€ ™ s Swedish lawyers , said : â€œMy demand will be that he is released and I will fight for that to happen.â€ �
Assange has always argued that he sought asylum not to avoid answering the Swedish sexual assault allegation ( three further claims were dropped in 2015 after the statute of limitations expired ) but because he fears onward extradition to the US for potential prosecution over WikiLeaksâ€ ™ publishing activities â€ “ the basis for Ecuador granting asylum .
Reuters reported last month that a long - running grand jury investigation into WikiLeaks has been expanded to include its recent leaks of CIA documents ( further source codes were released on Friday ) , which Assangeâ€ ™ s lawyers claim makes the grounds for his asylum even stronger .
â€œWe are obviously hoping that there will be a change in approach from the new [ Trump ] administration , â€ � said Robinson .
â€œWe have been seeking dialogue with the Department of Justice for a very long time , and we will continue to make those representations.â€ �
But although WikiLeaks leaks of Democratic party material last summer and autumn are believed by many to have helped elect Donald Trump to the White House , it is not clear that the new administration takes a different view of the investigation to the previous one .
Assangeâ€ ™ s best hope in the short term , in other words , is likely to be a Moreno victory .
If that does not happen , international human rights groups might rally in his defence , according to Moscoso , or WikiLeaks might uncover material to put pressure on Lasso .
But Moscoso does not expect Ecuadorian public opinion to come to the rescue : â€œFor many itâ€ ™ s a headache.â€ �
The Wikileaks founder will be hoping that â€ “ for once â€ “ the polls are right .

2017-04-03,"Ecuadorâ€ ™ s ruling party candidate appeared to be heading for victory in a presidential runoff that would cement the countryâ€ ™ s reputation as a bastion of the Latin American left and provide breathing space for the WikiLeaks founder , Julian Assange .
However , the narrow 51 % to 49 % lead for LenÃ­n Moreno was contested by the opposition candidate , Guillermo Lasso , prompting fears for heightened political tension in the days ahead .
With 99 % of votes counted , Moreno , a former vice - president under the outgoing president Rafael Correa , was on course to beat Lasso , a 61-year - old former banker .
The head of Ecuadorâ€ ™ s electoral council , Juan Pablo Pozo , called on the opposition candidate to recognise the results .
â€œEcuador deserves the ethical responsibility from its political actors to recognise the democratic decision made by the people at the ballot box , â€ �
Pozo said .
However , Lasso , who had earlier claimed victory based on three exit polls that showed him leading by as much as six points , pointed to irregularities and demanded a recount .
â€œThis is very sickening .
Weâ€ ™ re not going to allow it , â€ � he said , calling on supporters to protest against the results peacefully but firmly .
â€œTheyâ€ ™ ve crossed a line.â€ �
Several thousand of his supporters picketed the electoral council headquarters on Sunday night chanting : â€œWe donâ€ ™ t want fraud , we want democracy.â€ �
Meanwhile , Moreno appeared on a stage flanked by Correa and Jorge Glas , the vice - president , as thousands of supporters waved flags in the lime - green colours of the Alianza PaÃ­s coalition and cumbia music blasted into the night .
Moreno called for dialogue with the opposition , saying : â€œWe know how to hear the criticisms .
Letâ€ ™ s work together in peace and harmony.â€
� Dancing in the crowd , Marisol Jaramillo , 34 , an agricultural worker said : â€œNow the revolution will continue , life has changed for us over the last 10 years and we want the progress to carry on.â€ �
For the countryâ€ ™ s 15 million population , at stake was whether to continue the redistributive policies of the ruling party , which won three elections under Correa , including reduced poverty and improved access to education and healthcare .
Correaâ€ ™ s administration had also been criticised for media censorship , corruption and abandoning many environmental promises .
The alternative offered by Lasso was a pro - business , pro - austerity programme that promised tax cuts and more jobs , though Lasso was plagued with accusations of tax avoidance through dozens of offshore accounts .
He also promised to ask Assange to leave the Ecuadorean embassy in London within a month of securing a mandate because he said the asylum was putting a burden on the countryâ€ ™ s taxpayers .
Assange is reportedly sufficiently concerned to have instructed lawyers in Quito in case Lasso wins .
The election will also have regional ramifications .
Should a Moreno victory be confirmed , it would cement Ecuadorâ€ ™ s reputation as a bastion of the left in Latin America .
Should he lose , it will be taken as another sign of the regionâ€ ™ s retreating â€œpink waveâ€ � , following defeats for the left in an Argentinian election and a Bolivian referendum , plus the impeachment and ousting of the Workersâ€ ™ party president , Dilma Rousseff , in Brazil .
With the stakes high in Ecuador , there were accusations of vote - rigging and other dubious practices during the first round , which was delayed because the result was close , though independent observers from the Union of South American Nations said there was no evidence of fraud and praised the election process as transparent .
The foreign minister , Guillaume Long , urged all involved not to discredit the process for political reasons .
â€œWe have made great strides in social progress in the past decade and we will now continue to do so for the next four years , â€ � he said .
â€œItâ€ ™ s important that all sides respect these results and show their commitment to democracy , without throwing around false allegations that their defeat is due to irregularities , or engaging in any actions that seek to undermine the democratic will of the Ecuadorian peopleâ€ � .
Earlier in the day , Moreno voted at a polling station in Quito , while his supporters gathered outside chanting : â€œYou can see it , you can feel it , LenÃ­n president.â€ � Moreno called for the election to be a peaceful process .
â€œLet the people make their decision , â€ � he said .
As police formed a cordon to hold back the throng , voters â€ “ many of them Lasso supporters
â€ “ said they could not enter the polling station to vote , as Moreno sympathisers jeered .
â€œI voted for Lasso , I voted for a change , â€ �
Maria Jose Maldonado , 33 , a business administrator , said .
â€œWe donâ€ ™ t want a dictatorship , we donâ€ ™ t want our freedom taken away , we donâ€ ™ t want to be like Venezuela , â€ � she said , alluding to the move by the supreme court in Caracas to take over legislative powers in the opposition - controlled Venezuelan congress last week .
Casting his vote in Ecuadorâ€ ™ s port city of Guayaquil , Lasso said : â€œThis is a crucial day , this isnâ€ ™ t any election , here
thereâ€
™ s a path ; thereâ€ ™ s a path to Venezuela or a path to democracy and freedom.â€
�
At the polling station in Quito where Moreno voted , Nora Molina , 57 , said she had voted for him because â€œwe have made a lot of progress in the last 10 years
and we want it to continueâ€ � .
Voting with her young children , Patricia Romero , 37 , said she backed Moreno : â€œI would like him to continue with the revolution which has helped us and he is genuinely concerned for the people.â€ �
Carlos Muso , a 54-year - old taxi driver , said he had opted for Lasso because he would favour small businesses .
â€œWe need a change .
Lasso is the best opportunity we have .
We need a boost for the private sector , lots of companies have had to close and thatâ€ ™ s no good , â€ � he said .
While Morenoâ€ ™ s supporters danced in Quito , Lassoâ€ ™ s supporters had their own festivities in Guayaquil , while hundreds more massed outside the countryâ€ ™ s electoral board headquarters awaiting the final results .
Correa , meanwhile , called for calm and awaited the official results as â€œtwo exit polls have given absolutely contradictory resultsâ€
� .
It is the tightest race in living memory , said Santiago Basabe , a political scientist with the Latin American Faculty of Social Sciences .
â€œI donâ€
™ t think weâ€ ™ ve ever had such a close election , so hard - fought with such a high level of uncertainty among the population.â€
�
The voter indecision is because the candidates lack the charisma and conviction of Correa , said Hernan Reyes , a political scientist at SimÃ³n BolÃ­var Andean University in Quito .
â€œNeither candidate generated any kind of passion of the kind the Ecuadorean voter is used to.â€ �"
2017-04-03,"An Australian anti - war activist was among the victims of alleged illegal email hacking by UK police , according to whistleblower claims being investigated by the British police watchdog .
Ciaron Oâ€ ™ Reilly , a Ploughshares and Catholic Worker organiser , is one of 10 people named in a letter to the Green party peer Jenny Jones by an anonymous whistleblower who alleged the emails of those individuals were among those illegally monitored by a secretive Scotland Yard unit working with Indian police and hackers .
Oâ€ ™
Reilly , a key supporter of Julian Assange , was contacted last week by a London law firm that confirmed his email account and password were identified in the letter , now being examined by the Independent Police Complaints Commission ( IPCC ) .
He told Guardian Australia he was â€œoutraged but not surprisedâ€ � by the alleged intrusion of the Metropolitan policeâ€ ™ s national domestic extremism and disorder unit into his private emails .
Oâ€ ™
Reilly said he assumed â€œthe significance of Julian Assangeâ€ � and his own role in rallying support for the WikiLeaks founder outside courts and the Ecuador embassy had put him on the unitâ€ ™ s
â€œpriority listâ€ � .
The Brisbane - born activist , who has twice served jail time for damaging US military equipment , said he was the kind of non - violent protester who â€œcould end up in quite vulnerable positions with these [ police ] , who kind of overrate our significanceâ€ � .
â€œBut part of overrating our significance is justifying their budgets , â€ � he said .
â€œIf Iâ€ ™ m their problem , they havenâ€
™ t got a problem .
The reason Iâ€ ™ m coming out publicly is to remind people how dangerous this is , because with areas like the secret police , thereâ€ ™ s no accountability , thereâ€ ™ s no transparency.â€ � Oâ€ ™
Reilly is one of at least seven people who , at the request of the law firm acting for British Green party peer Jenny Jones , have volunteered passwords matching or closely resembling those on the whistleblowerâ€ ™ s list .
Jones , who received the allegations in a letter from the unnamed whistleblower , referred them to the IPCC and called for â€œa full - scale criminal investigation into the activities of these police officers and referral to a public inquiryâ€ � .
The IPCC has been separately investigating claims the Metropolitan police unit shredded a large number of documents in May 2014 , despite being told the files should be preserved for a judge - led public inquiry into undercover policing of political groups .
The letterâ€ ™ s author , who claimed to formerly work for the intelligence unit , said the unit worked with Indian police who used hackers to illegally obtain passwords for the email accounts of campaigners and some journalists , including from the Guardian .
The lettterâ€ ™ s writer said he or she had spoken out about the â€œserious abuse of powerâ€ � because â€œover the years , the unit had evolved into an organisation that had little respect for the law , no regard for personal privacy , encouraged highly immoral activity and , I believe , is a disgraceâ€ � .
The Metropolitan police service last month said it was â€œaware that the IPCC are carrying out an independent investigationâ€ � into â€œanonymous allegations concerning the accessing of personal dataâ€ � .
The police service had referred the matters to the watchdog on its request , it said .
Oâ€ ™ Reilly has served jail time in Ireland in 2003 and the US in 1991 over Ploughsharesâ€ ™ protests that inflicted damage on a US navy warplane and an airforce runway , respectively .
He was also detained five times under anti - terrorist legislation in Dublin , Belfast and London in a single year around 2008 .
He said that was part of authorities using â€œthe whole cover of the war on terrorism to crack down on the civil rights of non - violent , anti - war peopleâ€ � .
Oâ€ ™ Reilly said Edward Snowdenâ€ ™ s revelations about the National Security Agency showed there was â€œno privacy in email and textingâ€ � .
â€œBut in this case , how dodgy are [ the UK police ] to subcontract this out to India ?
Iâ€ ™ ve never been to India , never pissed off any Indians , so that was all a bit weird as well.â€ �
Oâ€ ™ Reilly has founded three activist support groups in the UK since 1996 , the first one allegedly infiltrated by a former soldier .
Oâ€ ™
Reilly said he suspected Giuseppe Conlon House , which he co - founded in 2010 to offer hospitality to war zone refugees in London , had been infiltrated from the start by a former activist who was â€œcompromised and turnedâ€ � by authorities .
He said he hoped the broader undercover policing inquiry would â€œreveal the specifics of how our efforts to offer solidarity to these most heroic people of our time were underminedâ€ � ."
2017-04-10,"For blowing the whistle , Edward Snowden has to live in exile , Julian Assange took refuge in an embassy and Chelsea Manning was sent to prison .
I received a phone call from Luciano Pavarotti .
I was co - founder of War Child , a charity set up in 1992 to help child victims of war in the former Yugoslavia .
Our first project was a mobile bakery feeding hungry families , but we soon found that it was not enough to just feed the body .
The mind needs food as well .
For us , that food was music .
Under shell fire in Sarajevo and Mostar , we brought traumatised children and young people together in cellars and broken buildings to sing , beat drums and make music â€ “ so they could begin to feel human again .
We quickly attracted support from the music business .
War Childâ€ ™ s early patrons included Luciano Pavarotti , Brian Eno and David Bowie .
With them on board , we decided to build a music centre , something positive to bring together communities that had been divided by war .
Something permanent that would outlast the conflict .
In a bombed - out school in Mostar , a new building rose from the rubble : the Pavarotti Music Centre .
On Sunday afternoons , 60 excited children would play djembes , maracas , handbells , marimbas and wood blocks .
Music workshops were taken into local schools and orphanages .
I was appointed its first director .
I had hoped the centre would act as a template for similar work in other conflict zones
â€ “ that it would be a revolutionary model for using music projects to help heal children traumatised by war .
Sadly , the dream was not to last .
The construction company offered a â€œgiftâ€ � to those in the charity responsible for awarding the building contract .
When I found out , I reported it to our trustees .
They decided that the project manager would remain in place until the centre opened , after which he must never be associated with the charity again .
There the matter might have rested .
But as a result of my disclosure I found myself isolated and ostracised within the charity .
I was living in Mostar , far away from the London office , but it was not far enough .
There were constant claims that I was ill , that I needed leave , that I had â€œgone nativeâ€ � .
Two years later , I found out that the project manager had been employed by the charity on another programme .
It was then I got my phone call from Pavarotti .
He asked me to fly to New York to plan the charityâ€ ™ s reform and , with his backing , I resigned as director of the music centre in Mostar and returned to work in London .
Within months , I had been sacked .
Pavarotti and Eno dropped their support for War Child but it made no difference .
Influential patrons may have the ability to generate media interest and fundraising for charities , but they have no legal status or authority under charity conventions .
Their high - profile departure had little effect on the trustees .
When I tried to explain the situation to the Charity Commission , they refused to meet me or read my documentation on the grounds that I was no longer employed by the charity .
Catch 22 .
I had no option but to approach the press .
It took four years for the truth to come out and the people responsible to be held to account .
Truth - tellers are not popular .
After the story broke , I was unable to find work in the aid world and started selling hi - fi systems .
Sixteen years later , the legacy of my whistleblowing still lingers .
When I offered my services recently as a volunteer to a well - known charity , I told them I had been a founder of War Child .
Their initial eagerness to have me stuff envelopes disappeared .
Since my sacking , the Charity Commission has started to offer greater support to whistleblowers .
There is now a dedicated email contact for those brave enough to put their heads above the parapet .
But they still emphasise that this is for employees only .
Nearly 20 years on from the Public Interest Disclosure Act , I believe whistleblowers should still contact Public Concern at Work , the whistleblowersâ€ ™ charity , as a first step .
My advice : proceed with caution and with all your documents intact .

2017-04-21,"Swedenâ€ ™ s existing warrant to extradite Julian Assange over a sexual assault allegation would be the first consideration for the British government if the Australian were to leave the Ecuadorean embassy , Home Office sources have indicated .
The US attorney general , Jeff Sessions , said on Thursday that the arrest of the WikiLeaks founder was now a â€œpriorityâ€ � .
US federal prosecutors were understood to be considering bringing charges against Assange over a number of the websiteâ€ ™ s publications since 2010 , US media reported , which could potentially lead to a second extradition request for Assange , from Washington .
Were that to happen , the question of which warrant would then take priority - from Sweden or the US - would then come into play .
However the British authorities stressed the UK had an existing legal obligation to extradite Assange to Sweden under the European arrest warrant .
The Home Office never confirms whether an extradition request has been made or received until the person in question has been arrested , the source indicated â€ “ this is currently impossible while Assange remains in the embassy , where he was granted asylum in 2012 .
Extradition law is notoriously complex , with requests to the UK from outside the EU governed by the Extradition Act 2003 .
It states that in the event of competing warrants from two countries , the home secretary would have to decide which took precedence , based on factors including the relative seriousness of the offences , the date the requests were received , and whether the person had been accused or convicted .
The government would not be able to take into account political or human rights issues , however , which would be for the courts to decide .
The US authorities can not touch Assange while he remains in the embassy seeking to avoid an arrest warrant on rape allegations in Sweden .
Ecuadorâ€ ™ s incoming president , the socialist LenÃ­n Moreno , has promised not to extradite him .
Barry Pollack , Assangeâ€ ™ s lawyer , denied any knowledge of any imminent prosecution .
â€œWeâ€ ™ ve had no communication with the Department of Justice and they have not indicated to me that they have brought any charges against Mr Assange ,
â€ � he told CNN .
â€œTheyâ€ ™ ve been unwilling to have any discussion at all , despite our repeated requests that they let us know what Mr Assangeâ€
™ s
status is in any pending investigations .
Thereâ€ ™ s no reason why WikiLeaks should be treated differently from any other publisher.â€
�
US authorities have been investigating Assange and WikiLeaks since at least 2010 , when the website released , in cooperation with publications including the Guardian , more than a quarter of a million classified cables from US embassies , which were leaked by US army whistleblower Chelsea Manning .
Asked whether it was a priority for the justice department to arrest Assange â€œonce and for allâ€ � , Sessions told a press conference in El Paso , Texas : â€œWe are going to step up our effort and already are stepping up our efforts on all leaks .
This is a matter thatâ€ ™ s gone beyond anything Iâ€ ™ m aware of .
We have professionals that have been in the security business of the United States for many years that are shocked by the number of leaks and some of them are quite serious.â€
�
He added : â€œSo yes , it is a priority .
Weâ€ ™ ve already begun to step up our efforts and whenever a case can be made , we will seek to put some people in jail.â€ �"
2017-04-21,"The arrest of WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange is now a â€œpriorityâ€ � for the US , the attorney general , Jeff Sessions , has said .
Hours later it was reported by CNN that authorities have prepared charges against Assange , who is currently holed up at the Ecuadorian embassy in London .
Donald Trump lavished praise on the anti - secrecy website during the presidential election campaign â€ “ â€œI love WikiLeaks , â€ � he once told a rally â€ “ but his administration has struck a different tone .
Asked whether it was a priority for the justice department to arrest Assange â€œonce and for allâ€ � , Sessions told a press conference in El Paso , Texas , on Thursday : â€œWe are going to step up our effort and already are stepping up our efforts on all leaks .
This is a matter thatâ€ ™ s gone beyond anything Iâ€ ™ m aware of .
We have professionals that have been in the security business of the United States for many years that are shocked by the number of leaks and some of them are quite serious.â€
�
He added : â€œSo yes , it is a priority .
Weâ€ ™ ve already begun to step up our efforts and whenever a case can be made , we will seek to put some people in jail.â€ �
Citing unnamed officials , CNN reported that prosecutors have struggled with whether the Australian is protected from prosecution by the first amendment , but now believe they have found a path forward .
A spokesman for the justice department declined to comment .
Barry Pollack , Assangeâ€ ™ s lawyer , denied any knowledge of imminent prosecution .
â€œWeâ€ ™ ve had no communication with the Department of Justice and they have not indicated to me that they have brought any charges against Mr Assange ,
â€ � he told CNN .
â€œTheyâ€ ™ ve been unwilling to have any discussion at all , despite our repeated requests , that they let us know what Mr Assangeâ€
™ s
status is in any pending investigations .
Thereâ€ ™ s no reason why WikiLeaks should be treated differently from any other publisher.â€
�
US authorities has been investigating Assange and WikiLeaks since at least 2010 when it released , in cooperation with publications including the Guardian , more than a quarter of a million classified cables from US embassies leaked by US army whistleblower Chelsea Manning .
Republican politicians expressed fury at the time , accusing Assange of treason , and Trump himself told an interviewer : â€œI think itâ€ ™ s disgraceful , I think there should be like death penalty or something.â€ �
All that changed during the election when WikiLeaks published emails acquired via Russian - backed hackers from the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clintonâ€ ™ s campaign .
Trump and his associates seized on the revelations , citing them with relish during speeches , prompting accusations of cynical opportunism .
Now in power , their attitude seems to have reverted to Republican orthodoxy .
In a speech last week in a speech at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington , the CIA director , Mike Pompeo , said : â€œItâ€ ™ s time to call out WikiLeaks for what it really is : a non - state hostile intelligence service often abetted by state actors like Russia.â€
�
He added : â€œJulian Assange has no first amendment freedoms .
Heâ€ ™ s sitting in an embassy in London .
Heâ€ ™ s not a US citizen.â€
�
But US authorities can not touch Assange while he remains in the Ecuadorian embassy in Britain , seeking to avoid an arrest warrant on rape allegations in Sweden .
Socialist candidate Lenin Moreno , who won the recent election in Ecuador , has promised not to extradite Assange ."
2017-04-21,"In an unprecedented and dangerous move that threatens the press freedom rights of all journalists , the US Justice Department has indicated it is preparing to charge WikiLeaks with a crime and may attempt to arrest its founder Julian Assange .
The charges may stem from the publication of US State Department cables in 2010 and their more recent of disclosure of CIA hacking tools .
Whether you like or dislike WikiLeaks â€ “ especially if you dislike them
â€ “
itâ€ ™ s important to understand just how dangerous this potential prosecution is to the future of journalism in the United States .
Newspapers publish classified information all the time , and any prosecution of WikiLeaks puts journalists of all stripes at risk of a similar fate .
Even WikiLeaksâ€ ™ harshest critics need to denounce this potential move as a grave threat to the first amendment .
People may not realize it , but not a week goes by without classified information on the front pages of the New York Times , Washington Post or Wall Street Journal .
Without the right to publish secret information , as New York Times reporter Max Frankel put it more than 40 years ago in the landmark Pentagon Papers case : â€œThere could be no adequate diplomatic , military and political reporting of the kind our people take for granted , either abroad or in Washington and there could be no mature system of communication between the government and the people.â€
�
There is no better example of this than the current reporting being done on the Trump administration : investigations that constantly require journalists to publish information that government considers classified .
Whether itâ€ ™ s the resignation of controversial national security adviser Michael Flynn , the Trump administrationâ€ ™ s plans for ramping up war across the globe , or the possibility it will bring back torture â€ “ the American people would be far worse off if none of this information came to light .
Itâ€ ™ s easy to see what the response to these potential charges will be from some WikiLeaks critics .
There is certainly a portion of the American public that holds an animus towards the organization due to the Clinton emails it published in the lead up to the presidential election and are eager to see the organization and Assange punished .
â€œJulian Assange isnâ€ ™ t a journalistâ€ � or â€œheâ€ ™ s not an American citizenâ€ � , will be the claims , in an attempt to distance him from other news organizations .
This is incredibly shortsighted .
Whatever criticism you want to level at WikiLeaks for its editorial judgment , there is no doubt that it publishes significant information that many people consider newsworthy .
Yes , the organization has angered two successive administrations because much of what it publishes is considered â€œsecretâ€ � , but so has every paper worth its salt in this country at one time or another .
Just because you may think WikiLeaks may have bad opinions , that it is more antagonistic , partisan or abrasive than traditional news organizations , does not mean that our free press should be put at risk with this vengeful and deeply misguided prosecution .
( By the way , first amendment rights are not just afforded to US citizens , they are universal to anyone who falls under US jurisdiction â€ “ citizen or not â€ “ contrary to what the CIA director thinks . )
And does anyone really think the Trump administration â€ “ with its avowed hatred for the press â€ “ is really going to stop at WikiLeaks ?
Republican and Trump supporter Peter King immediately went on CNN on Thursday and declared he was glad the Justice Department had apparently â€œfound a way to go afterâ€
�
WikiLeaks .
This is the same Peter King , who on multiple occasions in the last decade , has called for reporters to be prosecuted .
During the Bush administration , he said New York Times reporters should be jailed under the Espionage Act .
Then , under the Obama administration , he said the same thing about then - Guardian journalist Glenn Greenwald for his reporting on the Snowden documents .
This is the kind of reporter who will be next in line if the Justice Department succeeds in their alleged plans .
It was just a few weeks ago that Trump called the New York Times and other mainstream news organizations â€œthe enemy of the American peopleâ€ � .
He has constantly decried their critical reporting of his statements as â€œfake newsâ€ � , he threatened to sue news organizations or journalists at least a dozen times during the campaign , and openly questioned whether laws should be changed to make them easier to go after in court .
Donâ€ ™ t think for a moment that his administration wouldnâ€ ™ t immediately turn around and use any precedent set by a WikiLeaks prosecution to go after the next newspaper that publishes a critical story .
If the Trump Justice Department follows through on its threat , make no mistake : next time it wonâ€ ™ t be a publisher you donâ€ ™ t like , it will be the newspaper that Trump doesnâ€ ™ t like â€ “ likely the one you read every day .
So stick up for WikiLeaksâ€ ™ rights â€ “ or the New York Times , Washington Post or Guardian could be next ."
2017-04-23,"On 9 March 2017 , an ordinary Thursday morning , Ian Stubbings , a 35-year - old Londoner , was walking down the street near his office in South Kensington when he spotted a familiar face .
He turned and saw a man entering the redbrick terrace which houses the Ecuadorian embassy , where the WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange has been holed up since 2012 .
And the familiar face ?
It was Nigel Farage , the man who spearheaded Britainâ€ ™ s exit from the European Union .
â€œI thought â€˜hang on a momentâ€ ™
,â€ � Stubbings says .
â€œâ€˜That looks a bit dodgy.â€ ™
I knew the building was the embassy because I often see camera crews outside .
But there was no one else around .
I was the only person whoâ€ ™ d seen him .
And I didnâ€ ™ t know what the significance was â€ “
and I still donâ€
™ t actually â€
“
but I thought : thatâ€ ™ s got to be worth telling and I was the only person whoâ€ ™ d witnessed
it.â€
�
So , at 11.22am , he tweeted it .
His handle is @custardgannet and he wrote : â€œGenuine scoop : just saw Nigel Farage enter the Ecuadorian embassy.â€
� Moments later , a reporter from BuzzFeed , who happened to follow him on Twitter , picked it up and tweeted him back , and Stubbings told her : â€œNo press or cameras around.â€
�
No press or cameras around , that is , until BuzzFeed turned up just in time to catch Farage leaving , 40 minutes later .
â€œNigel Farage Just Visited the Ecuadorian Embassy in London ,
â€ � the headline said .
â€œAsked by BuzzFeed News if heâ€
™ d been visiting Julian Assange ,
the former Ukip leader said he could not remember what he had been doing in the building.â€ �
And that was how the world found out , by accident , that the founder of WikiLeaks , the organisation which published Hillary Clintonâ€ ™ s leaked emails â€ “ a decisive advantage for Donald Trumpâ€ ™ s campaign â€ “ and Farage , a friend of Donald Trump , were mutually acquainted .
In Britain , we routinely treat Farage as if he were Widow Twankey in the national pantomime that is Ukip politics .
And Widow Twankey dropping by on the man who lives in the Ecuadorian embassyâ€ ™ s broom cupboard seemed just one more weird moment in the weird times in which we now live ; six weeks on , it had faded into yet another episode in the surreality show that now passes for normality .
But in a week that saw two major developments on both sides of the Atlantic regarding the respective roles that Assange and Farage played in the US election and the EU referendum â€ “ the same week in which a UK general election was announced â€ “
it is an attitude that needs urgent re - examination .
For if you were to pick three individuals who had the most decisive impact on that most decisive of years , 2016 , it would be hard to see beyond Trump , Assange and Farage .
What was not known until Ian Stubbings decided to go for an early lunch is that there is a channel of communication between them .
Last week brought this more clearly into focus .
Because in a shock development last Thursday , the US justice department announced it had prepared charges with a view to arresting Assange .
A day later , the Electoral Commission announced it was investigating Leave .
EU â€ “ the Brexit campaign Farage headed .
Significantly , the commission said its investigation was â€œfocused on whether one or more donations â€ “ including of services
â€ “ accepted by Leave .
EU was impermissibleâ€ � .
One of the grounds on which a donation can be deemed â€œimpermissibleâ€
� is that it comes from abroad .
A fundamental principle of British democracy and our electoral laws is that foreign citizens and foreign companies can not buy influence in British elections via campaign donations .
Robert Mercer , the billionaire hedge fund owner , bankrolled the Trump campaign and his company , Cambridge Analytica , the Observer has revealed , donated services to Leave .
EU .
If this issue forms part of the Electoral Commission investigation , this isnâ€ ™ t
just a case of possibly breaking rules by overspending a few pounds .
It goes to the heart of the integrity of our democratic system .
Did Leave .
EU seek to obtain foreign support for a British election ?
And , if so , does this constitute â€œforeign subversionâ€
� ?
What did or didnâ€ ™ t happen on 9 March may perhaps reveal clues to understanding this .
To unravelling the links between WikiLeaks , the UK and the Trump administration â€ “ an administration embroiled in ever deeper connections to the Russian state .
Between Trump â€ “ whose campaign was funded by Mercer and who came to power with the help of the same analytics firm now under investigation for its work with Leave .
EU â€ “ and Brexit .
And 9 March was the day that all these worlds came together
â€ “ when the cyber - libertarian movement that Assange represents collided headfirst with the global rightwing libertarian movement that Farage represents .
When Nigel Farage tripped down the steps of the Ecuadorian embassy â€ “ a visit that he did not expect to be photographed or documented â€ “ a beam of light was shone on a previously hidden world : a political alignment between WikiLeaksâ€ ™ ideology , Ukipâ€ ™ s ideology and Trumpâ€ ™ s ideology that is not necessarily just an affinity .
It is also , potentially , a channel of communication .
David Golumbia , an associate professor at Virginia Commonwealth University in the US who has studied WikiLeaks , describes it as â€œthe moment when the lines suddenly become visibleâ€ � .
He says : â€œIt was like the picture suddenly came into focus .
There is this worldwide , rightwing , nationalistic movement that is counter to the EU , and this is present in the US and Europe and Russia , and we are just starting to understand how they do all seem to be in communication and co - ordination with each other.â€ �
In many ways , it wasnâ€ ™ t a surprise .
There are clear ideological similarities between Assange and Farage .
They have both been regulars on RT , Russiaâ€ ™ s state - sponsored news channel .
They have both been paid â€ “ indirectly by the Russian state â€ “ to appear on it .
Ben Nimmo , a defence analyst with the Atlantic Councilâ€ ™ s
Digital Forensic Research Lab , points out that Farage has voted systematically in favour of Russian interests in the European parliament .
â€œThere is very , very strong support for the Kremlin among the far right in Europe .
And Farage is squarely in that bloc with the likes of the Front National in France and Jobbik in Hungary.â€ �
In February , when I started my investigation into Leave .
EU and Cambridge Analytica
, I met Andy Wigmore , its director of communications , for a coffee
and he told me that Farage was in the US , where he was going to be making a big platform speech at CPAC , the US conservative conference .
â€œAnd itâ€ ™ s not going to be his normal â€˜Mr Brexitâ€ ™ speech , â€ � he said .
â€œHeâ€ ™ s going to be talking about the need for closer relations with Russia.â€
�
Really ?
I said .
That sounds odd .
â€œWhat ?
No way .
Farage has been across the subject for years in the European parliament.â€ �
It didnâ€ ™ t make much sense at the time â€ “ and , in fact , that wasnâ€ ™ t the speech that Farage made .
On 24 February , he told the crowd : â€œOur real friends in the world speak English.â€ � The next evening he had dinner with Trump at the Washington Trump hotel and tweeted a photo of him with â€œthe Donaldâ€ � in the early hours of the morning .
Eleven days later , he headed off to the Ecuadorian embassy .
BuzzFeedâ€ ™ s story dropped at 1.31pm .
And , 57 minutes later , at 2.28pm , WikiLeaks made an announcement : it would host a live press conference by Julian Assange about his latest leak , â€œVault 7â€ � .
The timing of this was lost in the â€œisnâ€ ™ t that bizarre?â€ � tone of the coverage .
And , maybe , also , itâ€ ™ s only with distance that it raises significant questions
â€ “ not least because the complex web of connections between the Trump administration is a challenge for even hardened US newshounds to follow .
Nearly every day of 2017 has brought forth some new nugget of fact about â€œTrump - Russiaâ€ � but this was a tough week for Trump , even by his standards .
The â€œwitch - huntâ€ � , as heâ€ ™ s termed it , was gathering pace .
On 2 March , his attorney general , Jeff Sessions , recused himself from the Trump - Russia investigation and , on 4 March , Trump retaliated in a tweetstorm which accused Obama of â€œwiretappingâ€ � him .
And then , on 7 March , he finally caught a break .
Some other news came along to knock him off the front page .
For more than a month , WikiLeaks had been periodically issuing cryptic tweets about Vault 7 .
A month passed before it finally landed : a leak that , whether by accident or design , embarrassed the CIA .
WikiLeaksâ€ ™ data trove had come from what it called â€œthe CIAâ€ ™
s
global hacking forceâ€ � , its Center for Cyber Intelligence .
â€œCIA scrambles to contain damage from WikiLeaks documents , â€ � said the headline in what Trump calls the â€œfailing New York Timesâ€ � .
The documents apparently showed that the CIA had the capability to hack a huge number of devices , not just phones but also TVs .
In the midst of the most serious investigation of foreign cyber - interference in a current administration in US history , vivid revelations about the USâ€ ™ s similar capacity to interfere abroad had hit the headlines .
A highly placed contact with links to US intelligence told the Observer : â€œWhen the heat is turned up and all electronic communication , you have to assume , is being intensely monitored , then those are the times when intelligence communication falls back on human couriers .
Where you have individuals passing information in ways and places that can not be monitored.â€ �
When asked about the meeting in the embassy , Farage said : â€œI never discuss where I go or who I see.â€ �
In October , Roger Stone , a Republican strategist whose links to Russia are currently under investigation by the FBI , told a local CBS reporter about â€œa back - channel communication with Assange , because we have a good mutual friend â€ ¦ that friend travels back and forth from the United States to London and we talkâ€ � .
Asked directly by the Observer if Nigel Farage was that friend , his spokesman said : â€œDefinitely not.â€ � And in some ways , this may not be the point .
A channel exists .
In the perfect storm of fake news , disinformation and social media in which we now live , WikiLeaks is , in many ways , the swirling vortex at the centre of everything .
Farageâ€ ™ s relationship with the organisation is just one of a whole host of questions to which we currently have no answer .
Some of those questions dog Arron Banks , the Bristol businessman who bankrolled Leave .
EU and who announced last week that he is standing for election in Clacton .
When I interviewed him last month , he said : â€œNot a single penny of Russian money has been put into Brexitâ€ �
â€ “ though that wasnâ€ ™ t a question I had asked him .
He is , however , openly pro - Putin and anti - democracy .
â€œItâ€ ™ s not possible to run that entire country [ Russia ] as a pure democracy , â€ � he said .
When asked about the investigation into Leave .
EUâ€
™ s
campaign finances
, he told me : â€œI donâ€ ™ t give a monkeyâ€ ™ s about the Electoral Commission.â€
�
On Friday night , he released a letter saying that he would no longer co - operate with the commission â€ “ a body mandated by parliament to uphold UK electoral law â€ “ and said he would â€œsee them in courtâ€ � .
As Britain hurtles towards a general election to choose a government that will take us out of the European Union , this may be the moment to realise that Nigel Farage is not Widow Twankey , and that this is not a pantomime .
Farageâ€ ™ s politics and his relationships are more complicated than we , the British press , have previously realised .
His relationship to Mercer and Cambridge Analytica , the same firm that helped Trump to power , is now under official investigation .
Every day , more and more questions are being asked about that administration .
Yet , here in Britain , we plunge blindly on .
Real , hard questions need to asked about what exactly these relationships are and what they mean .
Donâ€ ™ t they ?"
2017-05-15,"Edward Snowden and Noam Chomsky are among those calling on Donald Trump to drop the US governmentâ€ ™ s investigation into Julian Assange and WikiLeaks .
The pair â€ “ along with more than 100 other activists , journalists and government workers â€ “ have signed an open letter to the president that calls prosecuting WikiLeaks â€œa threat to all free journalismâ€ � .
The letter asks the Department of Justice to drop plans to charge Assange and other WikiLeaks staff members .
â€œIf the DoJ is able to convict a publisher for its journalistic work , all free journalism can be criminalised , â€ � says the open letter , released on Monday by the Courage Foundation , a trust that raises funds for the legal defenses of whistleblowers , including Snowden .
The group launched a campaign in support of WikiLeaks last month .
Trump praised WikiLeaks on the campaign trail , telling a Pennsylvania rally in October 2016 : â€œI love
WikiLeaks.â€ �
The organization had leaked Hillary Clintonâ€ ™ s emails .
Others in his administration , however , have not expressed the same enthusiasm .
The US attorney general , Jeff Sessions , said last month that Assangeâ€ ™
s arrest was a â€œpriorityâ€ � for the US .
Sessionsâ€ ™ words prompted the open letter .
The letter to Trump reads : â€œIt was a free and robust press that provided you with a platform on which to run for president .
Defending a truly free press requires freedom from fear and favour and the support of journalists and citizens everywhere ; for the kind of threat now facing WikiLeaks â€ “ and all publishers and journalists â€
“ is a step into the darkness.â€ �
The signatories also include the musician PJ Harvey , the former British intelligence officer Annie Machon , the Australian senator Lee Rhiannon and the philosopher Slavoj Å½iÅ¾ek .
US prosecutors have been investigating WikiLeaks since at least 2010 , when it released more than 250 m classified cables from US embassies around the world .
The cables were passed to WikiLeaks by Chelsea Manning â€ “ a former US army intelligence analyst who is also backed by the Courage Foundation â€ “ and were published in cooperation with news organizations including the Guardian .
In April , Sessions was asked at a press conference in Texas whether it was a priority for the justice department to arrest Assange â€œonce and for allâ€ � .
He said : â€œWe are going to step up our effort , and already are stepping up our efforts on all leaks .
This is a matter thatâ€ ™ s gone beyond anything Iâ€ ™ m aware of .
We have professionals that have been in the security business of the United States for many years that are shocked by the number of leaks , and some of them are quite serious.â€ �
He added : â€œSo yes , it is a priority .
Weâ€ ™ ve already begun to step up our efforts and whenever a case can be made , we will seek to put some people in jail.â€ �
The US has not been able to prosecute Assange because he has been living in the Ecuadorian embassy in Britain since 2012 .
If he were to leave the embassy , British authorities have indicated they would have to first consider an existing extradition request from Sweden , where Assange is wanted on an allegation of rape , which he denies ."
2017-05-19,"We are going to wrap up our blog for the day .
Here is our latest story , taking in Assangeâ€ ™ s comments from the Ecuadorian embassy in London .
Thanks for reading .
Haroon Siddique has filed for us from outside the Ecuadorian embassy in London : Julian Assange has said that the battle is over but the war has just begun after Swedish prosecutors dropped their investigations into allegations of rape against the WikiLeaks founder .
Standing on the balcony of the Ecuadorian embassy , Assange lambasted the Metropolitan policeâ€ ™ s threat to arrest him on charges of skipping bail as â€œuntenableâ€ � .
There were a few cheers as Assange emerged , clad in a brown leather jacket and raising a clenched fist , but his supporters were vastly outnumbered by the worldâ€ ™ s media .
He said : â€œToday is an important victory for me and for the UNâ€ ™ s human rights system but it by no means erases the years of detention without charge in prison , under house arrest and almost five years here in this embassy without sunlight , seven years without charge while my children grew up without me .
And that is not something I can forget , it is not something I can forgive.â€ � Reporters and photographers were joined by curious passersby and tourists as the crowd swelled during the day after the Swedish announcement on Friday morning .
Assange kept the throng waiting until seven hours after that announcement before addressing them .
In a speech lasting about 10 minutes that was frequently interrupted by a heckler shouting â€œWhat is the truth?â€ � and comparing Assange to the central character in Monty Pythonâ€ ™ s Life of Brian , the WikiLeaks founder took aim at Sweden , the UK , the EU - specifically its extradition system - and the US .
â€œWhile today is an important victory and an important vindication , the road is far from over , the proper war is just commencing , â€ �
he said .
â€œThe claim by the UK that it has a right to arrest me for seeking asylum in a case where there have been no charges is simply untenable.â€ � Assange said a more important victory was the release of Chelsea Manning earlier this week .
He made no mention of the woman who accused him of rape .
Press Association have published their first take on the Assange appearance : Julian Assange has signalled he will remain inside the Ecuadorian embassy in London despite the Swedish authorities suddenly dropping a seven - year investigation against him .
The WikiLeaks founder made a rare appearance on the balcony of the central London building to hail the decision by Swedenâ€ ™ s director of public prosecutions as an â€œimportant victoryâ€ � .
He gave a clenched fist salute to his supporters , and scores of journalists and TV crews , before maintaining that a â€œlegal conflictâ€ � with the United States and the UK continues .
The Australian , who has lived inside the embassy for almost five years , said the â€œroad is far from overâ€ � , adding it was â€œextremely regretfulâ€
� that he was still being threatened with arrest if he leaves the embassy .
Assange said he had spent seven years either under house arrest or living inside the embassy , without charge , as he faced sex - related allegations in Sweden , which he has always denied .
He had missed seeing his children growing up .
â€œThat is not something I can forgive , or forget , â€ � he said , maintaining that he had been the victim of a â€œterrible injusticeâ€ �
.
Detention and extradition without charge had become a feature of the EU , but it was not something expected from the rule of law in the UK , he said .
Assange thanked the government of Ecuador for granting him political asylum despite â€œintense pressureâ€ � , as well as his legal team and others who had stood by him .
â€œWe have today won an important victory , but the road is far from over .
The proper war is just commencing.â€ �
He pledged that WikiLeaks will continue distributing material about the activities of the CIA in the United States , and will â€œaccelerateâ€ � its publications .
â€œThe claim that the UK has the right to arrest me for seeking asylum in a case where there have been no charges is simply untenable .
â€œMy legal staff have contacted the UK authorities and we hope to engage in a dialogue about what is the best way forward.â€ � Assange said the UK had refused to confirm or deny whether there is a warrant from the US for his extradition , insisting he was happy to talk to the US Justice Department .
He returned into the building which has been his home for almost five years , without answering questions .
Assange said his legal battle is not over , despite the decision by Swedish prosecutors to drop their investigation into him .
Using defiant language , the WikiLeaks founder said : â€œThe road is far from over â€ ¦ the proper war is just commencingâ€ � .
A â€œlegal conflictâ€ � with the United States and the UK continues , he added .
On what happens next , Assange signalled that he would remain inside the embassy for the time being , and that he was seeking dialogue with British and US officials : My legal staff have contacted the UK authorities , and we hope to engage in a dialogue on what is the best way forward .
To some extent the UK has been exploited by the process it entered into with the EU , where it agreed to extradite people without charge .
That is to an extent a forced position the UK has been put into .
And , the first part of that is over .
The UK refuses to confirm or deny at this stage whether a US extradition warrant is in the UK territory .
While there have been extremely threatening remarks made [ in the US ]
Iâ€ ™ m always happy to engage in a dialogue with the Department of Justice about what has occurred .
Assange has long said he think the US wants him extradited and arrested in connection with WikiLeaksâ€ ™ publication of classified US documents .
He contends that the US should recognise his First Amendment rights as a journalist .
Assange addresses the release of Chelsea Manning from prison in the US : We have had an even more important victory this week [ and ] that is the release of Chelsea Manning after seven years in military prison .
Assange thanks Ecuador , in whose embassy he has been holed up : I would like to thank Ecuador , its people and its asylum system .
They have stood by my asylum in the face of intense pressure .
â€œToday is an important victory for me , â€ � Assange says , adding that his seven - year legal ordeal , which he calls unjust detention , â€œis not something that I can forgive.â€
�
It was â€œextremely regretfulâ€
� that he was still being threatened with arrest if he leaves the embassy , he added , going on to say : The inevitable inquiry into what has occurred in this moment of terrible injustice is something that I hope will be more than just about me â€ ¦ because the reality is that detention and extradition without charge has become a feature of the EU .
Julian Assange is addressing the media and his supporters from the embassy in central London .
Word outside the Ecuadorian embassy is that Assange will make a statement at 4.3opm , writes Haroon Siddique .
In the meantime we are going to pause the blog .
Thanks for reading so far .
Barry J Pollack , the lawyer who represents Assange in the US , told the Guardian that the Swedish decision â€œonly highlights the fact Mr Assange has been unlawfully detained for yearsâ€ � , writes Esther Addley .
He added : â€œRecent comments by the United States Attorney General and Director of the CIA demonstrate the obvious need of Mr Assange for asylum .
The UK has no legitimate basis to interfere with Ecuadorâ€ ™ s lawful decision.â€ � Jeff Sessions , the attorney general , recently said arresting Assange was a â€œpriorityâ€ � for the US , while Mike Pompeo , CIA director , described Wikileaks as a â€œhostile intelligence serviceâ€ � .
While we wait for Assange to appear , hereâ€ ™ s a summary of how things stand : Swedish prosecutors have dropped their preliminary investigation into an allegation of rape against the WikiLeaks founder , Julian Assange , bringing an end to a seven - year legal standoff .
The decision was taken after prosecutors concluded that â€œat this point , all possibilities to conduct the investigation are exhaustedâ€
� , said Swedenâ€ ™ s director of public prosecutions , Marianne Ny .
Ny warned that the case could be reopened if Assange returns to Sweden before the statute of limitations ends in 2020 .
While Assange no longer faces sex crime allegations in Sweden , the Metropolitan Police have said there is still a warrant for Assangeâ€
™ s arrest on the less serious offence of failing to surrender to the court in June 2012 .
It would be â€œobliged to execute the warrantâ€ � if Assange leaves the Ecuadorian embassy , it said .
A European arrest warrant against Assange has been dropped .
Theresa May said added any decision about UK action in relation to Assange were he to leave embassy is â€œoperational matter for the police.â€ �
It is not known whether US authorities are seeking Assangeâ€
™ s arrest for his role at the head of WikiLeaks , which has published tens of thousands of leaked classified US documents .
There may be a sealed indictment .
Last month US attorney general Jeff Sessions said arresting Assange was a priority .
Ecuadorâ€ ™ s foreign minister Guillaume Long said his country will now try to secure safe passage for Assange .
â€œEcuador will now be intensifying its diplomatic efforts with the UK so that Julian Assange can gain safe passage , in order to enjoy his asylum in Ecuador , â€ � he told the Guardian .
WikiLeaks said it feared Assange still faces extradition to the US .
After the Swedish announcement it tweeted : â€œUK refuses to confirm or deny whether it has already received a US extradition warrant for Julian Assange .
Focus now moves to UK.â€ �
Per E Samuelsson ,
Assangeâ€ ™ s lawyer in Sweden , claims the decision is vindication for this client .
He said : â€œThis is a total victory for Julian Assange .
He is now free to leave the embassy when he wants .
We have won the Assange case .
A lawyer for Assangeâ€ ™ s accuser called the prosecutorâ€ ™ s decision a â€œscandalâ€ � .
Elisabeth Fritz said : â€œIt is a scandal that a suspected rapist can escape justice and thereby avoid the courts.â€ � Assange has warned he does not â€œforgive or forgetâ€ � .
Earlier he tweeted a picture of himself smiling .
David Leigh , the Guardianâ€ ™ s former investigations editor who worked with Assange over the leaked US embassy cables , has dismissed US rhetoric about arresting the Wikileaks founder .
Leigh was asked by BBC News about US Attorney Jeff Sessions claiming that arresting Assange was a priority .
â€œWell thatâ€ ™ s all just noise , â€ � Leigh replied .
He said : â€œThe fact is that there is no official extradition request that has been made known from the US to the UK to get hold of Julian Assange .
The Obama administration had probably dropped the idea of arresting and extraditing Assange .
â€œThen his antics during the Trump campaign [ when ] he leaked material maybe supplied by the Russians to discredit the Democrats , helped get Trump in .
It now appears to be the Trump administration who are acting in a pretty hostile way .
So that is very ironic.â€ �
Leigh added : My guess is we are not going to see Julian stick his head out of the door today .
If he had faced music in Sweden and had been convicted , then any punishment he would have got would have been less than being locked up for seven years in a little room in the Ecuadorian embassy .
We wrote a book about Julian Assange and we researched and investigated in great detail these sexual allegations .
We discovered there was a good deal of evidence to support them .
There was no evidence whatever that the women were part of some kind of CIA honeytrap .
Assange has bounced around like pinball .
The one thing he has succeeded in doing is getting attention for himself and the story probably has got a bit further to run .
There may be no sign yet of Assange at the windows of the Ecuadorian embassy , but he does appear to be following this blog .
Claes BorgstrÃ¶m , who originally represented the two women but who is no longer involved in the case , has expressed regret that Assange will not be prosecuted in Sweden , writes Amelia Gentleman .
â€œFor the two women it would have been good if he had been examined in court .
He will now never be found not guilty , â€ �
BorgstrÃ¶m said .
He said one of the women , the one whom he represented most recently , â€œis not interested in making any comment or doing any interviews .
It is so long ago now .
She has tried to put that behind her and live a normal life .
She doesnâ€ ™ t want to be reminded of what happened.â€ �
He added : â€œI understand why the prosecutors have dropped the case now .
Such a long time has passed .
But I regret that Julian Assange was not brought to the Swedish court of law to answer the allegations against him.â€ � BorgstrÃ¶m added : That would have been the thing that should have happened , but he avoided that by going to the Ecuadorian embassy .
From both womenâ€ ™ s point of view , it would have been reasonable that he had to answer to what they say he has done to them .
The Swedish courts have found it most probably that he has committed crimes against them , he was arrested on probable cause .
The courts in Sweden , the district court , the court of appeal and the supreme court , have found it probable that he has committed what the prosecutors claimed .
The whole case is left with that knowledge .
He [ Assange ] decided to avoid the arms of justice .
He didnâ€ ™ t want to come to court .
He didnâ€ ™ t want to answer the allegations , so he decided to escape .
Julian Knowles , a Matrix chambers barrister who specialises in extradition says the US might to have to act swiftly if they want to arrest Assange .
Speaking to BBC Radio 4
he said the complicating factor in Assangeâ€ ™ s
case is that he has committed a bail act offence by failing to surrender to court .
He said He has committed a criminal offence , so the Metropolitan police do have the power to arrest him for that , because there is a ordinary English criminal lay warrant outstanding for him .
Whether they will do that , given the underlying predicate namely the Swedish rape allegation has fallen away remains to be seen .
They [ Scotland Yard ] have made a statement saying they will deal with it proportionately , so I think they are hedging their bets at the moment .
Warrants can always be withdrawn not every criminal offence gets prosecuted .
So I would imagine there will be discussions going on between the police and the Crown Prosecution Service as to what to do about that domestic offence .
Asked about the US attempts to extradite Assange , Knowles said : That is an unknown quantity .
I couldnâ€
™ t understand if the Americans wanted him why they didnâ€ ™ t take action some years ago .
There was no logic in them waiting for the Swedish proceedings to take precedence because it just made things more complicated .
On that basis I would wonder whether the US really do want him .
But if they do they would have to move swiftly because if he is not proceeded against as a bail act offence , heâ€ ™ ll be a free man when he leaves the Ecuadorian embassy and he will be able to go anywhere in the world where he is lawfully able to go .
If the United States are interested in getting him they will have to first of all obtain a provisional warrant from the court here and that will then provide a basis of arrest .
But whether they are going to do that , or have done that , is an unknown quantity at the moment .
Assange has fired off a new tweet saying he does not â€œforget or forgiveâ€ � .
Meanwhile , journalists are still waiting for him to speak at the embassy .
Vaughan Smith , the former army officer who housed Assange in his Norfolk mansion in 2010 after he was bailed , says Assange should now be allowed to walk free .
Smith , who spoke to Assange earlier this month , told BBC Radio 4â€ ™ s
World at One programme that the Wikileaks founder had complained of a lack of progress by Swedish prosecutors .
â€œHe felt that Marianne Ny was aiming to protect her reputation because she didnâ€ ™ t have the evidence against him , â€ � he said .
Smith added : I feel very pleased .
One feels a bit vindicated , as do the supporters that have stuck by Julian .
I can completely understand why Julian felt this was politically motivated .
We should be asking ourselves has there been a political misuse of the judicial process .
He added : The woman in question and Julian Assange have let down by a failure to prosecute .
They have missed the opportunity to find out what actually happened .
It is a massive distraction from the real issue , which is the important debate we are having about the role of whistleblowers and secrecy in our society .
I would like to see it resolved .
I think he should be let out .
Ecuadorâ€ ™ s foreign minister Guillaume Long has welcomed the Swedish decision and confirmed that his country will now try to secure safe passage for Assange .
He said he â€œregrets that the Swedish prosecutor delayed more than four years in carrying out this interviewâ€ � .
He described the conduct of prosecutors as â€œwholly unacceptable ... which has led to unnecessary delays in progressing this case .
â€œGiven that the European arrest warrant no longer holds , Ecuador will now be intensifying its diplomatic efforts with the UK so that Julian Assange can gain safe passage , in order to enjoy his asylum in Ecuador.â€ � Prof Mads Andenas who chaired the UN working group which claimed that Assangeâ€ ™ s plight in the embassy amounted to arbitrary detention , welcomed Swedenâ€ ™ s decision .
He said : This is a victory for the rule of law .
The warrant was contestable .
There were dissents in both the UK and Swedish supreme courts .
Also the majority in the UK supreme court was concerned by several aspects of the extradition request .
The Swedish supreme court laid down strict requirements and warned the prosecutors to speed up or drop the case .
The UN working group on arbitrary detention found ( 4 - 1 ) violations of international law .
Assangeâ€ ™ s accuser called the prosecutorâ€ ™ s decision a â€œscandalâ€ � , her lawyer has said .
â€œIt is a scandal that a suspected rapist can escape justice and thereby avoid the courts , â€ � the lawyer , Elisabeth Fritz , told AFP in an email .
â€œMy client is shocked and no decision to [ end the case ] can make her change [ her view ] that Assange exposed her to rape , â€ �
she said .
Theresa May appears to be trying to keep her distance from Assangeâ€ ™ s fate .
Asked if Britain would now support a request to extradite Assange to the United States , the prime minister said : â€œWe look at extradition requests on a case - by - case basis.â€ � Speaking at a Conservative campaign event in Edinburgh , May added : â€œIn relation to Julian Assange , any decision that is taken about UK action in relation to him were he to leave the Ecuadorian embassy would be an operational matter for the police.â€ �
There has been no sign of Julian Assange emerging from the Ecuadorian embassy yet , much to the frustration of the 70-plus members of the press gathered outside , writes Haroon Siddique .
A throng has gathered under the balcony where Assange has previously addressed the media , in 2015 and 2012 on the day he first entered .
A police car with three officers inside is parked opposite the building in Knightsbridge , London , presumably ready to arrest the WikiLeaks founder on charges of skipping bail , which the Met has said he is still wanted for .
More police cars and officers are stationed nearby .
The most excitement so far came when the embassy cat , which even has its own Twitter account , made a brief appearance in the window , the cue for the waiting , bored photographers to start clicking .
Glenn Greenwald , the former Guardian journalist who worked with NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden , points out that Assange is far from free .
Writing on the Intercept he says : â€œThe termination of the Swedish investigation is , in one sense , good news for Assange .
But it is unlikely to change his inability to leave the embassy any time soon .
If anything , given the apparent determination of the Trump administration to put him in a US prison cell for the â€˜crimeâ€ ™ of publishing documents , his freedom appears farther away than it has since 2010 , when the Swedish case began.â€ � The Crown Prosecution Service has confirmed to the Guardian that the European arrest warrant against Assange has been dropped after Swedenâ€ ™ s request .
Ecuador says it will now seek safe passage for Assange from its embassy in London to Ecuador , a source close to the case at the Ecuadorian foreign ministry told PA .
It quoted the source saying : â€œGiven that the European arrest warrant no longer holds , Ecuador will now be intensifying its diplomatic efforts with the UK so that Julian Assange can gain safe passage in order to enjoy his asylum in Ecuador.â€
�
The source also said : Ecuador welcomes the decision to drop the charges against Julian Assange .
This decision follows the interview of Julian Assange in Ecuadorâ€ ™ s embassy in London in November 2016 .
Ecuador regrets that the Swedish prosecutor delayed more than four years in carrying out this interview .
This unnecessary delay was despite the repeated insistence from the Ecuadorian government , since Ecuador granting asylum in 2012 , that this interview was not only possible but that Ecuador would facilitate it in its embassy .
Ecuador was clear from the outset that it would fully co - operate with the Swedish justice system .
As was once again communicated to the Swedish state as recently as May 8 , Ecuador has regularly criticised as wholly unacceptable the conduct of the Swedish prosecutor which has led to unnecessary delays in progressing this case .
The European arrest warrant has been formally discharged , according to Richard Ford from the Times .
Earlier Swedenâ€ ™ s chief prosecutor , Marianne Ny , confirmed that Sweden had withdrawn its request for a European arrest warrant against Assange .
Franceâ€ ™ s leftwing former presidential candidate , Jean - Luc MÃ
© lenchon ,
claims Swedenâ€
™ s decision is vindication of his support for Assange .
This is Matthew Weaver taking over from Jon .
Our old colleague David Leigh , the former investigations editor of the Guardian , worked with Assange on the edited publication of the leaked US embassy cables before falling out with the WikiLeaks founder .
Leigh , now a professor of journalism at City University , reckons that Swedenâ€ ™ s decision to drop the investigation ( there were no charges ) will change nothing .
Hereâ€ ™ s what we know so far about Swedish prosecutorsâ€ ™ unexpected decision to drop their investigation into a rape claim against WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange after almost seven years : The decision was taken because â€œall prospects of pursuing the investigation under present circumstances are exhaustedâ€
� and there is â€œno reason to believe that the decision to surrender [ Assange ] to Sweden can be executed in the foreseeable futureâ€ � .
It means Assange no longer faces sex crime allegations in Sweden , though prosecutors stressed they are not making a finding on Assangeâ€ ™ s guilt or innocence and the investigation could be reopened should he return to the country before the statute of limitation expires in 2020 .
In London , the Metropolitan Police have said there is still a warrant for Assangeâ€ ™ s arrest on the less serious offence of failing to surrender to the court in June 2012 .
It would be â€œobliged to execute the warrantâ€ � if Assange leaves the Ecuadorian embassy , it said .
It is not known whether US authorities are seeking Assangeâ€
™ s arrest for his role at the head of WikiLeaks , which has published tens of thousands of leaked classified US documents .
There may be a sealed indictment .
WikiLeaks tweeted after the Swedish announcement : â€œUK refuses to confirm or deny whether it has already received a US extradition warrant for Julian Assange .
Focus now moves to UK.â€ �
Per E Samuelsson ,
Assangeâ€ ™ s lawyer in Sweden , told Swedish radio : â€œThis is a total victory for Julian Assange .
He is now free to leave the embassy when he wants .
We have won the Assange case.â€
�
The head of the Swedish bar association , Bengt Ivarsson , has told Svenska Dagbladet that the investigation into the rape allegations against Assange â€œdid not move forward fast enoughâ€ � and has â€œcreated a negative image of the prosecution
serviceâ€
� :
A government official has a responsibility to push an investigation forward .
It has not happened in this case .
Quite early on it was clear that Assange was not going to allow himself to be questioned in Sweden ...
The investigation has had a major impact internationally .
And how this has been handled is not an advantage for the Swedish legal system .
It has created a negative image of the prosecution service .
This is the scene outside the Ecuadorian embassy in London where Assange has been living since taking refuge there in 2012 .
Thereâ€ ™ s not a huge amount happening at the moment ...
The British Home Office has said the decision to drop the investigation into Assange is â€œa matter for the Swedish authorities and not one which the UK government has had any involvement
inâ€
� .
It added that Britain had a legal obligation to execute the European arrest warrant and arrest Assange , and that the EAW had been upheld by the UK courts , including the supreme court , which at every stage had found his extradition to Sweden would be â€œentirely lawfulâ€ � .
The EAW will be formally withdrawn in the UK courts , it said .
My colleague Matt Weaver says Peter Tatchell , one of Assangeâ€ ™ s most prominent supporters , has given a guarded welcome to the decision , but said he still faces the risk of extradition to the US .
Tatchell told BBC news : â€œIt is good news from Julianâ€ ™ s point of view .
Iâ€ ™ m not in a position to say whether the allegations against him were true or not .
He has always denied them .
He was never charged with any sexual offence , these are only at the level of allegations .
So it is a relief that they are being no longer being pursued .
But it is not entirely satisfactory because the Swedish prosecutors seemed to say that they case could be reopened if he at any point returned to Sweden.â€
� Before he could leave the embassy , Tatchell added , Assange would need to â€œconsult his legal advisers and begin some dialogue with the Metropolitan police and if necessary
the attorney generalâ€ � .
He added : Much more substantive is the risk if he stepped outside the embassy that he could face extradition to the United States .
We know that there is an ongoing national security investigation into Julian Assange and Wikileaks .
We believe that a secret grand jury has been empanelled ...
US attorney general Jeff Sessions said arresting Assange was a priority .
So he certainly is in danger of extradition to the US .
Assangeâ€ ™ s Swedish lawyer , Per E Samuelsson , has been talking to Swedish media .
According to Svenska Dagbladet , he said Assange was â€œhappy but laconicâ€ � and described the day as â€œa major victory for my client and myselfâ€ �
: This is one of the happiest days of my life as a lawyer .
The decision is based on the fact that he was questioned in November 2016 and could provide a good explanation of what happened .
In April this year , we had evidence that the US is chasing him .
It seems completely unreasonable for Sweden to prevent him from obtaining political asylum .
The lawyer added that the case had been dropped because prosecutors approved Assangeâ€ ™ s argument about what had happened when the alleged rape occurred : â€œThis is obviously a case of consensual sex between two adultsâ€ � .
With regard to the UK arrest warrant , under which Assange could still be arrested if he leaves the Ecuadorian embassy , he said he did â€œnot know what Julian will decide to do nowâ€ � .
A lawyer for Assange has welcomed the Swedish decision .
Christophe Marchand , a member of Assangeâ€ ™ s Brussels - based legal team , told AFP : We have been waiting a long time for this decision .
Julian Assange has been a victim of a huge abuse of procedure .
We are very pleased and very moved , as this marks the end of his nightmare .
WikiLeaks , the organisation Assange founded to â€œanalyse and publish large datasets of censored or otherwise restricted official materials involving war , spying and corruptionâ€ � , has said the ball is now in Britainâ€ ™ s court : Here are the key remarks from the chief prosecutor , Marianne Ny : In view of the fact that all prospects of pursuing the investigation under present circumstances are exhausted , it appears that it is no longer proportionate to maintain the arrest of Julian Assange in his absence .
Consequently , there is no basis upon which to continue the investigation .
Swedish prosecutors have released a statement explaining the reasoning behind their unexpected decision to drop the case against Assange .
Here are the key paragraphs : Almost five years ago Julian Assange was permitted refuge at the Ecuadorian embassy in London , where he has resided ever since .
In doing so , he has escaped all attempts by the Swedish and British authorities to execute the decision to surrender him to Sweden in accordance with the EU rules concerning the European arrest warrant .
According to Swedish legislation , a criminal investigation is to be conducted as quickly as possible .
At the point when a prosecutor has exhausted the possibilities to continue the investigation , the prosecutor is obliged to discontinue the investigation .
At this point , all possibilities to conduct the investigation are exhausted .
In order to proceed with the case , Julian Assange would have to be formally notified of the criminal suspicions against him .
We can not expect to receive assistance from Ecuador regarding this .
Therefore the investigation is discontinued .
As a result of the decision to discontinue the investigation , the prosecutor has reversed the decision to detain him in his absence and withdrawn the EAW .
The prosecutors say , however , that the investigation â€œcould be reopened if Assange returns to Sweden before the statute of limitations ends in 2020â€ � .
A second allegation of sexual assault , made by a second Swedish woman , was dropped by Swedish authorities in 2015 after the statute of limitations expired .
The prosecutors are holding a press conference to explain their decision .
The chief prosecutor , Marianne Ny , has said the rape case has been dropped essentially because there is no possibility of arresting Assange in the foreseeable future : The investigation into Julian Assange has been discontinued because there was no reason to believe that the decision to surrender him to Sweden can be executed in the foreseeable future .
My colleague Vikram Dodd has more on the London police warning that Assange still faces arrest by Scotland Yard should he step out of the Ecuadorian embassy : There is still an outstanding warrant â€ “ albeit for a much less serious offence â€ “ for Assangeâ€
™ s arrest , issued by Westminster magistrates court following him failing to surrender to the court on 29 June 2012 .
The Met has said it is â€˜obliged to executeâ€ ™ that warrant if Assange leaves the embassy , but added it would â€˜provide a level of resourcing which is proportionate to that offenceâ€ ™ .
In October 2015 , the Met ended the permanent presence of officers waiting to pounce should Assange emerge from the embassy .
That decision came at a time when he was wanted for a much more serious offence relating to the alleged sexual assault in Sweden .
On Friday , the force said it would not comment further on its operational plan , adding its â€˜priority must continue to be arresting those who are currently wanted in the capital in connection with serious violent or sexual offences for the protection of Londonersâ€ ™ .
My colleagues Peter Walker and Damien Gayle have a handy timeline of the near - seven - year standoff between Assange and the Swedish authorities that began when he was invited to address a seminar in Stockholm in August 2010 and reportedly had sex with two women who subsequently expressed concerns about the encounters .
Assange posted a this picture on his personal Twitter account shortly after the Swedist prosecutorâ€ ™ s surprise announcement : As my colleague Esther Addley notes in the Guardianâ€ ™ s initial news story on the surprise Swedish announcement , Assange has been living in the Ecuadorian embassy in London since 2012 after losing court battles to avoid extradition to Sweden over the claims , which he has always denied .
While the Stockholm decision potentially allows the 45-year - old Australian to leave the embassy , his lawyers have repeatedly said that he would not do so without assurances that he will not face extradition to the US over possible espionage charges , linked to Wikileaksâ€ ™ publishing activities .
The Metropolitan police statement said a warrant for the arrest of Assange still stands following his failure to surrender to the court on 29 June 2012 , adding the service â€œis obliged to execute the warrant should he leave the embassyâ€ � .
Prosecutors in Sweden have said they are dropping a preliminary investigation into an allegation of rape against the WikiLeaks founder , Julian Assange .
More details are expected at a press conference later on Friday , but the countryâ€ ™ s director of public prosecutions , Marianne Ny , said in a statement this morning she had â€œtoday decided to discontinue the investigation regarding suspected rape ( lesser degree ) by Julian Assangeâ€ � .
Shortly after the Swedish announcement , the Metropolitan police in London issued a statement confirming a warrant for the arrest of Assange still stands following his failure to surrender to the court on 29 June 2012 .
Weâ€ ™ ll bring you the latest developments as we get them ."
2017-05-19,"What has happened to Julian Assange ?
Swedish prosecutors have dropped their rape investigation into the WikiLeaks founder .
Marianne Ny , Swedenâ€ ™ s director of public prosecutions , said she had decided to discontinue the inquiry into the allegation dating from 2010 , when the country issued a European arrest warrant for him .
Why has the investigation been dropped ?
Ny said Sweden had exhausted the possibilities for investigating the allegations and were therefore obliged under Swedish law to discontinue the inquiry .
But , she said , it could be reopened if Assange returns to Sweden before the statute of limitations ends in 2020 .
She also confirmed that Sweden had withdrawn its request for a European arrest warrant against him .
Another allegation of sexual assault made by a second Swedish woman was dropped by Swedish authorities in 2015 after the statute of limitations expired .
The UK government said on Friday it had no involvement in Swedenâ€ ™ s decision to drop the investigation .
Does this mean Assange can walk out of the Ecuadorian embassy in London ?
No , because he still faces arrest over breaching UK bail conditions , and the possibility of extradition to the US .
Assange sought refuge in Ecuadorâ€ ™ s embassy in London in 2012 , after UK courts ruled
that Swedenâ€ ™ s extradition request was lawful .
Assange has always said he believes he faces extradition to the US because WikiLeaks published classified information .
But the Metropolitan police have maintained that Assange would be arrested if he left the embassy .
That position has not changed .
Scotland Yard said on Friday that it is still obliged to execute a warrant issued by Westminster magistrates court for the arrest of Assange after his breach of bail conditions in June 2012 .
It said in a statement : While Mr Assange was wanted on a European arrest warrant for an extremely serious offence , the MPS response reflected the serious nature of that crime .
Now that the situation has changed and the Swedish authorities have discontinued their investigation into that matter , Mr Assange remains wanted for a much less serious offence .
The MPS will provide a level of resourcing which is proportionate to that offence .
The priority for the MPS must continue to be arresting those who are currently wanted in the capital in connection with serious violent or sexual offences for the protection of Londoners .
The offence of breaching bail carries a maximum sentence of one year in prison .
Does the US want Assange to be extradited ?
Almost certainly , but the Home Office never confirms whether an extradition request has been made or received until the person in question has been arrested .
Last month , the US attorney general , Jeff Sessions , said the arrest of Assange was a â€œpriorityâ€ � after the CIA director , Mike Pompeo , described WikiLeaks as a â€œhostile intelligence
serviceâ€ � and a threat to US national security .
US federal prosecutors are understood to be considering bringing charges against Assange over a number of the websiteâ€ ™ s publications since 2010 .
This could potentially lead to an extradition request for Assange .
â€œWeâ€ ™ ve already begun to step up our efforts and whenever a case can be made , we will seek to put some people in jail , â€ � Sessions said .
Has the European arrest warrant against Assange been lifted ?
Yes .
The Crown Prosecution Service said that the European Arrest Warrant was discharged on Friday at Westminster Magistratesâ€ ™ Court after the Swedish investigation was dropped .
Has Assange been questioned by Swedish prosecutors ?
Yes , this took place at the embassy last November in the presence of Swedenâ€ ™ s chief prosecutor , Ingrid Isgren .
Assange later released his full testimony to Swedish prosecutors , maintaining that he was â€œentirely innocentâ€ � of the allegation ."
2017-05-19,"Swedish prosecutors may have decided to drop their investigation into an allegation of rape against Julian Assange , but the future for the WikiLeaks founder is far from clear â€ “ and may even be more precarious .
Marianne Ny , Swedenâ€ ™ s director of public prosecutions , said on Friday that the inquiry into the allegation dating from 2010 was being discontinued and the European arrest warrant the country had issued recalled .
She said Sweden had â€œexhausted the possibilitiesâ€ � for investigating the allegations against Assange and there was no reason to believe the 45-year - old Australian would be brought to Sweden in the foreseeable future .
But the decision does not make life any easier for Assange , who has been living in the Ecuadorian embassy in London since 2012 after claiming asylum to avoid extradition to Sweden and from there , he feared , to the US .
If he steps outside the embassy , he risks at the very least a fine .
The Metropolitan police has said that an arrest warrant remains open for Assange after he breached his bail conditions by failing to appear in court five years ago to accept extradition .
The UK courts could hear the case quickly and have a range of options including a minor fine .
But the process could last many months and a judge may decide to impose the maximum penalty : a prison sentence of up to one year .
Once the bail offence has been dealt with , it might be possible for Assange to leave the UK for Ecuador ,
whose foreign minister , Guillaume Long , said on Friday that London â€œmust now grant safe passageâ€ � to the former hacker .
On the other hand , leaving the Ecuadorian embassy without safe passage could expose Assange to a renewed risk of extradition .
The legal commentator David Allen Green suggested that if he was arrested , Sweden could resume its case .
He tweeted that the case being dropped was â€œto stop expending resourcesâ€
� when there was â€œno clear path
to extraditionâ€ � , but if Assange â€œwent into British custody
, then the Swedes may well revisit their decision â€ ¦ as extradition is suddenly easierâ€ � .
Ny stressed on Friday that the investigation could be reopened if Assange returned to Sweden before the statute of limitations on the rape allegation against him ends in August 2020 .
The most alarming outcome from Assangeâ€ ™ s viewpoint is a possible extradition to the US , where he has long feared he would face trial for leaking tens of thousands of secret US military and diplomatic documents .
It is not known whether US officials have asked British police to arrest Assange because of a possible sealed indictment against him .
The US justice department , White House and British government all declined to comment on that matter on Friday .
From Assangeâ€ ™ s perspective , the threat by Donald Trumpâ€ ™ s administration to imprison him might seem ungrateful :
WikiLeaks published awkward emails stolen from Hillary Clintonâ€ ™ s campaign chairman in the runup to the November election .
Assangeâ€ ™ s organisation also exposed plotting inside the Democratic National Committee to ruin the candidacy of Bernie Sanders and was touted by Trump associates such as Roger Stone as the force that would finish off Clinton .
â€œI love WikiLeaks , â€ �
Trump himself said at a rally a month before his election as president .
Sean Hannity , an extreme Trump backer , conducted a three - part Fox News interview with Assange inside the Ecuadorian embassy after the election .
But Trump said last month he would support any decision to charge Assange and the US attorney general , Jeff Sessions , has suggested that his arrest and prosecution could be an American priority .
â€œWeâ€ ™ ve already begun to step up our efforts and whenever a case can be made , we will seek to put some people in jail , â€ �
Sessions said last month .
The CIA director , Mike Pompeo , has described WikiLeaks as a â€œhostile intelligence serviceâ€ � and a threat to US national security .
The Washington Post has reported that prosecutors have been drafting a memo that looks at charges against Assange and WikiLeaks members that possibly include conspiracy , theft of government property and violations of the Espionage Act .
WikiLeaks has a long track record of publishing classified military material .
In 2010 alone , the group published an estimated 90,000 documents relating to the war in Afghanistan , 400,000 documents relating to the Iraq war , and 250,000 leaked state department cables .
Perhaps the most famous material in those leaks was footage of a US helicopter firing on and killing Iraqi civilians in 2007 .
The source for that material was army private Chelsea Manning , then Bradley , who was released after seven years of imprisonment on Wednesday morning ."
2017-05-19,"A threat by the Donald Trump administration last month to imprison WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange
might , from Assangeâ€ ™ s perspective , seem ungrateful .
It was WikiLeaks that published a steady drip of awkward emails stolen from Hillary Clintonâ€ ™ s campaign chairman in the run - up to the November election .
It was WikiLeaks that exposed plotting inside the Democratic National Committee to ruin the candidacy of Bernie Sanders .
And it was WikiLeaks that Trump associates such as Roger Stone touted as the force that would finish off Clinton .
â€œI love WikiLeaks , â€ �
Trump himself said at a Pennsylvania rally a month before the election , brandishing a printout of a Clinton campaign email , to cheers from the crowd .
So favored was Assange inside the Trump orbit that Fox News host Sean Hannity , an extreme Trump backer , traveled to London after the election to conduct a three - part interview with Assange inside the Ecuadorian embassy .
Trump and Assange were , not four months ago , more than friendly allies .
They were undeclared partners .
But now , with Swedish prosecutors having closed an investigation of rape allegations against Assange , the stated intention of the United States to charge him or his associates for crimes relating to the publication of classified material once again looms as perhaps the greatest threat to Assangeâ€ ™ s freedom .
The Trump team revealed its 180-degree turn on the Assange question last month , with CIA director Mike Pompeo â€ “ who celebrated WikiLeaks during the presidential campaign â€ “ calling the group a â€œhostile intelligence serviceâ€ � and attorney general Jeff Sessions saying that prosecuting WikiLeaks was â€œa
priorityâ€ � .
â€œSo
yes , it is a priority , â€ � Sessions said .
â€œWeâ€ ™ ve already begun to step up our efforts and whenever a case can be made , we will seek to put some people in jail.â€ �
The White House had not commented on the development in the Assange case by midday Friday .
It was unclear what steps the justice department had taken against Assange or whether the US had requested his extradition from Britain .
In some ways , the twist in Assangeâ€ ™ s fate presents a problem to US prosecutors , who are under new pressure to state their case , which includes grappling with thorny first amendment and jurisdictional issues .
David Leigh , the former investigations editor of the Guardian and the author of a book on WikiLeaks , said on Friday that Sessionsâ€ ™ tough talk on Assange was â€œall just noiseâ€
� .
â€œThe fact is that there is no official extradition request that has been made known from the US to the UK to get hold of Julian Assange , â€ �
Leigh told the BBC in an interview .
â€œThe Obama administration had probably dropped the idea of arresting and extraditing Assange.â€
�
WikiLeaks has a long track record of publishing classified military material .
In 2010 alone , the group published an estimated 90,000 documents relating to the war in Afghanistan , 400,000 documents related to the Iraq war and 250,000 leaked state department cables .
Perhaps the most famous material in those leaks was footage of a US helicopter firing on and killing Iraqi civilians in 2007 .
The source for that material was Army private Chelsea Manning , then Bradley , who was released after seven years of imprisonment on Wednesday morning following Barack Obamaâ€ ™ s forgiveness of part of her sentence on Espionage Act charges .
Given the Manning release , there is an uncanniness about the timing of the closure of the Swedish investigation of Assange , and the prospect , however complicated , that he may go free after five years of detention in the embassy .
WikiLeaks tweeted in January : â€œIf Obama grants Manning clemency Assange will agree to US extradition despite clear unconstitutionality of DoJ case.â€ �
After Obama commuted Manningâ€ ™ s sentence in January , a lawyer for Assange retreated on that dare , saying that the US presidentâ€ ™
s
action was â€œwell short of what he [ Assange ] sought.â€ �
It is also the case that the special counsel investigation of alleged Russian interference in the last US presidential election announced Wednesday could fuel the US desire or ability to prosecute the WikiLeaks founder .
The US government formally accused Russia in October of hacking the DNC emails , which WikiLeaks then published .
A statement by intelligence agencies at the time explicitly linked WikiLeaks and â€œRussian - directedâ€ � hacking efforts .
Roger Stone , the on - again , off - again Trump adviser , boasted in early March that he had a â€œperfectly legal back channelâ€ � to Assange .
Stone also appears to have been a focus of an FBI investigation of Russian tampering in the election , judging by pointed questions directed at former bureau director James Comey in testimony before the House intelligence committee in late March .
â€œDo
you know Stone tweeted confidence that Assange would educate Americans ?
And then WikiLeaks started publishing
Podestaâ€ ™ s
emails?â€ � ranking member Adam Schiff asked Comey .
â€œNo comment , â€ � Comey replied .
After the hearing , Republican senator John McCain said that â€œobviouslyâ€ � Stone should testify before Congress about what went on behind the scenes during the election .
â€œI think he and others need to be questioned , â€ � McCain said .
Stone , never one to shirk the spotlight , volunteered to testify .
â€œI have had no contacts or collusions with the Russians , â€ � he said .
As for ranking member Schiff ?
â€œLargely full of Schiff , â€ � Stone said ."
2017-05-20,"Call me pedantic , but Iâ€ ™ m not sure that , where the aborted Swedish rape investigation is concerned , WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange should be acting as though he has been found innocent .
He hasnâ€ ™ t .
The Swedish prosecutor said that the arrest warrant had been revoked , as it was impossible to serve Assange notice .
Which is hardly the â€œtotal victoryâ€ � that has been claimed .
As many rape victims are all too aware , a lot of cases are halted , for myriad reasons , before they make it to court .
Fairly or unfairly , itâ€ ™ s not the same as someone being found innocent .
Of course there are complexities to Assangeâ€ ™ s case , not least his fear that the Swedish government would extradite him to the US to face charges over the leaks , had he left the Ecuadorian embassy .
Assange also still faces the lesser charge of failing to surrender himself to a court , an offence that could be punishable by up to a year in prison .
All this considered , and also factoring in that previous high - profile supporters have backed away from him ( with a screech of wheels that brings to mind the bat - infested haunted house - mobile in Wacky Races )
, perhaps Assange needs to take a little more care over his public demeanour .
For instance , he could have thought twice before releasing his triumphalist press statement concerning the dropped case , where he rather diva - ishly intoned that he would not â€œforgive or forgetâ€ � .
I know Assange hasnâ€ ™ t been getting out much , but Iâ€ ™ ve seen queens on RuPaulâ€ ™ s Drag Race fighting over wigs and nipple pasties with less petulance than that .
In this vexed situation , perhaps Assange should be mindful that the last thing he should be â€œleakingâ€ � right now is his own brand of self - righteous melodrama .
â€¢ Comments will be opened later"
2017-06-01,"Nigel Farage is a â€œperson of interestâ€ � in the US counter - intelligence investigation that is looking into possible collusion between the Kremlin and Donald Trumpâ€ ™ s presidential campaign , the Guardian has been told .
Sources with knowledge of the investigation said the former Ukip leader had raised the interest of FBI investigators because of his relationships with individuals connected to both the Trump campaign and Julian Assange , the WikiLeaks founder whom Farage visited in March .
WikiLeaks published troves of hacked emails last year that damaged Hillary Clintonâ€ ™ s campaign and is suspected of having cooperated with Russia through third parties , according to recent congressional testimony by the former CIA director John Brennan , who also said the adamant denials of collusion by Assange and Russia were disingenuous .
Farage has not been accused of wrongdoing and is not a suspect or a target of the US investigation .
But being a person of interest means investigators believe he may have information about the acts that are under investigation and he may therefore be subject to their scrutiny .
Sources who spoke to the Guardian said it was Farageâ€ ™ s proximity to people at the heart of the investigation that was being examined as an element in their broader inquiry into how Russia may have worked with Trump campaign officials to influence the US election .
â€œOne of the things the intelligence investigators have been looking at is points of contact and persons involved , â€ � one source said .
â€œIf you triangulate Russia , WikiLeaks , Assange and Trump associates the person who comes up with the most hits is Nigel Farage .
â€œHeâ€ ™ s right in the middle of these relationships .
He turns up over and over again .
Thereâ€ ™ s a lot of attention being paid to him.â€
�
The source mentioned Farageâ€ ™ s links with Roger Stone ,
Trumpâ€ ™ s
long - time political adviser who has admitted being in contact with Guccifer 2.0 , a hacker whom US intelligence agencies believe to be a Kremlin agent .
Farageâ€ ™ s spokesman said he had never worked with Russian officials , and described the Guardianâ€ ™ s questions about Farageâ€ ™ s activities as â€œverging on the hystericalâ€ � .
â€œNigel has never been to Russia , let alone worked with their authorities , â€ � the spokesman said .
But he did not respond to questions about whether Farage was aware of the FBI inquiry ; had hired a lawyer in connection to the matter ; or when Farage first met Trump .
The spokesman also declined to comment on whether Farage had received compensation from the Russian state - backed media group RT for his media appearances .
RT , which has featured Farage about three times over the last 18 months , also declined to comment , citing confidentiality .
On Thursday Farage dismissed the story as â€œfake newsâ€ � .
He said he visited Assange at the Ecuadorian embassy in March at the behest of LBC Radio â€œwith a view to conducting an interviewâ€ � .
He added : â€œI consider it extremely doubtful that I could be a person of interest to the FBI as I have no connections to Russia.â€
�
Farage has said he only met Assange once has but declined to say how long the two have known each other .
The FBIâ€ ™ s national press office said it had no comment on Farage .
The former Ukip leader has voiced his support for the Russian president , calling Vladimir Putin the leader he most admired , in a 2014 interview .
Ukip also has history with Assange :
Gerard Batten , a Ukip member of the European parliament ( MEP ) , defended the Wikileaks founder in a speech in the European parliament in 2011 .
One source familiar with the US investigation told the Guardian that the examination of Farageâ€ ™ s activities was considered especially delicate given his role as an MEP .
Neither Farage nor Trump have made a secret of their admiration for one another .
They emerged as unlikely winners last year in contests that have reshaped the world order :
Britainâ€ ™ s vote to leave the EU and Trumpâ€ ™ s surprise ascendency to the White House .
Both men credited their ability to tap into the worries of struggling and neglected citizens for their victories .
But at the heart of the US investigation lies a deeper question : whether Trump campaign officials and people close to the former reality TV star sought to work with state players in Russia to try to influence the US election result .
Last July , Farage attended the Republican national convention in Cleveland , Ohio , when Trump became the partyâ€ ™ s nominee .
According to an account by the Ukip donor Arron Banks , Farage first met Trump at a campaign stop in Mississippi in August , where he spoke at a Trump campaign event .
But Farageâ€ ™ s relationships with people close to the US president began years earlier .
Farage first met Steve Bannon , Trumpâ€ ™ s strategist and former campaign chief executive , in the summer of 2012 , when Bannon , who was interested in rightwing movements in Europe , invited the then Ukip leader to spend a few days in New York and Washington , according to an account in the New Yorker magazine .
There Farage was introduced to , among others , the staff of the then senator Jeff Sessions , who is now the US attorney general .
Speaking of his longtime admiration for Bannon , Farage told the New Yorker last year : â€œI have got a very , very high regard for that
manâ€ ™ s brain.â€ � Two years later , in 2014 , Breitbart News , of which Bannon was executive chair , opened an office in London .
A top editor , Raheem Kassam , later went on to work as Farageâ€ ™ s chief of staff .
In 2015 , Breitbart News arranged a dinner in Farageâ€ ™ s honour at â€œthe embassyâ€ � , the nickname for the house the news group rented in Washington .
According to a report in Bloomberg , attendees were â€œblown awayâ€ � by Farageâ€ ™ s speech at the event , which was also attended by Sessions .
Then , on 24 June last year , the day after the UK voted to leave the EU , Farage thanked Bannon during an interview for Breitbart Newsâ€ ™ s coverage of the leave campaign .
Bannon , in turn , congratulated Farage on his victory , saying he had led an extraordinary â€œDavid v Goliathâ€ � campaign .
Farageâ€ ™ s ties to Stone are also under scrutiny , it is understood .
Stone has frequently publicised his relationship with Assange and described him on Twitter as â€œmy heroâ€ � .
Stone publicly predicted the 2016 release of hacked emails from the Clinton campaign that now lie at the heart of the federal inquiry .
Democrats on the House intelligence committee have named Stone in their hearings and , according to the New York Times , he is now under investigation .
Last summer , just a few weeks before Farage met Trump in Mississippi , Stone bragged about having a â€œmutual friendâ€ � who served as an intermediary between himself and Assange .
He also mentioned in a separate tweet that he had dinner with Farage , though the date of the encounter is unclear .
After Trumpâ€ ™ s victory , Farage was one of the first foreign politicians to meet and celebrate with the Republican president - elect , and had his picture taken with Trump in front of a golden elevator in Trump Tower just days after the US election .
In November , Trump suggested in a tweet Farage should become the UKâ€ ™ s ambassador to the US .
The tweet prompted a curt response from Downing Street , which pointed out that there was â€œno vacancyâ€ � .
A spokesman said : â€œWe already have an excellent ambassador.â€ �
The pair met again in February , when they had dinner together with Trumpâ€ ™ s daughter and adviser , Ivanka , and her husband and White House adviser , Jared Kushner .
Farage was asked about his relationship with Assange in a recent interview with Die Zeit , the German newspaper , after he was seen on 9 March leaving the Ecuadorian embassy where Assange has lived for years .
Farage , who declared he had â€œnever received a penny from Russiaâ€ � , said he met Assange for â€œjournalistic reasonsâ€ � .
Pressed on his meetings with Russian officials in the past , Farage initially denied having had any , but then acknowledged that he had met Alexander Yakovenko , the Russian ambassador to the UK , in 2013 .
Asked by Die Zeit what he was doing now , and whether he saw himself as a politician or a journalist , Farage concluded : â€œChanging public opinion .
Thatâ€ ™ s what I have been doing for 20 years .
Using television , media .
Shifting public opinion .
Thatâ€ ™ s what I am good at.â€
�
A spokesman for Farage told the Guardian he had only met Assange on that one occasion .
â€œThe meeting was organised by a broadcaster , they could have easily sent another presenter instead.â€ �
Key players in Russia - Trump investigation Donald Trump
The US presidentâ€ ™ s campaign team and people close to him are being investigated for possibly colluding with Russian state actors to influence the outcome of last Novemberâ€ ™ s election .
Trump , who has called the investigation â€œfake newsâ€ � and recently fired the FBI director leading the case , was a staunch defender of Farageâ€ ™ s Brexit campaign and has met the former Ukip leader , whom he proposed several times as a possible UK ambassador to the US .
While Trump recently said he would be OK with the US arresting Assange for leaks of sensitive information , he has previously sided with the Wikileaks founder , repeating Assangeâ€ ™ s claim that he did not receive support from Russia .
Nigel Farage
The former Ukip leader was an enthusiastic supporter of Trumpâ€ ™ s presidential campaign and attended the 2016 Republican national convention .
He also has links with Steve Bannon , Trumpâ€ ™ s White House strategist , and Roger Stone , the presidentâ€ ™
s decades - long political mentor .
Farage has praised Vladimir Putin as a strong leader and has appeared several times on RT , Russiaâ€ ™ s English - language propaganda channel .
Farage has declined to say how much money RT paid him .
Sources say Farage is a â€œperson of interestâ€ � in the FBIâ€ ™ s investigation into whether Trumpâ€ ™ s associates colluded with Russia during the presidential election .
Steve Bannon
The presidentâ€ ™ s chief White House strategist , who served as chief executive of the Trump campaign , has known Farage since 2012 , when he was working as a senior editor at Breitbart News , the rightwing news website .
The former investment banker â€ “ seen as the driving force behind Trumpâ€ ™ s â€œAmerica Firstâ€ � nationalist policies
â€ “ hosted Farage in the US while he was leading Ukip and introduced him to key US conservatives .
Breitbart strongly supported the leave campaign during the EU referendum in the UK and Bannon is seen as the main conduit between Trump and Farage .
Roger Stone
The Republican operative , who has known Trump for decades , is at the centre of the FBI investigation .
Stone , who reportedly keeps in touch with Trump , boasted last year that he had a â€œback channelâ€ � to Julian Assange , the Wikileaks founder , and predicted the release by Wikileaks of emails that damaged Hillary Clintonâ€ ™ s campaign .
Last summer , Stone tweeted that he had dinner with Farage â€ “ confirming the pairâ€ ™ s relationship â€ “ and had contact with Guccifer 2.0 , who claimed responsibility for the hacking of Democratic party emails .
Julian Assange The editor - in - chief of WikiLeaks played a key role in the release of hacked Democratic party emails , according to US intelligence agencies .
They allege Russian hackers working for two Moscow spy agencies â€ “ the GRU and the FSB â€ “ gave the emails to Assange in London .
WikiLeaks then published the leaked emails in July and October .
This damaged Clintonâ€ ™ s campaign and helped Trumpâ€ ™ s , US intelligence says .
Assange denies the emails came from a state .
In March , Farage visited Assange at the Ecuadorian embassy in London , just days after he had dined with Trump in Washington ."
2017-06-01,"The Guardian has revealed that Nigel Farage is a â€œperson of interestâ€ � in the FBIâ€ ™ s ongoing investigation into alleged collusion between Trump associates and Russia .
According to sources familiar with the investigation , Farage is of interest because of his relationships with several individuals .
They include President Donald Trump , Trumpâ€ ™ s adviser Roger Stone , and the WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange , whom Farage visited in March .
â€œIf you triangulate Russia , WikiLeaks , Assange and Trump associates the person who comes up with the most hits is Nigel Farage , â€ �
one source said .
Farage has not been accused of wrongdoing and is not a suspect or a target of the US investigation .
On Thursday , Farage dismissed the story as â€œfake newsâ€ � .
He said he visited Assange at the Ecuadorian embassy in March at the behest of LBC Radio â€œwith a view to conducting an interviewâ€ � .
He tweeted :
And : The Guardian put a series of questions to Nigel Farage over several weeks .
So far he has declined to answer them .
They include : When did you first meet Donald Trump ?
What was the nature of your meeting with Julian Assange and what did you discuss ?
How much money have you received from your appearances on RT , the Russian state broadcaster ?
Have you hired a lawyer in the UK or US in connection with the FBI investigation into alleged collusion between Trump associates and Russia ?
Roger Stone ,
Trumpâ€ ™ s
political associate , has said he was in touch with Assange in 2016 via an â€œintermediaryâ€ � .
Were you that intermediary ?
Do you still talk with Mr Stone , Steve Bannon or President Trump ?"
2017-06-19,"The WikiLeaks founder , Julian Assange , has abruptly cancelled a press conference at which he had planned to make a â€œspecial announcementâ€ � .
Journalists and supporters had gathered under a balcony at the Ecuadorian embassy in central London , from where Assange usually conducts press conferences .
The latest was to have coincided with the fifth anniversary of his taking refuge in the embassy .
The Swedish authorities have dropped an investigation into sex - related allegations , but there is an arrest warrant out for him in the UK accusing him of jumping bail .
Assange expressed hope in an interview with the Press Association ahead of the planned press conference that a standoff with the UK authorities might be resolved .
He cited various reasons to be hopeful .
â€œWe have support across many parts of the political spectrum in the United States , including most of the mainstream media .
â€œWithin Europe there is a growing recognition that extraditing me or any of our staff to Trumpâ€ ™ s
America is not a way to win votes.â€ � Assange has repeatedly expressed fears that arrest in the UK would lead to his extradition to the US , where he could be charged with espionage offences .
Without the UK arrest warrant , Assange would be free to fly to Ecuador , which has offered him asylum .
Melinda Taylor , one of Assangeâ€ ™ s legal team who was outside the embassy on Monday , said : â€œJulian was scheduled to make a special announcement today .
I am not privy to that .
His UK lawyers were told there is going to be a meeting with UK authorities .
â€œUnder advisement , he cancelled the announcement to assure negotiations proceeded in an open and constructive manner because it is essential there is a resolution as soon as possible to what the UN stated is illegal and arbitrary detention.â€ �"
2017-06-29,"Laura Poitras wants to make one thing absolutely clear .
She still admires Julian Assange despite everything that has happened .
But , it soon emerges , this is a mighty caveat .
Risk , Poitrasâ€ ™ s film on Assange , six years in the making , is finally finished .
During this time she has gone from being an Assange supporter given privileged access to an outsider banished from the WikiLeaks inner sanctum ; she has exposed the National Security Agencyâ€ ™ s global spying programme ( a lot of it published in Britain by the Guardian ) after being the first journalist to make contact with whistleblower Edward Snowden , and she has made an Oscar - winning documentary about Snowden called Citizenfour .
Her Snowden film is gripping â€ “ a complex , real - life seat - of - the pants thriller .
The Assange film , Risk , is very different .
At times , it could be a black comedy â€ “ part
The Office , part Brass Eye .
Yet it was never meant to be like this .
Poitras initially contacted Assange because she believed the work he was doing ( again , a lot of it published in Britain by the Guardian ) was so important .
â€œI thought WikiLeaks was doing the hard journalism that hadnâ€ ™ t been done for a long time post 9/11 .
The mainstream media had abdicated responsibility to ask hard questions of what was going on in the occupation of Iraq and Afghanistan .
It was crucial and brave journalism .
I was also interested in the global impact it was having .
So I was very optimistic about the project.â€ �
She pauses .
â€œAnd I remain optimistic about many things about the work they do and its necessity.â€ �
Another caveat .
WikiLeaks seemed to be reinventing journalism when it launched in 2006 as an online platform allowing sources to leak classified information anonymously .
In 2007 , the not - for - profit organisation discovered that some prisoners held at GuantÃ¡namo Bay were denied access to the Red Cross .
In 2010 , it received more than 700,000 US military and state department documents and released the Collateral Murder tape showing a US Army Apache helicopter crew killing 15 civilians ( including two Reuters journalists )
â€ “ as the crew laughed at the â€œdead bastardsâ€ � saying â€œlight â€ ™
em up!â€
�
Last year , WikiLeaks exposed the Democratic party leadershipâ€ ™ s bias against Bernie Sanders and for Hillary Clinton .
And on it goes .
Assange , born in Australia and a computer programmer by profession , is the founder and editor - in - chief of WikiLeaks .
In 2011 , to all intents and purposes he was WikiLeaks â€ “ the crown prince of transparency .
Poitras says it took time for Assange to agree to access .
At one point in the film , she says : â€œItâ€ ™ s a mystery why he trusts me because I donâ€
™ t think he likes
me.â€
�
Poitras , by contrast , was born in Massachusetts to wealthy parents ( in 2007 , they donated $ 20 m [ Â£15 m ] to found the Poitras Center for Affective Disorders Research at the McGovern Institute for Brain Research ) .
As a teenager , she dreamed of becoming a chef and worked as a cook in a French restaurant in Boston .
She then became fascinated with film , which she studied at the San Francisco Art Institute , and , in 1992 , moved to New York to pursue film - making .
In 2006 , her film My Country , My Country , a documentary about life for Iraqis under US occupation , was nominated for an Academy award .
Her 2010 film
The Oath is about two Yemeni men caught up in Americaâ€ ™ s war on terror .
Assange was aware of both films .
It is clear he believed Poitras would faithfully document the hero behind the groundbreaking work .
Which she has done .
And some .
So we see portrayed a man of principle desperate to expose the secret institutions that shape how we live .
But we also see a pompous Assange demanding to speak to Hillary Clinton and telling the US Department of State that he is only calling as an act of altruism ( â€œTo try and make it clear , we donâ€ ™ t have a problem , you have a problemâ€ � ) ;
a comically deluded Assange , who believes dyeing his hair ginger and putting on a floppy hat and pair of shades was the perfect disguise , and a narcissistic dictator having his hair cut by two members of staff .
We also meet the paranoid Assange who , according to Poitras , runs the organisation like an intelligence agency using â€œdenial and deceptionâ€ � ; and the contemptuous Assange , who tells his colleague Sarah Harrison to imagine the press are â€œa piece of shit on your shoeâ€ � .
Then there is the messianic Assange with the self - confessed â€œGod complexâ€ � , who tells Lady Gaga , â€œLetâ€ ™ s not pretend Iâ€ ™ m a normal person , â€ � and ticks her off for asking how he feels .
( â€œItâ€ ™ s irrelevant how I feel â€ ¦ because the cause is so much bigger.â€
� )
Not forgetting Assange the wannabe celeb , who readily acquiesces to Gagaâ€ ™ s request for him to wear a T - shirt instead of his shirt , so he looks different for her fans .
Poitras knew Assange could be difficult â€ “ when she started filming he had already fallen out with the Guardian â€ “ but the level of difficulty surprised her .
In 2010 , an arrest warrant was issued in Sweden , where WikiLeaks is based , in relation to sexual assault allegations against two women .
Things became more difficult in 2012 , when the UKâ€ ™ s
Supreme Court ruled that he should be extradited to Sweden and he sought sanctuary in the Ecuadorian embassy .
In one astonishing scene , Assange talks to Helena Kennedy QC , who is advising him on how to deal with the allegations .
Assange says , as if to excuse himself , that it is a â€œradical feminist conspiracyâ€ � and dismisses the complainants as lesbians .
Kennedy tells him it is not helpful to talk like this .
â€œNo , not publicly , â€ � he says , while being filmed .
Her look of despair is priceless .
Assange then explains why it is not in the best interests of the women to press charges .
â€œAn actual court case is going to be very hard for these women
â€
¦ they will be reviled for ever by a large segment of the world population .
I donâ€
™ t think itâ€ ™ s in their interest to proceed that way.â€ ™ â€ ™
It is this scene that led to Poitras and Assangeâ€ ™ s falling out .
She promised him she would show him the film when it was ready .
And shortly before an early version of Risk premiered at Cannes , he did see it
â€ “ and blew a gasket .
â€œHis lawyers demanded we took this scene out , and another one where he talks about the investigation and the women involved .
We didnâ€ ™ t , and then he sent a text saying the film is a threat to his freedom and he is forced to treat it accordingly.â€
�
What right did he have to make that demand ?
â€œHe had no right .
He had no editorial control over the film.â€ �
Did it surprise her when he tried to censor Risk ?
â€œYes
it absolutely did , considering what WikiLeaks stands for .
I was surprised on the ideological level â€ “ not only did he demand that things were removed , but more recently he sent â€˜cease and desistâ€ ™ letters to my distributors demanding that they stop releasing the film .
He was really angry and he tried to intimidate.â€ �
Would she have had more respect for Assange if he had returned to Sweden to be interviewed by the police ?
She exhales loudly .
â€œI donâ€ ™ t know .
I do think his fear of US indictment is not paranoia .
The investigation is massive , and he has very good reason to be concerned about being extradited to the US.â€ � Poitrasâ€ ™ s relationship with WikiLeaks was further complicated when it emerged in 2016 that Jacob Applebaum , one of Assangeâ€ ™ s closest WikiLeaks confidantes , has also been accused of sexual abuse .
Poitras discloses that she and Applebaum had â€œbeen involved briefly in 2014â€ � .
She then realised she was making a very different film from the one she started out making .
â€œIt does take on a question about gender and sexism .
When there is another person in the film who has been accused of abuse of power and sexual misconduct , how could I not address it?â€
�
The longer she filmed Assange and WikiLeaks , the more critical she became â€ “ of their failure to redact names from documents putting people at risk , the tone of the WikiLeaks Twitter feed , attitudes to women , and the motive for some releases .
While Poitras is no fan of Hillary Clinton , she does question the timing of the Podesta emails ( John Podesta was chairman of Clintonâ€ ™ s election campaign ) , thought to have been hacked by the Russians and published by WikiLeaks in October / November 2016 just before the election .
Clinton partially blamed her defeat on WikiLeaks .
I ask Poitras if she enjoyed making Risk .
She laughs , which feels like an answer in itself .
â€œDid
I enjoy it ?
No , I canâ€
™ t say I did .
Filming is always hard , and this was particularly hard .
I knew Julian was going to be furious with the film , and I donâ€ ™ t have any joy with that .
I know heâ€
™ s polarising , but there is no doubt heâ€
™ s a really significant historical figure in the work that he has done , which has transformed journalism , and I think he understood ahead of many people how the internet was going to change global politics.â€ �
While she is critical of Assange , Poitras is also scathing of
the media â€ “ indeed , the film is partly a critique of the pack mentality of the press .
She also believes the Guardian and the Washington Post took too much credit for the Snowden story and literally tried to push her out of the limelight .
â€œIn New York , when they gave the Pulitzer prize to the Guardian and the Washington Post , neither organisation invited me on to the stage .
That pissed me off .
That was really bad behaviour .
On the other hand , the story needed institutions behind it.â€
�
It is hard to watch Risk and not compare it with Citizenfour .
In fact , for a long time Poitras thought they were going to be one and the same film .
Assange and Snowden seem such different men , I say .
â€œI donâ€
™ t feel itâ€ ™ s my job to judge and compare them â€ “
but , yes , they have different motivations .
Certainly , my feelings that come through in the film are much more conflicted.â€ �
Is there a moral purity to what Snowden did ?
â€œPeople would ask me when I was releasing the film :
Is he a hero ?
People are defined by their actions , and he did something deeply heroic .
And I think it was selfless .
He knew the consequences could be the end of his freedom or the end of his life.â€ �
She says the whistleblower Chelsea Manning would be a more suitable person to compare Snowden with .
What is the most annoying thing about Snowden ?
â€œHe can lecture .
He can get a little bit talky , if you watch some of his public appearances , but thatâ€ ™ s not something that pissed me off.â€ �
Her life has changed considerably since making Citizenfour .
At times , she has felt scared for her own safety .
â€œRight after the Snowden stuff
, I knew I was being followed by intelligence agencies .
I felt really nervous about threats from the government , private contractors , intelligence agencies all over the world .
There are a lot of bad actors out there .
But I have to keep doing the work.â€ �
She says sheâ€ ™ s exhausted and could do with a break , but sheâ€ ™ s hooked on film - making : surveillance and the intelligence services in particular .
What would she like to do next ?
â€œIâ€ ™
d love to look at whatâ€ ™ s happening in the investigation into Trump .
I donâ€
™ t think I am going to get that access!â€ �
she laughs .
â€œI donâ€
™ t think Comey would take my phone call , unfortunately .
Heâ€
™ d be top of the list of people Iâ€ ™
d love to film at the moment.â€
�
But for now , she is focusing on the release of Risk .
After Assange complained about the film , Poitras took it away , spent a year re - editing it â€ “ and returned with a film that was tougher on him .
Was that her response to his intimidation ; a form of revenge ?
Again , she exhales loudly and pauses .
â€œI donâ€ ™ t make vengeful films , but I do have to make films that are honest.â€ �
Does she think that Assange was right to trust her ?
â€œI think thatâ€ ™ s a question for Julian.â€ �
I tell her
I think itâ€ ™ s a fine film , and her response surprises me .
She sounds upset â€ “ almost heartbroken .
â€œI
donâ€ ™ t want to have fallings out with people that I have respect for , â€ � she says .
â€œFor me
itâ€ ™ s
a tragedy.â€ � â€¢ Risk is released on 30 June 2017 ."
2017-06-30,"No one has gone from hero to zero quite as quickly or as embarrassingly as Julian Assange , and by embarrassingly I mean for those of us who once rather admired him .
The man himself is unembarrassable .
It seems clear that Laura Poitrasâ€ ™ s film was originally designed in form and content for â€œheroâ€ � , like her Snowden documentary , and the movie tries to wriggle away from Assange a bit .
( I should say that I have not seen the earlier cut , which was reportedly more sympathetic ; the re - edit â€ “ itself arguably an admission of error
â€
“ should perhaps have been far more radical and self - questioning , or perhaps this documentary should have been dumped entirely in favour of a new one about Chelsea Manning . )
At any rate , itâ€ ™ s a serviceable portrait of vanity .
The founder of the whistle - blowing website WikiLeaks , once feted for challenging official secrecy and arrogance , is now absurd in his creepy conceit , paranoia and celebrity hauteur , holed up in Londonâ€ ™ s Ecuadorian embassy to avoid a rape allegation in Sweden .
Heâ€
™ s keeping in shape with boxercise , doing interviews with Lady Gaga and waffling interminable double - talk in a conspiratorial murmur .
His relationship with Pamela Anderson isnâ€ ™ t touched on , and neither is his apparent sympathy for Marine Le Pen .
Is he just another liberal who shuffled to the right or alt - right in middle age ?
Or is he someone for whom a clinical diagnosis is in order , addicted to the thrill of seeming to manipulate global , digital forces ?
Poitrasâ€ ™ s film begins as the rape allegations have been made public , with Assange staying with his entourage in a Norfolk country house .
Amal Clooney is glimpsed at his side on the courtroom steps but invisible thereafter , and Assange takes cover on Ecuadorian soil within sight of Harrods department store in west London .
He says the whole rape allegation is a scam to extradite him to the US ; but why wasnâ€ ™ t he extradited from Britain ?
Arenâ€ ™ t we supposed to be Americaâ€ ™
s
poodle ?
Itâ€ ™ s an obvious question Poitras never asks .
We do see Helena Kennedy QC trying to get him to play the game , say heâ€ ™ s innocent but that women are naturally entitled to bring rape allegations if they wish â€ “ but Assange airily sticks to his conspiracy theory , to Kennedyâ€ ™ s obvious mortification and dismay .
During the US election , he became hated for releasing emails that embarrassed Hillary Clinton .
Of course if he had released documents that undermined Donald Trump that might well have restored his heroic reputation .
But the question never arose .
It suited Julianâ€ ™ s hackers and backers to damage Hillary .
And still there is no end in sight .
Perhaps Assange will die of old age in his tiny embassy cell convinced of his martyrdom to the last ."
2017-07-02,"Shot over five years and beginning in 2010 , Laura Poitrasâ€ ™ s portrait of WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange works as a prequel to Citizenfour , her 2014 documentary thriller about NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden .
Favouring screens as intermediaries , shooting crowds of people filming on their camera phones and watching live press conferences via giant televisions , Poitras creates an atmosphere of surveillance .
Her camera stays close to Assange while he is under house arrest at the plush Ellingham Hall in Norfolk , and in Londonâ€ ™ s
Ecuadorian embassy , where he has spent the last four years dodging formal questioning about two separate sexual assault allegations .
The access is impressive , and the oily , paranoid and â€œruthlessly pragmaticâ€ � persona that emerges here is candid enough despite Poitrasâ€ ™ s intermittent narration ( â€œI donâ€ ™ t think he likes
meâ€ � ) .
The film scrambles towards its rough - hewn conclusion , unable to confidently wrap up the still - unspooling threads of the Assange - WikiLeaks saga .
Itâ€ ™ s worth noting that this is a ( more critical ) recut of the film Poitras screened at the Cannes film festival in 2016 , and has been hastily updated to reflect , among other things , WikiLeaksâ€ ™ s involvement in the leaking of the Democratic National Committeeâ€ ™ s emails ahead of last yearâ€ ™ s US presidential elections .
Assange tells Poitras that â€œto make the world the way you want it , you have to act globally , â€ � but remains opaque about WikiLeaksâ€ ™ s ( and , for that matter , his own ) politics outside their commitment to â€œradical transparencyâ€ � .
Weâ€
™ re not privy to what WikiLeaksâ€ ™ s global vision might look like , nor does Poitras push Assange on the political implications of his radical transparency , deployed strategically .
Yet , by including his glib dismissal of the assault case as â€œa tawdry , radical feminist positioning thingâ€ � , Poitras reveals how she views Assangeâ€ ™ s localised thirst for power .
â€œI thought I could ignore the contradictions
, â€ � her voiceover says .
â€œI thought they were not part of the story .
I was so wrong .
They are becoming the story.â€ �"
2017-07-11,"Julian Assange , the Wikileaks founder , has claimed that he contacted Donald Trump Jr and tried to persuade him to publish emails showing he was eager to accept sensitive information about Hillary Clinton via the anti - secrecy website .
Instead , the US presidentâ€ ™ s eldest son did so via Twitter , igniting a firestorm of criticism around his apparent willingness to work with the Russian government against his fatherâ€ ™ s Democratic rival .
â€œContacted Trump Jr this morning on why he should publish his emails ( i.e with us),â€ � tweeted Assange , who is based at the Ecuadorian embassy in London .
â€œTwo hours later , does it himself.â€ �
Asked by another Twitter user to explain , Assange elaborated : â€œI argued that his enemies have it â€ “ so why not the public ?
His enemies will just milk isolated phrases for weeks or months ... with their own context , spin and according to their own strategic timetable .
Better to be transparent and have the full context ... but would have been safer for us to publish it anonymously sourced .
By publishing it himself it is easier to submit as evidence.â€ �
It was not clear whether Assangeâ€ ™
s
use of the word
â€œenemiesâ€ � was the reference to the media or political rivals .
The Australian added :
â€œHeâ€ ™ s surely had advice and/or is confident on the facts .
Iâ€ ™
d argue that even the completely innocent need @WikiLeaks.â€ � WikiLeaks played a prominent role in the US presidential election , publishing emails stolen from the Democratic National Committee ( DNC ) and Clintonâ€ ™ s campaign manager , John Podesta .
As a candidate , Trump declared : â€œI love WikiLeaks!â€
�
US intelligence agencies concluded that the hacking was carried out by Russia .
Trumpâ€ ™ s longtime confidante Roger Stone communicated with Assange and a hacker known as â€œGuccifer 2.0â€ � , who began posting DNC documents on 15 June â€ “ less than a week after Trump Jrâ€ ™ s meeting with a Russian lawyer in New York .
WikiLeaksâ€ ™ apparent overlap of interests with the Trump campaign drew scrutiny at the time .
Robert Mackey of the Intercept website wrote in August last year : â€œThe WikiLeaks Twitter feed has started to look more like the stream of an opposition research firm working mainly to undermine Hillary Clinton than the updates of a non - partisan platform for whistleblowers.â€ �"
