1999-07-17,"In 1996 Lance Armstrong was the hottest young cyclist in the world .
The Texan had won the 12-day , 1,200-mile Tour DuPont - the most respected race in the US - for the second year in a row and was ranked seventh in the world .
The money was just beginning to roll in with a $ 2 million contract to compete for France 's Team Cofidis and a $ 1 m Nike endorsement deal . '
Twenty - five and entering the peak of my career
, ' he says with a rueful smile . '
I felt bulletproof . '
He was n't .
Suffering with an aching groin , Armstrong went to see a doctor .
It took two hours to diagnose the problem : the cycling champion had testicular cancer and it had spread to his lungs and abdominal lymph nodes .
The doctor gave him a 60 per cent chance of survival .
Or to put it another way : a 40 per cent chance of dying . '
I was in shock , ' he recalls .
' I put my head down on the doctor 's desk and thought about it for a couple of minutes .
But there was no point denying it , so I looked up and said : ' ' Let 's get started .
Let 's kill this stuff '' . '
Armstrong remains bitter that , in the days following his announcement , the cycling world was buzzing with speculation that performance - enhancing drugs might have played a role .
That only fuelled his determination to recover and helped motivate him for his startling performance in the Tour de France , where he has grabbed the yellow jersey and , with just a week of the race left , does not look like surrendering it .
Earlier this year , resting in the living - room of his luxurious apartment in Nice , he pondered those dark days .
It began on 28 September 1996 with a pain in his right testicle .
A few days before he had coughed up some blood .
Long accustomed to the discomforts of riding a bike seven hours a day , Armstrong shrugged off the symptoms . '
You have to perform with pain as an athlete , ' he says .
He wonders now if his competitive drive drowned out some crucial messages from his body .
In July of that year a case of bronchitis forced him to drop out of the Tour de France and racing left him more fatigued than usual .
On hearing the crushing news , Armstrong did n't hesitate .
He had his cancerous testicle removed the morning after the diagnosis , and after spending a few days recuperating from the surgery , reported for his first chemotherapy session .
On the advice of a nutritionist he radically altered his diet - giving up red meat , dairy products and coffee .
Still the chemotherapy dragged him down , and by the end of his first week the once hyperactive athlete found himself taking two - hour naps every afternoon , even after sleeping 10 hours at night .
After another operation and extensive chemotherapy , he began his comeback early last year .
He now has only a tiny chance of the cancer returning . '
He 's 98 per cent home , ' says Dr Lawrence Einhorn , who treated him . '
His treatment is completely finished and he takes no medication . '
To come back as a professional athlete and to be in his form - that is a result of Lance 's spirit and dedication .
It 's one thing to recover and go back to work as an accountant .
But it is very , very difficult to perform as an athlete , after all the terrible fatigue you go through and everything else . '
Einhorn cites one example of Armstrong 's determination : between draining rounds of chemotherapy - he went through four of them , lasting five days each - the 27-year - old Texan would ride his bike 30 to 50 miles a day .
Einhorn strongly denies any link between testicular cancer and performance - enhancing drugs , as some French and Belgian newspapers have hinted .
Armstrong is amazingly philosophical about the drugs issue . '
My story is a success story in the world of cancer , ' he says . '
In America , in France , in Europe , they relate to this story . '
I 'm not going to get mad about the questions , because I understand them after the events of last year .
I expected this . '
Armstrong has turned his plight into a lesson for men between the ages of 20 and 34 - prime candidates for the disease that will strike more than 5,000 Britons this year . '
I never thought I 'd get cancer , ' Armstrong says . '
But young , strong men should realise that this can happen . '
OTHERS WHO MADE DEADLY DISCOVERY BOBBY MOORE ( Football )
One of the best - kept secrets in football history was that Bobby Moore suffered from testicular cancer in 1964 .
Treatment ensured he recovered to lead England to World Cup glory in 1966 , though it was not until after his playing days were over that his trauma was revealed .
Moore later died of cancer .
STEVE SCOTT ( Athletics )
The most prolific sub - four - minute miler in history , Scott was diagnosed with testicular cancer in 1994 .
An operation and chemotherapy ensured that he recovered and he is now one of the top veteran runners in the United States .
DARRYL STRAWBERRY ( Baseball )
The New York Yankees outfielder , one of the greatest baseball players in history , contracted colon cancer in 1997 and needed surgery .
His recovery and comeback have been hampered by alcohol and drug addictions .
LUDMILA ENQVIST ( Athletics )
The most recent high - profile sports person to find they are suffering from the disease , the 1996 Olympic 100-metres hurdles champion was diagnosed with breast cancer two months ago .
An operation failed to stop the cancer spreading and the Swede is undergoing chemotherapy .
JASON CUNDY ( Football )
The former Tottenham Hotspur star discovered that what he believed to be a groin injury was testicular cancer .
An operation to remove the testicle and a course of radiation therapy cured the problem and he resumed his career with Ipswich Town .
LESHON JOHNSON ( American Football )
The New York Giants running back was diagnosed with non - Hodgkins lymphoma last year , but recovered following chemotherapy .
He is one of four Giants players since 1980 to have been diagnosed with cancer during their careers ."
1999-07-29,"Lance Armstrong rightly spoke out against his former team , Cofidis , who went back on their promise to stand by him , as well as others who would not take him on after his illness ( Texan beats cancer to win Tour de France , July 26 ) .
I too was treated for testicular cancer , and have found that my former condition has been used by insurance companies to artificially increase premiums .
Despite a letter from my doctors stating that the chance of recurrence , not of death , was less than 2 % , Commercial Union charged me extra for life insurance .
Ten years on , General Accident still require a health declaration each time my accident insurance is renewed .
Cover for my business expenses , should I have a different illness , is too expensive to be worth taking on .
Despite the fact that survival rates from testicular cancer are extremely high , it is a deeply disturbing experience .
This unjustified discrimination against those who have had it adds insult to injury .
Phil Abel , London 
John Grant 's heartfelt plea for additional funding for cancer research ( Lottery of life , Society , July 21 ) will have struck a chord with many but I fear that families struck down by other than the commoner cancers to which he refers are even further down the queue .
A little over a year ago I was diagnosed with a rare form of lung cancer , about which little is known , except that it is not caused by smoking ( I do not smoke ) , that there is no effective treatment , and that it kills about 300 people in this country every year .
I have found it most distressing that no one is even contemplating research into my type of cancer "" because it is so rare "" .

2000-07-30,"Despite perfecting the bicycle - by adding essentials such as chains , gears , brakes , etc to the original French vélocipede - we have never really taken to it in the same way they have ( admittedly they patented the pedal , though Leonardo first sketched one in 1490 ) .
But as Lance Armstrong packs his bike away for at least a week 's break before he begins training for next year 's Tour de France , it seems timely to look at what it would cost to keep up with him .
The Tour remains the world 's most gruelling sporting event , and it is no surprise that France hosts it - this is , after all , the country that came up with the word ' sadism ' .
So the most important factor is the extra weight you will have to pedal up and down the Pyrenees .
Armstrong 's bike , a Trek 5500 , weighs 17 lb with its components , while the carbon fibre frame alone is just 2.5 lb and costs £ 1,000 .
Complete , it is £ 2,700 , while his signature version is an extra £ 1,000 .
Frame material is crucial - carbon fibre and titanium are the most expensive , but aluminium bicycles have fallen in price and are almost as light .
Spare wheels are more than £ 500 per pair , while the groupset ( gears and brakes ) is £ 1,000 .
Shoes and pedals that clip together cost £ 90 .
Other racing essentials include a helmet ( from £ 20 to £ 100 ) and a puncture kit ( £ 1.50 , pump £ 10 ) , and to avoid dehydration you 'll also need a water bottle ( £ 5 ) .
Professional cyclists are unabashedly devoted to Lycra ( shorts , £ 20 ) and also shave their legs ; it is assumed this enhances their aerodynamics ( razor and blades £ 3 ) .
Note that designers have omitted any pouches for packed lunches and the like .
Indeed , if you are concerned about provisions , you may not be cut out for the Tour de France at all - remember that these athletes diet for most of the year and have the body - fat of whippets and legs by Rodin .
A traditional bicycle , of the sort usually found in British university towns with a wicker basket and buckled wheels , is probably more appropriate and can be picked up for £ 30 or less .
However , mountain bikes are still the biggest sellers : the most popular costs about £ 350 , while a full - suspension model is about £ 1,000 .
Tour de France bicycle £ 2,700 Frame only £ 1,000 Spare wheels £ 500/pair Shoes £ 90 Helmet up to £ 120 Puncture kit £ 1.50 Pump £ 10 Lycra shorts

2001-06-06,"John Sutherland ( How do you get a drug on to the US market without testing it ? , G2 , June 4 ) starts almost believably , though predictably snobbishly , by trashing the loony alternative medicine freaks of the US , but then shifts into complete langue de fruitsville by claiming that conventional chemotherapy does n't work against cancer .
Of course we could n't expect a professor of English to know about Lance Armstrong , the champion of the Tour de France whose fight against testicular cancer was made possible by chemotherapy , or the thousands of Hodgkin 's disease or breast cancer sufferers who have beaten their tumour with the aid of drugs .
Sutherland 's answer is - hey ! - nutritional supplements .
The balance of evidence is that a healthy diet does help prevent all kinds of disease ( not just cancer ) but there is no shred of admissible evidence to suggest that alternative medicine of any kind cures , as opposed to helping to prevent , cancer .

2001-07-01,"One minor hiccup held up Lance Armstrong 's serene progress to victory last week in the Tour of Switzerland , his final warm - up race before he starts his bid for a third successive win in the Tour de France on Saturday .
It came when an overzealous official at the theme park hosting the opening stage in the German town of Rust would not let Armstrong bring his bike into the building where the winner 's press conference was being held .
The Texan is not noted for his patience and stalked off .
That , however , was as tough as it got for the double winner of the Tour de France in the fourth - toughest stage race in cycling , which ended in Lausanne on Thursday .
Armstrong did not look extended in the two mountain legs , and was crushing in his superiority in the race 's two time - trial stages , the second of which , on Tuesday , scaled the 19-mile climb to the Alpine ski resort of Crans Montana .
This is ominous : Armstrong 's main purpose in choosing the Tour of Switzerland was to use Crans Montana as a dress rehearsal for the afternoon of 18 July , when the Tour de France includes its first mountain time trial since 1996 , between Grenoble and the Chamrousse ski station .
Such stages are usually key , combining as they do the Tour 's most two unforgiving disciplines .
From ' visualisation ' for the big event , this turned into a clear statement : the next man was over a minute and a half behind - a massive margin - and this was the Italian Gilberto Simoni , who is at his best having just won his home Tour .
Armstrong , however , hopes there is better to come . '
I would be disappointed if we had seen the best of me here , ' he said . '
The important thing is to be good in the next month . '
Barring last - minute hiccups , Armstrong will climb the start ramp in Dunkirk for Saturday 's five - mile time trial with an impregnable aura that can only be compared to the five - time winner Miguel Indurain 's .
It is easy to forget that it is a mere three years since he made his comeback from testicular cancer .
To add to the impression that everything is currently going Armstrong 's way as he prepares to join seven men who have won three Tours , and the four who have won three in a row , the Texan 's wife , Kristin , announced recently that she is expecting twins following successful IVF treatment .
Armstrong , who banked sperm before his cancer treatment , will treat this as a bigger victory than either of his Tours .
There is even a break in the one cloud that still hangs over Armstrong , the investigation launched last November by the Paris judge Sophie Helene Chateau into his United States Postal Service team for alleged infractions of the law on use and provision of banned drugs at sports events .
On Thursday , as he was on the final stage of the Tour of Switzerland , Judge Chateau 's office announced that ' in the context of the inquiry , no measures are likely to be taken against the team 's riders during the 2001 Tour ' .
The investigation followed an anonymous denunciation of Armstrong 's team after a television crew filmed helpers driving 100 miles away from the team hotel at last year 's Tour to dump binbags containing a large quantity of syringes and medical detritus in a motorway service area .
Armstrong has not been able to offer an explanation for this , beyond protesting his innocence .
On Thursday , however , the prosecutor 's office stated that the bin bags contained nothing that broke the law .
Judge Chateau added that the results of tests on urine and blood samples , taken during last year 's race from Armstrong and his team , would not be known for ' at least a month ' , making it unlikely that there would be dramatic revelations during the race .
Armstrong 's lawyer , Georges Kiejman , said he was ' delighted that the court has indicated that the Tour will be permitted to go ahead peacefully ' and that he was ' particularly satisfied ' by the news that ' the rumours which have grown about the US Postal teams dustbins were without foundation ' .
The controversy will have its effect , however .
The race organiser Jean - Marie Leblanc was still outraged by the team 's actions when The Observer spoke to him recently , and revealed that he had made his feelings known to the USPS team .
He is not the only man angered over the affair .
Armstrong has raced just twice in France this year , and his first appearance , at the Circuit de la Sarthe stage race in April , was preceded by an aggressive press conference .
He expressed his anger over the length of time taken by the inquiry team and asserted that his urine samples were negative - although Judge Chateau has countered that the tests are not complete .
History shows that Armstrong is a rider who needs enemies , real or imagined .
In 1999 he was aiming his ire at the teams who did not believe he could return from cancer , in 2000 at the French press , who had expressed doubts about the purity of his victory the previous year .
This year , the target is easy to guess , and his anger will fire him up - more , probably , than opponents such as Jan Ullrich will - throughout the next four weeks ."
2001-07-09,"Under pressure over his revelation that he works with the controversial Italian trainer Michele Ferrari , Lance Armstrong last night stated : "" He has never discussed EPO [ erythropoietin ] with me
and I have never used it , "" writes William Fotheringham .
Armstrong confirmed he has worked with Ferrari since 1995 "" on dieting , altitude preparation , hypoxic training and the use of altitude tents , which are all natural methods of improvement "" .
Mark Gorski , general manager of Armstrong 's US Postal Service team , defended the rider 's work with the trainer who goes on trial in September charged with the provision of banned drugs to cyclists including EPO , human growth hormone , the anabolic agent DHEA and testosterone .
In a second investigation Dr Ferrari is alleged to have supplied EPO .
Armstrong added last night that Ferrari 's "" primary role has always been limited "" and that he has worked with Ferrari when his regular coach Chris Carmichael was not in Europe .
He said : "" Chris has grown to trust Michele 's opinion regarding my testing and my form on the bike . ""
He added : "" In my personal ex perience I have never had occasion to question the ethics or standard of care of Michele . ""
Armstrong has spent two years , since winning his first Tour de France , combating insinuations over doping .
His team is currently at the centre of an investigation by a Paris judge into possible malpractice relating to the disposal of medical waste during last year 's Tour de France ."
2001-07-10,"Erik Zabel today won his second stage out of three in this year 's Tour de France , but it was not enough to prevent Australian Stuart O'Grady taking the yellow jersey after an enthralling run into Seraing .
Lance Armstrong , the American chasing a hat - trick of Tour wins this year , finished in the main pack of riders to stay in strong contention in a race that will be won and lost in the mountains rather than on the moderate climbs riders faced today .
Zabel , the German who wears the green jersey as the leading points scorer for the last five years , followed up Sunday 's win to seal the 10th stage win of his career in the 198.5 km run from Antwerp .
O'Grady 's 31st - placed finish on the uphill final sprint was enough to move the yellow jersey into the possession of the green and gold as Australia 's remarkable sporting run continues , making up for the disappointment of missing out at Wimbledon yesterday .
Marc Wauters , the Belgian who led going into the third stage , lost his lead on home soil , as he fell behind was on the Mont Thieux climb .
The race continues tomorrow with the 215 km fourth stage from Huy to Verdun ."
2001-07-11,"At a mere 900 feet , the third - category climb of the Cte des Forges is a mere pimple compared with next week 's Alpine and Pyrenean passes , yet the drag over its wooded summit provided a brief vignette of what may await this Tour .
A group of a dozen drew ahead of the main field , the mini - breakaway including last year 's top four : Lance Armstrong , Jan Ullrich , Joseba Beloki and Christophe Moreau , plus the 2000 King of the Mountains Santiago Botero .
All the favourites , in other words .
They observed each other briefly , as if making sure that the magic circle was complete , and then permitted the rest of the front - runners to catch up again before battle was joined for the stage finish , which went , for the second time in three days , to Ullrich 's team - mate Erik Zabel .
Small the Forges may be , but its one - in - eight slopes are steeped in cycling history , a fixture in the oldest one - day Classic on the calendar , Liège - Bastogne - Liège .
The last time the Tour tackled these roads in 1995 , it was the launch pad for one of the greatest coups of Miguel Indurain 's five Tour wins , the daring surprise attack into Liège which effectively won him his fifth Tour .
This time round , the drama was on a lesser scale but the Forges , and the other two ascents in the Ardennes triptych , the Ctes de Mont - Theux and Sart - Tilman , did see off the only Italian hope , Francesco Casagrande , the runner - up in last year 's Tour of Italy .
Out of sorts due to illness before the Tour , he finished almost five minutes behind and is talking of returning to Tuscany .
The maillot jaune Marc Wauters was equally ill at ease once the race left the flatlands of Limbourg and crossed the river Meuse into the steep wooded valleys of the Ardennes , and the Australian Stuart O'Grady duly benefited .
On Monday in Antwerp he and his Crédit Agricole team , led last year by Chris Boardman , had completely failed to realise that Wauters was in contention for the yellow jersey .
Blindly , they let the Belgian slip away in the last kilometre , a howler which O'Grady described as being "" like missing the winning penalty in a World Cup final "" .
After a sleepless night , normal Australian sporting business was resumed yesterday .
O'Grady 's team - mates set a searing pace once they realised that Wauters had been left behind , handing them a second chance to make an assault on the race lead .
The winner of the PruTour of Britain in 1998 now has 17sec in hand over Moreau , which should be sufficient to keep him in yellow at least until tomorrow 's team time - trial .
Zabel was always the likely favourite for the stage as none of the other sprinters made it over the hills in the front group of 100 , and he is a past master at a finish like yesterday 's , at the top of a lengthy drag .
There was much speculation at the start of this Tour about his relations , or lack of them , with Ullrich , who specified that the team selection should include specialist climbers to help him in the mountains , at the expense of the two men who assist Zabel in his sprints .
Sunday 's victory at Boulogne reconciled them , and yesterday in the last kilometre Ullrich was never far from the Berliner , who was at pains to point out afterwards "" the team did very good work , the atmosphere is very good "" .
When he launched his winning effort , on his shoulder was Armstrong , no less , who was acutely aware that vital seconds can be won and lost in an uphill finish like yesterday 's if even a small gap appears between the riders in the group .
Ullrich and Beloki were equally determined to give nothing away , and finished 13th and 14th to the American 's 10th .
At the other end of affairs , David Millar slipped yesterday to the position of lanterne rouge , the name given to the rider who is last in the overall standings , even though he had his best stage of the race so far .
He is the first Briton to hold the honorary title since 1985 , but has regained his optimism and is now talking about helping his team in tomorrow 's team time - trial before bidding for a stage win for himself .
Meanwhile , the Anglo - Italian Max Sciandri , bronze medallist in the road race at the Atlanta Olympics , yesterday confirmed that he is among the 86 people who are likely to be investigated further by police following the mass raid by the drugs police at the Giro d'Italia . ""
My name is in there too and it pisses me off , "" Sciandri admitted yesterday , speaking from his home in Tuscany . ""
But I 've heard nothing further from the police .
I 'm waiting for something from them .
I had a product there with me , but it 's not something I 'm going to ruin my career for .
I 've told my team and they are OK about it . ""
Sciandri is adamant that the substance found in his possession is "" nothing to worry about "" .
It is , he says , a mixture of caffeine and aspirin which "" is n't anything I could be in trouble for .
I had it there and took it
, it 's a foreign medication , which is why they are looking at it .
"" It is not clear what charges , if any , he might face .
The judge leading the inquiry into the Giro d'Italia drug seizures , Luigi Bocciolini , has yet to place any of the people on his list under formal notice of investigation .
His analysts are still going through the 300 different substances which were seized , and he is currently on holiday , which means the chances of his inquiry having an impact on the Tour de France are greatly reduced ."
2001-07-13,"Jaan Kirsipuu of Estonia won a sprint finish at the end of the sixth stage of the Tour de France today .
But Stuart O'Grady did enough to keep the yellow jersey of race leader .
Lance Armstrong , the American chasing his third successive Tour victory , finished comfortably within the main bunch as he stayed focused on next week 's decisive mountain stages .
Armstrong 's US Postal team lost ground in the team time trial on Thursday but there no surprises in the sixth stage , run over 211.5 kilometres from Commercy to Strasbourg .
Axel Merckx , Rik Verbrugghe , Michele Bartoli , Laurent Brochard and Frederic Bessy were in a lead group around three minutes ahead for more than 150 kms , making it over the Col du Denon with few problems , but were caught before the finish .
The race continues on Saturday with a 162.5-km stage from Strasbourg to Colmar ."
2001-07-13,"When the Tour de France reintroduced the team time - trial in 2000 after a four - year absence much was made of the unique spectacle it creates : perfectly coordinated formations of nine riders in largely identical colours doing battle on spectacular aerodynamic machines .
Yesterday 's high - speed pile - up involving Lance Armstrong 's US Postal team was indeed spectacular , but not as the race organisers would have intended .
With about 17 km left , the American Christian van de Velde lost control of his front wheel in the middle of the road .
He collided with the Spaniard Roberto Heras , last year 's Tour of Spain winner , and the pair slid down the tarmac with their team - mates scattering like a flock of pigeons to avoid them .
Armstrong was ahead , fortunately , but it was as close as he has come to disaster in recent Tours .
What had preceded the "" chute "" was an impressive display of Armstrong 's strength .
In a team time - trial the riders share the pace more or less according to their ability to keep the speed at a maximum .
Usually one man will head the indian file for about 10 to 15 seconds .
One of Armstrong 's spells "" in the wind "" , as the cyclists put it , was timed at 75 seconds .
What followed the crash was an equally impressive display of solidarity and sang - froid .
Armstrong could have merely left the pair to fend for themselves but he made his team slow down while Heras and Van de Velde remounted and caught up .
It will have cost him time but should pay dividends in maintaining team spirit .
Round one of the duel between Armstrong and Germany 's Jan Ullrich , the prologue time - trial , was a draw but yesterday 's pile - up did not stop round two from going the Texan 's way , as Ullrich 's Telekom team dropped 24 seconds , with only a puncture to the points leader Erik Zabel to hinder them .
Of more concern to Armstrong , however , was the 55 seconds he lost to Joseba Beloki , third last year , whose Once team were , however , relegated to second by Stuart O'Grady 's Crédit Agricole men , decisive winners by 31 seconds .
The Australian was lost for words at the finish but he should continue to wear yellow at least until tomorrow , when the Vosges make their appearance .
Immediately behind him , however , are his own team - mates , the German Jens Voigt and Philadelphia 's Bobby Julich .
He is 87 seconds ahead of his old amateur rival Armstrong , who now has a little catching up to do .
 Italian police yesterday proved there is no sex discrimination in cycling by conducting a drugs search at nine hotels in Levico Terme being used by the 17 teams in the women 's Giro d'Italia .
According to La Gazzetta dello Sport banned substances and syringes were found in several rooms ."
2001-07-16,"David Millar 's painful first week ended yesterday when the young Briton finished outside the time limit set for the stage , over 35 minutes behind the winner , Erik Dekker of Holland .
However Lance Armstrong , Jan Ullrich and Joseba Beloki , last year 's top three , also missed the cut , as did the entire field apart from 14 riders in the day 's winning escape , according to the president of the Tour 's disciplinary committee , Giovanni Meraviglia .
The Tour 's rules state that any rider finishing 10 % slower than the stage winner when the average speed is above 44km - per hour should be disqualified .
Fortunately , and unsurprisingly , they were all permitted to stay in the race as the rules allow "" exceptional circumstances "" .
And this was an exceptional stage .
Millar described it as "" horrific "" but for the first time this Tour the entire field shared his suffering .
They finished chilled and sodden to a man after almost six hours in the rain , which varied through the day from heavy to torrential .
Enveloped in flapping capes , by the end their eyes were red - lidded in grit - speckled , haggard faces , their limbs goose - pimpled and tetanisés , as French slang puts it :
paralysed by cold .
Horrific it certainly was , but things may be looking up for the lone British rider , although he remains in last place , the first Briton since Paul Sherwen in 1985 to wear the "" red lantern "" .
Millar finished in the main pack yesterday , something he has not managed since his crash in the opening time trial nine days ago and on Saturday , conscious of the need to make a show on Bastille Day for his Cofidis team , he was one of a three - rider group that held the lead to the top of the first climb .
"" It 's picking up a bit , I 'm definitely feeling a bit better , "" he said .
"" The first five days I was suffering but fortunately they took it a bit easier today .
Every other day has been balls to the wall . ""
Friday 's leg to Strasbourg , when he finished last but one was , he says , "" one of the worst days I 've ever had on the bike .
Any other time I would have packed it in .
I could n't hold on to the field even on the small climbs .
I honestly thought I was out of it .
If I had n't had another rider , Bart Leysen , with me , I would have been eliminated . ""
"" All he can do is take it day by day , "" said his manager Bernard Quilfen yesterday .
"" When you are going through what he is going through the only solution is to wait for things to get better , and he is getting better now , in his state of mind , and in his physical form . ""
Quilfen , who has been in cycling for over a quarter of a century , believes , rather poetically , that what the French call caractère - fighting spirit - is "" forged through suffering "" .
"" He 's had a bad week , but it will be of service in future , "" said Quilfen .
"" It strengthens a cyclist 's character .
When you 've experienced what David has this week , you will come out of it a stronger person . ""
With yesterday 's sodden six hours coming on top of a week of pain , Millar will end up with caractère , as well as sweat , oozing from every pore .
Yesterday 's great escape began three miles from the start and its 14 participants huddled together , as if for warmth , as the Tour headed south , initially a stone 's throw across the Rhine from Germany and finally running parallel to the border with Switzerland .
Elegant chalets and fields full of docile cows and watch - making museums reflected the Swiss tone ; the weather left its mark in deep puddles , overflowing gutters and swollen rivers .
With their minds merely on getting through the day , the peloton let the 14 upstarts squelch away to a lead of over half an hour , unprecedented for any break in the post - war years , which meant the main bunch had not reached the banner marking 25 km ( 15 miles ) to go when Dekker outsprinted the Spaniard Aitor Gonzalez , and the Belgians Servais Knaven , and Marc Wauters .
While Dekker added a sodden victory to his three stage wins of last year , there were major ramifications as the result transformed the overall standings .
The yellow jersey , which switched on Saturday from Stuart O'Grady to his German team - mate Jens Voigt , is now back on the shoulders of the Australian , who was one of the 14 .
O'Grady also relieved Erik Zabel of the points leader 's green jersey , his long - term objective here .
The reason the peloton took so little interest was not merely down to the weather : of the 14 escapees , only one , Millar 's Kazakh team - mate Andrei Kivilev , has any reputation as a man who can climb mountains ; he now leads Lance Armstrong and the other favourites by some 13 minutes , which could be enough to put him in the yellow jersey if he can hang on tomorrow at l'Alpe d'Huez .
All riders have their own ways of coping with conditions like yesterday 's and Dekker 's sounded the wisest .
"" When you were in the break it was better than being in the peloton , "" he said , and this is indeed the case .
Fourteen men throw less spray in the eyes than 180 , it is easier to skid around trafffic islands and over slippery zebra crossings in a small group , and there is less danger of hitting the brakes too hard and losing control .
Yesterday , however , being in the break had one overwhelming advantage , according to the Dutchman :
"" It was half an hour shorter . """
2001-07-18,"Lance Armstrong 's great friend Robin Williams was in a front seat in the Texan 's US Postal Service team car as Armstrong scattered Jan Ullrich and the rest of the Tour de France field to the four winds here yesterday .
And afterwards , in pidgin French , the actor gave as lucid an analysis as anyone here could manage of the American 's performance .
""
Six and a half hours in the mountains , then like a motorbike , voom . . .
"" he jabbered , making a gesture of an aeroplane taking off .
The script , however , was not so much Mrs Doubtfire as Groundhog Day .
For the third year running the first major mountain stage of the Tour belonged to the Texan , as it did at Sestriere on the other side of the Alps in 1999 and at the Hautacam ski station in the Pyrenees last year .
The weather was dry but that was about the only difference .
As on the previous two occasions Armstrong put in a sudden burst of pace at the foot of the climb , looked at the opposition - Alex Zulle in 1999 , Marco Pantani last year , Ullrich yesterday - saw signs of weakness and accelerated again before taking flight alone .
It looks clinical but the inner energy which he produces once opportunity beckons is nothing short of savage .
On yesterday 's evidence , Williams has been teaching the Texan how to act .
Armstrong was rarely anywhere near the front of the leading group on either of the day 's two passes -
the 6,000 ft Col de la Madeleine and the Col du Glandon , which is slightly lower but rears up like a wall for its final few kilometres .
This raised hopes that the double Tour winner might be having an off day , and Ullrich ordered his Deutsche Telekom team - mates to set the tempo .
Armstrong later admitted he had been "" playing poker a little "" .
He explained : "" In cycling everyone 's watching .
The [ team ] directors have television in their cars and you can hear the television camera motor - bikes come alongside to look at you .
Sometimes you have to play that game a little bit . ""
And when Armstrong made his effort at the foot of the Alpe after a surge of speed from his Spanish team - mate Jose - Luis Rubiera , Ullrich had the look of a man who could not believe what he was seeing .
Traditionally the 11.25 miles of numbered hairpins leading to this resort are annexed for the day by the Dutch , winners here several times in the 1970s and 1980s but a spent force since 1989 .
They still come en masse in a sea of orange streamers , but yesterday there were Danes in viking helmets and Americans by the score , waving the stars and stripes as they ran alongside Armstrong .
But the Germans were most striking : there were signs from village after village proclaiming their loyalty to Ullrich .
"" It 's a mystical stage , "" said Armstrong , the first defending Tour winner to triumph here since Bernard Hinault in 1985 .
He may have meant mythical , as there was no mystery about yesterday 's result .
The first four at the top of the Alpe were the first four in Paris last year :
Armstrong , Ullrich - 1min 59sec behind - Joseba Beloki , Christophe Moreau .
There is , however , a peculiar look to the overall pecking order , where three of Sunday 's escapees still have a temporary hold thanks to the 35 minutes they gained into Pontarlier .
The wizened , grey - haired François Simon of the Bonjour team now holds the yellow jersey , but he can be expected to bid it au revoir in the near future .
Simon 's is the kind of story France loves : his brothers Pascal , Regis and Jérme all won stages in the Tour , and it was on a stage finishing here 18 years ago that Pascal became one of the few riders to quit while in yellow .
Simon has almost 12 minutes in hand on the Kazakh Andrei Kivilev of David Millar 's Cofidis team , another member of the great escape and a better climber .
Stuart O'Grady , the maillot jaune yesterday morning , still lies third , but the true story begins with Armstrong , now lying fourth , who leads Beloki , Moreau and Ullrich by between 1min 45sec and 2min 44sec .
These are not decisive margins , but another body blow like yesterday 's should suffice .
Millar 's was among the bodies which have had enough :
his pains finally came to an end after 10 days when he abandoned on the Madeleine . ""
He was at the end of his tether , "" said his manager Alain Deloeuil .
"" It was n't so much pain in his legs as in his head . ""
Six others quit , including Jaan Kirsipuu , the winner in Strasbourg , and the autobus of non - climbers survived only by the skin of its teeth .
The pack will be shuffled again in today 's mountain time - trial to the Chamrousse ski station , high above Greno ble , where acting will have no place : this is not called the "" race of truth "" for nothing .
Yesterday Armstrong seemed concerned that he might feel the after - effects of his all - out effort .
"" The scary thing is that that was everything I had .
I might pay for that effort .
I could lose two minutes .
"" This is conceivable , but it is more likely that it is just anotherattempt to hoodwink the opposition . 
A French court yesterday convicted three officials from the now - defunct Dutch cycling team TVM of providing riders with performance - enhancing drugs in 1998 .
The court in the eastern city of Reims gave the former team sports director Cees Priem a suspended 18-month prison sentence and a £ 7,421 fine .
Andrei Mikhailov , the team 's doctor , received a 12-month suspended sentence and a fine of £ 5,564 .
TVM trainer Jan Moors was given a six - month suspended sentence and fine of £ 3,707 .
All three immediately appealed the decision , according to Philippe Bouchez , an attorney for Priem ."
2001-07-19,"Lance Armstrong and his Belgian team manager Johan Bruyneel can not agree how many times the Texan looked over the 20-mile climb to this ski resort in the run - up to the Tour .
"" I always say five or six , Johan says three or four , "" said Armstrong yesterday .
These were the only figures over which there was any doubt : by finishing a clear minute ahead of Jan Ullrich , Armstrong took his second stage win in two days and the Tour is now his to win or lose .
It remains , however , to be won .
Two mountain victories in two days mean that Armstrong will fly south - west to the Pyrenees today with a clear enough margin over Ullrich and Joseba Beloki - 3min 34sec and 3min 10sec respectively - but the yellow jersey remains the property of the grizzled little Frenchman François Simon , who finished precisely seven minutes behind Armstrong yesterday .
He is a popular maillot jaune , who still boasts a 13 minute lead over the American , but it was over 30min on Sunday and the signs in the Alps which proclaimed "" Simon in yellow in Paris "" are Gallic fantasy .
The yellow jersey fits no more comfortably on his compact frame than the wobbly nostril expander strip he sported yesterday , and he is unlikely even to approach the eight days in yellow his elder brother Pascal managed in 1983 .
Pain , however , is something the Simons know all about .
Pascal spent six days in agony in yellow with a fractured shoulder , and yesterday François 's sufferings , if not on that level , were painful to watch .
If tomorrow 's uphill finish at Plateau de Bonascre does not blow him away , then he will surely founder on Saturday 's five passes en route to one of the classic Pyrenean finishes at Pla d'Adet .
Founded in 1865 , this little ski resort in the Belledonne Massif is no stranger to sporting legend in the making .
It was here that Jean - Claude Killy took three skiing gold medals in the 1968 winter Olympics and the Col du Luitel , of which this climb is a part , was the setting for Charly Gaul 's epic stage win in the 1958 Tour .
Gaul and Armstrong can now be mentioned in the same sentence : the speed with which Armstrong turns his legs as he goes uphill has been compared to the legendary "" angel of the mountains "" , and this double of Alpine victories is simply exceptional .
No one has won back - to - back Tour stages in the Alps since the Russian Piotr Ugroumov in 1994 and the last defending Tour winner to do such a thing was Eddy Merckx .
If he goes on to take his third Tour , Armstrong will owe much to the fact that he leaves nothing to chance and his relentless practice paid off in spades .
He chose the perfect line on each hair - pin bend , and led at every checkpoint apart from the first , where he and Ullrich were level .
He was sufficiently confident to back off slightly in the second part of the climb , allowing Ullrich to come back at him , before piling the pressure on again in the final few kilometres .
The only threat to his progress came from over - zealous fans , who persistently ran the gauntlet by jumping out in front to yell encouragement , leaping back at the very last moment .
As at l'Alpe d'Huez the previous day , Ullrich and Armstrong presented a contrast in styles .
The German clearly relies on strength rather than what the French call souplesse , the ability to turn the pedals swiftly and economically , which is Armstrong 's forte .
For the also - rans style was academic , and they finished with heads swaying , mouths gasping for air .
Armstrong , however , was in a class of his own ."
2001-07-21,"Lance Armstrong is wearing the yellow jersey for the first time in this year 's Tour de France tonight as he claimed victory in an epic 13th stage . .
The American took everything his main rival Jan Ullrich could throw at him on the 194-kilometre stage from Foix to Saint - Lary - Soulan before launching an attack of his own on the last of six climbs to the Pla d'Adet in the Pyrenees .
It was a third mountain stage win out of four on this year 's Tour for the American , who seems to be headed for a successful title defence after taking another minute out of Ullrich with his withering final assault .
The German claimed second place in the stage , a minute behind Armstrong according to provisional results , with Spain 's Joseba Beloki third a further 46 seconds back .
Ullrich had earlier taken a tumble on the descent of the Col de Peyresourde when he misjudged a bend and ended up in a ditch , but he recovered and immediately continued on a new bike .
Francois Simon of France , who led Armstrong by nine minutes 10 seconds at the start of the day , finished over 13 minutes down and lost the yellow jersey to the American ."
2001-07-21,"The countryside north of the six - mile climb to the Pyrenean ski station of Plateau de Bonascre proudly proclaims its links with the Cathars , a medieval sect who were brutally stamped out by the Catholic church in the middle ages , and here yesterday Lance Armstrong proved equally implacable in the face of the first signs of unrest from Jan Ullrich .
It was Ullrich who forced the pace on the steepest part of the ascent , as soon as the leaders left the spa town of Ax - les - Thermes and crossed the river Ariège - as Armstrong 's main challenger for overall victory , there really was nothing else he could do .
But the German 's trouble is that , as the Texan pointed out after his decisive victory on Tuesday at l'Alpe d'Huez , he is not a rider who can produce the abrupt changes of pace which can unsettle a climber as confident as Armstrong .
All Ullrich could do yesterday was ride as fast as he could , in the hope that Armstrong might find his pace too much at the end of a 103-mile stage .
Some hope .
Armstrong was immovable , and the difference between the two riders was highlighted with a mile to go when the Texan produced the kind of effort Ullrich clearly can not : a searing burst which left the Olympic champion yards behind within moments .
Ullrich rallied , and limited his losses to 23 seconds by the finish , but he is now four minutes behind Armstrong and the effect on his morale must have been devastating .
The American could not quite make it a hat - trick of stage wins , however , as the diminutive Colombian climber Felix Cardenas had already taken flight earlier in the stage .
He lasted out to claim a victory full with emotion given the tragedy which hit his Kelme team in March , when two of their riders , the twin brothers Javier and Ricardo Ochoa , were mown down by a car while training near Malaga .
Javier was killed instantly while Ricardo , the stage winner at the other end of the Pyrenees at Hautacam last year , has only recently emerged from a coma and begun to speak again .
Another tragedy , the Italian Fabio Casartelli 's fatal accident six years ago , sprang to mind on the descents , which were narrow , hairpinned and hair - raising .
On the first climb , the Col de Jau , the Dutchman Bram de Groot bounced off a rockface and over a crash barrier .
He was taken to hospital with multiple facial injuries and was later said to be in a coma although in a "" satisfactory "" condition .
After the same fall Sergei Ivanov , the stage winner at Aix - les - Bains , was taken to hospital with shoulder injuries and is out of the race .
Then , as the lead bunch plunged down into the Ariège valley before the finish , the Belgian Kurt van de Wouwer lost control and slid into a stone wall , breaking his collarbone .
Nor was that the end of the casualties , who included one major threat to Armstrong .
Christophe Moreau , who started the stage eighth overall and with every hope of finishing in or at least close to the top three , had begun the day unwell and climbed into his team car in a state of distress as soon as the bunch reached the lower slopes of the 4,500 ft Col de Jau .
He was said to be suffering from lung trouble .
Today , in the 121-mile stage to the ski station at Pla d'Adet , there are six major climbs in the final 75 miles .
The current maillot jaune , François Simon , is likely to see his 9min lead over Armstrong melt like the fresh snow on the peaks here ."
2001-07-22,"The prospect of Lance Armstrong and Jan Ullrich engaging in the two - wheeled equivalent of hand to hand combat had been much anticipated in the last two weeks .
Over the six passes to this tiny ski resort , perched precariously on a Pyrenean mountainside , the much awaited mano a mano was decisively won by the Texan , who took over the race leader 's yellow jersey from the Frenchman François Simon .
He now looks certain to take his third Tour win when the race enters Paris next Sunday , but his battle with Ullrich was ferocious . '
Jan has no choice but to attack , even if it means he loses time and finishes fifth , ' said his manager Rudy Pevenage before the start . '
He has already finished second three times in Paris , so a fourth is n't worth anything . '
Ullrich had already tried in vain to break Armstrong twice , on the mountain stages to l'Alpe d'Huez on Tuesday and on Friday to Plateau de Bonascre , and yesterday he tried again , with courage which will have won him more support than on any single day since he won the Tour four years ago .
Over the final three mountains , under bright blue skies where vultures circled , he did his utmost .
First on the majestic Col de Peyresourde , sweeping across a green mountainside like a giant letter Z , then among the orange - clad hordes of Basque cycling fans above the green lake at Val Louron .
In between , flying down the descent from the Peyresourde at 40 mph , he left the road on a left - hand hairpin , sped off down a grassy slope and somersaulted over his handlebars , fortunately with no harm done .
Amid a sea of fans on the climb to the finish , cut into a cliff - face , he accelerated as if the finish were round the next hairpin in a desperate bid to dislodge the American .
His efforts earned him the same reward as at l'Alpe d'Huez and Bonascre : the second Armstrong scented a hint of lassitude - moral and physical - it was the American 's turn to sprint , and Ullrich had no answer .
The gap at the summit was a minute ; the gap between the two men is now over five minutes .
Armstrong crossed the line pointing to the heavens , as he did six years ago in Limoges after the death of his teammate Fabio Casartelli . '
Same gesture , same sentiments .
I absolutely dedicate this victory to Casartelli , because it is the first time I have passed the monument in a race .
It 's amazing to me how much emotion it brings back . . .
how beautiful it is and how special it is to me . '
Armstrong added that he was ' crying like a baby ' when he stopped at the memorial while reconnoitring the stage six weeks ago , and said ' when I passed it [ today ] I decided there and then that I was going to win today . '
France 's new hero Simon may have been unable to keep his yellow jersey , but the home nation rediscovered Laurent Jalabert , its darling of Bastille Day .
The Frenchman stayed at the head of affairs for over 100 miles , surviving until three miles from the line , and now has a serious option on the polka - dot King of the Mountains jersey .
For all his dominance , Armstrong is not taking victory as read . '
Are you going to keep the yellow jersey until Paris ? '
he was asked afterwards . '
Steady on , ' he replied , twice .
And indeed , anything can happen in the final week of the Tour - and today 's short but vicious mountain stage and Friday 's lengthy time trial remain to be negotiated .
But it will now take an act of God or a collapse of the most spectacular kind to prevent the Texan joining the elite band who have won three Tours on the trot ."
2001-07-22,"Pontarlier , Sunday 15 July The Tour rolls into the centre of the absinthe industry in an appropriate state .
Ecstasy among the members of what will be known in future as ' the Pontarlier coup ' , who have got away with the biggest lead of any breakaway group since the Second World War - 35 minutes ; oblivion in the peloton , who simply let the 14 men in the ' coup ' get on with it , because none was considered of any importance in the great scheme of things .
The tone is set for the week 's racing : a kind of handicap event , in which Lance Armstrong needs to claw back the deficit as well as gain time on Jan Ullrich and the recognised contenders .
Amusingly given the weather , a break of this magnitude is also known as an ' echappée fleuve ' - a flood break .
Aix - les - Bains , Monday
16 July Downhill all the way from the Pontarlier plateau , unless you 're David Millar , who is in trouble even on the two small climbs .
This bodes ill for the Alps and , after 10 days ' suffering , he is homeward bound the next day .
L'Alpe d'Huez , Tuesday
17 July ' Breathe , you are at L'Alpe d'Huez , ' says the banner placed by the first grim chalets .
Getting enough oxygen is , indeed , an issue for most of the bunch as they ride up the 22 hairpins carved into the mountainside , with two passes around the 6,000 feet mark - Glandon and Madeleine - already behind them .
And Laurent Roux 's wife , Isabelle , is in need of a few deep breaths too , as she stands in the finish line throng .
Holding her daughter 's hand , she quietly sobs under the protective arm of a team helper as her husband 's epic ride over the two great passes comes to an agonising end within sight of the victory that would have meant instant stardom - and perhaps a new kitchen .
Once Armstrong has left Ullrich for dead it is only a question of when ' Lolo ' , as the goatee - bearded , tinted - haired Roux is inevitably nicknamed , will be reeled in .
Roux has had a thin time since he was banned for using amphetamines in April 1999 : he received no salary for the rest of the season , was unemployed last year and gained a place with the Jean Delatour squad only when he called the manager , burst into tears and said he would ride for the wage of a first - year professional .
Victory would have meant financial security for several years , but the polka - dot King of the Mountains jersey will have to do .
Grenoble , Wednesday 18 July The bells rung yesterday evening in the village of Mesnil - Saint - Loup , near Troyes in eastern France , and the villagers paraded in yellow football shirts to celebrate the accession to the maillot jaune of François Simon , youngest of the village 's four cycling Simon brothers .
Like O'Grady , he is a member of the Pontarlier ' coup ' , but a better climber .
Pascal Simon , holder of the jersey in 1983 , hires a Renault Espace and the entire clan drives through the night to watch François defend his lead in the mountain time - trial up to the Chamrousse ski station .
He loses seven minutes to Armstrong but , thanks to the ' coup ' , still has 13 in hand .
Perpignan , Thursday 19 July While the Tour cyclists are flying from Grenoble to Perpignan , 6,400 amateurs from around the world are pedalling the course for Sunday 's final Pyrenean stage , 90 miles starting from Tarbes , climbing over the Aspin and Tourmalet passes and finishing at the Luz Ardiden ski station .
It is an annual chance to ride the same roads as the legends of cycling , with a similar road closure provided by the gendarmerie - the cycling equivalent of racing the street circuit at Monaco in your own car .
As pleasure goes , it is over the edge of masochism : after nine hours on the road , exhausted figures are still wobbling - and in some cases trudging - up to Luz Ardiden in bone - chilling rain .
The Tour winner today will cover the terrain in half that time .
Ax les Thermes , Friday 20 July A day of ghosts in a land that bears , like stigmata , the martyred traces of its Cathar past .
The patron at the Hotel Mirouze in Saint Girons points at his reservation list : the family of Fabio Casartelli , who died in a crash during the 1995 Tour , stayed here only two weeks ago on a visit to his memorial on the descent of the nearby Col de Portet d'Aspet .
Armstrong always says that the most emotional victory of his career was a stage win later in that Tour - with his arms pointed at the heavens in Casartelli 's memory - and this morning at the start in Perpignan , he is presented with a replica of the memorial , which is now a place of pilgrimage for cycling fans , and where the Tour peloton still halts when the race passes .
A wreath is due to be laid at the spot the next day .
In the afternoon Colombian Felix Cardenas , of the Kelme team , dedicates his victory high on the plateau above Ax to the memory of his team - mate , Javier Ochoa , killed by a car while out training in the spring with his twin brother Ricardo , a stage winner in the Pyrenees last year .
Ricardo remained in a coma for two months , and when he regained the power to communicate his first question was about his brother . '
Injured , ' he was told . '
You 're lying , ' he responded , and turned away in tears .
To paraphrase Armstrong 's best - selling autobiography , cycling ' is not just about the bike ' ."
2001-07-23,"This morning Jan Ullrich will give a press conference in his hotel in Pau , but as his PR man Luuc Eisenga put it - only half in jest - there is nothing to say .
Yesterday , at the top of the eight miles of hairpins leading to the bleak ski station of Luz - Ardiden , actions spoke louder than words .
For the first time in a mountain stage of this Tour de France , Ullrich finished ahead of Lance Armstrong , sprinting in third behind the Spanish stage winner Roberto Laiseka and Italy 's Wladimir Belli .
The German champion was all of a metre ahead of the American , who was clad in the yellow jersey that he wrested on Saturday , but as he crossed the line Ullrich stretched his right hand towards Armstrong , who took it and shook it gently .
The handshake amounted to an admission that the battle for this Tour de France is over and that Ullrich is resigned to a fourth second place since 1996 , a sequence broken by his win in 1997 and his absence from the 1999 race .
"" I have battled for five days on the trot with Lance and in all that time he has never shown any weakness , and that s why I made the gesture , "" said Ullrich .
Armstrong , meanwhile , has continually sung the German s praises .
In fact he has been mounting something of a PR offensive on this Tour , and on Saturday he showed professional respect for Ullrich as well , by waiting when the German made an unintentional high - speed diversion into a hayfield on the descent from the Col de Peyresourde to make sure he had not been injured .
Over the long and punishing weekend Ullrich showed better form than at any time since his victory four years ago , and proved a more than worthy adversary for Armstrong .
On Friday he blasted up the foot of the climb to Plateau de Bonascre and on Saturday he made similar attempts to blow Armstrong away on the Peyresourde pass and on the climb to the finish at Pla d'Adet .
Yesterday the German looked set to mount one last offensive , sending four of his climbing domestiques - Andreas Kloden , Jens Heppner , Alexandr Vinokourov and Udo Bolts - up ahead over the Aspin and Tourmalet passes .
This is a classic textbook tactic , in which the domestiques are in front , the leader attacks from behind , and the workhorses then wait to tow him away .
There was just one problem : Ullrich could not complete the move by getting away from Armstrong , who looked as comfortable as anyone can when climbing up three large mountain climbs in a single day .
It was not until the final two kilometres to the finish here - far too late to hope to cut seriously into his five - minute overall deficit - that Ullrich made a serious attempt to break clear , and by that time his domestiques had long blown a collective gasket and were trailing behind .
As on Saturday at Pla d'Adet and on Friday at Plateau de Bonascre , he could not get rid of Armstrong - whose attacks when he sensed Ullrich weakening on both occasions should win him this Tour when the race enters Paris on Sunday .
Yesterday , however , the Texan was content to ride defensively , and made no attempt to contest third place .
Ullrich and his camp are clearly frustrated by the Olympic champion 's impotence .
On Friday his manager , Rudy Pevenage , accused Armstrong of making Ullrich look ridiculous by letting his Telekom team make all the running before popping out on the last climb to leave their man for dead .
On Saturday Ullrich admitted : "" I feel stronger than I did in the past , but it doesn t mean much and that s eating me up . ""
Others have found the Pyrenees more productive .
On Saturday Laurent Jalabert cemented his status as France s new - found favourite by following up his double of stage wins with an epic 100-mile escape over five of the day 's six climbs , relinquishing his lead only four miles from the finish at Pla d'Adet and taking a firm grip on the polka dot jersey of best climber .
That is not a turn of events anyone would have predicted two weeks ago in Dunkirk .
Another unexpected Frenchman , the gritty , grimacing , grizzled François Simon , fought heroically but vainly to hold on to the yellow jersey on Saturday , but still has every chance of finishing in the top six at the end of the week .
The other survivor of last Sunday s epic escape into Pontarlier , the Kazakh Andrei Kivilev , never looked like taking Simon 's yellow jersey , but his consistent climbing over the weekend has left him in an equally unlikely third place .
That place is still up for grabs between the Kazakh and last year 's third finisher , Joseba Beloki , who has been a disappointment , together with the rest of his Oncé team , who have two other riders placed in the top 10 but even on the borders of their native Spain have done little more than follow Armstrong and Ullrich like mountain sheep .
Over the weekend , as the foul weather of last week turned into blazing sunshine , the slopes of the mountains were fragrant with the delicate smell of hay , newly cut at the foot of the Tourmalet , sitting in the high pastures of the Aspin in round bales that looked ready to roll down the steep hillsides .
As during last year , when he took the yellow jersey at the rain - chilled ski station of Hautacam near Lourdes , it is Armstrong who has brought home the richest harvest from the Pyrenees .
Today is a rest day ."
2001-07-24,"In the Tour de France the process is now as firmly established as the fact that the finish comes after the start : first the dominating performances , then the questions about drugs .
It is a reflection of a new spirit of scepticism among those who follow the sport - which can even be heard from members of the general public - that no winner has ever been questioned so closely about drugs as Lance Armstrong , who now has his third Tour victory in his sights .
Questioned over his relationship with the controversial trainer Michele Ferrari , Armstrong issued a statement two weeks ago denying that he had ever used the banned blood - booster erythropoietin , and the man who famously beat testicular cancer yesterday added that he had not used human growth hormone either .
Three years ago , before the Festina scandal , it would have been taboo even to mention these substances .
"" Why would someone in my position , with my medical history , take something like that ? ""
he said , with his hand on his heart , referring to the rumours that have linked human growth hormone with cancer . ""
No way , no way . ""
Armstrong did confirm that he uses a tent known as a hypobaric chamber to simulate high - altitude conditions , a permitted way of increasing the number of oxygen - carry ing red cells in his blood .
"" It 's absolutely natural , absolutely clean , absolutely healthy , and absolutely perfectly legal . ""
Armstrong revealed two weeks ago that he has worked for almost six years with Dr Ferrari , who goes on trial in September on charges of supplying banned drugs to cyclists .
"" I believe he 's an honest man , I believe he 's an innocent man , "" he said yesterday .
However , he added that if Ferrari is found guilty , he will "" re - evaluate the relationship "" .
Today Armstrong faces a more straightforward task : the longest stage of the race , across the hilly terrain of Aquitaine - mere molehills compared with the mountains he conquered last week ."

2001-07-26,"Two days after Lance Armstrong 's vehement defence of his work with the controversial Italian coach Michele Ferrari , further allegations about the scientist emerged yesterday from another cyclist .
On Monday Armstrong was adamant that Ferrari , with whom he has worked since 1995 , was "" a clean man . . .
an honest man . . .
an innocent man "" .
However , the Italian magazine GQ has printed extracts from statements given to police by the Italian rider Filippo Simeoni , who said Ferrari - apparently nicknamed Il Mito , the myth , by Italian cyclists - advised him to use the red blood cell booster erythropoietin ( EPO ) , testosterone and human growth hormone to improve his performance .
An inquiry led by the magistrate Pierguido Soprani is investigating Ferrari on charges of providing or recommending performance - enhancing drugs to cyclists .
Key evidence lies in diaries kept by Simeoni in which he recorded the substances he took between 1992 and 1999 , when he was questioned by Italian police .
Simeoni told Soprani he worked with Ferrari between October 1996 and July 1997 and alleges Ferrari advised him how to dodge the tests for blood thickness , intended to restrict the use of EPO .
In one of his diaries Simeoni wrote : "" Doctor Ferrari advised me to use two alternatives : Hemagel [ a blood thinning agent ] on the morning of the control , albumin [ an element contained in white blood cells ] on the evening before a possible control . ""
Simeoni , who won four races last year , said Ferrari had not warned him about possible side - effects and that he stopped working with him because he felt Ferrari was giving preferential treatment to others .
"" Ferrari did not treat me with the same efficiency he showed to other athletes , "" he said .
Asked about the new allegations concerning the trainer he consults on diet , altitude training and the use of a depleted oxygen tent , Armstrong said yesterday : "" It 's a story that is three years old .
Anyone can print old articles . ""
As well as pressures off the bike , the Texan was reminded yesterday that he can take nothing for granted until Sunday 's finish in Paris .
Early on , before the lime avenues of the Lot département gave way to the oakwoods and limestone gorges of the Dordogne , Jan Ullrich and the Spaniard Igor Gonzalez de Galdeano , sixth overall , made a brief escape in a group of 19 , quickly retrieved by Armstrong 's team - mates .
After the honey - coloured farmhouses had given way to the pinewoods of Corrèze , the peloton hit 50 mph on the descent into Tulle , 25 miles from the finish , and a touch of wheels felled 30 men .
Five did not continue , including the Antwerp stage winner and former maillot jaune Marc Wauters , and the Swiss Sven Montgomery , who was 17th overall in his first Tour until he opened up his forehead on a metal crash barrier .
The crash slowed the peloton but they had stood no chance of catching the day 's escapees : a seven - strong group including the eventual winner Jens Voigt and the Australian Bradley McGee , a bronze medallist at the Sydney Olympics on the track , who pulled away from their companions as they entered the twisting , wooded roads leading to this village of 295 people .
This is , however , no ordinary hamlet : Bernadette Chirac is deputy mayor , the President of the Republic has a mansion nearby and the main building is a museum for gifts he has received from around the world .
Like the Tour , the president 's reputation is taking a battering : he is under investigation for alleged corruption .
In 1998 the first couple 's stage , a time - trial , was ruined the night before by the exclusion of the entire Festina team in the celebrated drugs scandal ; yesterday the only disappointment was that Mme Chirac would have preferred Laurent Jalabert to win .
Voigt was a popular winner , however ; he held the yellow jersey briefly after the stage through the Vosges to Colmar and frequently takes part in long escapes like yesterday 's .
Usually he is unsuccessful but McGee offered no resistance .
Utterly dehydrated in the 30C heat and low on blood sugar after 100 miles in the lead , he weaved across the line , came close to blacking out and had to be supported by team helpers after the finish .
Pale and baggy - eyed , he was asked whether he would try to win again and commented : ""
Tomorrow ?
Do n't tell me there 's another flipping stage tomorrow ?
"" There is indeed : it will be equally hot and is the last chance for any long - distance heroes to imitate the German and the Australian ."
2001-07-27,"Lance Armstrong won his fourth stage of the current Tour de France today , tearing along the 61-kilometre time trial course from Montlucon to win by over a minute .
The American was once again a class apart from his rivals , beating second - placed Igor Gonzlez Galdeano of Spain by one minute 24 seconds and Germany 's Jan Ullrich by a further 15 seconds , according to provisional results .
Armstrong now holds a lead of six minutes 44 seconds with just two stages to go and barring outrageous misfortune he will go on to claim his third successive Tour de France win in Paris on Sunday .
Ullrich held on to second place in the overall standings , while Joseba Beloki of Spain overtook Andrei Kivilev of Kazakhstan to move into the third podium place ."
2001-07-27,"Only two issues remain to be settled in this Tour de France .
The yellow jersey is Lance Armstrong 's for the third year running , barring accidents .
The measled mountains vest , with its red polka dots , will go to Laurent Jalabert , an unexpected and popular triumph for the rider who has become known as "" the panda "" thanks to a cartoon on French television which has been picked up by the roadside public .
The green , which rewards the best sprinter , on the other hand , has turned into an intense contest between the German Erik Zabel , winner for a record five years running , and Stuart O'Grady , who has worn it for the last 12 days .
Becoming the first Australian to win the maillot vert , or indeed any jersey in the Tour , has been O'Grady 's prime objective throughout ; it has been eating away at him since two years ago , when he pushed Zabel hard until a crash in Bordeaux with three days to go .
Yesterday , for the second day in succession , the pair sprinted to the finish side by side in what is becoming their own private competition ; Zabel won with sixth to "" Stuey 's "" seventh , 13sec behind the unexpected winner , Serge Baguet of Belgium .
Zabel was caught behind slower riders in the final metres and only broke through with what O Grady described as a "" desperate manoeuvre "" .
On Wednesday at Sarran , 130 miles to the south , Zabel again cut O'Grady 's lead by a single point when they finished eighth and ninth ; the Australian is just 11 points to the good and the chances are their contest will last as far as the Champs Elysées on Sunday .
"" It 's a good , clean fight , "" Zabel said yesterday .
"" There 's a lot of mutual respect there . ""
Not , one suspects , that that will stop them leaning on each other when push , as it were , comes to shove .
O'Grady is slightly slower when it comes to terminal velocity in the finishing straight , but he knows that as long as Zabel does not finish more than one place ahead he is relatively secure , so the pair ride the final miles of each stage like Siamese twins .
With points on offer at two intermediate sprints each day , they have to be constantly vigilant , although the long - range escapes that have decided each day 's racing since the Pyrenees have favoured O'Grady : each sprint taken by a breakaway is one less to worry about as far as he is concerned .
Yesterday the peloton was in curmudgeonly mood and the day 's 16 escapees never gained more than five minutes .
The constant chase from the Corrèze pine woods into the pastureland of Limousin - over one area of highland delightfully named the Plateau of a Thousand Cows - kept the average speed close to 29 mph in the 30C ( 86F ) heat .
Against all the odds , three of the 16 - Baguet , Italy 's Massimiliano Lelli and the Danish national champion
Jakob Piil - fought out the finish , with the bunch , hot and pouring with sweat , on their heels led mainly by Zabel 's Telekom team in the latter stages .
In the final miles Lelli refused to share the work at the front , much to Baguet 's anger , but the Belgian proved easily the strongest in the uphill finish .
This was literally a case of the worker having his day : the 32-year - old , whose biggest win previously was a stage of the Kellogg 's Tour of Britain in 1993 , was so disillusioned with his lack of results that he took three years out to work as a roofer , returning only last year . ""
During that time I put 10 kilogrammes on , "" he said .
"" Like all Belgians , I drank a lot of beer . ""
Yesterday would have sweated out any remnants of his Duvel - belly .
The green jersey will have to wait until Sunday , but in today 's 38-mile time - trial through the beech forests used to make the vats for Bordeaux 's wines , the Tour 's other outstanding issue should be settled : the third slot on the podium behind Jan Ullrich , which is a straight fight between the Kazakh Andrei Kivilev and last year 's incumbent , Joseba Beloki .
If Kivilev hangs on to his 1min 20sec advantage - unlikely given that Beloki time - trialled well to his third place last year - it will bring a wry smile to the face of the local hero Roger Walkowiak , a Montluçon native who got in a lucky break in 1956 and clung on to win overall , and who watched the stage finish yesterday .
Kivilev owes his high place to a modicum of climbing ability and the gift from the favourites of a 35-minute lead on the road to Pontarlier 12 days ago .
That he has subsequently hung on "" à la Walkowiak "" , as this situation is known , is a tribute to his tenacity and proof that minor miracles can still happen in modern - day Tours ."
2001-07-28,"Lance Armstrong is looking fitter than ever .
Lighter and stronger , with his body fat ratio surely as low as a healthy man 's can go , he has spent the last three weeks outdoing his own already remarkable achievements and giving cycling fans memories that should live alongside the greatest moments from the long and vivid history of the Tour de France .
There is flame in Armstrong 's eyes and an implacable desire in his soul .
At the foot of l'Alpe d'Huez last week , having lulled the opposition by feigning exhaustion every time a motorcycle - borne TV cameraman came near , he turned and stared into the face of Jan Ullrich , his principal rival , before accelerating away to produce one of the most prodigious feats of solo climbing the race has seen .
Four days later , when Ullrich crashed on the descent from the Col de Peyresourde , Armstrong stopped and waited for him to recover .
And as they crossed the finishing line at Luz - Ardiden the following day , Ullrich extended a hand to the American in a gesture filled with meaning and , if you are susceptible to such things , with beauty .
Yesterday afternoon Armstrong got off his bike here in St Amand - Montrond in the dead centre of France to be told that , at the end of a 61 km ( 38-mile ) time - trial , he had won his fourth stage of the Tour and increased his lead over Ullrich by more than a minute and a half .
As he has done every day since he took over the yellow jersey a week ago , he mounted the podium to receive kisses , flowers and the acclaim of the spectators , many of them children , crowded behind the barriers at the finish of the day 's stage .
What he is not receiving , however , is the unanimous admiration of those who have followed the Tour for the past three weeks .
This story of the man who beat cancer to win the world 's most gruelling sporting event , which only two years ago seemed to be a feat without parallel in sport , is now being widely seen in a different light .
Armstrong is almost certain to win the Tour for the third year in a row in Paris tomorrow , making him only the fifth rider in history to achieve that feat .
But he will do so at the centre of a gathering vortex of disbelief concerning his relationship with drugs .
Armstrong has consistently denied taking drugs and there is no direct evidence against him but there were those who , right from the start , refused to believe that he could have made his way back to the top without the help of illegal methods after he had undergone treatment in 1996 for testicular cancer so advanced that it had spread to his brain and his lungs .
Two years and five months after his discharge , he did something which , in his pre - cancer years , he had failed to achieve : he won the Tour .
Last year he did it again , and now he is on the verge of joining Louison Bobet , Jacques Anquetil , Eddy Merckx and Miguel Indurain in the record books .
This could only have happened , according to his accusers , with the aid of a systematic and sophisticated doping programme .
Others , formerly ready to give him the benefit of any doubt , now look at recent circumstantial evidence and feel that Armstrong has abused their trust .
A year after French police seized medical refuse , including hypodermic needles and bandages , discarded by Armstrong 's US Postal team during the Tour , a judicial inquiry has yet to produce its findings .
And three weeks ago , as the 2001 Tour set off from Dunkirk , the Sunday Times published information linking Armstrong to Dr Michele Ferrari , an Italian who has worked with many cyclists and who in September will be called into a court in Bologna to answer charges of treating riders with erythropoietin , or EPO , the illegal drug that enhances endurance by increasing the proportion of red corpuscles in the blood .
The evidence against Ferrari includes this month 's revelation by an Italian rider , Filippo Simeoni , a member of the Cantina team between 1996 -1998 , that the doctor dispensed EPO and human growth hormone to the riders , and advised them on how to mask the presence of these substances .
Armstrong , hearing rumours that the Sunday Times knew the dates of his meetings with Ferrari at his clinic in Ferrara , going as far back as 1995 , pre - empted the revelation by giving an interview to an Italian newspaper in which he admitted the existence of the relationship but denied that doping was a part of it .
This week he held a press conference at which he confronted his chief accuser and again declared his innocence .
"" I 've lived by the rules , "" he said .
"" Something like human growth hormone - you think someone with my health history would take something like that ?
There 's no way . ""
Of Ferrari , he said : "" I believe he 's an honest man , a fair man , an innocent man .
Let there be a trial .
Let the man prove himself innocent . ""
He said he had not worked with the doctor during the present Tour , but would have no qualms about resuming the relationship if Ferrari were cleared by the court . ""
With what I 've seen with my two eyes and my experience , how can I prosecute a man who I 've never seen do anything guilty ? ""
Armstrong talked briefly about his use of a hypobaric chamber , a sort of tent which replicates the effect of training at altitude .
Unlike many of the great cyclists of the past , he has an acute awareness of what goes on in his own body .
His autobiography , It 's Not About The Bike , in which he described in detail the surgery and chemotherapy he endured at Indianapolis University 's medical centre , made it clear that he is not one of those who lie down on the operating table , close their eyes and ask no questions .
A sharp mind such as his could not be fooled into taking something illegal without knowing it .
Neither would he be unaware of the precise boundaries of legality .
It would be unrealistic to believe that Armstrong went through his formative years as a junior triathlon and swimming champion in Texas without at least observing the existence of anabolic steroids .
During his cancer treatment , EPO was administered .
His medical knowledge , at least in a couple of specialised areas , must be well above average .
And if it has enabled him to operate up to the very margin of the rules , as may be the case , then he can not be criticised for that .
He is an extraordinary man in many ways .
No one who saw him destroyed by the Alps in 1993 during his first Tour , lying in total distress in a bunk in his hostel in Serre - Chevalier three days after he had become the youngest rider ever to win a stage , could help but have a special admiration for the determination with which he came back to master the event and eventually to dominate it .
Brash and arrogant on his arrival in big - time European cycling , he learned his lessons fast .
Although there are still those who find him difficult to like , there is no question that the surly boy from a featureless Dallas suburb has adapted successfully to an alien culture .
He now speaks French , Italian and Spanish well enough to conduct interviews in all three .
His illness also gave him new perspectives on human existence .
"" When I was sick , "" he said , "" I saw more beauty and triumph and truth in a single day than I ever did in a bike race . ""
No doubt a psychologist would trace his independence and his motivation back to a difficult childhood .
His mother was only 17 when he was born , and his father left before their son was two .
"" I 've never had a single conversation with my mother about him , "" Armstrong wrote .
"" Not once .
In 28 years she 's never brought him up , and I 've never brought him up . ""
Her single - handed success in building a life for them , and her devotion to his nascent career , must also have left a powerful impression .
But there is a bigger question here than merely one man 's guilt or innocence .
When it comes to doping , after all , sport is always in denial of one sort or another , whether it is the family of Tom Simpson refusing to accept the presence of amphetamines in his body and in the pocket of his racing shirt as he fell dead on Mont Ventoux in 1967 or Ben Johnson lying and lying and lying until he finally gave way and admitted that he had won the Olympic 100 metres gold medal in 1988 by cheating .
In terms of cycling , history multiplies the resonances .
In the old days , just about everyone doped and nobody worried about it .
The first police raid on the Tour teams , at the end of a stage in Bordeaux in 1966 , changed nothing .
Nor , it seems , did the raids of 1998 , which followed the arrest of the Festina soigneur Willy Voet in his drug - packed van , at least if the discoveries on this year 's Giro d'Italia are anything to go by .
Guilty or not , Lance Armstrong exists in a climate modified by changed attitudes and values , not least those of the mass media .
Will his achievements be allowed to stand alongside those of , say , Fausto Coppi and Jacques Anquetil , or is he to be judged by a different set of criteria ?
"" I can not prove a negative , "" he said this week , "" so it 's always going to be a tricky situation .
When they find a test for one thing , then somebody stands up and says , ' Well , you must be doing the next thing . '
When they find a test for that , then they say , ' Well , you must be using the next thing . '
It goes on and on . ""
As well as the accusers and the recently disillusioned , there is a third group following Armstrong 's progress to the podium on the Champs- Elysées .
These are people predisposed to believe his expressions of innocence while reserving their right not to be surprised by anything the future may reveal .
They are not advocates of cheating , but they acknowledge the fundamental impossibility of imposing a completely drug - free regime on bicycle racing .
Their opinion of Armstrong was summed up yesterday by a friend of mine , a German journalist covering his 19th Tour . ""
My admiration , "" he said , "" is bigger than my suspicion . """
2001-07-29,"Lance Armstrong has been voted the most uncooperative rider in the race by the photographers and said in jest yesterday that he may respond by boycotting the traditional photographs at the start of the final stage in which the winner poses with a bottle of champagne .
That is unlikely , and the little spat will not stop the Stars and Stripes from flying on the Champs Elysees today for the third successive year as the Texan completes his hat - trick of Tours thanks to superlative performances in the mountains last week .
He accepted his probable victory yesterday evening , saying ' I had much more fun in this Tour than I have ever had before ' , and adding the warning : ' I think I can continue to improve until I 'm 30 , 31 .
And I think I can work harder .
I think we can do things better . '
Today the riders will prom enade in the early part of the stage , as is customary , but yesterday they sprinted the 90 miles as if the finish was just around the corner .
They averaged close on 30 mph in one long gasping line through cornfields where the harvest was being brought in , and past elegant medieval chateaux and sturdy Romanesque churches before being led into this ugly new town by the five - times points winner Erik Zabel of Germany .
The urgency was due to the one unresolved issue in the race , the nip - and - tuck battle for the green points jersey between Zabel , who took his third stage in this year 's race yesterday , and Stuart O'Grady of Australia .
They finished first and second at the finish , first and second in one of the day 's intermediate sprints , and second and third in the other , with the end result that O'Grady has just one point in hand , and Zabel is on the point of depriving him today of what could be the finest cycling performance ever by any Australian .
They were inseparable yesterday as O'Grady continued his psychological warfare against his opponent , who is trying for his sixth successive win in the award today . '
I stay on Zabel 's wheel because he did the same to me in 1999 . '
It 's very stressful having the rider with the jersey on your wheel when you 're trying to gain points .
I know because I 've been there . '
He lost contact with the German at the worst possible time , in the final kilometre , just as the lead group were winding up for the sprint .
Then it got worse , as he found Zabel 's team - mate Alexandr Vinokourov in his way , and his second place was achieved only by shouldering the world champion Romans Vainsteins out of his way in the final metres to move through a tiny gap at some 45 miles per hour .
Speculation and suspicion over the use of performance- enhancing drugs formed the background to this Tour , as they have to each Tour since the Festina drugs scandal of 1998 .
Yesterday , at the start by the cathedral in Orleans , a group of campaigners against the use of drugs in sport gathered near the start and held a press conference , having ridden the 95 miles from Saint Amond Montrond , the previous day 's stage finish .
The campaigners included the former Festina trainer Antoine Vayer , the 1992 Tour stage winner Gilles Delion , the 1996 world mountain bike champion Jerome Chiotti , who returned his gold medal after admitting the use of drugs , and representatives of two pressure groups , the Association for Fighting Doping , and 100 % Sport Pur .
They asked to ride into the stage start , but the Tour organisers did not permit it , which seems bizarre at a time when the sport is attempting to rebuild its credibility ."
2001-07-30,"After three weeks of epic pedalling , expending up to 10,000 calories of energy a day , Lance Armstrong finally made it to the front page of his country 's most prestigious newspaper at the weekend .
Hours before the Texan 's latest and arguably greatest win in his sport 's most prestigious race , the New York Times finally recognised his Tour de France achievements by putting his picture on the front of Saturday 's edition .
It was a rare moment of wider national recognition for a sports star whose Tour exploits may make him the talk of continental Europe each summer but whose deeds are followed from across the Atlantic by only a niche group of fans , with Armstrong eclipsed in the US media by the latest home - run heroics of the baseball sluggers and the upcoming gridiron training camps .
The Times picture told a symbolic story .
It showed Armstrong going flat out in the yellow jersey , hunched over his handlebars as he imposingly added a fourth stage win to his 2001 Tour de France tally in Friday 's 37.9-mile individual time trial from Montluçon to St - Amand - Montron , thereby setting the seal on his triple triumph in le grand bouclé .
Armstrong 's third succes sive triumph on the Champs - Elysées yesterday , together with Greg LeMond 's treble
a decade or so ago , means that Americans have won the Tour six times in the past 15 years .
It is a record that only cycling - crazy Spain can rival .
What is more , those 15 years have seen not a single Frenchman crowned on a winner 's podium , even in 1989 when LeMond edged Laurent Fignon off the No1 spot in the cruellest last - day finish ever likely in the Tour .
But while the attention of Europe remains loyally fixed on the Tour despite professional cycling 's doping scandals , Americans still seem to be taking only passing notice of the achievements of Armstrong and his US Postal Service team .
Even among US sports writers , Armstrong 's victories are not allowed to stand on their own for what they are .
Instead , they appear to feel the need to translate what he has done into terms that make them intelligible to Joe Six - Pack . ""
Think Dallas 52 ,
Buffalo 17 , "" one wrote last week about Armstrong 's back - to - back stage wins in the Alps .
The problem is not that Americans are denied detailed daily coverage of what Armstrong is up to if they can manage to find it .
On the contrary , here in Washington , and in approximately a third of US homes , cable television viewers have been able to see up to six hours of the Tour each day , including substantial live coverage .
The expanded coverage comes courtesy of the Outdoor Life Network , which has picked up the US televi sion rights to the Tour through to 2004 for $ 3 m ( about £ 2.1 m ) , a relative snip in big - time media sports deal terms .
Its coverage features the veteran Channel 4 commentating team of Phil Liggett ( whose French pronunciation remains as awful as ever ) and Paul Sherwen ( whose reading of the race 's tactical twists and turns is unfailingly informative ) .
Even here , however , the Tour remains a piece of sports exotica and Armstrong a distant hero to most fans .
But that could change if the Texan in the Oval office invites the Texan in the yellow jersey for the expected prime - time White House welcome home ."
2001-07-30,"I t 's over - another Tour de France successfully negotiated , and with my man Lance Armstrong taking the yellow jersey for the third time running .
It 's been a tough few weeks , mind - we 're usually out at the team 's truck by 7 am each day , unloading the bikes , putting them on top of the race cars and pumping the tyres .
There 's no servicing to do , as that 's done the night before , after the previous day 's stage .
We jump in the cars and go to the start about 11 am , take the bikes off the roof racks again , stack them by the team bus and then stand around making sure no one steals them .
There are rarely any last - minute problems but we do have them : on the way to the first road stage this year , Viatcheslav Ekimov 's bike fell off the roof rack and was completely destroyed , so we had to set up his spare bike .
We lose one bike on average every year : the roof racks come from the Tour organisers and have to be adjusted for each bike , and there 's always one that slips through the net .
We carry six spare bikes on the first car and five pairs of wheels ; the second has two spares plus a second spare for Lance .
He always has two spare bikes in the race , in case one car has to stop and something happens to him .
The bikes are carbon fibre , 10 gears , worth around £ 3,000 , and he has four of them , including one special light bike for the mountains .
During the stage another mechanic , Jean - Marc , and I ride in the two support cars , which is a waiting game for five or six hours : I catch some zzzs , hand up waterbottles to the riders , and wait for something to happen .
You do n't do much leaning out of the car doing repairs on the move , although I have a toolkit with me just in case -
it 's got tweezers for pulling things out of tyres , a tape measure because the riders are always certain their position is wrong , and a big hammer , as a last resort .
I have n't had to get out of the car much in this Tour , except when two of our riders crashed in the team time - trial .
I was in the second car right behind them , but I was watching it on television .
I saw Christian [ Van de Velde ] go down with Roberto Heras
so I jumped straight out and ran .
Luckily a gentleman on the roadside had picked Christian up , so I got him back on the bike and pushed him off , but the poor fellow who had helped him back on was running in front of me , so I had to muscle him out of the way and pushed him in the ditch .
Kind of rude , but needs must when the devil drives .
We had all kind of crashes in the first week of the race this year , our guys just kept going down , but the worst I 've seen was in 1995 with Motorola , when Fabio Casartelli died .
After the stage finish , we put the bikes on the cars and go to the hotel .
The other two mechanics in the team have already gone there with the truck , so they start the washing , and Jean - Marc and I unload the cars .
The security issue is critical .
Because sometimes the hotels are in dodgy areas , there are always people around and it would be easy to take a bike off the roof or pick up a wheel .
The first year Lance won the Tour , the head mechanic , Julien de Vries , slept with Lance 's bike in his room every night to make sure it was safe , but now we just lock it up safely .
Telekom , Jan Ullrich 's team , had a car stolen this year , full of equipment .
They got it back
but it was empty .
Washing the bikes after the stages used to take a long time , but we have a power washer now , which means we can get all eight done in 25 minutes .
We check the tyres and wheels every day , but the quality of components these days means there 's very little maintenance .
The water gets into some of the bearings , which have to be replaced , but even that 's easy today - two minutes .
And we do n't have to change tyres at night any more ; if someone punc tures we just take a new wheel and the guys who are in the truck stick a new one on the following day .
In fact , because there are four of us and we have the power washer , there are n't many late nights any more .
I 've done eight Tours .
At the start we would work until 11 pm ; now it 's 9 pm maximum ."
2001-07-30,"The Tour de France 's victory rostrum is designed in trompe l'oeil style to resemble a yellow road winding up the Champs Elysées to the Arc de Triomphe .
Lance Armstrong 's victory was not complete until he had climbed the podium to hear the Star - Spangled Banner yesterday but the road had begun to turn yellow for him 13 days ago when he glanced back at Jan Ullrich at the foot of l'Alpe d'Huez , saw the German was vulnerable and stamped on the pedals to prove it was no optical illusion .
Armstrong 's third victory is simply summed up .
No overall winner has taken four stages for 17 years and the last winners to take a time - trial and stages in the Alps and Pyrenees , reflecting total dominance of every phase and discipline of the race , were the five - times winners Bernard Hinault and Eddy Merckx .
There was no single knock - out blow such as Miguel Indurain or Merckx might have struck but "" a succession of nails in Ullrich s coffin "" , as the double winner Bernard Thévénet put it - at l'Alpe d'Huez , in the Chamrousse mountain time - trial , at Pla d'Adet in the Pyrenees and in Friday 's St - Amand - Montrond time - trial .
Merckx says that Armstrong could win "" six or seven times without difficulty if he wants to "" , which is an exaggeration from a man who is among Armstrong 's inner circle and who went to the United States to accompany him on his first bike ride after cancer treatment four years ago .
But from now on Armstrong will nudge the greats of the sport at every pedal stroke .
As well as the hat - trick , achieved by only four others , he has this year equalled Merckx , by winning the Tour of Switzerland and Tour de France , and the "" champion of champions "" Fausto Coppi , by taking the Tour overall and the legendary mountain - top finish at l'Alpe d'Huez in the same year . ""
For me , he 's among the very best , "" said the Tour organiser Jean - Marie Leblanc .
"" In terms of pure class , he has less than a rider like Jacques Anquetil , but he has more willpower , more professionalism . ""
Apart from his status as a cancer survivor Armstrong 's victories are notable for the sheer hard work that has gone into them .
Indurain recalls meeting him in a hotel in the Pyrenees , riding the passes in February ; the inhabitants of Chamrousse in the Alps , where the mountain time - trial finished , were awestruck to see the Texan riding up to the ski station time after time in foul spring weather .
But if Armstrong has , as Leblanc put it , inspired "" a terrible admiration "" in the last three weeks , he has not drawn affection despite all his attempts to use French , something he refused to do last year .
He is also the first Tour winner to appear at the start and finish with bodyguards to keep the crowds back , he has been booed at times and he was voted the "" lemon "" prize for the race 's most antipathetic rider by the photographers .
Leblanc was damning with faint praise when he called Armstrong "" a great professional in the American style "" .
He added : "" It 's his job , first of all , public relations and popularity are a duty , not spontaneous things .
He does not have a personality which draws you like Indurain , who was a perfect sportsman , or Merckx , who constantly attacked and had huge panache , or Anquetil , who was perfection on a bike .
He is clinical . ""
There have been more American spectators than ever before at this Tour but Leblanc has judged that a proposal from Phil Knight , chairman of the Armstrong sponsor Nike , to hold a stage in New York is "" a good idea which we may realise one day - but it 's currently a bit premature "" .
For once there was more than the prestige of the stage win at stake on the final day : the battle between Stuart O'Grady and the German Erik Zabel for the green jersey went to the wire as expected , after the German 's third stage victory this year put him only two points behind the Australian on Saturday in Evry .
The pair were inseparable yesterday , as they had been for most of the five stages since the Pyrenees , but Zabel is the faster man and finished in front at the two intermediate sprints .
In the final rush up the Champs he was second and
O'Grady third behind the Czech sprinter Jan Svorada .
Thus , somewhat confusingly , O'Grady finished in green , but did not win green , while Zabel has now won the points award for six years on the trot , a record that is unlikely ever to be matched .
Yesterday , as is traditional , the teams pedalled up and down the Champs after the presentations .
Armstrong s US Postal Service team brandished the stars and stripes , their leader a lone star of Texas banner - until it caught in his wheel and forced him to dismount briefly .
That was Armstrong 's only glitch in 2,275 miles .

July 1 : Armstrong fired up for third win Lance Armstrong 's serene progress to victory in the Tour of Switzerland suggested he is on course for a third successive win in the Tour de France"
2001-08-04,"Lance Armstrong 's winning total time of 86 hours , 17 minutes and 28 seconds was the third fastest in the history of the sport 's most prestigious race .
The Texan finished the 2,146-mile race six minutes and 44 seconds ahead of Germany 's Jan Ullrich , whose compatriot , Erik Zabel , took the green jersey for the highest points tally .
Most observers saw Armstrong 's performance as clinical . ""
More professional , richer , thinner , tougher and , above all , faster , Armstrong represents the future which a still history - entrenched sport is struggling to embrace , "" concluded Procycling magazine .
Armstrong even made it to the front page of the New York Times , rare exposure for the Tour in the US . ""
Like Miguel Indurain , the Spanish champion of the 90s , Armstrong has so overwhelmed the Tour that he threatens to deaden its suspense , "" the paper said .
The Austin American - Statesman reminded its readers that the local boy had "" overcome cancer and the mountains of France on his way to glory "" .
Despite a successful battle against testicular cancer and triple Tour wins , in a sport bedevilled by rumours of drug use , Armstrong "" still faces hostility from French officials and the European press "" , even though "" he has never failed a drug test "" .
The American - Statesman was adamant that Armstrong 's "" remarkable feat places him among the top cyclists in the history of the sport "" .
In France , Le Monde agreed that Armstrong had now very much earned the accolade "" legend in his own time "" .
But the Guardian had reservations , describing Armstrong as "" the first Tour winner to appear at the start and finish with bodyguards to keep the crowds back "" , and noted : "" He has been booed at times and he was voted the ' lemon ' prize for the race 's most antipathetic rider by the photographers . """
2001-12-12,"The controversy which dogged Lance Armstrong throughout this year 's Tour de France will begin its end - game today in the central Italian town of Bologna , when the Texan 's trainer and confidant Dr Michele Ferrari enters its court - house to answer four separate charges of supplying banned drugs to elite cyclists over a lengthy period in the 1990s .
Armstrong is not on the long list of cyclists alleged to have been supplied by Ferrari but , en route to his third successive win in the Tour this summer ,
cycling 's biggest star repeatedly and loudly declared his belief in his trainer 's probity .
If Ferrari is found not guilty , Armstrong 's stand will be vindicated .
On the other hand , if the charges stand , it will be a grave embarrassment for the American , who has said that in that event he would consider dispensing with the Italian 's services .
The slight , studious - looking Dr Ferrari denies that he provided erythropoietin ( EPO ) , human growth hormone , adrenalin , Insulin Growth Factor , Dhea , testosterone and corticosteroids to a number of cyclists "" in a manner prejudicial to health "" , as the charge sheet puts it .
His fellow accused , Massimo Guandalini , proprietor of a pharmacy called Giardini Margherita , admitted the charges on a plea - bargain basis at an initial hearing in February .
The evidence drawn up by the investigating magistrate Giovanni Spinosa includes tapped telephone calls , prescriptions apparently signed by Ferrari , a list of drugs found in Ferrari 's house during police searches , and cyclists ' training programmes .
Ferrari is also accused of illegally importing folic acid - based substances , which can be used in conjunction with EPO to boost the red - cell count in an athlete 's blood .
The doctor is confident that he will be found not guilty . ""
None of the interrogated riders have told the police that I have given them illegal medicines .
I do n't think I will be convicted .
But naturally it is n't pleasant to think about the risk . ""
Just before this year 's Tour Armstrong confirmed rumours which had circulated in the cycling world for six years that he worked with Ferrari and during the race he was questioned about their relationship in a long , tense press conference on the race 's rest day in the Pyrenees .
Armstrong 's position is that the doctor is innocent until proven guilty and that he personally has never been given grounds to suspect him of any wrongdoing .
Asked why he had not stopped working with Ferrari when it was known that he was facing charges , he said : "" I 'm confident in the relationship , I 've never denied the relationship .
I believe he 's an honest man , I believe he 's an innocent man .
I 've never seen something to make me believe otherwise . ""
The doctor , in his only interview in the last seven years , revealed that the pair have had a close working relationship over the past five years , since the Texan began his comeback from testicular cancer .
Speaking recently to the Danish newspaper Ekstra Bladet , Ferrari said that , when Armstrong is racing , he is in daily contact with the rider by telephone .
This is not surprising , as that is how Ferrari worked with other cyclists .
But Ferrari painted a new picture of the way they work by revealing that Armstrong had even called him for advice during a mountain stage of the Tour de France , using a mobile phone belonging to Armstrong 's team manager Johan Bruyneel , who follows the race in the team 's car . ""
During the Tour de France in 2000 Lance called me in the course of the stage that finished in Courchevel , where Marco Pantani attacked before withdrawing from the race the next day .
Pantani 's attack was a good distance from the finish and I advised Lance to take it easy and let him go . ""
Ferrari added that he spoke to Armstrong on two or three occasions during the 2000 Tour in this way .
For any coach in cycling to make such an intervention is virtually unheard of and implies an extremely close relationship .
Armstrong is not the only major name in cycling who faces embarrassment if Ferrari is found guilty .
In the mid-1990s many of the world 's top cyclists made their way to his office in the city of Ferrara .
The list of the doctor 's clients is topped by the triple Tour of Spain winner and Tour de France runner - up Tony Rominger , who was the world No1 between 1994 and 1996 .
Also named are a host of major figures from the 1990s , including Claudio Chiappucci , the runner - up in the 1990 and 1992 Tours de France , Spain 's 1995 world champion Abraham Olano , Mario Cipollini , the flamboyant sprinter who won four stages in a row during the 1999 Tour , and Axel Merckx , the son of cycling 's non - pareil Eddy .
Armstrong 's former close friend Kevin Livingston is also on the list .
They have all been cited as injured parties by Spinosa and will therefore not face charges and are unlikely to appear as witnesses .
Since the Tour de France drugs scandal of 1998 , cycling has been on trial in a number of high - profile court cases : the Festina trial in 1998 , Marco Pantani 's indictment last year and this year 's trials involving the supply of narcotics and EPO .
Today is different , however : Ferrari 's extensive list of clients means that the credibility of almost a decade of results could be undermined if he is found guilty ."
2001-12-20,"4 :
Lance Armstrong 's third Tour win
When Rudy Pevenage realised that Lance Armstrong was pretending to hit trouble on the first mountain stage of this year 's event , the alarm bells started ringing .
Pevenage is a grizzled , stocky little Belgian , with close - cropped white hair above a banana - shaped grin .
Twenty years ago he was a Tour man himself , the winner of a cold , soaking stage in the 1980 race .
In recent years , as manager of the Deutsche Telekom team , he and his protege Jan Ullrich have faced the Sisyphean task of trying to engineer Armstrong 's downfall .
On Tuesday July 17 , Pevenage was driving close behind the front group of Tour cyclists with the other team managers in their little flotilla of Fiat Marea estates with spare bikes and giant radio aerials on their roofs and gaudy team stickers on the sides .
As they negotiated the corridors of cheering fans on the hairpins among the oak woods and rock outcrops of the Col du Glandon in the Alps , he realised something strange was happening a few metres ahead among the group of 30 or so cyclists - with Armstrong , for once , well towards the rear . ""
As riders were left behind by the group I would overtake them , and some of them were telling me Armstrong was not looking good , that he was not OK , "" he recalls .
All team cars on the Tour are fitted with miniature televisions : Pevenage could hear the French commentators saying the same thing : "" Armstrong en difficulté "" .
Armstrong in trouble .
A little grimace on Armstrong 's usually expressionless face , a little shake in his shoulders in the blue jersey , the fact that he was not riding right at the front : it all indicated that the man who had won the Tour for the previous two years by flying up the mountains was struggling .
A commentator on a motorbike dropped back to ask the Texan 's team manager Johan Bruyneel what was going on .
With carefully chosen words , Bruyneel stirred the waters : "" I do n't know if he 's good or bad .
I can see the picture like you , and it does n't say anything good to me . ""
Every time Pevenage saw the group as they went round a hairpin he could see the recovered cancer sufferer just ahead , hanging on to the back of the group with his Spanish team - mates in US Postal , Roberto Heras and Jose Luis Rubiera .
He looked like a man clinging on for dear life .
One or two of Armstrong 's fellow competitors gave him little pushes of encouragement .
What was wrong with the favourite ?
No one knew .
But Ullrich - at the head of the leading group - and Pevenage had to find out , so the manager spoke by radio to his team 's strongest mountain climbers , the American Kevin Livingston and the Italian Giuseppe Guerini .
Through the little earpieces linked to minute receivers in their jersey pockets , he told them to make the hottest pace they could .
If Armstrong was struggling he would be left behind .
If they did not try they would never find out .
Pevenage knew the attempt to burn Armstrong off might prove to be a lost cause .
"" I did n't believe this cinema , "" he recalls .
"" I knew he [ Armstrong ] was joking ; Jan knew it also .
He was pretending , and I said so to Jan.
Our riders made the tempo because Janni asked me .
What else could we do ? ""
Rubiera , the Texan 's domestique , was also puzzled . ""
Heras and I were with Lance .
We wanted to go to the front , but he told us to keep calm , that everything was fine .
I was amazed by how cold and detached he could be . ""
The first mountain stage in any Tour de France is a key moment .
The opening 10 days or so of racing on the flat are a phoney , if strength - sapping , war ; the favourites bide their time , knowing the race will take shape only when they reach the Alps or the Pyrenees .
The first mountains invariably weed out the weak , setting the pattern for the rest of the race .
Thus Armstrong 's beleaguered appearance seemed to confirm the widespread impression that , on this Tour , the American was not having things all his own way .
During the team time - trial stage two of his team - mates had crashed and his key climbing assistant Christian van de Velde had pulled out .
On the mountain pass before the Glandon , the Col de la Madeleine , all his team apart from Heras and Rubiera had been unable to hold the pace .
If the Texan really was having a bad day he would have little support .
This background doubled the impact in the Texan 's knockout punch , delivered with clinical precision 40 minutes later at the foot of the day 's third and final mountain : l'Alpe d'Huez .
As the race reached the chalets of Bourg d'Oisans , in the valley 3,000 feet below the ski resort , Pevenage 's fears were realised : Armstrong had been acting . ""
He was at the back of the group on the Glandon , but I could see he was OK when we got to the bottom of Alpe d'Huez because he had moved to the front .
If he had been bad he would still have been at the back .
Rubiera and Heras were with him and I knew what they would do .
I said to Jan : ' Watch out .
Armstrong will attack twice ; first to see whether you react , the second time 100 % . '
"" There is no gentle run - in to l'Alpe d'Huez : from the valley floor the road suddenly rears up the mountainside in 1-in-9 ramps between the hairpin bends cut into the cliff - face .
For the first time that day , Armstrong took the initiative . ""
Lance told me to drive like hell , "" says Rubiera .
It was a classic tactic : the team - mate sets the initial pace , then the leader deals with those who are left .
With Armstrong at his shoulder the little Spaniard pushed hard , and within a few seconds only Ullrich and the Kazakh Andrei Kivilev were clinging on .
Then came Armstrong 's attack .
In British cycling slang it was a "" double shuffle "" - an acceleration ,
a look back to check the opposition , then the coup de grace .
The Texan stamped on the pedals , glanced back at Ullrich , saw him floundering , and stamped again - harder .
With his face set , he disappeared up the mountain .
Eight miles of climbing later , Ullrich was two minutes behind .
After the stage , Armstrong admitted he had been playing mind games .
"" Everyone can see everything , because of the television cameras .
Sometimes you have to go along with that .
I played poker with Telekom , and I won . ""
The Tour was as good as over .
No one had expected Armstrong to perform this well . ""
Jan was convinced he was OK , perhaps he thought he would lose 30 seconds , never two minutes , "" says Pevenage .
Ullrich and Telekom 's hopes were shattered .
"" We could n't believe what we saw , "" says the team 's oldest domestique , Udo Bölts .
"" When we saw the way he attacked , we all lost morale .
The team directors tried to hold up our motivation , but when you saw how easy it was for him you had to be realistic .
To have a little chance we needed Armstrong to have a bad day , but he never looked like it . ""
With three Tour wins in a row under his belt Armstrong now has an impregnable aura .
Bölts insists , "" Winning the Tour next year is not done and dusted for him , "" but his manager , Pevenage , feels the opposite : "" If next year Armstrong is stronger than this year , I do n't know who can beat him or how we could do it .
We 've tried everything .
If you know the answer , please tell me .
"" What happened next ...
Lance Armstrong went on to win the Tour , joining the select group of cyclists who have won the race three times and the even more select bunch - Louison Bobet , Jacques Anquetil , Eddy Merckx and Miguel Indurain - who have won a hat - trick .
Udo Bölts , who rode against both men , maintains that Armstrong is not as impregnable as Indurain . ""
It seemed as if Indurain could win six or seven Tours , he looked untouchable .
Armstrong will start as favourite in the next two but it will be hard for him to win five .
Indurain seemed like he was on another planet , and Armstrong seems that way too , but a lot of riders are hungry to beat him ; in Indurain 's time nobody could take him on . ""
With his wife Kristin expecting twins , Armstrong rode his last race of the year in early September .
His third Tour victory merely cemented his status as all - American hero .
In the United States his defeat of testicular cancer has always been seen as uniquely life - affirming , something confirmed after the September 11 disaster when the American Red Cross invited him to visit Ground Zero to raise morale .
During his 36 hours there he met volunteers and firemen , addressed rescue workers to a standing ovation and at one station , Bowery 33 , actually raced two firemen on their old bikes .
The autumn held other significant events : five years after Armstrong was diagnosed with cancer he was declared completely clear of the condition and on November 21 his wife gave birth by Caesarean section to daughters Isabelle and Grace .
Like their son Luke the twins were conceived from sperm which Armstrong donated before his illness .
There remain two shadows over the Texan .
A judicial inquiry in France into alleged use of banned substances by his team continues and should be concluded by March .
The trainer Michele Ferrari , with whom Armstrong has been associated , went on trial last week for allegedly providing drugs to top cyclists , not including Armstrong ."
2002-02-11,"It has long been known that one of the biggest problems facing women 's football in this country is the fact that no one , interested parties aside , can name any of the players .
Outside Mia Hamm , who was last year named as the US 's fifth most marketable athlete ( after Michael Jordan , Tiger Woods , Lance Armstrong and Anna Kournikova ) and Brandi Chastain ( for the shirt - removing incident ) , few players in the world , let alone this country , come close to celebrity status over here .
Months ago the Football Association declared its intention to select a handful of players with an elusive combination of talent and attractiveness - Rachel Yankey , Sue Smith and Katie Chapman being among the favourites - to promote the game .
But while everyone waits for their official unveiling , Fulham , ever at the forefront of such matters , have come up with their own solution .
The club has appointed Kirsty Gallacher , of Sky Sports fame and , according to a poll by her employers ' website , the "" soccer siren "" men would most like to take on a Valentine 's date , as honorary president .
It is hoped Gallacher , a regular at Craven Cottage , less so at Woking where the women play , will fulfil the sport 's "" strong need for personalities "" .
More than one voice within the game has been heard to pray for the emergence of "" a David Beckham "" of women 's football .
But while Gallacher has the ambiguous task of being "" just like a figurehead "" , the precarious position of the England women 's captain is hardly helping matters .
It emerged this week that Tara Proctor , who has agreed to sign for Brighton , can not now do so until next season .
FA rules protecting non - league clubs from the poaching of players meant she could not have made her debut until March 17 , well after the transfer deadline .
So when England meet Portugal in a World Cup qualifier later this month , the national captain will not have played in more than two months .
Yesterday , however , Proctor 's club - in - waiting beat a managerless Sunderland ( he had to work )
1 - 0 .
In the first FA Cup quarter - final , Fulham saw off Everton 4 - 0 while in the fifth round Oldham knocked out Southampton 2 - 1 ,
Tranmere dispensed of Wolves 4 - 1 and Doncaster Belles ground out a 1 - 0 win in Barry , where two of the games most recognisable names - Gemma and Carly Hunt , aka "" the Rottweilers "" - made their debuts for Doncaster .
Hunt , said her manager with relish , put in some "" grrrreat tackles "" ."
2002-02-27,"The basics
It 's the same every year : we catch a few hours of the Tour de France on TV and all of a sudden we think we 're Lance Armstrong .
Off we go ( in the car , no doubt ) to the nearest bike shop with the intention of making a life - changing purchase that will help us get fit and beat the traffic at the same time .
But a few weeks later the bike has joined its cousin , the exercise bike , behind cardboard boxes in the garage .
The lesson is clear : do n't buy a bike on a whim .
Spend some time researching what you need , and you might end up actually testing those shiny new mudguards .
The range available to you is enormous .
Gone are the days when your choice was limited to a boneshaker with a shopping basket or a five - gear road racer with go - faster stripes .
The evolution of bicycles over the past few decades has seen us embrace all manner of contraptions - from Choppers to BMXs and mountain bikes .
But the good news for the consumer is that , after years of technological experimentation , the bicycle market is more mature and offers plenty of value for money .
What do you want to use your bike for ?
Do you just want it for the occasional Sunday afternoon pootle by the canal ?
Have you had it with public transport and decided to beat the traffic with pedal power ?
Are you looking to use a bike for exercise ?
Are you planning a cycling holiday ?
In answering these questions , you will largely determine what type of bike you should buy - from the frame , handlebars and saddle to the wheels , tyres and gears .
Most bike shops will offer you the following types : Road bikes : The classic bicycle design with drop handlebars and narrow tyres .
Mountain bikes : The popular choice due to their comfortable handling , upright seating , strength and versatility .
About 70 % of all bicycle sales are now mountain bikes , even though the highest climb most of them will see is on to the kerb .
Hybrids : As their name suggests , these are a cross between road bikes and mountain bikes .
They have narrower tyres and are sleeker than mountain bikes , and are thus ideal for commuting .
Comfort bikes : The best choice for the weekend leisure rider due to their softer saddles , lower gearing and more upright riding position .
Kids ' bikes : Many are just smaller versions of adult bikes , but most shops offer one - gear bikes for the younger child .
Niche bikes :
Everyone knows about tandems , but "" recumbents "" are gaining popularity .
These are the bikes that allow the rider to pedal in a low , reclining position .
They boast better comfort for long - distance riding because they reduce the pressure on your bum and your back .
Making your purchase When you head off to buy a bike , look for a dedicated bike shop rather than a shop that offers only half a dozen or so models , such as a supermarket , because the quality of service and knowledge of the staff will be much higher .
You should especially look out for shops that are members of the Association of Cycle Traders ( ACT ) , and staff who are CyTech accredited - a national level of competence for mechanics accepted by all the major cycling organisations in the UK .
Bike shops also offer the best post - sales service and will usually give your bike a free tune - up a few months after you have bought it to make sure it is still set up correctly .
Buying by phone or the internet should only be considered when you have already worked out the exact model and specification you need , and have tried it out beforehand .
The best time to find bargains is usually in the autumn , when shops are looking to make room for next year 's new stock and the summer rush for bikes has slowed .
January and February are also a good time .
Try to buy everything you need together .
There are a few essential accessories - especially a helmet - that you will need and it 's best to buy them at the same time as you get the bike
so you can try to strike a better price .
Road - testing a bicycle
Once you have spoken to bike shop staff about which type is right for your needs , try a few out by taking them out for a spin .
Make sure that you familiarise yourself with the bike 's specifications beforehand
so you know exactly what you are testing and comparing .
Begin by taking each bike out on the road for five minutes or so .
( You may have to leave something such as a driving licence as security . )
Really put it through its paces : ride up a hill using the full range of gears to see if they shift smoothly ; brake hard to test how responsive the brakes are ; make lots of sharp turns ; and consider how comfortable the saddle is .
Back at the shop , test for any "" wheel wobble "" by looking at the rim 's proximity to the brake pads while the wheel is moving .
If there are wobbles it means the wheel is out of true and needs to be fixed .
The brake pads should also be exactly parallel to the wheel 's rim .
If they are not , the brakes will wear down unevenly .
All the bike 's "" bearings "" - the wheel hubs , the handlebar stem and the pedals - should not be too loose or too stiff .
And check to see whether the brake cable wires are finished tidily with metal caps .
Finding the right size The best way to check whether a bike is the right size for you is to straddle the crossbar ( if it 's a man 's bike ) while wearing the shoes you are likely to be riding in and to measure the distance between your crotch and the crossbar .
For a mountain bike , the distance should be about 10 cm ( 4 in ) .
For a road racer , the distance should be about 5 cm ( 2 in ) .
For a woman 's bike , which will typically have a frame without a crossbar , carry out the same test , gauging where a crossbar would be .
As well as height , you need to check the bike 's reach - the distance of the handlebars from the saddle .
You will have your own idea of what a comfortable distance is , but a quick test is to see if you can see the front wheel 's hub over the handlebars .
If you can , the reach may be too small for you .
You also want your elbows to be slightly bent , but do n't forget that the handlebar and saddle heights can be adjusted .
Ask a sales assistant to alter them if you think it will help .
1 :
Frames When considering which frame to opt for , your decision will largely be dictated by its construction material .
There are four realistic options : steel , aluminium , titanium and graphite .
Look for the frame 's "" decal "" , which will tell you what brand , type and standard of material has been used .
You will find this on the tube under the saddle or on the down tube beneath .
Steel , the traditional material for frames , is durable and strong , but the fact that it is heavy and vulnerable to rust means that it tends to be used only on entry - level bikes nowadays .
However , steel is popular for forks ( the long brackets that attach the wheels to the frame ) because of its strength and because it absorbs shock well .
And there are some high - quality steel alloys .
Chrome - molybdenum - usually referred to as "" chromoly "" or "" chrome - moly "" - is perhaps the best known .
Aluminium is now the most popular material for frames .
Since the 1980s , when manufacturers developed ways to make viable aluminium - alloy tubing for bikes , it has been favoured for its lightness , strength and shock absorbency .
Pure aluminium is not strong enough to use for bikes , and you should look out for which alloy is being offered - two of the most popular are 6061 and 7005 .
These numbers indicate the levels of magnesium , silicon and zinc in the alloy , but all you need to know is that most manufacturers believe 6061 to be superior because it is easy to manipulate under heat .
Titanium , or "" ti "" , is the most expensive frame material available .
It has many of the advantages of aluminium and many experienced riders rate its perceived springiness and superior handling .
The two most common types are 3Al/2.5V and 6Al/4V , the names indicating the blend of the alloy : 6Al/4V is perceived to be the best alloy because it is harder and lighter , but both grades are extremely good materials for a frame .
Graphite - or carbon - frames are unique because they are not made of metal ; instead , a fabric is impregnated with resin and shaped .
Graphite allows radical new designs , and , like steel , is popular for forks .
It is also expensive .
2 :
Wheels and tyres
The weight of the wheels should be considered just as much as the weight of the frame .
The "" wheel feel "" alters dramatically according to weight because it is a rotating object .
A difference of a few grams in a wheel will noticeably alter the bike 's handling , acceleration and ease of climbing .
Obviously , the construction material of the wheel will affect its weight - again , aluminium is very popular - but the performance of the wheel is also affected by the number of spokes and the type of rim .
Wheels traditionally have 32 spokes , but some modern bikes have reduced this number to reduce aerodynamic drag .
This is only worth it if you are really serious about your cycling and plan to add the odd yellow jersey to your wardrobe .
You have two choices when it comes to rims - the strip of metal around the outside of the spokes .
Box - section rims are square - shaped and offer better comfort for leisure riders .
Speed freaks should opt for aero - section rims , which are triangular in shape .
They offer a harder ride than box - section rims , but are more aerodynamic .
Tyre sizes are largely determined by the weight of the rider and the required use of the bike .
Most racer tyres meet the European standard 700c , having an outside diameter of 700 mm .
Sizes are then categorised by the tyre 's width : 700x20 : Ideal for professional cyclists , speedsters and light riders .
700x23 :
Good for most conditions , but best for racing and training .
700x25 :
Good for shock absorption and long - lasting .
700x28 :
Tough , and therefore ideal for commuting , touring and heavy riders .
You may want to consider Kevlar - belted tyres if you are going to use your bike in town .
These have a layer of Kevlar - a strong , light , synthetic fibre - under the tread surface to cut the risk of a puncture , but they are more expensive .
Do n't confuse them with Kevlar - beaded tyres - used by competitive cyclists to save the minimal weight of steel beads ( the hoops at either side of the tyre ) .
Most tyres will last between 1,000 and 2,000 miles depending on your weight and riding style , and whether they are used on the front or back wheel .
3 :
Gears
The more the merrier is the popular perception , but you need to ask yourself ( and the sales assistant ) whether you really need the 30 gears commonly offered on bikes today .
After all , you will be paying for them .
Most leisure riders would be more than happy with 20 , but if you anticipate plenty of climbs ahead of you , more gears are certainly an advantage .
You can work out the number of gears on a bike by multiplying the number of chainrings ( the sprockets near the pedals ) to the number of cassette cogs ( the sprockets on the rear wheel ) .
What else do I need to know ?
Kids ' bikes Never be tempted to buy a bike that a child will grow into .
Children are much more likely to have accidents if they are struggling to handle an oversized bike .
And do n't give a child under 10 a bike with more than one gear .
Check the number of spokes , too .
Most children 's bikes have 28 spokes , but cheaper models may have around 20 , which will offer less strength .
Pedals must offer good grip , so avoid the slippery plastic versions .
Metal pedals are better , but not ones with sharp metal teeth .
Insurance Bicycle theft is a huge problem , particularly in urban areas .
Your best defence is to buy insurance that offers worldwide new - for - old and public - liability cover , no - claims bonuses and personal accident cover .
Members of the Cyclists ' Touring Club ( see below for contact details ) are insured for free .
It costs £ 27 to join , or £ 10 for those under 26 .
In addition to the comprehensive insurance cover , you will receive a magazine , advice on cycling routes , discounts at shops and access to their rescue service .
The British Cycling Federation , a more sports - oriented organisation , also offers free insurance to members .
All insurance will be conditional on you recording your bike 's unique frame number , which you should also report to the police if making a crime report .
It 's a good idea to register your frame number with Bike register , too , for added peace of mind .
Ethics watch When Ethical Consumer magazine examined bicycle manufacturers , one point of concern was workers ' rights .
Most imported bikes sold in the UK came from Taiwan , which has attracted criticism on labour rights and environmental protection issues .
Taiwanese companies also commonly subcontract manufacture to even lower - wage economies in the region .
One of the cycle brands attracting most attention was Land Rover - licenced from the Ford Motor Co. Ford has been criticised for lobbying for more road - building and for promoting even greater trade with China , a country still criticised for its human rights record .
The magazine 's advice was to choose locally - made products .
Overall best buys were Pashley , Dawes and Brompton brands labelled as manufactured in the UK .
Sterling Resources ( Universal Bikes ) also scored well on workers ' rights .
All bicycles were , of course , best buys for environmental impact reasons .
For more information visit Ethical Consumer or call 0161 226 2929 .
Only for the brave Many bikes are stolen solely to be sold , so if you are tempted to buy a bike second - hand at a market or through the classifieds , ask the seller if they can provide the receipt for the bike and its frame number .
Police auctions are another way of buying cheap bikes .
Retrieved stolen bikes whose owners fail to claim them are auctioned off to the public .
Check with your local police force or at Auction net for auctions in your area .
Expert view Richard Hallett , the technical editor of Cycling Weekly magazine ( 020 - 8774 0811 ) gives the following advice : · Mountain bikes are highly versatile , so one of these or the more road - oriented hybrid bikes makes a good starting point .
But forget full suspension unless you fancy some serious off - road adventure .
· Look for rigid forks if a cycle path is the most demanding surface you will tackle . · For road use , get your dealer to replace knobbly mountain - bike tyres with fat , slick "" city "" tyres , which roll more easily . · Drop - handlebar - equipped road bikes are faster and more efficient , but require careful handling on poorly maintained roads .
They also need more careful setting - up for a comfortable riding position .
Look for a dealer with access to Bio Racer , or a similar positioning system , to make the process easier . ·
Do n't forget mudguards - a common mistake .
They are virtually essential for the regular cycle commuter .

2002-03-31,"The Escape Artist Matt Seaton Fourth Estate £ 14.99 , pp182 Cycling has come a long way since Philip Larkin entered a country church back in 1955 and took off his famous cycleclips ' in awkward reverence ' .
The supermen of latterday road - racing - Lance Armstrong , Miguel Indurain - have drawn a public who marvel at their endurance .
Cycling has proved to be telegenic , too .
The agony of time - trialling , the drama of pursuit racing and the ardour and arduousness of the Tour de France have given cycling a lactic chic of its own .
Right from owning his first bike , Matt Seaton was never in any doubt that cycling was cool .
But it was n't until what he calls the ' soft implosion ' of the British Communist Party in the late 1980s left him organisationally homeless that Seatonstarted to take cycling and cycle - racing seriously .
By this time , he was married to the journalist Ruth Picardie .
For Seaton , cycling neatly replaced institutional Marxism by offering him another form of group belonging .
Out racing with dozens of other riders , Seaton felt ' an anonymous part of something much larger , like a swarm of angry bees or a shoal of silver , darting fish ' .
Cycling provided Seaton with a community .
But it also provided him with a way to distinguish himself , because cycle - racing involves , as he puts it , ' a strange blend of co - operation and competition ' .
In order to make the solo break for the winning line in a race - to be ' the escape artist ' - you 've got to spend most of the race working with the other riders , preventing any one rider getting away .
It 's all , to put it another way , about camouflaging individualism as socialism until the last minute .
From the start , he bought enthusiastically into cycling 's economy of pain ; he learnt a new vocabulary for self - induced physical suffering - oxygen debt , lactic build - up , adrenaline swoon , hitting the wall , feeling the burn .
The pain soon became narcotic , as it does , and Seaton became an addict ; up at dawn to squeeze in a two - hour ride before work and skipping off every weekend to race .
So far , so familiar : the sports - junky confessional is now a tired , though not an exhausted , genre .
What makes Seaton 's book different , what makes it , in fact , thoroughly tragic and almost brilliant , is that in 1996 a new and unasked - for pain entered his life .
Ruth was diagnosed with breast cancer at the age of 32 , a year after giving birth to twins .
The last third of The Escape Artist is concerned with Seaton 's turning away from cycling : an elaboration of how a world which once had so wholly absorbed him came to seem nugatory .
Ruth 's illness , and her death , became Seaton 's new endurance test .
The pleasures of this book are several .
It is a perceptive essay in sporting anthropology , a keyhole view on to a subculture and an intensely personal study in flight and responsibility .
Seaton is perceptive about the way that metaphors of one part of our lives infect and inflect other spheres of our existence : in the book , ideas of ' escape ' , ' trust ' and ' breakdown ' escape the world of cycling to become images and lessons for life .
Throughout , his writing is careful and unostentatious .
There are some beautifully physical descriptions of the act of cycling and he superbly recaptures his early zealotry for the Zen of bicycle maintenance .
Above all , The Escape Artist is an achingly sad account of what Seaton now refers to as ' my former life ' ."
2002-04-01,"Lance Armstrong continued to show ominous signs of form over the weekend , but with his major Tour de France rivals injured it could be that his most fearsome adversary this summer will be the French inland revenue service .
Armstrong finished a close second behind the Spaniard Alberto Martinez in the final standings , by a single second , of the two - day three - stage Criterium International .
It was a useful result , but came after another episode in Armstrong 's long and bitter feud with the country that has crowned him the greatest cyclist of the moment .
In an interview with the website cyclingnews.com this week , Armstrong said the French authorities are trying to make him pay tax on winnings of some £ 250,000 from his first Tour de France victory in 1999 .
This is completely unprecedented , as tradition demands that a Tour winner receives none of his prize money : it is always divided between his team - mates and staff .
Armstrong claimed his first win in the Tour proved how wrong French teams were to reject him when he had cancer ; his second win proved the press were wrong to claim his first win was a fluke ; and last year he was out to prove his bona fides after a police drug investigation , which now looks to have stalled .
The tax man 's claim is merely the latest part of a French campaign against him , he says .
"" They ca n't find drugs in his urine , so he must be a tax cheater , so the tax authorities have now decided to send me a tax bill for the 1999 Tour de France prize money , the whole thing .
It 's like $ 400,000 .
They 've sent me the bill , the full bill , as if that cheque was written to me . ""
They know damn well STF [ Societé du Tour de France ] wrote the cheque to the US cycling federation , who wrote us a cheque , to the team , and it was disbursed to the team members .
I did n't take a dime , but I 'm liable for the entire tax penalty .
And they know that
and they 're going to do it for 2000 and 2001 .
Right now it 's at the point where we 're showing them the documentation that I did n't receive a red cent and hopefully that 's enough . ""
Armstrong is , however , in pole position for his fourth Tour already , with the runner - up Jan Ullrich out of action until the end of the month and the third finisher Joseba Beloki also injured .
The hex has also hit the Italian climber Gilberto Simoni , winner of the Giro d'Italia last year and expected to challenge Armstrong in the Tour ; he crashed during the week and has a hairline fracture in his thigh that will put him out for two weeks .

2002-05-08,"Jan Ullrich yesterday withdrew from this year 's Tour de France , which starts in just over two months , due to a persistent knee injury .
It will deprive Lance Armstrong of his principal adversary , making the Texan 's bid this July to win the race for the fourth year running that much easier .
The German was runner up to Armstrong in 2000 and 2001 , and last year he and his Deutsche Telekom team were the only meaningful opposition to the American .
The absence of Ullrich , who won the 1997 race and finished second in 1996 and 1998 , will mean that Armstrong will be the only former winner to start this year 's race , unless the 1998 victor Marco Pantani miraculously finds form and earns a last - minute entry .
Ullrich 's withdrawal is no surprise .
When he announced in March that inflammation of muscle and bone in his right knee would cause him to forego racing until mid - May , that left little time to find the form to compete with Armstrong .
"" We 've taken the decision so that he [ Ullrich ] can have peace of mind about the situation , "" said a Deutsche Telekom 's spokesman .
This reflected concerns over Ullrich 's ability to deal with the pressure of the tight deadline for his recovery , aroused last week when he was involved in a minor late - night accident in Fribourg while driving his Porsche 911 after drinking several glasses of wine .
He failed to report the accident and had his licence confiscated ."
2002-05-27,"With six weeks to the start of his bid for a fourth successive Tour de France , Lance Armstrong already looks in commanding form .
Yesterday he completed his first win of the season , the difficult Midi Libre stage race in Southern France , finishing fourth in the final stage won by the Frenchman Laurent Paumier , despite misjudging a bend on a descent .
More ominously , however , his competitive fire is already burning strongly .
Armstrong finished second in Friday 's time - trial stage at Rodez , and third in Saturday 's tough hill - top finish in the town of Sète and neither result pleased him .
"" I lay awake all night thinking about finishing second on Friday , I was so disappointed not to have won .
For the last two months I 've felt in good form in lots of races without winning a single one .
Now the Tour is coming near I want to win , I need to win . ""
The weather has prevented the Texan from carrying out the inspections of the Tour 's mountain stages which he had planned for recent weeks , but otherwise he has enjoyed a trouble - free spring .
He said over the weekend : "" I 've never been as thin at this time of year .
My weight , 74 kilos [ 11st 6 lb ] , is exactly what it would be at the start of the Tour . ""
As Armstrong celebrated , his former lieutenant Tyler Hamilton staked his claim to a podium place in the Tour of Italy , with his first win since leaving the US Postal Service team at the end of last year for the Danish CSC - Tiscali squad .
The New Englander 's victory in the 19-mile time trial at Numana on Italy 's east coast left the 2000 world time - trial champion , Sergei Honchar of the Ukraine , 31 seconds behind and moved him to third overall behind the race leader , Germany 's Jens Heppner .
Second overall , with a week remaining , is the young Australian Cadel Evans , the double world mountain bike champion , who is in his first season as a professional .
Evans 's emergence is the only pleasant revelation of an event where drug scandals , rather than racing , have made all the headlines ."
2002-07-05,"A little slip of Lance Armstrong 's tongue in his press conference on Thursday sums up the state of affairs as the Texan launches his campaign for a fourth successive Tour de France win here today .
Asked to discuss his potential rivals , he referred to the duo in the Spanish Kelme squad , the grizzled Colombian time - trial specialist Santiago Botero and the baby - faced climber Oscar Sevilla , as "" Botilla "" .
Welding the two together might be Armstrong 's best chance of finding a rival able to offer a decent fight in the next three weeks .
Following the withdrawal of the German Jan Ullrich due to a knee injury , and the banning of the Italian climber Gilberto Simoni after two positive tests for cocaine , none of the other 188 who come under starter 's orders today merits more than an outsider 's tag against the man who beat cancer .
Armstrong 's build - up through the spring has been perfect .
With no crashes or illness , it included victories in his two last stage races , the Midi Libre and Dauphiné Libéré .
In the latter he also took the final mountain stage , over the Col du Joux - Plane , but with the air of a man who was keeping plenty in reserve .
His United States Postal Service team domestique Floyd Landis finished just behind his boss in the Dauphiné , and Armstrong 's chief lieutenant , the Spaniard Roberto Heras , won the Tour of Catalonia last week .
French legal sources have indicated that the investigation into allegations of malpractice by Armstrong 's team staff during the 2000 Tour are to be dropped , because nothing incriminating has been found .
There have been no awkward questions or further revelations about Armstrong 's work with the controversial trainer Michele Ferrari , whose influence , the Texan recently confirmed , extends beyond altitude training and diet to offering advice by mobile phone during mountain stages of the Tour .
Ferrari is currently on trial in Italy on drugs charges unconnected with Armstrong . ""
Qui peut le battre ? ""
asked a headline in yesterday 's edition of L'Equipe about Armstrong .
Who can beat him indeed : every possible on the start list carries a proviso .
The Spaniard Joseba Beloki should be next in line , having finished third in the last two Tours , but he has done so exclusively by following Armstrong .
Sevilla , the runner - up by a whisker in last year 's Tour of Spain , still looks too callow .
The Texan 's right - hand man last year , Tyler Hamilton , finished second in the Giro d'Italia four weeks ago , with a broken shoulder blade , but that effort will have told .
This does not make Armstrong a shoo - in , however .
If he wins his fourth Tour he will join such greats as Miguel Indurain , Eddy Merckx , Jacques Anquetil and Bernard Hinault .
But that quartet all faltered unexpectedly in one Tour or other when they looked impregnable .
The lack of meaningful rivals is not an unalloyed joy . ""
The one thing that could screw him up is the fact that there is no other favourite , so everyone will look to his team to control the race and pulling the breaks back will fall on Postal again and again , "" says Armstrong 's former team - mate Jonathan Vaughters .
Already minds are turning to the post - Armstrong era .
The young Spaniard Iban Mayo will be closely scrutinised , as will Britain 's David Millar , who is adamant that this year , as part of the learning process , he needs to finish the Tour for the second time and go for victory on a couple of stages .
"" I 'm not going to hammer myself just to get in the top 15 overall , "" Millar said .
"" My long - term plan is that I 've got to be up there in the Tour of Spain before going for the Tour .
This year and next year it 's Spain , and then maybe full gas for the Tour . ""
After a low - key start to the year , when he was recovering from glandular fever , Millar said he hoped to be at his best in the final week .
"" I 've got full reserves , I 'm nice and fresh , and either it 'll work or it 'll turn around and bite me on the ass .
I 'll be either flying or dying . """
2002-07-11,""" Drink bubbly , you 'll ride lighter , "" read one roadside sign amid the serried ranks of vines but after yesterday 's team time - trial the only Tour de France favourite with any right to celebrate was Lance Armstrong .
The triple Tour winner pulled ahead of all but two of the opposition , his team avoided any disaster like last year 's crash , and the bad luck that usually accompanies this stage was visited on others .
This stage had been the only chink in Armstrong 's armour in the past two years and a third upset beckoned four miles from the finish when the American 's US Postal Service team were timed 38sec behind the Once squad of Joseba Beloki and Igor Gonzalez de Galdeano , who finished third and fifth last year .
"" We had some difficulty getting in our rhythm and could n't get the right formation , "" said the Olympic champion Viatcheslav Ekimov , one of Armstrong 's team - mates .
But Once faded , handicapped by the loss of one of their strongest riders , Mikel Pradera , with a puncture , which meant that with eight team riders left the fatigue began to tell .
By the finish they were only 16sec ahead of Armstrong 's Postmen , who turned potential disaster into their best - ever result in this stage or its equivalent .
The American outfit were fortunate to be spared any of the mechanical problems , especially punctures , which turn this test of collective strength into a test of team managers ' decision - making .
When one of the nine squad cyclists gets a flat tyre , the dilemma is whether the remaining eight should push on and run the risk of fading , as Once did , or wait and lose 30 - 45sec .
It is a judgment of Solomon , and yesterday the 1996 Tour winner Bjarne Riis , who manages the Danish CSC - Tiscali team , got it wrong .
CSC were already one man short when the Swede Michael Sandstod punctured 12 miles from the finish .
Riis 's team , which includes last year 's king of the mountains Laurent Jalabert and an outsider in the American Tyler Hamilton , had led all the way , but their boss made the worst call possible : he decided to leave Sandstod , then changed his mind , then changed his mind again .
The time was lost and so was the cyclist .
Jalabert , who stood to wear the yellow jersey for the third time in his career
had they won , was understandably spitting blood at the finish .
Instead the maillot jaune now sits on the shoulders of Gonzalez de Galdeano , the first Spaniard to lead the Tour since Miguel Indurain in 1995 .
The 28-year - old Basque finished fifth to Armstrong last year but is unlikely to get ideas above his station : the American is only 7sec behind . ""
The team time - trial does n't decide who wins the Tour , the individual time - trials and the mountains do that , "" the Spaniard said .
"" I 'm happy for the team that we won , but it does n't mean much . ""
Armstrong will barely be worried that he is 4sec behind Beloki or that Hamilton is handily placed , 46sec adrift .
Most important , the Kelme pair of Santiago Botero and Oscar Sevilla lost just over two minutes , which is not insurmountable but could easily be doubled in the next key stage , Monday 's individual time - trial in Brittany .
The pleasant surprise for British fans is the fine form of David Millar .
Two years ago he lost the yellow jersey during the equivalent stage as his Cofidis team went to pieces , and last year he suffered horribly in the team time - trial after his first - stage crash .
Yesterday , however , he was one of Cofidis 's strongest men as they raced coherently to fifth along the Route Touristique du Champagne , and he is now 23rd ,
1min 40sec off the lead .
Today the field heads for Rouen and what should be the fourth bunch sprint in an opening week which would have ideally suited Mario Cipollini , the winner of 12 Tour stages in recent years , who shocked the cycling world by announcing his retirement late on Tuesday night .
It is a bizarre decision : although he is 35 , he was widely expected to continue racing at least until October and the world road - race championship , on a pancake flat course where his speed would have made him the favourite .
The Lion King explained that he was quitting "" because I feel bitter at not being able to ride the Tour and have the chance to win a stage "" , his team having been ruled not good enough , and because his current sponsor , the cosmetic company Acqua e Sapone , "" does not recognise my value "" .
If this is not merely a bluff to force a new contract out of his sponsor it is entirely in keeping with Cipollini 's image as an unpredictable showman , but it is also a bad blow to Italian cycling , which has been rocked by drug scandals in recent years and apparently has now lost its only star with a "" clean "" image ."
2002-07-14,"Until Lance Armstrong was caught up in a crash at the foot of the hill leadinging to the finish here in Avranche , there had been something slightly unreal about his continual good luck as he attempts to win his fourth Tour de France in succession .
Nothing , it seemed , could go wrong for the Texan cancer survivor : his main rivals were eliminated by a variety of misfortunes , his build - up went perfectly and he could hardly have ridden better in the only two stages that counted this week , last Saturday 's prologue time trial and Wednesday 's team time trial .
Yesterday , however , came a reminder that , no matter how seamless it all appears , Armstrong 's fourth Tour win is at the mercy of one of the many crashes that have left much of the peloton bandaged and bruised .
Armstrong had to stop when his team - mate Roberto Heras fell and his handlebars became stuck in Armstrong 's wheel .
Once they had disentangled themselves , Armstrong was quickly back on his way but was always going to lose time because the incident happened two kilometres from the line .
Brad McGee calculated his effort perfectly to give Australia a second stage win in five days .
At the line , Armstrong dropped 26 seconds on rivals such as Joseba Beloki , Igor Gonzalez de Galdeano , who is wearing the leader 's yellow jersey , Spain 's Oscar Sevilla and fellow Americans Levi Leipheimer and Tyler Hamilton .
Given that the Texan 's winning margins in his three Tour wins have been counted in minutes , it may not matter when he gets to the mountains , but it means that he does not look quite as invincible as he did yesterday morning .
It could have been worse .
The Frenchman Christophe Moreau hit the ground in a far more serious crash than Armstrong 's , 10 kilometres out , and could barely make it to the finish .
Another Frenchman , the former national champion Didier Rous , was taken to hospital with a broken bone .
The crashes on Thursday and Friday left two riders , the Italian Marco Pinotti and the Kazakh Alexandr Shefer , with serious facial injuries .
After three pile - ups in two days , Britain 's David Millar somehow avoided trouble on this occasion .
Yesterday 's pile - ups shook the Tour from a state of suspended animation .
The stages have been animated , as French cycling slang has it , by escape after fruitless escape and one rip - roaring bunch sprint after another , but the serious stuff has been suspended since Wednesday 's team time trial and will not begin again until tomorrow , when the 31-mile individual time trial will mark the opening of serious hostilities .
There is also the little matter of Bastille Day to get through today .
For the French , the national holiday and the national institution blend into what in Britain would be called the Wimbledon cocktail : massive expectation , which makes normally efficient athletes choke like amateurs .
Yesterday , like a 110-mile dress rehearsal , the roads were packed with crowds the size of which are usually seen only in Brittany on Bastille Day .
They spilt off the verges in front of rough - stone farmhouses into the roads , packed six and seven deep on every little hill and rise that gave a view back down the road .
Tricolours were waved and the banners hailed the home heroes such as ' Jaja ' ( Laurent Jalabert ) and ' Vivi ' ( Richard Virenque ) .
Rural France seems to have a lot on its mind , not just fireworks and all - night parties : on Friday 's roads there were huge slogans in white paint protesting against a proposed waste dump near the stage finish ; yesterday saw placards complaining about nuclear waste storage , wind farms , factory closures and the imprisonment of the countryside leader José Bové .
The peloton will also have much on its mind today as it heads across Brittany .
Serious crashes such as those of the past three days create a spiral of panic .
The riders become more nervous , so they fight more urgently for position in the bunch , leading to still more pile - ups .
And , after yesterday , they will all be on edge , including Armstrong ."
2002-07-15,"For the first time in four Tours de France , Lance Armstrong showed signs of weakness when he was beaten by Colombian Santiago Botero in the first big time trial of this year 's race today .
Botero humbled the once - invincible American in one hour , two minutes and 18 seconds over 52 kilometres of an individual time trial between Lanester and Lorient , in Brittany .
The Texan , who had won the five long - distance time trials held on the Tour since 1999 , had to be content with second place this time , 11 seconds behind the Kelme team leader .
Not far from the course on which he was crowned time trial world champion two years ago in Plouay , Ukraine 's Serhiy Honchar was third in 1:02:36 .
Spaniard Igor Gonzalez Galdeano was fourth a second behind Honchar to retain his overall leader 's yellow jersey .
The ONCE team rider leads Armstrong by 26 seconds overall , a gap that would not have existed had the U.S Postal leader not lost 27 seconds after getting tangled up with his team mate Roberto Heras during the stage to Avranches two days ago .
But there was nothing Armstrong , who had won the prologue in Luxembourg , could do against Botero on the windswept course along the Breton seafront .
"" I was highly motivated for that time trial , "" said Botero , who was crowned king of the mountains on the Tour two years ago .
"" I was full of confidence , because I felt very powerful on the flat . ""
I have not been 100 percent in the mountains and I 'm going to see how I feel in the first stage in the Pyrenees and then anything can happen , "" he added .
Botero 's victory was not such a big upset as the Colombian had arguably been the best time trial specialist of the season , beating Armstrong in the Dauphine Libere after winning the two stages against the clock in last year 's Tour of Spain .
Botero is also rather untypical for a Colombian as most his compatriots are climbers .
Last year in the first time trial of the Tour , Armstrong had beaten his closest rival , German Jan Ulrich , by a minute but this year 's was a much tighter call , with less than a minute separating the first seven riders .
But Botero and Gonzalez Galdeano , who also beat Armstrong in a time trial this season in the Midi Libre , confirmed they would be the American 's big rivals for the Tour this year .
"" I was a little bit worried about Armstrong 's form and anxious to know whether he would leave the rest of the bunch a minute behind . ""
Now I know the answer , "" said Gonzalez Galdeano .
"" The Tour has changed .
Armstrong is not so strong in time trials as he was last year , but he remains my number one opponent , "" he added .
Armstrong can , however , find some consolation in the fact that he took precious time off mountain specialists like Spaniard Joseba Beloki , who is third overall - 1:23 behind his team mate Gonzalez Galdeano , and Oscar Sevilla , now some five minutes behind the American overall .
Botero moved up to fifth in the overall standings , 1:55 behind Gonzalez Galdeano .
The 182 riders left in the Tour have a rest day on Tuesday ."
2002-07-16,"So much for the shoo - in .
Lance Armstrong was expected to dominate yesterday 's time - trial stage alongside the golden Atlantic beaches with the swagger of a bully kicking down sandcastles .
Instead he neither won the stage nor the maillot jaune , and for a man who has won three Tours in resounding style this was a bitter defeat ,
although by no means a disaster .
After racing into Lorient 11sec behind the Colombian Santiago Botero , Armstrong made all the right noises .
The identity of the stage winner , he said , was "" not a surprise "" .
Botero is indeed a noted time - triallist .
The burly business studies student from Medellin , who looks more British than Colombian , had already got the better of Armstrong in a time - trial during his final pre - Tour warm - up , the Dauphiné Libéré stage race , and was the bronze medallist in last year 's world championship .
Incredibly for a man who has turned self - confidence into a trademark , Armstrong added that he had been "" 100 % sure "" beforehand that the Spaniard Igor Gonzalez de Galdeano would retain the yellow jersey , which he did by finishing fourth on the stage , a mere eight seconds slower than Armstrong .
Like Botero , the quiet Basque has already claimed Armstrong 's scalp this year in another build - up event , the Midi Libre .
But in winning three Tours the Texan had never been defeated in a time - trial of this distance , and whether yesterday marks the start of a gradual decline or is a mere blip en route to the record books remains to be seen .
Galdeano , for one , knows the significance of yesterday : "" Before , Armstrong had always won the first time - trial by a minute or so .
It 's not like that any more .
The Tour has changed .
"" One thing did not change : on a course designed for men who could deliver pure speed , the climbers lost time as expected .
Richard Virenque is 6min 25sec adrift of the yellow jersey .
Oscar Sevilla , runner - up in last year 's Tour of Spain , has 5min 21sec to make up , and last year 's surprise package , the Kazakh Andrei Kivilev , is more than seven minutes behind .
Kivilev is nominally David Millar 's leader at Cofidis , but that may change if the Scot negotiates the Pyrenees with out disaster .
Millar rode the best time - trial of his Tour de France career yesterday for seventh , 50sec behind Botero , and he now occupies that position in the overall standings as well .
As he intended , he is once again the best young rider in the race .
"" I 'm happy ; I do n't even feel I 'm on my best form
and I 'm close to the top guys , "" he said .
"" Long time - trials are something I 'm still getting used to
but I know I 'm getting stronger
and I was n't afraid to go hard from the beginning .
I just took it head - on and went for it . ""
He is still bruised from his crashes but it is not slowing him down , he says .
How long he remains the best under-26-year - old depends on his climbing form .
"" I do n't know what to expect in the mountains .
I 'm just curious .
"" Far more than Millar 's white jersey will be at stake when the peloton rolls out of Pau on Thursday towards the Pyrenees .
Armstrong had made no secret of the fact that he wanted to be in the yellow jersey by then .
Now , instead of controlling events , he will have to shape them in the mountains as he did in 2000 and 2001 .
Then the Tour did not include an early , long time - trial like yesterday 's , so he had to win the yellow jersey on the opening mountain stage .
The fact that he will not be in yellow tomorrow when the race resumes after today 's transfer day is only partly down to his inability to dominate yesterday 's stage in his accustomed style .
On Saturday he dropped 27sec at the finish in Avranches , but he is now only 26sec behind Galdeano .
Yesterday was the second time in three days that things did not go to plan , and to paraphrase Oscar Wilde , once looks like misfortune , twice looks a little careless .
Make that three and the Texan will begin to look vulnerable .
Overall standings : 1 Igor Gonzalez de Galdeano ( Spain )

2002-07-18,"Defending champion Lance Armstrong regained the yellow jersey then praised his team for leading him to victory in the first mountain stage of this year 's Tour de France .
Armstrong finished seven seconds ahead of Spain 's Joseba Beloki over the 158 kilometres from Pau to La Mongie , while his U.S. Postal Service teammate Roberto Heras finished third .
The result means that Armstrong takes the overall lead for the first time since the prologue in Luxembourg .
Armstrong 's win was the result of a collective effort that saw teammates George Hincapie of America and Spaniards Jose Luis Rubiera and Heras
take turns to lead the main group .
Between them , they saw off every rival except ONCE team leader Beloki .
The three - time champion thanked his colleagues after the race .
He said : "" I 'm very satisfied .
I dedicate this victory to my team , and to Robert Heras , who was incredible .
For me , Roberto is the stage winner "" Last year 's king of the mountains , Laurent Jalabert , headed the race for 120 kilometres , with the lead stretching to three minutes 55 seconds at one stage .
But he began to lose time in the climb to La Mongie as former Tour of Spain winner Heras led Armstrong and Beloki in a break from yellow jersey - holder Igor Gonzalez Galdeano of Spain and the other big names .
The trio passed the CSC - Tiscali team leader three kilometres from the finish and the Texan surged in the last 200 metres to see off Beloki .
The Spaniard has finished third in the last two tours and now looks like Armstrong 's only rival this year .
Jalabert , who has just announced his imminent retirement from the sport , may have the consolation of taking the best climber 's polka dot jersey with the points won in reaching the Aubisque summit in the lead .
Armstrong 's 13th
stage victory gives him an overall lead over Beloki of one minute 12 seconds with Galdeano third , 1:48 behind .
Friday 's 11th stage covers 199.5 kms from Lannemezan to the Plateau de Beille for another high altitude finish ."
2002-07-18,"Every year at a given point on the Tour de France an old saw is trotted out : "" Today the real Tour begins .
"" This year the "" real Tour "" had a false start in Monday 's time - trial stage in Brittany , where Lance Armstrong failed to win .
Today the 181 riders left in the race can "" begin the real Tour "" again .
Yesterday Armstrong had the grace to look embarrassed when asked where he will attack the Basque in the yellow jersey , Igor Gonzalez de Galdeano , and the rest of the very short list of men who might get in the way of his fourth Tour win : Galdeano 's team - mate Joseba Beloki , the winner of Monday 's time - trial Santiago Botero , the Lithuanian surprise packet Raimondas Rumsas , and Armstrong 's former team - mate Tyler Hamilton .
The Texan mumbled that it depends on many things : the form , the roads , the other riders or perhaps the state of the Dow Jones .
At some point today , however , his attack will come , either on the dramatic rock circus that is the Col d'Aubisque , the first mountain climbed by the Tour riders in 1910 , or in the concrete tunnels leading to the architectural nightmare masquerading as the ski station where the race finishes today .
The forecast is for clear skies but Galdeano is under something more like a black cloud or a nasty mist , depending on which side of the mountain you come from .
Yesterday France 's anti - doping body , the Conseil Pour la Lutte Contre le Dopage , the CPLD , opened an inquiry into a run of tests carried out on him since May.
These showed the presence of Salbutamol on enough occasions and in sufficient quantity for them to feel that his reasons for using it need further examination .
Salbutamol , a bronchial dilator , widens the air passages in the lungs and can be a mild stimulant .
The substance is permitted under prescription if an inhaler is used , and there is no limit on the volume .
However , if the CPLD feels that Galdeano 's medical file is not in order , he may be suspended , but only in France .
Galdeano is one of a distinguished group of two - wheeled asthmatics .
The five - time Tour winner Miguel Indurain was "" positive in France "" for Salbutamol in 1994 , and it was also found in the baggage of the Olympic champion Jan Ullrich during the police raids in last year 's Tour of Italy .
The Swiss Alex Zülle is another case .
Cycling 's governing body , the Union Cycliste Internationale , has come down on the rider 's side .
Its head of anti - doping , Leon Schattenberg , said there is no case to answer , as he has the necessary medical documents .
According to Schattenberg , the drug 's inclusion on the banned list is an anachronism , and it will be removed next year .
The Spanish , naturally , see it as a plot to blacken Armstrong 's rival - the whole
Once team rather than merely the rider - and Galdeano 's team manager Manolo Saiz had choice words for the newspaper that broke the story .
If it all sounds arcane , then it is , and compared with the heavy artillery of drug - taking within sport generally - erythropoietin , growth hormone , insulin - Salbutamol is bows and arrows .
However , Salbutamol was found in quantity during last year 's police raids on the Tour of Italy , and the episode contributes to a picture of drug - taking on the borders of legality and within specified limits , involving caffeine and testosterone as well as Salbutamol , which is neither edifying nor ethical .
Between the drug debate , a child 's death and divining Armstrong 's intentions , the Tour headed south yesterday with the keenness of migrating birds .
The speed through the pine woods of the Landes and into the bastides and maize fields of the Pyrenean foothills was intense , making it the third fastest stage in the Tour 's history at an average of just over 30.5 mph .
Muted the mood may have been , but after 10 stages the French finally had some cause for mild celebration with their first victory - from the Breton Patrice Halgand , who leapt away from 11 leaders close to the finish .
It was vindication for him and his team , Jean Delatour , who were not selected amid protests in 2000 and accepted for this Tour only in extremis on the rejection of the Saeco Coffee Machines squad after their leader Gilberto Simoni tested positive twice for cocaine .
Behind Halgand came the youngest rider in the race , the 22-year - old Jerôme Pineau , while the Australian Robbie McEwen pulled on the green jersey of best sprinter after pipping Erik Zabel four minutes later .
The flatlanders have had their half of the race and they enjoyed yesterday as condemned men savour their last meal before the knock on the door .
Nobody , except Armstrong perhaps , knows where the executioner 's blow will fall ."
2002-07-19,"From just behind the finish line here , a cable car transports tourists effortlessly and smoothly 3,000 feet up to the neighbouring summit of Pic du Midi .
Almost as swiftly and seamlessly , Lance Armstrong and his team - mates took control of the race yesterday , as indeed they had to if questions were not to be asked about the triple Tour winner 's form .
For the fourth time in as many Tours , the first mountain stage ended with the Texan in the yellow jersey .
For once it was not a solo effort .
Armstrong owed much to his Spanish team - mate Roberto Heras , the curly - haired , bird - like little climber he hired at vast expense at the end of 2000 .
Last year Heras fell off in the team time - trial and did not perform , but yesterday he made the running after the man who started the day in yellow , Igor Gonzalez de Galdeano , began to feel the pace as the gradient stiffened three miles from the end .
Heras accelerated so hard that the opposition simply melted , just as the topmost winter snowdrifts did in yesterday 's sun .
Only the rider who has finished third to Armstrong in the past two Tours , the impassive Basque Joseba Beloki , could cling on - but when the time came to dislodge him in the final kilometre , Armstrong seemed to have no great difficulty .
So it was that the American duly took the 13th stage win of his career .
It is only a footnote , but that is now more than Miguel Indurain managed .
When the results sheets were handed to him afterwards , Armstrong stared at them intently .
He would have liked what he saw .
Only Beloki remains within reach , 1min 12sec behind , and Galdeano 's loss of 1min 54sec in three miles was enough to suggest that he has shot his bolt .
Monday 's time - trial winner Santiago Botero faded as well , losing 2min 24sec .
The Basque Gonzalez de Galdeano , however , is still talking up his chances and those of his Once team , who now have four men in the top seven overall . ""
Armstrong is not the same as other years , "" he insisted .
""
If he could have attacked he would have , because he always attacks .
He 's more accessible this year than in previous years .
"" We shall see .
Galdeano remains at the eye of a minor storm over his use of the Ventolin inhaler , a medicine which contains the lung - opener Salbutamol .
His level is massively high but as far as the governing body , the Union Cycliste Internationale , is concerned he has a prescription for his asthma and that is that .
The World Anti - Doping Agency thinks differently , however .
Yesterday the chairman of the agency 's European branch , Dr Alain Garnier , said that in his view so much Salbutamol was found in Galdeano 's urine in one recent Tour test that it could not be justified on medical grounds .
Galdeano was found to have a level of 1,360 nanogrammes per millilitre , and Garnier 's view was that "" above 1,000 nanogrammes , Salbutamol is considered an anabolic agent and its use to this extent can not be medically explained . ""
Be that as it may , on these punishing roads in the "" circle of death "" there are constant reminders of Tour history . ""
Forge Christophe "" proclaimed a banner beside a stone barn , once the smithy of the village of Sainte - Marie de Campan , at the foot of yesterday 's eight - mile climb to the finish .
A plaque on the wall commemorates the legendary Tour episode of 1913 when the so - called Old Gaul , Eugène Christophe , spent four hours repairing his broken forks in the forge after running eight miles down the mountain .
Laurent Jalabert 's day was in the best tradition of long labours in vain .
On the offensive from the start , he rode alone over the Tour 's first mountain , the Col d'Aubisque , where shaggy ponies grazed in high meadows amid crystal streams .
After the descent through the great rock circus of the Col du Soulor and the high hayfields , "" Jaja "" had reason to hope for the stage win until Heras took control and he was mercilessly overtaken two miles from the line .
His reward for 75 miles of effort was second place in the King of the Mountains standings and the day 's "" offensiveness "" prize .
David Millar 's defence of the best young rider 's white jersey ended soon after the start of the final climb .
"" I had nothing in my legs , "" he said .
"" It was just one of those days . ""
The Scot dropped from seventh to 27th overall and is now 9min 28sec behind Armstrong .
Assuming he recovers , he will be aiming for stage wins now that the white jersey has gone west .
Today , however , may not be the day , as the stage profile resembles the Needles .
All eyes will be on Armstrong as he tries to consolidate his lead ."
2002-07-20,"There was a glitch in Lance Armstrong 's serene progress towards his fourth Tour de France win yesterday , but it was not something to give his rivals the slightest encouragement .
All that went wrong for Armstrong as he rode to the 14th Tour stage win of his career was that he was unable to offer the victory on the Plateau de Beille to his team - mate Roberto Heras .
Having set up his leader 's winning attack four miles from this sunbaked mountain top , in the same emphatic style in which he had launched Armstrong 's stage win when the race entered the Pyrenees on Thursday , Heras sprang away from the only other rider still in contention , his fellow Spaniard Joseba Beloki , and for a few minutes , as he rode through the corridor of fans waving Basque flags , it seemed as if he might catch up with his boss .
Armstrong did not exactly slow down , but he looked back repeatedly before it became clear that Heras was not going fast enough , and
so on he went , spinning his legs with the rapid cadence which the French press have nicknamed "" the coffee grinder "" .
Yesterday , everyone was again grist to his mill .
The episode merely underlines Armstrong 's dominance in the mountains , which is now of the kind that the Tour has not seen since the days of Eddy Merckx , 30 years ago .
But even Merckx was not able to win the first two mountain stages of the Tour two years running , which the Texan cancer survivor has now done .
Currently , there are no climbers capable of living with him , except perhaps Heras , and Armstrong took the wise precaution of hiring him at the end of 2000 .
Armstrong is at pains to point out that there are nine days to come .
"" It takes one bad day in the mountains and you can lose everything .
If you have a bad day on the Ventoux , for example , when it 's very steep and hot , you can lose a lot of time . ""
The Ventoux is tackled tomorrow , but it is hard to see Beloki , who is now 2min 28sec behind , achieving much without the intervention of fate .
While Armstrong bided his time until the final climb to the Plateau , the rest of yesterday 's six - hour run over a series of little mountain passes in the rustic glory of the Ariège was taken up with Laurent Jalabert and Richard Virenque 's battle for the hearts and minds of the French public .
Thus far , it has been one - way traffic .
Until Jalabert 's surprise announcement on Tuesday that this will be his last Tour , roadside preferences - to judge from the signs waved by the public - were divided .
Jalabert 's imminent departure has struck a sentimental chord , however , and the verges of the Tour 's route have been a forest of placards with one message variously expressed : Do n't go , Laurent .
His 75-mile lone escape in Thursday 's first mountain stage whipped up the affection still further .
Virenque , who is not showing anything like the form which won him five King of the Mountains jerseys , responded yesterday , but Jalabert also had his plans for the stage .
The pair both escaped early in yesterday 's stage , but it was "" Jaja "" who ended up in front .
His plan was to lead over the four mountains before the finish and take the measled vest which Virenque has always seen as his personal property . ""
Jaja en pois "" as one placard put it : "" Jalabert in peas "" , a reference to the maillot à pois , as the red - spotted climber 's jersey is known .
So Jalabert raced away on the first hill , the Col de Mente , with the Swiss Laurent Dufaux and the Spaniard Isidro Nozal , and Virenque was left chasing impotently behind for much of the stage .
On the climb to the finish , Armstrong and company swept past like a TGV passing a local train , but Jaja is now in peas .
In fact , full of beans would be more like it .
This was a day of blinding heat amid the scent of mountain hay and the hillsides covered in bracken .
The fans ripped branches off roadside trees to create impromptu sun shelters but "" the Panda "" , as Jalabert is known , remained impassive behind his mirror sunglasses , his white racing cap pulled tightly down over his forehead .
Behind , the riders made constant visits to their team support cars for drinks and they grabbed bottles off the spectators .
If the heat continues this weekend , there could be many casualties .
The air in these valleys is supposed to have stress - reducing properties , but that did not stop a rare episode of two - wheeled road rage when France 's Christophe Moreau and Jalabert 's Spanish team - mate Carlos Sastre came to blows after bumping into each other in the bunch and spent the next few seconds swapping pushes and punches .
If they avoided falling off , it said more about their cycling skill than their sang - froid .
This was mere playground stuff compared with the day 's killer punch , delivered by Armstrong ."
2002-07-22,"The Tour 's inflatable finish podium , with its screen for sponsors ' logos , can not be transported up to the top of the great Mont Ventoux , so when Lance Armstrong pulled on the yellow jersey yesterday he did so with only the blue Provençal sky behind him .
As it was when he pulled on the yellow jersey here in a freezing gale in 2000 , his Tour is almost won , barring acts of God .
The weather changes ; Armstrong goes on .
The Texan 's only remaining challenger , the Basque Joseba Beloki , finally tried to dislodge him but instead he was brushed aside and could not hold on .
He is still in second place but is now over four minutes behind , and his only remaining hope is that the maillot jaune has an off day .
That has not happened in the last 3 Tours .
As in 2000 , when Marco Pantani beat him , Armstrong was pipped for the stage win here by a climber of dubious reputation .
This time round it was Richard Virenque who won , the fourth mountain - stage victory of his career .
He missed last year 's Tour due to his eight - month ban for using the blood - booster erythropoietin at Festina , but his rehabilitation among the French public will now be complete .
For the last six days "" Rico "" has lost his status as the national heart - throb , and his King of the Mountains jersey , to Laurent Jalabert .
Yesterday , however , Jalabert was understandably a little tired after 270 miles in front of the peloton in one escape or another , so Virenque made his break early in the 137-mile stage from Lodève with 10 other hopefuls .
This reflects another reality in this race : in order to win a mountain stage , a climber needs several minutes ' lead on Armstrong at the foot of the final climb .
Like Pantani two years ago , he was made to suffer horribly for his victory in what was , in essence , a mountain handicap race .
At the foot of the 13 miles of climbing Virenque had seven minutes in hand .
At the finish by the tower , with the whole of Provence laid out below like a map , his lead was just over two minutes , so rapid had Armstrong 's progress been in the final kilometres , once the Texan had disposed of Beloki .
To his credit , the Basque tried to attack , as at one point in the hellishly hot lower slopes through the oakwoods Armstrong 's team were unable to hold the pace , and Beloki used his Portuguese team - mate Jose Azevedo as a decoy .
But it was as impotent an effort as could be imagined : Armstrong sprang past him and set off after Virenque and company , devouring all of the 11 escapees bar the Frenchman and a Russian , Alexandr Botcharov , with the relentlessness of a Pacman computer game .
The Ventoux , as ever , left its mark on all who climbed her .
Thor Hushovd , a vast Norwegian riding with Crédit Agricole and one of the 11 escapees , picked up 100 bottles of Chateauneuf du Pape at the final bonus sprint of the day , so will be able to acquire a headache over the winter to go with his sore legs .
As for his team - mate Anthony Morin , he turned off the road at the foot of the Ventoux and went deep into a vineyard .
Not because he wanted to delay getting to the mountain : he had taken his racing jersey off and got toilet paper from his team car .
Clearly , fear of the "" Bald Mountain "" had struck deep .
Even Armstrong fears this place .
Having donated the win to Pantani in 2000 , he wanted to win yesterday .
Earlier , he had said that winning here would be "" like winning at l'Alpe d'Huez "" - another mythical finish , bypassed this year - "" because these are bits of cycling history "" .
Afterwards , he accepted that the mountain had got the better of him : "" Maybe it 's not for me . ""
But , Terminator - like , he promised : "" We 'll come back , I 'm sure . ""
If personal battles with mountains now preoccupy the cancer survivor , that reflects the fact that none of the men in this race is anywhere near his level .
It is , however , entirely in keeping with the Ventoux 's reputation that it has got the better of him again .
It was called a "" despot of cyclists "" by the philosopher Roland Barthes .
One Tour man , Tom Simpson , died here and another , Jean Malléjac in 1955 , came within an ace of death , a place where careless tourists can be stoned to death by windblown rocks , and where the limestone caves are believed to lead into hell itself .
Atop the Ventoux yesterday , as the waiting crowds roasted gently on the limestone scree slopes like live gannets in an open - air oven , among the songs played on the loudspeakers was "" Walking on the Moon "" .
The Tour 's own moonscape remains out of this particular Armstrong 's reach , but yesterday he took another giant step towards joining cycling 's immortals ."
2002-07-23,"After winning the 15th stage in the ski resort of Les Deux Aples today , Santiago Botero has now beaten Lance Armstrong twice during this year 's Tour de France .
But the Colombian rider has no illusions about where he stands compared with the three - times champion . ""
Lance Armstrong is simply the best cyclist in the world , "" said the Kelme team leader after today 's win . ""
He has incredible mental strength and it is very hard to beat him , "" he said .
But the Colombian did , becoming the first rider to outpace the Texan in the long - distance time trial in Brittany over 55kms a week ago .
And he did it again today , winning the first Tour stage in the Alps and leaving the American six minutes and 41 seconds behind .
Asked which of the two stage victories had made him happier , he said : "" They were both great .
When I won the time trial , we celebrated late into the night and shouted as if Colombia had scored a goal in the World Cup final . ""
But Botero lost too much time in the Pyrenees and later in the Mont Ventoux , in which he conceded 15 minutes to the leaders , to be a threat overall .
"" I had never lost hope of winning a stage despite losing ground in the Ventoux , "" he said .
"" That day I had mechanical problems , I had dehydration , "" he said .
"" After the Ventoux , I was obsessed with winning this stage and when I saw there was a breakaway , I went , "" he added .
"" I was so disappointed about my race two days ago .
You have a bad day and eight months of hard work vanish . ""
But it 's better to win a stage than to be fourth in the final standings , "" added Botero , who now lies seventh overall , 11:31 behind Armstrong .
With three stage wins in the Tour - he had won in Briancon , near Les Deux Alpes , in 2000 - Botero has now joined Lucho Herrera as his country 's most successful rider in the Tour .
But he refused to be compared to the first great Colombian rider .
"" You ca n't make comparisons from one period to the other .
I 'm a very different rider .
Lucho was climber , one of the best ever .
I 'm more of an all - rounder , "" he said ."
2002-07-23,"Always a man in search of new battles to fight , Lance Armstrong appears to have found his enemy in this year 's Tour .
Yesterday , as the race rested in the Vaucluse region , it was still feeling the weight of his unprecedented tirade against fans who catcalled him and accused him of doping during the Mont Ventoux mountain - top finish on Sunday .
"" If I had a dollar for every time somebody yelled ' Dopé , dopé ' I 'd be a rich man , "" said Armstrong .
"" It 's disappointing , to be honest with you .
The people are not very sportsmanlike .
Some of them . . .
a boo is a lot louder than a cheer .
If you have 10 people cheering and one person booing , all you hear is the booing .
"" I do n't particularly understand that mentality .
I think it 's an indication of their intelligence .
But I 'm not here to be friends with a bunch of people who stand on the side of the road that have had too much to drink and want to yell "" Dopé ! ""
I do n't have to care .
Nor will I care in three or four years when I 'm sitting on the beach with my kids , having a cold beer .
But do n't come to the bike race in order to stand around and yell at cyclists .
Stay at home . ""
Armstrong has drawn this kind of attention before .
Last year he was booed at the race start in Dunkirk by fans of the French rider Cédric Vasseur , who was left out of his US Postal Service squad for that Tour .
He is the first Tour rider to bring a professional bodyguard with him , something which did not go down well with the Tour organisers last year .
In 2000 he was asked about his refusal to talk French and said , in typically abrasive style , that the Tour "" was not a beauty contest "" .
The Texan is a man who seems to need new foes every year in order to find motivation in the Tour .
In 1999 he was out to prove a point to French teams who had written him off during his fight against testicular cancer .
In 2000 he had it in for the French press , who accused him of drug - taking , and also managed a war of words with the little Italian Marco Pantani .
Last year 's adversary was a British journalist who investigated his work with the controversial trainer Michele Ferrari .
Armstrong is also sensitive to accusations that he is killing off the race 's suspense , so complete is his dominance .
His answer is : "" I ca n't really concern myself with ' Is it bad for the event , is it bad for the sport ? '
I have to do my job
and I have to fulfil my passion .
That 's normal , I think .
Perhaps that 's part of the reason that people are sometimes so angry on the climbs .
Of course they 're pissed .
They would rather have a new winner every year and a new winner every day , and a constant evolution . ""
Similar claims were made against his great friend Eddy Merckx , the most dominant cyclist ever .
"" The Cannibal "" received death threats and was punched by a fan at a stage finish in 1975 .
He said yesterday : "" It 's a ritual .
People take against whoever 's winning as a matter of course . ""
Today is the hors d'oeuvre in a three - course menu of Alpine stages , a relatively light serving of small passes en route to the ski resort of Les Deux Alpes , just across the valley from the far harder and more celebrated Alpe d'Huez .
The main course , tomorrow , includes three of the Tour 's greatest climbs : the Cols du Galibier and Madeleine , and the finish at La Plagne .
There are still issues to be decided .
Fresh offensives from Laurent Jalabert and Richard Virenque can be expected , in their personal battle for the polka - dot King of the Mountains jersey which this year carries with it the unofficial title of best Frenchman .
The green jersey of best sprinter is currently a tie between the six - times winner Erik Zabel and the Australian Robbie McEwen , but with four days ' heavy or moderate climbing to come it may be that the maillot vert will be undecided until the Champs Elysées on Sunday .
The contest for second and third behind Armstrong remains fluid , with half a dozen contenders led by Joseba Beloki of Spain .
The main issue , however , looks cut and dried , whether the French public like it or not . ·
The International Cycling Union conducted 54 blood tests on riders yesterday and all passed , organisers said ."
2002-07-25,"Amid the continual speculation about what chemical and medical assistance the Tour men need to complete the world 's greatest bike race , it is easy to forget that they rely on other things for support .
Yesterday 's winner , the Dutchman Michael Boogerd , offered a timely reminder of the power superstitions and lucky charms have always played in a sport in which , more than most others , sheer bad luck plays a defining role .
As Boogerd crossed the finish line after achieving a minor miracle in holding off Lance Armstrong in the final kilometres , he kissed a small medallion hanging on a chain around his neck .
It contains his first tooth and that of his girlfriend , and the four - leaf clover that he was carrying when he won his first stage of the Tour at Aix - les - Bains back in 1996 .
It may smack of voodoo , but it works for him .
It is also in the best Tour tradition .
Much of the magic worked by the soigneurs in days of yore was old wives ' lore : bees ' and toads ' venom , and eggs in a glass of port .
The double Tour winner Bernard Thevenet never wore green gloves because he fell off once while wearing a pair .
The climber Luc Leblanc , famed for his religious sensibility , always carried a photo of his dead younger brother in his pocket .
Yesterday 's win was the product of sweat as well as superstition , however .
Boogerd was in the early action over the highest point in this year 's Tour , the great scree slopes leading to the 8,000 ft summit of the Col du Galibier , which only needed bleached bones by the roadside to complete the picture of desolation .
He held on up the more pastoral slopes of the Col de la Madeleine , amid a clinking of cowbells and the smell of wild garlic , but his margin at the foot of the climb to La Plagne was only seven minutes .
When Armstrong decided to add a little to his overall lead by attacking Joseba Beloki and Raimondas Rumsas , who lie second and third , it seemed as if the Texan might overtake him .
Armstrong closed rapidly , but the Dutchman hung on .
The Alps no longer belong to the Dutch as they used to .
L'Alpe d'Huez - nicknamed "" the mountain of the Dutch "" - was traditionally where they pitched camp , but it is 13 years since a Dutchman won the stage there or anywhere to compare with it .
Overall they have only had Boogerd 's fifth place overall in 1998 to boast about in the last 10 Tours , and he says that result damned him to several years fruitlessly seek ing a place in the top three .
This year his Rabobank team have turned to an American , Levi Leipheimer , to be their leader , but he lies a disappointing ninth .
If not quite in the numbers to compare with the great days , the Dutch fans were there on the final climb , however , well oiled on Oranjeboom , dressed in orange wigs or blue soldier suits , brandishing tricolours , playing oompah music , and dancing drunkenly to the rhythm of the man they call "" Boogie "" .
Yesterday all but decided the battle for the red - and - white polka dot jersey awarded to the best mountain climber , as Richard Virenque 's legs failed to rise to the challenge .
He was left behind on all three mountains and is now too far behind Laurent Jalabert to stand much of a chance of equalling the record of six King of the Mountains titles .
Considering his relatively limited ability as a climber , Jaja played a tactical blinder , as he has since the race entered the Pyrenees .
He escaped early on the Galibier with Boogerd , was retrieved after taking third place at the summit , then evaded the peloton again close to the foot of the descent from the "" roof of the Tour "" to take a place in the group chasing the Dutchman .
That ensured him second place at the top of the Madeleine , and his 131-point lead over Virenque should take him to Paris .
Tour followers with an eye for superstition have already noted that he is wearing No51 , the dossard which is held to bring good fortune .
It has helped him to what should be a triumphal swansong .
Armstrong , on the other hand , now has five minutes on Beloki and no apparent need of good luck charms .

2002-07-26,"Glory through suffering has been the Tour 's leitmotif for 99 years , and yesterday 's stage winner , the 24-year - old Norwegian Thor Hushovd , was in the best tradition .
All Tour men have bad days , with the exception of Lance Armstrong , but few have as unpleasant a bad day as Hushovd did 2 weeks ago on the road to Sarrebruck on stage two .
With cramp paralysing his legs , Hushovd had to stop repeatedly so that team helpers could massage him .
He could barely pedal and finished 18 minutes behind the peloton , just within the day 's time cut .
It took him a while to find his legs but he has ridden strongly through the Alps for the past few days and was one of 10 men in yesterday 's day - long escape over the hilly roads between the mountains and the Rhone .
As usual for a group without any contenders for the major overall standings they were given considerable leeway , and three riders had drifted away on the final 50 mph descent to the plains : Hushovd , confirming the promise he showed in 1998 when he was world under-23 time - trial champion ; the Dane Jakob Piil ; and a Frenchman , the 1997 stage winner Christophe Mengin .
The sprint was classic cat and mouse between three slow men , with none willing to commit himself , each waiting for another to make the first move .
Piil launched himself first but went haywire when his shoe detached itself from its pedal .
All the riders use step - in fixings similar to ski bindings which are supposed to prevent this happening , but Piil found himself splayed across his crossbar .
He stayed upright by a miracle but his chances of future fatherhood will not have been enhanced .
Worse still , Hushovd and Mengin hared off for the line , where the Norwegian took , by a whisker , his country 's second stage win in this race after Dag - Otto Lauritzen in 1987 .
A long escape , an unknown winner : this was a classic "" stage of transition "" , designed purely to get the riders from Thursday 's passes to today 's 31-mile contre la montre in the Beaujolais .
It ran through a peculiarly anonymous region , the Ain , as much Swiss in appearance as French with its pine woods , rolling hills and shallow - roofed houses .
In Marlioz , a 100 ft crane had a spectacular if precarious string of bikes swinging from it ; in Copponex two cows were grazing , dressed in yellow and polka - dot jerseys .
As a reminder that the Swiss border was nearby , for most of the day cow bells sounded everywhere .
It is not so much bell - ringing as whistle - blowing which bothers Armstrong , however .
His fourth Tour is in the bag
but he is unwilling to let rest allegations of malpractice in his US Postal Service team , which began with an anonymous denunciation of the squad two years ago which led to a long - standing investigation by a Paris judge , Sophie - Hélène Chateau .
Her inquiries into the discovery of bin bags containing medical waste allegedly dumped by Armstrong 's team assistants have been proceeding with the urgency of a disabled snail and , legal sources have said , will end this summer with a non - lieu , a decision that there is no case to answer .
Yesterday , however , Armstrong said : "" The case has been a joke from the beginning .
Nowhere would have a case been started on those grounds , but in Paris they did .
They knew the evidence was clean .
They can keep [ the case ] open but there is nothing there . ""
Armstrong has already attacked cycling fans who , he said , had yelled "" dopé "" at him , and yesterday again had hard words for those doubting cycling 's probity .
"" I do n't know if our sport will ever be vindicated .
I think it 's a much bigger [ thing ] than me , "" he said .
"" It 's a question of cycling , of endurance sports and of Olympics sports and of professional sports .
It 's an epidemic .
They 're going to question when somebody breaks the 5,000 m record on the track , they 're going to question things in the swimming pool .
The champions , the best and the record - breakers will never be vindicated .
There will always be someone who does not believe it . ""
As a reminder of why some cycling fans and press have turned cynical , yesterday produced another doping case , if not one related to this Tour , when the 2000 Giro d'Italia winner Stefano Garzelli was banned for nine months after testing positive for the diuretic probenecid during this year 's Giro .
He has also been fined 100,000 Swiss francs ( £ 45,000 ) .
Today 's time - trial through the Beaujolais vineyards will offer a final chance to reshuffle the finishing order .
If the top three of Armstrong , Joseba Beloki and Raimondas Rumsas seems set in stone , the rest of the top 10 has ebbed and flowed over this final week , and that could continue today .
The remaining major award , the green jersey of points leader , was a tie between Robbie McEwen and Erik Zabel from Béziers a week ago until yesterday , when McEwen sneaked a point on the German .
It will go down to the last metres on the Champs Elysées tomorrow afternoon ."
2002-07-27,"After Lance Armstrong lost the first long , time - trial stage of this Tour in Brittany 12 days ago , there was speculation that the Texan 's previously untouchable domination of the discipline in the Tour might be in decline .
Yesterday , by crushing the opposition over 30 miles of the 19th stage of the race in the baking heat through the Beaujolais vineyards , the cancer survivor showed that he is as strong as in any of his previous three Tour de France wins . '
It was important to win again today , as everyone said after I lost in Brittany , "" ah , Armstrong 's not so good as before in the time trial , "" even though you ca n't win every time trial all year , ' said the Texan . '
The course was good for me , with a little climb in the vines , and a bit of wind . '
Armstrong remains cautious - ' today 's another race , and a puncture or crash could change everything ' - but barring an act of God today he will ride up the Champs Elysées for the fourth year running in the yellow jersey , after another Tour in which he has barely even been flustered , let alone worried .
There were two minor hiccups along the way - a few seconds lost due to a mechanical problem at Avranches after a week 's racing , the setback in the time trial in Brittany - but otherwise it was serene , if highly energetic , business as usual , with two mountain stage wins in the Pyrenees to take the lead , and a highly efficient defensive operation thereafter .
Yesterday , a sign brandished among the vines as the road climbed away from the start bore the words ' Rumsas le menace ' - Rumsas the threat - and indeed the blond Lithuanian , who has managed third overall his first Tour de France , did manage to threaten Armstrong , at least briefly .
He led by 11sec at the top of the climb with six miles covered , but that was about as good as he got .
Towards the finish , his handlebars came loose , he was unable to hold an aerodynamic position , and his challenge faded .
By the finish , Armstrong was 53sec in front , with the only glitch in his progress to his 15th stage win a near - miss with a spectator wielding a camera .
Briefly , Rumsas also looked as if he might challenge the Basque Joseba Beloki for the runner - up spot behind Armstrong , but that slipped away as well , and Beloki will move one step up on the podium after his third places in 2000 and 2001 .
This was not a course that favoured the brute - force style of the Colombian Santiago Botero , surprise winner ahead of Armstrong in the first long time - trial stage of this Tour between Lanester and Lorient , and he faded to eighth .
A long hill , big enough to be rated third - category in the King of the Mountains prize , reared up from the start , snaking up to almost 2,000 feet above sea level through the Beaujolais vineyards .
The rest of the course was as much a test of bike handling and nerve as of pure speed , with sweeping descents tackled at up to 60 mph .
Britain 's only representative in the race , David Millar , ended his third Tour in fine style with fourth place on the stage , just one minute 14sec behind Armstrong , to go with his fifth place in the first time - trial stage in Brittany , and his road race stage win in Beziers last Saturday .
Millar was the fastest of the early starters at both the intermediate time checks , and he can now be optimistic about his chances for the rest of his season , which will include the Tour of Spain in September , and the world time - trial championship in October . '
It was hard , there was nowhere to hide in that heat , ' he said afterwards . '
I was aiming for the top five , and I think I did a good ride .
I 'm happy with the way that my Tour has gone .
I had a few rough days
but I feel good and fresh now . '
This is the second Tour that Millar has finished , and he has finished it looking fresh , as he did his first in 2000 , which suggests that he may be able to aim for a high overall placing in future years ."

2002-07-29,"Tour de France fans dream of seeing suspense reign for the full three weeks until the final sprint on the Champs Elysées , of a Tour in which two men duel from start to finish with neither gaining the upper hand on the other until the very last yards of the 2,000-mile race .
This was one of those cliff - hanging Tours , but Lance Armstrong was not the man on the edge .
The American was untouchable from the moment he won the first mountain stage in the Pyrenees to his victory in Saturday 's time - trial amid the ranks of vines that line the gently rolling Beaujolais hills .
Moreover , in the final week the polka - dot King of the Mountains jersey always looked destined for Laurent Jalabert , who twanged the heartstrings of France in his final Tour .
He was kitted out on Sunday with polka - dot sunglasses and a bike stencilled with words that expressed the feelings of an entire nation - "" Merci Jaja "" - and was greeted on the podium by his entire family dressed in spotted vests , proving , conclusively , that measles are contagious .
No , the great doubt was over the green jersey , which is awarded to the most consistent daily finisher on points , from finish placings and the two or three daily intermediate sprints .
Usually it goes to the best sprinter .
For the second year running Erik Zabel of Germany , was pushed all the way to Paris by an Australian .
Last year it was Stuart O'Grady , who lost the duel ; this year Robbie McEwen , who scored a mini grand slam yesterday : he won the stage , prevented Zabel from winning for a seventh year , and became the first Australian to take one of the Tour 's major awards .
Their private battle , often fought for minor placings several minutes behind the day 's escape , was nip and tuck from the first week , when McEwen was 10 points behind .
Both men won stages early on ; by Rouen McEwen was two points adrift , and in Pau he pulled on the jersey for the first time , a point ahead of Zabel .
The German clawed it back by a point in the Pyrenees , but McEwen finished a place ahead of him in the sprint in Béziers , putting the pair level and enabling the Australian to wear the jersey by virtue of his higher stage placings .
They stayed level for six days , until on Friday they sprinted elbow - to - elbow up the finish straight in Bourg - en - Bresse , where McEwen again snaffled a single point .
Their final shoot - out after 10 laps of the Champs Elysées yesterday was almost anticlimactic in comparison .
Zabel was balked , and instead the rider who pushed McEwen all the way to the line , and even bumped his shoulder at 40 mph in the final metres , was his fellow Australian Baden Cooke .
The 23-year - old was rarely out of the first half - dozen in the sprints this year in his first Tour , and will surely win a stage soon .
McEwen , a puckish 30-year - old from Brisbane , is one of the few cyclists in the peloton who is not afraid to mince his words , and he had a run - in with Armstrong in the Pyrenees which apparently did little for his relations with the Texan .
A former BMX racer , he does a wheelie at the top of the hardest climb in each Tour he rides , as his way of celebrating the fact that he has got through the mountains : this year it was Mont Ventoux .
Traditionally , the final leg from the outskirts of Paris to the Champs Elysées is a procession , ending in a bunch sprint in which none of the overall contenders makes any attempt to alter the status quo .
For the first time in at least two generations the unwritten law was broken , by the man in third place overall , the Lithuanian Raimondas Rumsas , who could have won Saturday 's time - trial and possibly snatched second from Joseba Beloki if his handlebars had not come loose .
Yesterday , presumably after going over his bike with a fine - tooth comb , he sneaked away from Beloki in the Rue de Rivoli and joined a large group led by Jalabert , who was performing what amounted to several high - speed laps of honour , and Britain 's David Millar , who ended his Tour in great style with an impressive fourth place in the time - trial on Saturday .
That was enough for Beloki 's Once team to get in a panic and they massed at the front of the bunch to ensure that , even if Rumsas 's bike remained in one piece , his last - ditch attempt to snatch second came unstuck .

2002-08-19,"Searching for the names of the sort of serial winners he wants Arsenal to become as they began their defence of the Double , Arsène Wenger reached for Lance Armstrong 's in his programme notes yesterday .
In temperatures the four - time winner of the Tour de France would recognise , Wenger got his wish .
Arsenal beat out a fearsome rhythm here , one that left the Premiership novices Birmingham City gasping for breath like toiling domestiques .
Not too much should be read into what amounts to the prologue of a 38-stage Tour of England , of course , but then what pleased Wenger , and what should have worried the rest of the field , is that this was merely an extension of Arsenal 's supreme form of last season .
This was the 14th Premiership instalment of a winning Arsenal run that began at Goodison Park on February 10 .
That is a record in the top division of English football , eclipsing Tottenham 's 13-game run over the 1959 - 60 and 1960 - 61seasons , and Preston 's and Sunderland 's from 111 years ago .
Should Arsenal win at Upton Park next Saturday then they will establish a record for English football as a whole .
They are setting standards others will have to match and while we are at the very beginning of a new season , a sense of continuity is marking Arsenal out already .
The previous Sunday in Cardiff showed that
and yesterday it was beautifully encapsulated by Arsenal 's second goal , a wonderful sweep of a move finished by Sylvain Wiltord .
The power and the glory of that goal , initiated by Sol Campbell 's clearance three yards from his line , offered the most obvious illustration of Arsenal 's seamless transition from one season to the next , but their all - round display was just as awesome in its relent less pass - and - move simplicity .
"" It was a tremendous goal , "" said Wenger , "" you had everything in that goal .
"" Wiltord , the man who scored the championship clincher at Old Trafford 3 months ago , was one of nine starters present yesterday from that night in May.
That constancy of personnel also helps , though the ease of the victory meant that two younger players , 19-year - old Jérémie Aliadière and 21-year - old Kolo Touré , were introduced late on .
The other used substitute was the World Cup winner Gilberto Silva .
Everything about Arsenal suggested strength .
The moment Birmingham ran out for their first taste of top - flight football since 1986 they must have noticed even a physical disparity .
Two of the Blues ' midfield , Bryan Hughes and Damien Johnson , are 5 ft 9 in and weigh 11 stone .
Two of Arsenal 's , Vieira and Edu , are 6 ft 4 in and 6 ft 1 in , Vieira is over 13 stone , Edu over 12 .
The difference in physique was notable in the first half in particular .
In punishing heat the City players were frequently seen pausing to regain breath as Arsenal switched the ball around Highbury 's lush turf with utter confidence .
This was no weather to be chasing the ball but with Wiltord prominent on the left immediately , Thierry Henry surging on to every pass from Dennis Bergkamp , Edu and Vieira , City had to do just that .
Ultimately that brings fouls and one from Johnson on Henry led to the first goal .
The last time the two clubs had met in the league David Seaman was in goal for Birmingham and how Steve Bruce must have wished he was again .
Having picked himself up off the floor Henry took the free - kick 25 yards out .
It was reasonably well struck but was virtually straight at Nico Vaesen .
The Belgian , however , went down like a collapsing building and Henry had his first of the season .
Another 13 minutes , in which Vaesen did save from Henry and Stern John fluffed a chance at the other end , and Arsenal had the game won .
It stemmed from a Birmingham attack cleared by Martin Keown .
Campbell ushered it on , Vieira nudged it to Bergkamp whose expert flick fed Henry .
His pass left Wiltord in possession close to the halfway line .
Wiltord made rapid progress as City backpedalled .
Reaching the City area , Wiltord chose his moment to shoot and curled the ball into the far corner .
At that point Birmingham knew they were in a different league altogether .
Arsenal slowed a little but still managed to create seven clear chances after the interval .
Four of these came in the last five minutes by which time Aliou Cissé was in the dressing room , having collected two bookings for fouls on Wiltord and Ashley Cole .
Cole 's reaction to Cissé 's second lunge was seen by some to be exaggerated .
But not by Wenger , naturally .
All he had seen were champions performing like champions .
The pace has been set . ·
Fabian Carini , the goalkeeper whose move from Juventus to Arsenal collapsed , has been offered on a year - long loan to Manchester United and Leeds United by the Italians ."
2002-09-03,"The doping investigation into the US Postal team and their American leader , the four - time Tour de France winner Lance Armstrong , was dropped yesterday due to lack of evidence .
The French judge Sophie - Helene Chateau initially opened the investigation in November 2000 after a French television crew filmed a team member disposing of bags of medical waste on an isolated road before the start of the Tour 's gruelling mountain stages .
The bag was later found to contain medicines including the performance - enhancing drug Actovegin , a substance made from extracts of calf 's blood which is believed to boost oxygen levels in the blood .
But after nearly two years of inquiries investigators were unable to find any conclusive evidence that the team used banned substances during the 2000 Tour de France , with none of the blood or urine samples taken from the Texan and his team - mates testing positive .
US Postal said none of its riders used the substance , which was on hand to treat severe skin abrasions and for use by a staff member with diabetes .
Armstrong himself has repeatedly denied taking banned substances and has never failed a doping test .
But in France he has been dogged by suspicions of drug use .
During the Mont Ventoux stage of this year 's Tour the champion was heckled by fans shouting "" Dop - AY !
Dop - AY ! ""
( "" Doped ! "" ) .
Later in the race Armstrong said the French probe was "" a joke from the beginning "" . ""
They [ French judicial officials ] knew immediately the evidence was clean but they kept the case open , "" he said ."
2002-10-25,""" With the same sweeping , powerful gesture which Zola gave to his farm worker in La Terre , L'Auto , a newspaper of ideas and action , will launch across France , from today , those unknowing and forceful sowers of energy , the great professional road racing cyclists . ""
Those words , from an editorial in L'Auto under the headline "" The sower "" , launched the first Tour de France on July 1 , 1903 , and next year much energy will be sown around the country in celebrating the centenary .
The "" sowers of energy "" remain as forceful as 100 years ago even if they are rather more "" knowing "" than of yore thanks to the assistance of sports doctors and business managers , and they turned out in force yesterday , led by the four - times winner and defending champion Lance Armstrong , at the Palais des Congrès to be shown the 2003 route .
Broadly the 2003 Tour follows a similar course to that devised by L'Auto 's Henri Desgrange , whose pieces set the florid , semi - epic tone which remains the language of French cycling journalism .
His successor Jean - Marie Leblanc has superimposed a modern - day Tour over the original stage towns : Lyon , Marseille , Toulouse , Bordeaux and Nantes .
The 1903 event was a voyage into the unknown for which the participants were paid 10 francs .
They had the right to pull out during any stage and still begin the following leg .
There were between one and three days ' rest between each of the stages .
With handlebar moustaches and wearing flat caps , they were allotted nicknames such as the "" the furniture - makers ' champion "" , "" the prince of the miners "" .
The eventual winner , Maurice Garin , was the "" white bulldog "" or "" the little chimneysweep "" .
Today the right to ride means economic life or death for a team but in 1903 Desgrange had to scour the ranks of the "" energy sowers "" of his day to find 60 riders willing to take on his 1,500-mile race .
The longest stage , Paris - Lyon , was 290 miles ; next year the longest leg will again be that to the gastronomic capital but will be half the distance .
Desgrange was driven to launch his event by a circulation war with his paper 's rival , Le Velo , and adopted his assistant Geo Lefevre 's suggestion for a round - France race , like the "" six - day races "" run on the velodromes , and outstripping Le Velo 's promotions , Bordeaux - Paris and Paris - Brest - Paris .
He marketed his event as "" a gigantic concept which will have the whole of France on its feet , not for a few hours but for 19 days "" .
In the event its impact has lasted a full century .
Garin led from the off and was triumphantly escorted into the Parc des Princes by a parade of 2,000 cyclists waving their hats in the air .
Sales of L'Auto went from 30,000 to 65,000 overnight , Le Velo was eventually closed down and L'Auto 's successor , L'Equipe , is still heavily involved with the race .
On the marathon stages , partly run at night , the organisers set up checkpoints , some unannounced , to prevent the participants taking short cuts , although several were caught jumping on trains and in cars in the following year 's event .
The first checkpoint in the 1903 Tour was in Nevers and the town on the banks of the Loire will host the finish of stage five .
Numerous other gestures to the past are in the offing .
For the first time in half a century the Tour will start in central Paris , the original ville départ .
The final road race stage will begin in the Paris suburb of Ville d'Avray , where the 21 finishers in the first Tour ended their voyage into the unknown .
The initials HD , for Henri Desgrange , will reappear on the maillot jaune in a pointed gesture at the 1980s marketing men who judged them old - fashioned and had them removed .
The race will pass memorials to the greats , including Desgrange 's atop the barren scree slopes of the Col du Galibier in the Alps and the plate on a stone barn in Sainte Marie de Cam pan , where the "" Old Gaul "" Eugene Christophe spent several hours repairing his forks in 1913 .
Next year 's event will also reflect another change : the Tour 's gradual transformation from a voyage into the unknown to an event which appeals to many fans because they can share the same roads as the greats .
As in 2000 , there will be a mass ride around a 30-kilometre circuit in the capital on the final stage 's route , and a similar event is planned around the 1903 course next summer .
But not all attempts to pay tribute to the original Tour have gone smoothly .
Next month actors will recreate the dinner in Taverne Zimmer , the Montmartre restaurant where the first Tour was refined over a long lunch .
But a different venue has had to be found .
The original is now a kebab shop ."
2002-12-14,"The quadruple Tour de France winner Lance Armstrong has effectively set a limit for his time in the saddle .
However , it is not a prospect that will give any encouragement to the opponents he has frustrated in the race since 1999 - he announced to an American television station that he is more than likely to retire at the end of the year after next , which will give him two more attempts at the world 's greatest cycle race .
"" It will probably be 2004 , although if something tells me to go on , I 'll go on , "" Armstrong 31 , told the TV station PBS during an interview on Thursday . ""
Whatever happens , I 'll be gone before I 'm 35 .
That 's 100 % certain .
I promise you that . ""
Before cancer struck him down in 1996 , Armstrong had always said that he would be unlikely to continue as a professional cyclist past the age of 30 .
However that changed following his dramatic return to win the Tour in 1999 , and since his third Tour win in 2001 there has been constant speculation over how long he will go on .
During this year 's triumphant progress to his fourth consecutive Tour win , Armstrong hinted that 2004 might be his likely retirement date as that is when his team 's current contract with the United States Postal Service runs out .
However , this is the first time that he has actually named the date .
With next year 's centenary Tour on the horizon , Armstrong is now on the point of joining the four greats of the sport , Jacques Anquetil , Eddy Merckx , Bernard Hinault and Miguel Indurain , all of whom won a record five Tours .
Postponing retirement until the end of 2004 will give him a chance to set an absolute record of his own , with six consecutive victories ."
2002-12-21,"The narrative of triumph over adversity is deeply inscribed into the consciousness of the United States , and tales of sporting endeavour generally subscribe to this obsession .
Jim Thorpe , Little Mo Connolly , Billy Mills , and in recent times Lance Armstrong , are just a handful of American sporting legends whose "" stories "" involve their overcoming obstacles en route to their enshrinement as national icons .
I would argue that during the past year the name of Serena Williams could legitimately be added to this list , although her status as a national icon remains debatable .
Despite her phenomenal 2002 , she is , to many observers , little more than one half of the "" problematic "" Williams sisters who have "" taken over "" women 's tennis with their power and their attitude .
However , such a view belittles her achievements .
Serena Williams was born in Saginaw , Michigan in 1981 , the youngest of five girls .
Lyndrea , Isha , Yetunde and Venus preceded her , and soon after her birth her parents , Richard and Oracene , relocated to Compton , a rough suburb of Los Angeles .
Under the guidance of their father , Venus and Serena were groomed on crowded public courts to become tennis players .
Although they both achieved early success , Richard was determined that his daughters would not suffer burn - out like Tracey Austin or Andrea Jaeger .
They were encouraged to concentrate on their studies and participation in tournaments was strictly limited .
Whenever they did compete the results were predictable .
Both girls were extraordinarily talented , and once they turned professional they began to rise quickly through the national , and then the world rankings .
In 1999 , a 17-year old Serena Williams became the first of the sisters to secure a Grand Slam title when she won the US Open .
However , the media story was not so much Serena 's win , but Venus 's disappointment .
The older sister had been expected to triumph first , but Serena 's meteoric ascent surprised everybody .
The following year Venus asserted herself , capturing both Wimbledon and the US Open , a feat that she repeated in 2001 .
Although Serena failed to win any Grand Slam titles in 2000 or 2001 , her play continued to develop and it became increasingly clear that , of the two sisters , Serena had the better all - round game .
The question was , did she possess the mental toughness and the desire to win ?
2002 began with Serena withdrawing from the semi - finals of the Australian Open having twisted an ankle .
However , after this initial setback , she won each of the remaining three Grand Slam titles and is ending 2002 as the world 's No1 player .
One might well ask , what is so remarkable about this ?
In modern times both Steffi Graf and Martina Navratilova have matched Serena 's feat .
In fact , in 1988 Graf not only won the Grand Slam of the Australian , French , Wimbledon and the US Open titles , she also won Olympic gold .
It was a feat of such sporting audacity that even today Graf 's 1988 season remains under - appreciated .
But Serena Williams 's 2002 deserves to be mentioned in the same company as this achievement .
In order to understand the magnitude of what Serena Williams has achieved we need to go back not to Graf nor to Navratilova , nor to comparisons with any other players past or present , but we have to return to the American narrative of triumph over adversity .
Tennis , like golf , is a sport whose gated boundaries have been defined by race and class .
When the "" commoner "" Fred Perry won his first Wimbledon in 1934 , he overheard a committee member of the All - England Club apologise to the Australian runner - up ; "" This was one day when the best man did n't win . ""
Although Perry was an Englishman , the committee man was embarrassed that somebody as "" uncouth "" as Perry , the son of a Labour MP , should have secured victory on Wimbledon 's patrician grass .
The patrons of tennis are almost always well - heeled , often royal , and there is an air of social exclusivity which pervades the sport .
It is also a sport in which , at the top level , one can usually count the number of non - white participants on the fingers of one hand .
The exceptions - Althea Gibson , Evonne Goolagong , Arthur Ashe - have been distinguished as much by their graceful accommodation of the tennis world 's questionable mores , as they have by their tennis excellence .
Serena Williams is a young black female of decidedly blue - collar parents who entered the sport without making any self - deferential gestures or apologetic nods towards the "" keepers of the game "" .
Her parents knew that if their daughter were to successfully participate in the lily - white world of tennis then her talent would have to be such that it demanded respect , for most would look askance at their gawky black child .
Richard and Oracene dared to imagine their daughter in such an environment , but they also knew that in order for Serena to survive talent alone would not suffice .
They would have to arm her with a fierce self - confidence that some might interpret as arrogance , for they knew that she would be jeered , mocked , ignored and resented .
And they were right .
En route to that first Grand Slam victory in 1999 , Serena Williams was drawn against the former Wimbledon champion , Conchita Martinez .
During this early- round match , I remember sitting courtside at Flushing Meadow and being appalled as the American crowd loudly cheered the Spaniard and booed one of their own .
The following day the stories in the press made reference to the hostility that the "" Williams sisters "" had to endure , without acknowledging that there was only one sister on court at the time .
This clumsiness was compounded by a reluctance to mention the world "" racism "" .
In fact , her father aside , only Martina Navratilova has had the courage to come right out and call it what it is .
It is not as though the US likes its sporting heroes to be shy retiring flowers ; witness John McEnroe , or the current bad boy , Andy Roddick .
It 's just that if they are perceived to be full of "" attitude "" and black then they are of course , to the tennis cognoscenti , as "" uncouth "" as the working - class Fred Perry was in an earlier era .
I watched the 18-year - old Serena Williams beat Martinez , and the manner in which the young girl handled the crowd spoke volumes not only about her maturity , but about the vision and foresight of her parents .
Of all Serena Williams 's achievements in 2002 , perhaps the one that will have the most lasting impact is the simple , but ultimately complex , gesture of her finding the strength to step out of the shadow of her older sibling .
When Serena beat Martina Hingis and won the US Open title in 1999 - thus becoming the first of the sisters to win a Grand Slam title - the thunderstruck look on Venus 's face left onlookers in no doubt as to how deep and dark that sisterly shadow really is .
During the course of this year , having beaten her sister in three consecutive Grand Slam finals , it is clear that Serena no longer lives in anyone 's shadow .
And what of the year ahead ?
Well , immediately there is the Australian Open in January , and should Serena win she will be the first player in 15 years to hold all four Grand Slam titles .
She has already established herself as the most dominant player in the modern game , and her 21-year journey from the streets of Compton to the apex of the tennis world is in many ways a more remarkable story than that of Tiger Woods .
En route she , like Woods , has had to negotiate the vagaries of race and class , but Tiger Woods has never had to suffer Americans cheering for foreigners to beat him , nor has he had to step out of the shadow of a talented and strong - willed older sibling .
And , one should also remember that Tiger Woods is male .
Were Serena Williams a 21-year - old white American middle - class young man who had just won three Grand Slam titles in the space of a single year
, she would be the most famous sports personality in America .
Serena Williams knows precisely why she is not lauded in this manner , but inside she is smiling .
After all , she is not playing in order to earn the kind of media attention and dollars that usually drives sportsmen and women .
She has nothing against making money or receiving endorsements , but her father helped her to understand the realpolitik of American life before she had even entered her teens .
Like many African - Americans before her - Jesse Owens , Joe Louis , Jackie Robinson , Jim Brown - Serena Williams knows that her task is to quietly fulfil her destiny .
Being overlooked and under - appreciated is just part of the deal .
Being accused of being aloof or full of attitude is fine by her .
Her eyes are fixed firmly on the prize .
Around the corner lies greatness ."
2003-01-31,"The quadruple Tour de France winner Lance Armstrong said yesterday he would not let possible threats to his security in the event of a war with Iraq deter him from trying for a fifth consecutive Tour victory this summer .
"" If I have to do the Tour with a war under way it would be very difficult for me
but I will be there just the same , "" said the Texan , who said he would race even if direct threats were made against him .
"" Even if I am advised to pull out for security reasons I will still go .
I am not afraid
and anyway I am not convinced that there will be a war , "" he said .
"" In cycling you ride in the open - there is no fencing or protection nets .
But I will be there just the same ; it wo n't be the war that stops me . ""
Armstrong has already become the first cyclist to employ personal bodyguards for the Tour , where the public can get far closer to the participants than at any other major sports event .
As a member of President Bush 's commission on cancer , he took advice from the State Department about the risks of racing in the Tour last year .
His defiant stance came as the professional road racing season opened in the northern hemisphere with the Tour of Qatar , a five - day race around the gulf state run by ASO , the company that organises the Tour de France .
The field includes two of Armstrong 's possible rivals in July , Richard Virenque of France and Italy 's Gilberto Simoni ."
2003-02-24,"The crowning event in Lance Armstrong 's miracle comeback looked to be unravelling yesterday when the Texan and his wife Kristin confirmed recent rumours that they are to separate due to "" difficulty "" in their marriage .
The four - times Tour de France winner flew to his Spanish base today to begin his build - up to what he hopes will be a fifth victory in July : his wife and their three children remain in the United States .
The Armstrongs issued a statement which read : "" Like many couples we have recently experienced difficulty in our marriage .
We are working through these sensitive issues in the same way we have met other challenges in our life : together , with determination and dedication .
We may experience a period of time apart from each other as we reflect on our relationship and work to preserve and protect the interests of our family and children . ""
The couple met while Armstrong was recovering from testicular cancer in the winter of 1996 - 97 and Kristin has been a constant presence during each of his four consecutive Tour de France wins .
The birth of the couple 's son Luke in October 1999 was the crowning moment of the Texan 's return from cancer to normal life , as he was conceived in vitro from sperm banked by Armstrong before testicular surgery and chemotherapy ."
2003-03-08,"Lance Armstrong , in his first competitive race this year , showed only glimpses of his true form but still managed to cross the line among the main bunch in the 161-kilometre ( 100-mile ) third stage of the Tour of Murcia yesterday .
The American continued to look in fine form and occasionally exerted himself at the front of the peloton as he tried to help out his team - mate Victor Hugo Pena .
But it was Germany 's Erik Zabel who claimed his first triumph of the new season when he burst away from the pack in the final stretch to win the stage .
The Telekom rider hit the front some 300 metres out and maintained his form to cross the finish line half a bike 's length ahead of the Swiss rider Beat Zberg , who was closely shadowed by Belgium 's Nico Sijmens .
Spain 's Javier Pascual Llorente retained the leader 's yellow jersey , seven seconds ahead of his Kelme team - mate Alejandro Valverde and the Euskaltel rider Haimar Zubeldia .
Although the stage boiled down to a sprint finish as expected , the peloton had to work hard to run down a determined five - man breakaway group that had opened up a lead of well over a minute with just 30 kilometres to go .
The group , featuring last year 's race winner , the Colombian Pena , managed to get clear from the main field on the first category climb to Alto Campo de San Juan to pose a serious threat to Pascual Llorente 's overall lead .
But the Spaniard 's Kelme team , helped by Zabel 's Telekom outfit , managed to muster their forces at the head of the peloton to reel in the breakaway group just over a kilometre from the finish .
Zabel then made the most of the hard work of his team mates by producing his customary late burst to notch his first victory of the season .
The five - day race heads for the mountains today with a 167-km ( 104-mile ) fourth stage starting in Cartagena and finishing with the third category ascent up to Alto de la Santa ."
2003-03-10,"Lance Armstrong , who is close to George W Bush , has told the president that he is opposed to war in Iraq . ""
He 's a personal friend of mine but we 've all got the right not to agree with our friends , "" said Armstrong .
The two Texans have a close relationship .
Bush has appointed the cyclist to his presidential commission on cancer , has received Armstrong several times at the White House and phoned Armstrong almost immediately after he won his fourth Tour last July .
But Armstrong is also famously independent - minded .
"" I think we ought to consider the opinion of other strong nations , "" he added .
"" Entering in a unilateral way into the war is an error .
But he has got all the information , he 's the president and my opinion does n't really matter .
I 'd always opt for a peaceful solution and not for a war . ""
Armstrong was speaking during the Tour of Murcia in southern Spain , his first build - up event to his attempt to win a fifth successive Tour de France .
Showing signs of form already , he came close to his first win of the year yesterday in the final time - trial stage .
Armstrong was only 2sec behind the stage and overall winner , Javier Pascual Llorente of Spain , in the 12.9 km ( eight miles ) individual contre - la - montre around Murcia .
It could well be that , when Armstrong rides the Tour in July , his country will be at war and he accepts that there could be threats to his personal security . ""
That is one of the consequences of war .
I do n't know if it would cause me problems , in the Tour de France for example .
I hope it wo n't . ""
Elsewhere the season began to move into top gear with the start of the biggest stage race of the early season , the Paris - Nice "" race to the sun "" .
The Belgian Nico Mattan ran out a narrow winner of the 4.8 km ( three miles ) individual time - trial prologue around the Paris suburb of Issy - les - Moulineaux , only 2sec ahead of the American Tyler Hamilton , with the 2001 Paris - Nice winner Dario Frigo showing ominously good form for sixth , 6sec behind ."
2003-04-09,"After a convoluted chapter of mishaps Jan Ullrich , the Olympic champion and 1997 Tour de France winner , finally returned to racing yesterday after a 14-month absence , finishing 22nd in the opening stage of the Circuit de la Sarthe - Pays de la Loire in Fontenay le Comte .
It is , he hopes , the first step to challenging Lance Armstrong in the Tour de France this July , but his comeback has had more twists and turns than the average Alpine pass .
Two hours before the start yesterday morning he was still awaiting the green light from the International Cycling Union .
It wanted to ensure that financial guarantees had been met for his contract with the German squad Coast , who were suspended from racing earlier this season for failing to pay their riders ' wages .
The team , sponsored by a jeans manufacturer , signed Ullrich in January but without the money to pay him .
A co- sponsor willing to contribute the money was found only on Friday and the team boss Günther Dahms did not agree terms until late on Monday afternoon , after Ullrich and his personal manager Rudy Pevenage had spent most of the day waiting at Nantes airport .
Apparently he was resigned at one point to quitting Coast .
The whole saga began when the German injured his knee while weight training in December 2001 .
In spring 2002 he had to pull out of the Tour , and in July it was announced that he had tested positive for amphetamines in an out - of - competition test conducted by his then team , Deutsche Telekom .
Ullrich admitted taking pills in a nightclub - he was supposed to be in a rehab clinic nursing his knee - and was banned for six months .
He decided to leave Telekom , and chose Coast after several months negotiating with the Danish team CSC .
Armstrong commented that he would have gone to CSC for nothing rather than to Coast , which may now strike a chord with Ullrich ."
2003-05-31,"Tomorrow , if all goes to plan , Jan Ullrich 's new team , sponsored by the Italian cycle makers Bianchi , will be presented to the press in Dresden .
The proviso is necessary : in the 18 months since Ullrich last won a major race , so much has gone wrong for the only man capable of threatening Lance Armstrong in the Tour de France that to assume his new squad will hit the road without a glitch is wishful thinking .
Launching a first - division cycling team led by the man who wants to deny Armstrong his fifth Tour title when the race is a mere five weeks away might seem a little unusual .
It is .
Very unusual .
Imagine a team such as McLaren being put together so that Jacques Villeneuve can go head - to - head with Michael Schumacher four months into the F1 season , and you get the picture .
Cycling teams are launched in January and February and Bianchi 's appearance in June speaks volumes about how messy Ullrich 's career has become .
There was , for example , apparently no certainty that the team would have kit ready for their first race - a small event yesterday in Germany - where they were prepared to wear plain jerseys instead .
But a few weeks ago Ullrich had no team at all after his previous sponsors , jeans makers Coast , were declared bankrupt , so having a squad around him at all is a major achievement .
Since he won the Time Trial World Championship in Lisbon in 2001 , Ullrich , 29 , has plummeted from fifth in the world computer rankings to 530th .
This time a year ago , he was recovering from a knee injury sustained through overdoing weight training , which was ironic for a man famed for not training enough and turning up at the start of the season looking like a barrage balloon .
He was also trying to get over the disappointment of withdrawing from the Tour , which was what prompted him to leave the clinic in Bavaria where he was convalescing and head for the Pacha disco in Munich with friends .
There , on 12 June , he was given two amphetamine pills and by sheer bad luck , it is assumed , drug testers from the German Cycling Federation turned up the next day to carry out a random test as part of the anti - doping programme subscribed to by his then sponsors Deutsche Telekom .
The positive test for amphetamines and Ullrich 's subsequent ban from racing came on top of a drink - driving episode two months earlier when the German was racing around the centre of Freiburg in his Porsche .
His behaviour confirmed Telekom 's suspicions that he was not applying himself to his métier and it became inevitable that he would leave the team who had brought him up from the amateur ranks and for whom , in 1997 , he became the first German to win the Tour amid scenes of national hysteria .
It seemed likely that Ullrich would join the Danish squad CSC , managed by his former team - mate Bjarne Riis .
Ullrich worked like a Trojan in his first Tour in 1996 to help the Dane win and Riis in turn assisted the German to victory in 1997 .
But Riis could not find co - sponsors to finance Ullrich 's substantial salary , plus he did not want his entourage : manager Rudy Pevenage , trainer Peter Becker and domestique Tobias Steinhauser .
Prodded by his manager Wolfgang Strohband , Ullrich opted for Coast , where the signing - on fee for him and his ' entourage ' was said to be € 7million ( £ 5 m ) .
But there was a problem : Coast 's manager Günther Dahms did not have the money .
He was relying on the publicity surrounding Ullrich 's signing to bring in new sponsors for the team , who had failed to pay some of their members in 2002 and had been placed on probation by the Union Cycliste Internationale .
When Ullrich came to race at the end of March , the UCI had not been presented with papers confirming Coast had the money to pay him , and his racing licence for 2003 was issued just hours before his first race .
Coast , already suspended for failing to pay their riders their February salaries , were wound up on 8 May , four days after Ullrich had won his first race in a year - and - a - half .
Since then , Pevenage has been racing to set up the new team , who have the same riders as Coast and much of the same management , but sponsors with the most evocative name in the sport .
Bianchi backed greats such as Fausto Coppi , the first man to win the Tour and Giro d'Italia in the same year .
Remarkably for a team who do not actually exist , they have already been awarded automatic entry to the greatest races in the world - the World Cup Classics and the Tour de France .
Which shows how keen cycling 's men in suits are to have Ullrich racing .
It remains to be seen what all this toing and froing will do to Ullrich 's chances of mounting a serious challenge to Armstrong , who relegated him to second in the Tour in 2000 and 2001 . '
This is not a situation you want to be in when you 're building up to the Tour , ' says the Irish cycling champion Sean Kelly , now working as a consultant for Eurosport . '
He worked hard all winter , won his first spring race for a long time , got fit after the difficulty of last year , and then this happens .
It 's bound to affect him . '
There is another argument : Ullrich may have been forced to mature by adversity and by the fact that his long - standing partner Gabi Weis is expecting their first child .
The Olympic champion certainly feels he has turned a corner during the last 18 months . '
When I heard the news of my suspension I thought it was all over ,
that I would just let it all go .
I did n't see the point in fighting for nothing .
I had neither the taste nor desire to get on a bike .
I went on holiday , came back and thought about what I wanted to do with my life .
It was a turning point
and I got hold of myself . '
Followers of cycling , who have watched the squandering of one of the finest talents in the sport , will feel it is long overdue .

2003-06-02,"The Italian climber Gilberto Simoni threw down the gauntlet to the Tour de France favourite Lance Armstrong yesterday after rounding off a dominant victory in the Giro d'Italia for the second time in three years .
"" I 'd like to try and hammer away at Armstrong in the mountains , perhaps I can even demolish him , "" Simoni said after finishing 18th in the concluding time - trial stage to Milan 's Piazza Duomo , won by the Ukrainian Serhiy Honchar . ""
He has never had to deal with a real climber before .
The guys he has beaten have been time - triallists .
If he 's caught out , perhaps he will panic . ""
Simoni 's superlative climbing enabled him to win three of the five mountain stages in this Giro , which was tougher than usual with 35 riders eliminated in just one snowy day in the Alps last week .
Simoni , who returns to the Tour next month six years after finishing the race for the first time , was one of a trio of Italians who restored their reputations in this Giro after being implicated in recent drug scandals .
He had to quit last year 's event after testing positive twice for cocaine , though was subsequently cleared of any wrongdoing .
The runner - up Stefano Garzelli also left last year 's race under a cloud after a positive test for the diuretic probenecid , but the biggest impression was made by the 1998 Giro and Tour winner Marco Pantani , who has gone from one drug scandal to another in the last four years but rode a brave race for 14th in spite of a bad crash .
If the laurels went to Simoni , Pantani regained the hearts of the Italian public with quixotic attacks in the mountains , and is now talking of a possible link - up for the Tour de France with Jan Ullrich , whose new team , sponsored by Pantani 's former backer Bianchi , is launched today in Dresden .
Also waiting for news of a possible start in the Tour is the Giro 's other marquee name , the sprinter Mario Cipollini , who broke the record for stage wins in the race 's second week . ·
Nicole Cooke , Wales 's Commonwealth Games champion , maintained her lead in the season - long women 's World Cup by finishing second in the sixth round in Montreal yesterday .
Cooke leads Sara Carrigan of Australia by 43 points ."
2003-06-15,"If the Tour de France is cycling 's Wimbledon , the eight - day Dauphiné Libéré through the French Alps is the Queen 's of the two - wheeled world : a final , pleasantly low - key dress rehearsal before the high - pressure main event .
If this is the rehearsal , the main event in July could be mere formality .
Going into today 's final stage , Lance Armstrong has the race in an iron grip .
He won Wednesday 's time trial by a country mile with a performance that the French newspaper L'Equipe compared to Miguel Indurain 's definitive time trial , in Luxembourg in the 1992 Tour .
Yesterday , in the toughest mountain stage , he did not look at his best , but still finished with his only challenger , Iban Mayo of Spain . '
I 'll see if I feel good , exactly where I am , ' Armstrong said before the Dauphiné started last Sunday . '
That 's what matters . '
On this showing , he is exactly where he wants to be , with this proviso : in 1996 , Indurain came to the Dauphiné as he built up to his bid for a sixth Tour win .
Indurain was untouchable - but four weeks later he was beaten .
The only hiccup in Armstrong 's progress was a crash on Friday that left him with two stitches in his right elbow , a sore buttock , and considerable resentment towards a Frenchman , Patrick Halgand , who he insisted had attacked when he was on the Tarmac .
Halgand denied the claim and tried to explain himself afterwards , but Armstrong ranted : ' That fucking guy can say what he wants , but it 's an amateur attitude attacking when the leader is lying on the road . '
Before the Dauphiné , the last sight the cycling world had of the four - times Tour winner was when he got into his private jet , looking like thunder , and headed west without saying a word after Armstrong 's poor showing in the Liège - Bastogne - Liège at the end of April .
Speculation was that his marital difficulties over the winter , including a trial separation from his wife Kristin , might have taken their toll .
Not surprisingly , Armstrong had far more to say last week about the Tour than he did about the race he was actually riding . '
My priority is to win again , not to equal a record .
Above all , I do n't want to think about the figure five .
I know people compare Jacques Anquetil , Eddy Merckx , Bernard Hinault and Miguel Indurain .
I respect that .
But what I can say is that these guys are legends . '
Armstrong was also asked to reflect on the current political situation .
It is one of the little ironies of his attempt to take a fifth Tour that he is aiming to conquer France 's greatest annual institution at the same time that relations between France and the United States are at an all - time low .
Armstrong had harsh words last year for the French public - as he has had in the past for the country 's judicial system , its cycling teams , its press , and its taxmen - but thus far , he has been pleasantly surprised . '
If you 'd asked me six or eight weeks ago if the political context scared me , I 'd have said , "" Yes , I 'm worried "" .
But I went out training for a few hours before the start of the Dauphiné and there was nobody yelling things against George Bush or the US . '
Armstrong struck a specific note during the build - up to war , saying that Bush needed to have Europe on his side .
But on the bike , he is infinitely more combative , each year targeting a person or group of people who have said or done something that annoys him .
This year 's enemies have apparently had their cards marked .
Halgand will top the list but shortly after winning the Giro d'Italia , the Italian mountain specialist Gilberto Simoni commented that he would like to take on Armstrong in the Tour , and that the American ' had never had to cope with proper climbers ' . '
Every year , people talk of challenges before the Tour , but talk is cheap , ' said Armstrong . '
I prefer to talk on the bike .
Things people say are always fine by me , because they just give me more motivation .
So I wo n't forget what Simoni said during the Giro .
They 're on the hard disc . '
The Italian has been warned .

2003-06-25,"Summer means sport for Esquire ( July ) .
The magazine carried an exclusive interview "" with the potential saviour of English cricket , Michael Vaughan "" , a feature on the world heavyweight boxing champion Lennox Lewis , a profile of "" cycling legend "" Lance Armstrong and an article on the life of a thoroughbred stud - of the equine variety .
However , the magazine also examined the rising levels of street violence in Britain and asked a surgical registrar in a London hospital to give an A&amp;E - eye view of the phenomenon .
Dr Pete Curtis - not his real name - spoke of his experience of dealing with the victims of stabbings , shootings and machete attacks .
Over the past 12 months , he said , he had observed patterns of violence , "" some of them specific to the ethnic groups who direct them .
Vicious gangs of Bosnians choose to mutilate people in a manner distinct from the Serbs , Croats and Turks , although over the course of time they may begin emulating one another 's styles .
They will stab or shoot each other on the right - hand side of the body , consciously reducing the risk of a penetrating injury to the heart .
They will direct heavy blows at the peripheries , rather than the head , neck or trunk "" .
The point of such attacks is to send a political message from one gang to another , he said .
But it is not Dr Curtis 's job to ask questions .
"" I do n't concern myself with the how s and why s .
My job , standing here at four o'clock in the morning with a machine - powered water pistol in one hand and a scalpel in the other , is to pack the wound with iodine - soaked swabs . ""
Frivolity reigned at FHM ( July ) , which flagged up its "" Thirst - quenching booze special including drunk , naked girls !
Around the World in 80 Beers ! ""
and a free pint for every reader .
Loaded ( July ) forsook the lager and restricted itself to a diet of soft porn , with features on "" sauna girls "" , regular features such as "" pornalikes "" ( porn models who resemble celebrities ) and a practical seduction manual for those who do n't know how .
For men who like words with their pictures , the magazine reported on Keith Lewis ( again , not his real name ) , "" the nerd who broke Vegas "" .
For three years Lewis lived the rock'n'roll lifestyle in the Massachusetts Institute of Technology ( MIT ) blackjack team , a secret society of professional card counters .
The players were mainly gifted mathematicians who could make vast sums of money - Lewis took home $ 130,000 ( £ 80,000 ) one weekend .
Like all high rollers , the MIT players were "" comped "" - offered free rooms , meals and luxuries - by the casinos .
By autumn 1997 , however , the casinos were on to him .
They hired private detectives to investigate the MIT team and started using heavies to intimidate them if they tried to gamble .
The final straw was a burglary in which the only thing stolen from Lewis 's apartment was his $ 50,000 stake money , which had been well hidden .
Nevertheless , "" if I could go back in time , I 'd do it all again . ""
The US magazine Details ( July ) looked at the life of a real American gigolo .
Nate Peterson is a male escort with model looks , a master 's degree and a penchant for women who will pay him for sex .
He told Details he earns more than $ 50,000 a year and has up to 10 regular customers he sees between twice a month and once a year . ""
Most are busy professionals - I get a lot of female CEOs , "" he said .
Does n't it ever feel demeaning ? ""
Money can buy a lot of shame and guilt away , "" said one of his friends .
Arena ( July ) offered a fashion tip from Gucci - grow a moustache and wear close - fitting jackets and knitwear together with "" ruthlessly tight trousers "" .
The look has "" a certain swagger and a sexy macho look "" , said Gucci 's Tom Ford .
That endorsement alone is likely to guarantee that moustaches are here for the season ."
2003-07-02,"The irony will not be lost on observers of the Tour de France on either side of the Atlantic .
In this year of all years , as Franco - US relations hit an all - time low , an American , Lance Armstrong , will start as odds - on favourite to win France 's greatest sports event .
This is a bitter pill but even less palatable for the home crowd is speculation that the US could also provide the main opposition to Armstrong .
That is perfectly on the cards , given the form shown this season by Armstrong 's former team - mate Tyler Hamilton , who left his service in 2001 and has blossomed as the leader of the Danish CSC - Tiscali squad .
The quietly spoken former skier from Marblehead , Massachusetts , outshone his former boss in April to win the Liège - Bastogne - Liège World Cup race , becoming the first American to win one of the five single - day "" monuments "" of the sport .
He followed that up with victory in the hilly , week - long Tour of Romandie in Switzerland and is shaping nicely for the big one , according to his team manager , the British former professional Sean Yates , by happy coincidence another former team- mate of Armstrong 's .
"" I hope he 's going to ride well , "" said Yates .
""
Bjarne Riis , who runs the team , has said he would like him to make the top five ; I 'd say he can definitely make the podium .
If Joseba Beloki can get on the podium three years running , I 'm sure Tyler can .
Even if he 's not in the same class as Armstrong or ( Jan ) Ullrich .
He 's serious , dedicated and knows how to suffer .
"" That is praise indeed coming from Yates , a legendary hard man , and Hamilton took dedication to the cause on to a new plane last year en route to his runner - up slot in the Giro d'Italia .
He crashed on the fifth stage and rode most of the race with a broken shoulder blade .
"" I knew it was a big problem but not that it was broken .
I did n't want to know how bad it was .
I did n't want it to hold me back . ""
He found out just how bad it was when he had to have 11 teeth replaced last summer . ""
Whether I was on my bike or in bed I was in pain , so I ground my teeth for 2 weeks straight .
I did n't realise how much damage I was doing . ""
A mainstay of the US Postal Service team even before Armstrong arrived , Hamilton took over the task of leading the Texan up the mountains , setting a pace that would awe opponents into submission .
He performed the task to perfection in 1999 and 2000 but US Postal is no place for a man with ambition .
Unlike most teams today , which have several leaders of equal status , the squad is entirely structured around Armstrong , in the same way that Eddy Merckx 's teams of the 1970s were totally focused on "" the cannibal "" .
There are scrapings from the boss 's table - Armstrong "" gifted "" Hamilton the win in the 2000 Dauphiné Libéré stage race - but little space for individual initiative and not a lot of spare cash for pay rises , as the steady exodus from US Postal shows .
At the end of 2000 Hamilton and Armstrong 's other lieutenant , Kevin Livingston , struck out on their own ; at the end of 2001 another American "" Postie "" , Levi Leipheimer , went after finishing third in the Tour of Spain .
Hamilton and Armstrong still live in the same apartment block in Gerona , Spain , but never meet or train together .
They talk on the phone occasionally and Hamilton is generous in praise of his old boss - wisely , given Armstrong 's tendency to leap on loose talk like a terrier scenting a rat . ""
He 's shown in the last four years that he 's not beatable , "" Hamilton says .
"" Perhaps you could say different if any of those races had been close but they were n't .
He 's the strongest by far .
If he comes to the Tour in the same condition as the last four years , he 'll be tough to break , because someone will have to go so much better than the year before . ""
Now 32 , Hamilton has learned enough from Armstrong to emulate the Texan with reconnaissance missions to the major mountain stages ; vitally for a former domestique , he is gaining in confidence , enjoying the experience of working for himself . ""
At Postal you were there to work .
You were listened to less .
As a team leader now I have to give the orders and I 've had to learn how to do it .
To be honest , I do n't feel I 've ever taken the Tour seriously because of having to work for Lance . ""
In this area Riis - taciturn , hard - headed , a protégé of the controversial Italian trainer Luigi Cecchini - has been the inspiration : CSC 's boss rose from obscure team worker to Tour winner in five years .
If Armstrong stumbles , Hamilton may also find that every domestique can have his day ."
2003-07-05,"You would think that a man who had survived a brush with death by testicular cancer and whose calling is one of the world 's most demanding sporting events - the Tour de France - would kick back a little when he has time for some R&amp;R.
But when Lance Armstrong , four times winner of the Tour , this year celebrating its centenary year , is at home he hikes through the sage brush of his native Texas to a waterfall named Dead Man 's Hole set among limestone hills .
There , he stands on the rim and launches himself the 45 feet through the air into the freezing green waters .
Armstrong describes it in the second volume of his autobiography Every Second Counts : ' A little fear is good for you . '
But he admits that it is more than that . '
At what point , ' writes the 31-year - old , ' do you let go of not dying ?
Maybe I have n't entirely , and maybe I do n't want to . '
There is a consciousness of mortality in all athletes ; the intimation that strength must fail and that all records must fall .
In the gruelling three - week , 2,000-plus mile endurance circuit of the Tour de France , that is more true than any other contest .
As the wiry , crop - headed Armstrong set off yesterday in the Tour 's individual time trial in Paris it was with the knowledge that this year if he can ride back into Paris in the yellow jersey he will have equalled the achievements of the giants of the Tour 's 100 years
- five times winners Eddy Merckx , Bernard Hinault , Miguel Indurain and Jacques Anquetil .
Armstrong has said that it does not matter to him if he wins a fifth tour , that he is already in the history books for the conjunction of his cancer and his four wins , and that he feels himself to be in a different league to the handful of five - time winners .
But it does not seem credible .
For although Armstrong has carved out other niches - his cancer foundation has raised $ 23 million and he sits on a presidential commission on the disease -
his real ambition is to better the greatest of all Tour riders , his former mentor Eddy Merckx .
He needs six wins .
Already Armstrong 's success has brought him greater celebrity than any of the Tour 's European giants of the past , propelling him to fame in the United States , where the Tour is , by and large , a total mystery .
His wealth and influence there are of a magnitude he could barely have imagined when , aged 16 , he set out as a professional triathlete .
But it was the cancer that transformed Armstrong from talented Texan ' bike geek ' to a giant of the Tour .
Armstrong has written that his ' cancer was the best thing ' that ever happened to him because his illness was also his antidote . '
It cured me of laziness .
Before I was diagnosed , I was a slacker .
I was getting paid a lot of money for a job I did n't do 100 per cent , and that was more than just a shame - it was wrong .
When I got sick , I told myself : if I get another chance , I 'll do this right - and I 'll work for something more than just myself . '
His ' work ' has turned him into an industry - some say a brand - an American sports superstar more famous from his endorsements in the US than for his actual performances .
This year his sponsorship alone will earn him more than $ 16.5 m while his salary from his team , US Postal , will be $ 4 m , which could almost double if he wins this year 's Tour .
Armstrong is certainly strong for this year , despite a rare but much remarked - on failure of strategy in the Liège - Bastogne - Liège classic in April which led to a falling out with long - time mentor Merckx , who publicly denounced Armstrong for hubris and ' bad riding ' .
But in reality the other races do n't count for Lance , a rider whose obsession with the Tour excludes all else .
He has created a complex personal mission out of the world 's greatest bike race - an annual pilgrimage he calls the ' obligation of the cured ' . '
To me , ' says Armstrong , ' just finishing the Tour de France is a demonstration of survival .
The arduousness of the race , the sheer unreasonableness of the job , the circumnavigation of an entire country on a bicycle , village to village , along its shores , across its bridges , up and over the mountain peaks they call cols , requires a matchless stamina .
It 's not unlike the stamina of people who are ill every day .
The Tour is a daily festival of human suffering , of minor tragedies and comedies . '
And the cancer has made its own contribution to his success in the Tour .
It was the illness , he has said , that changed the shape of his body , slicing off weight and allowing him to become a hill ' climber ' of a confidence that sees him psychologically wearing down the opposition before the race 's off .
It 's been a long haul from Plano , Texas , where Armstrong was born and got into road racing through the gruelling discipline of triathlon , and the distance will be magnified this year after the falling out between the administration of President George Bush - a Texas friend of Armstrong 's - and France over the invasion of Iraq .
Despite his high profile opposition to the war - he told the President he thought he was mistaken - Armstrong will still find himself an American in France .
He has withstood the taunts before .
Last year the crowd booed and shouted ' dopé , dopé ' .
Armstrong had previously admitted that his treatment for cancer involved the use of erythropoietin ( EPO ) , a drug used illegally by athletes to boost the production of the red blood cells that transport oxygen to muscles but also used to assist the recovery of patients who have undergone chemotherapy .
That story of his battle with testicular cancer is told each time that Armstrong 's name appears : the removal of two lesions from his brain , the pinpricks of tumours in his chest .
How within two years of finishing treatment Armstrong had won the first of four consecutive Tours de France .
But those victories have come at a cost - to his family life and to his self - image .
Armstrong 's marriage to his wife Kristin , his constant companion through his illness , faltered , culminating in the announcement of a brief separation earlier this year .
Kristin has described the pressures . '
We 've gone through six houses , three languages , two countries , cancer , three children , four Tours and a journey to celebrity status .
It 's been too much in such a short space of time . '
Then there was the attack by Merckx who accused Armstrong of living inside the bubble of his own myth . '
I think that he is surrounded by people who tell him he 's fantastic , a big shot - that he can say and do whatever he wants , ' Merckx told the Belgian media earlier this year . '
It 's even more dangerous that he believes it .
But he 's American , and it 's in his mentality to believe it . '
Merckx has not been the first to remark upon this .
Armstrong is popular among the riders in the peloton - the great pack of Tour cyclists - but French cycling fans , who have now waited a dozen years to see one of their countrymen win the Tour , have not warmed to him .
Nor do many others in the world of professional cycling .
They say he has no sense of ' cycling history ' - of how Hinault 's hands once froze to his handlebars in a race ; of how the great Merckx was robbed of a sixth victory by a spectator who ran from the crowd and punched him so hard in the kidneys he began urinating blood .
Armstrong admits it . '
I did n't grow up a student of [ cycling ] , so I could n't tell you about their most spectacular moments .
They are legends , the pillars of our sport .
I respect their results . '
His world is not the world of cycling , it is the world of American celebrity : of Super Bowl parties with Elton John , weekends at Kevin Costner 's house , lunch with Brad Pitt .
He has distanced himself from the media except in the most controlled of ways .
He trains on his own , often a solitary figure with nothing but a support car behind him , and goes to bed hungry to keep down his weight .
So will he win the Tour this time ?
Few in the peloton have any doubt .
Barring an accident or illness , or the kind of assault that robbed Eddy Merckx of his sixth Tour win , Armstrong is still the man to beat .
On that last front Armstrong is not taking any chances .
When he begins the Tour proper , the American who has taken France 's national sport hostage will be surrounded by a burly squad of bodyguards .
Lance Amstrong DoB : 18 September 1971 ( Plano , Texas )
AKA :
Bix Tex Family :
Married to Kristin ( three children :
Luke , Grace and Isabelle )
Home town : Austin , Texas ( the house named ' Casa Linda ' after Lance 's mother ) .
Interests :
Lance Armstrong Foundation to help people manage and survive cancer"
2003-07-05,"A straw poll of 30 Tour personnel ranging from Bernard Hinault to the chief of police via Lance Armstrong 's bodyguard yesterday produced an overwhelming consensus : according to 26 of those questioned the American will win the Tour de France again in three weeks ' time .
This was echoed by the Aujourdhui newspaper , whose preview of the Tour was under the headline "" And if Armstrong were no longer infallible ... "" The most convincing signs of weakness they could find were the fact that Armstrong fell off his bike in June , that the course may not suit him perfectly and that he has been trying to save his marriage .
All this smacks of clutching at straws .
The atmosphere here , with observers desperately looking for the smallest signs of vulnerability , and possible rivals singing the praises of the defending champion is reminiscent of 1995 , when Miguel Indurain went on to claim an historic fifth consecutive win , a feat Armstrong hopes to match this year .
None of the other 197 cyclists can be called a heavyweight challenger .
Jan Ullrich of Germany might once have qualified as the Olympic champion and the only other man in the field who has actually won the thing .
But yesterday he said that , having not ridden the race since 2001 , and after missing all last year due to injury and a drug ban , a stage win is the best that can be expected of him .
Ullrich 's squad , hastily pulled together over the past month by the cycle manufacturer Bianchi after the previous sponsor went bankrupt , are "" in a beautiful underdog position , "" says their manager Jacques Hanegraaf .
"" We do n't expect anything , just to show for a few days that Jan Ullrich is back where he belongs and that he is capable of coming and winning next year . ""
Ullrich will share team leadership with the Spaniard Angel Luis Casero , winner of the Vuelta a Espana in 2001 , and feels that his team 's newness may play to his advantage .
"" We will ride together as a team , we 've trained a lot together , "" said Ullrich .
"" The team have had a lot of problems , that 's clear , but we feel the stronger for it .
The good thing is that everyone is expecting us to do well but no one knows what to expect of us , be it in the mountains or the time - trial stages . ""
Armstrong himself seems particularly interested - concerned would be too strong a word - by the prospect of meeting the Italian Gilberto Simoni , winner of two of the last three Giro d'Italia .
Simoni is a climber and his ability to produce sudden changes of pace in the mountains is a quality the American has rarely encountered .
"" It all depends how he reacts after the Giro : is he keen to continue riding the same way or is he not motivated and tired ?
I think he 's strong and motivated and can change the face of the race , "" said Armstrong .
The rest of the opposition have provisos attached : Joseba Beloki of Spain , who has finished second or third for the last three years , has never displayed a winning mind - set for all that Armstrong describes him as "" a credible opponent "" .
His fellow Basque , Iban Mayo , pushed Armstrong hard in the Dauphiné Libéré stage race last month but is inexperienced at this level .
Santiago Botero of Colombia has outclimbed and outgunned Armstrong in time - trials on occasion but usually has an off - day at some point .
The Frenchmen Christophe Moreau and Richard Virenque have only the fact that they are French to recommend them .
In fact , the most "" complete "" opponent on past and recent form is Armstrong 's former team - mate Tyler Hamilton .
Among those asked to predict the top three finishers in Paris on July 27 was Bernard Quilfen , sports director of the Scot David Millar 's Cofidis team .
He expects Millar to win ahead of Armstrong , which for blind optimism outstrips the most blinkered resident of Henman Hill , and can only be interpreted as some kind of psychological trick to motivate his Ecossais .
Yesterday , however , Millar did speak in detail for the first time of a possible challenge for a high overall placing .
"" I 'll wait until after the first two mountain stages to see what happens , take it from there and see if I can stay with the best . ""
First , however , he has to stay upright in today 's prologue time - trial in Paris and win if possible .
Armstrong , who will not wear the yellow jersey "" because it does n't feel right "" , will have identical aims ."
2003-07-06,"Yesterday should have been all about happy memories as the Tour returned to the Reveil - Matin bar where the first grande boucle started a hundred years ago .
But Lance Armstrong will not recall the events of the weekend with any affection , even if he eventually does join the race 's record holders with a fifth consecutive victory .
On Saturday the Texan paid a small but still annoying price for what looked like rare complacency .
He decided not to reconnoitre the course of the prologue time - trial and thus lost a surprising five seconds to Jan Ullrich and failed to open ground on any of his likely rivals .
Yesterday , meanwhile , he hit the deck for the second time in a month , in probably the largest sprint crash the Tour has ever seen .
Armstrong was lying about 25th as the tightly packed peloton jostled for the finish , with the wind on their backs driving them at about 40 mph through a right - hand - left - hand chicane 700 metres from the line .
The Spaniard Jose - Enrique Gutierrez lost his balance as the rider in front of him changed line and fell , taking about 20 of his fellows with him in a maelstrom of flying limbs and wheels .
It was not quite as spectacular as the occasion when a policeman attempted to take a photograph of the finish sprint at Armentières in 1994 , causing Laurent Jalabert to lose several teeth .
But , unlike that incident , all bar the first 25 or 30 were affected .
As the leaders sprinted for the finish , led in by Italy 's new sprint hero Alessandro Petacchi , the fallers blocked the road , meaning that the rest of the field had to stop , which resulted in them crossing the line in dribs and drabs .
Armstrong landed on the heap of bikes and bodies , rather than flying over them , and they broke his fall .
"" I did n't see what caused it , "" Armstrong said .
"" I just went down and some other riders fell on top of me .
Things like that make you angry , but it 's always like this in the first week of the Tour .
"" It could , however , have been far worse and , in a grisly way , his task may now be easier .
His fellow American Tyler Hamilton , a likely contender for a top - three placing overall , may not start today 's stage after breaking his collarbone , while Levi Leipheimer , who came eighth last year , broke a bone in his hip .
The French sprinter Jimmy Casper , who went right over Gutierrez and fell on his head , was placed in a neck brace on the tarmac but is apparently unharmed , while the Dutchman Marc Lotz has severe facial injuries .
The only favourite to avoid the crash was Ullrich , who spent most of the nervous final kilometres yesterday sitting in the front rank of the peloton , sheltered by a single domestique from his Bianchi team .
Gilberto Simoni , of Italy , was among the fallers , as was the maillot jaune Bradley McGee , of Australia , although both were shaken rather than stirred .
David Millar rarely avoids a pile - up - he fell three times in three days last year - but was in the first line of riders who managed to slam their brakes on in time , and tiptoed around the mess .
Fortunately the Tour has a rule - devised with precisely this sort of accident in mind - that if a crash takes place in the final kilometre , all the fallers are given the same time as the winner .
There is currently a campaign among the riders to have the distance extended to five kilometres and , given the terrifying mix of roundabouts , corners and traffic islands that they had to negotiate at over 35 mph on yesterday 's run - in , they may have a case .
It is a sign of the times - and perhaps a good one , given the current state of Franco - American relations - that there were as many stars and stripes as tricouleurs alongside the route yesterday , once the peloton had left the Stade de France and pedalled gently across Paris , from one side of the péripherique to the other , in a procession lasting 19 miles .
Their initial destination was the Reveil - Matin cafe in the suburb of Montgeron , where the first Tour was flagged away at 3.16pm on July 1 , 1903 , and the start point of yesterday 's opening road stage .
Possibly in homage to the Texan who currently rules the Tour , although possibly not , the Reveil - Matin is now "" le Pub Restaurant Hacienda Tex - Mex "" .
Outside , the cafe is painted a lurid purple and orange ; inside the cultures clash just as incongruously .
A faded photo of the first Tour winner Maurice Garin and a turn - of - the - century clunker bike rub shoulders with Texan long - horns , bullwhips and feathered Native American head - dresses , and a fine portrait of Clint Eastwood , cigar in mouth .
Further evidence of the American cultural invasion , and confirmation for those who fear that the Tour now just represents a fistful of dollars .
If the Reveil - Matin did not quite rise to expectations , memories of Tours past were stirred in another way yesterday , when the German Olaf Pollack , one of the many victims of the great pile - up , was forced to walk across the finish line , carrying his bent bike on his shoulder .
This was the kind of image that was common in the Tour 's heroic era either side of the first world war , but Pollack spoiled the impression by smiling and waving at the crowd .
Another sprint , hopefully not as spectacular , is in the air today as the race heads for the Belgian border ."
2003-07-08,"Never say never in sport .
Whether it is Lance Armstrong recovering from cancer to win the Tour de France or Jose Maria Olazabal wondering if he would ever walk again and then helping win the Ryder Cup , there is no accounting for an indomitable will to prove the doubters wrong .
Almost a year ago Darren Gough played for England at Lord 's in the final of the NatWest Series .
It was to be his final match for his country until he faced Pakistan at the start of this year 's one - day fest , a chronic knee injury threatening to bring a halt to a decade of fast bowling .
You 'll never be back , he was told .
Oh no ?
Thus far he has proved a point .
These have been a revealing few weeks for Gough , though .
Bringing him back had a risk element that might not have been tolerated for a lesser player .
England were feeling their way .
No one quite knew how his knee would react to the instinctive demands of real competition .
The response has been good : 66 overs in seven innings , each one - even his final effort against South Africa at The Oval which Andrew Hall hit for 21 runs - a mini master - class in the art of bowling , an object lesson in the value of experience from which no young aspiring bowler could do anything but learn .
The culmination , on Sunday , was figures of four for 26 on a skittish pitch in Bristol to help dis pose of Zimbabwe in double - quick time .
He is , as he is never slow to remind anyone who listens , back .
How far that should extend beyond the final of the competition on Saturday is a matter for conjecture , but already there are those who would see a return to the Test side as a natural progression .
But would it be prudent to consider the resumption of a 32-year - old 's Test career which was placed on hold after the last home Ashes series two years ago , particularly at a time when new bowlers such as James Anderson , Steve Harmison , Simon Jones and Richard Johnson have been making their mark ?
"" We need the experience of a fit Darren Gough in the Test side , "" said the England coach Duncan Fletcher in the aftermath of the win over Zimbabwe .
But the key to that lies in the word "" fit "" .
There is the world of difference between being fit to bowl 10 overs in a one - day match , few of them flat out , and competing in a tough series on Test match pitches , where fast bowlers , as a strike force , operate on the edge .
At the moment Gough , through careful management , has the injury under control ; it gives him discomfort but it is not incapacitating .
But it is a degenerative condition which will only get worse and the dilemma for him is whether to push too hard in pursuit of a renewed Test career or settle for appearances in one - day matches .
The former might bring short - term glory but would almost certainly curtail his career , whereas the latter , if managed absolutely , could yet bring England benefit even as far as the next World Cup in 2007 .
Fletcher was adamant that he could be of no further help in this matter . ""
The only guy who knows if he is fit enough for Test cricket is Darren himself , "" he said .
"" But he would have to know that he could be out there for five or six sessions .
To bowl 25 overs in a day and then maybe 15 the following day and to stand all the while in the field is a hell of a lot different to one - day cricket .
Only he knows if he can do it . ""
An absolute priority would be for him to play - and bowl significantly - in Yorkshire 's County Championship match against Durham next week .
If it proved self - defeating then at least England would know .
In the short term it has to be decided whether it is in the interest of England and Gough for him to play in what has become a meaningless match at Edgbaston this afternoon .
England and South Africa have both qualified for Saturday 's final so there is an opportunity to give Gough 's knee a chance to rest up while offering more experience to another bowler .
Against that , it is important for England , and indeed Gough , to learn as much as they can about the recovery rate of his injury by subjecting it to as much stress as they dare .
England will surely want to make changes from the unbalanced XI that beat Zimbabwe .
Given that Rikki Clarke was unlikely to bowl in a side overloaded with seamers , his inclusion in that side suggested they were more confident of him scoring runs than either Jim Troughton or Robert Key .
He may be retained ; if not , Troughton can be expected to return for a match on his home ground .

2003-07-09,"STAGE FOUR : Joinville to Saint - Dizier , team time trial ( 69 km ) WHAT HAPPENED ?
In hot but windy conditions over 69 kilometers [ around 42 miles ] , the first team time trial of the Tour saw Lance Armstrong 's US Postal Service team edge out last year 's winners ONCE and Team Bianchi to record their first Tour victory .
The stage was a key target for the Postals team in the Tour 's opening week .
WHO 'S IN THE YELLOW JERSEY ?
Victor Hugo Pena , who became the first Colombian to wear the jersey in the Tour 's 100-year history .
"" Sure , I 'll be the one wearing the yellow jersey , but this is a victory for the team - it 's one of the best teams that 's ever existed in the world , "" he reflected .
The Postals ' win gave them a 30-second lead over the second - placed ONCE team and 43 seconds over the Bianchi team .
WHAT ABOUT LANCE ARMSTRONG ?
The 31-year - old Texan finished second in the overall Tour standings , one second behind Pena .
"" I 'd never won this discipline before , "" said Armstrong afterwards .
"" It was quite a hard course , with the wind - lots of wind ...
It 's a very , very hard discipline . ""
The win , the first for Armstrong in the team event since he took the first of his four Tour victories in 1999 , sets him nicely up for the mountain stages that start in the Alps on Saturday . ...

2003-07-10,"A blow - up shark brandished by American fans followed Lance Armstrong 's triumphal march to Paris last year , and it made its first appearance at the start yesterday .
It has bred over the winter , and now has two little sharks for company .
Next year , presumably , there will be an entire school .
Yesterday , the shark was doubly symbolic .
The voracious carnivore who has gobbled up the last four Tours smelled blood , and duly left the opposition in pieces .
With all the precision and devotion of pilot fish alongside their master , the Texan 's US Postal Service team dominated the stage .
It was also the day of el tiburon , as Armstrong 's domestique Victor Hugo
Pena is known from the shark tattoo on his left shoulder , and the large hands and feet that helped him become a Colombian swimming champion .
Thanks to the fact that he finished a single second faster than Armstrong in Saturday 's prologue time trial , he will today become the first Colombian to wear the yellow jersey .
Armstrong has been circling hungrily around a team time trial since the discipline was brought back into the Tour in 2000 . ""
For three or four years , we 've been second or third , "" he said .
"" I was second in 1994 with the Motorola team as well .
It 's been a huge frustration . ""
Significantly , all nine Postmen finished together , whereas the other squads in the top four all shed a couple of weaker elements .
The team time trial can be pitiless , and the biggest price was paid by Gilberto Simoni .
The Giro d'Italia winner was , until yesterday , the main threat to Armstrong on paper , but his Saeco Coffee Machines team blended poorly , possibly because they have not had to race a team time trial in the Tour since 2000 , and Simoni now has three minutes to pull back on the American .
Joseba Beloki and Once were expected at least to race creditably - they won the stage in 2000 and 2002 - and duly finished only 30 seconds adrift , having posted the fastest times until the final 20 kilometres , but the big surprises yesterday came from Jan Ullrich 's Bianchi and the Spaniards of Miguel Indurain 's old Banesto team .
Ullrich looked back to his best as he pulled his eggshell blue train along : face impassive under mirror glasses , no movement in the shoulders .
He cut his losses to only 43sec , while Banesto - now known as iBanesto.com to publicise the bank 's internet arm - raised memories of the days of Big Mig with fourth place , meaning that their young leader Francisco Mancebo is handily placed 90sec behind Pena .
It is 20 years now since the Colombians first appeared in the Tour , bringing with them a legion of famously motormouthed radio reporters , and Pena yesterday recalled listening to Radio Caracol 's blanket coverage of Tour heroes of the 1980s such as Lucho Herrera and Fabio Parra during his youth in Bogota .
Whereas Herrera was the archetypal waiflike Colombian climber - whose poorly disciplined teams tended to suffer horribly in the team time trials on the Tour - Pena has accumulated most of his 13 professional wins against the watch and is no mountain man .
But he is a typical self - made Colombian cyclist , who saved up his earnings from giving swimming lessons to buy his first bike .
Sudden heat baked the riders over the mainly flat route from Joinville , home of the elite batallion in which France 's young sportsmen do their military service , to Saint - Dizier , home of the foundry that produced the Art Nouveau decorations for the Paris Metro , a town that earned the rare distinction of hosting stage finishes on successive days .
The direct route up the Marne valley is about 15 miles , but the Tourmen meandered out into the plains known as the Pays de Der , once thickly forested with chestnut trees , now sporting locals basting gently in the sun atop mechanical loaders and grandstands made of hay bales .
A warm breeze got up during the day , prompting the mechanics to fit higher gears at the last minute , and it blew in the teams ' faces for the final 12 miles .
This was where US Postal profited from their decision to start gently and save their strength for these frequently dead - straight roads .
"" We saw an incredible increase in the team 's speed over the last 20 kilometres , "" said their directeur sportif Johan Bruyneel .
"" You could see that from the fact that we took 30 seconds out of Once . ""
The Frenchman Jean - Patrick Nazon 's tenure of the maillot jaune was predictably brief , as his Jean Delatour team finished 20th , and Pena 's time in yellow may also be curtailed .
Armstrong and Bruyneel have a classic dilemma as the race heads south today : defend Pena 's yellow jersey , and risking tiring the team , or relinquish the race lead to a breakaway on the assumption that Armstrong will regain it for good on Sunday at l'Alpe d'Huez .
It is Pena 's 29th birthday today , and yesterday 's gift may be cruelly snatched from him ."
2003-07-12,"1 Les Deux Alpes , 1996 Probably the most memorable mountain stage of the past 20 years began in Chambéry in torrential rain which had the riders sheltering under the start podium .
The Cormet de Roseland climb , tackled in chilly rain and fog , saw the maillot jaune Stéphane Heulot abandon in tears because of knee trouble and the favourites Chris Boardman and Laurent Jalabert blow gaskets .
On the soaking descent Johan Bruyneel - now Lance Armstrong 's manager - missed a hairpin and went flying over the mountainside and Alex Zülle , the previous year 's runner - up , fell twice trying to put his racing cape on .
The great drama came on the finish climb , however , where Miguel Indurain 's reign finally ended .
Big Mig ran out of energy and was penalised for taking a water bottle from a rival team 's car .
2 Sestriere , 1952
The day that sealed the Fausto Coppi legend when the campionissimo completed his second double of Giro d'Italia and Tour de France victories with a trademark solo break .
He escaped at the foot of the Galibier , rode alone into his native Italy over the Col de Montgenèvre to win by seven minutes , and he would win the Tour by almost half an hour .
An Italian radio commentator described his arrival in words never forgotten by the country 's cycling fans : "" one man . . .
alone in the lead . .
.
he has a blue jersey . . .
it is Fausto Coppi .
"" This was the first Tour when mountain - top finishes were used ; Coppi won all three , here , at l'Alpe d'Huez and at Puy de Dôme in the Massif Centrale .
Less than eight years later he would die of malaria .
3 Les Deux Alpes , 1998
The stage that saved the drug - scandal Tour de Farce .
In bone - chilling rain and pea - soup fog Marco Pantani broke away on the top of the Col du Galibier and Jan Ullrich blew a gasket .
Pantani had been fighting a war of attrition with the German since the time - trial a week earlier , chipping away seconds on every mountain , but this was the assault that clinched the first Giro - Tour double since 1993 and the first Tour win by an Italian since 1965 .
An epic for which Pantani is still loved , in spite of - or perhaps because of - his subsequent decline into a miasma of court appearances and depression which have left him a shadow of the flamboyant "" Pirate "" of old .
4 La Plagne , 1987 Four words sum up this stage , uttered by the Channel 4 commentator Phil Liggett : "" It 's Roche , Stephen Roche ! ""
The most dramatic fightback in any recent Tour .
Roche , the race leader , lost ground early on the climb to his rival Pedro Delgado , who knew that with a time - trial to come he had to open a decisive gap .
Over a minute behind with 10 kilometres remaining , Roche gave everything while Delgado slowed dramatically .
Liggett had no idea Roche was about to cross the line a few seconds behind the Spaniard , which explained his delight .
The Irishman collapsed and was given oxygen , but when asked how he was he replied : "" OK , mais pas de femme tout de suite [ not quite ready for a woman ] . ""
5 L'Alpe d'Huez , 1977 Hot , heavy and drama - packed .
The confirmation of Bernard Thevenet 's talent as he won his second Tour by a narrow margin ahead of Holland 's Hennie Kuiper .
The end of the great Eddy Merckx 's Tour career - and an illustration of his courage - as he lost 10 minutes on the Col de la Madeleine because of stomach trouble which had him vomiting during the climb .
A hard - luck story for Lucien van Impe , the stage and race leader when he was balked by a car on l'Alpe
d'Huez and lost the plot .
Another 30-plus hard - luck stories when the "" autobus "" of non - climbers was eliminated after they finished outside the time limit , after which only 53 men made it to Paris , the smallest number of survivors in the last half - century ."
2003-07-14,"The German fan who impersonates the devil was there as always , leaping about and brandishing his trident , but even he must have found the fires of hell a little on the warm side yesterday .
Lance Armstrong , normally a byword for cold calculation in the midst of an inferno , certainly did .
In his attempt to join the group of four men who have won the Tour de France five times , the Texan is doing it the hard way .
Armstrong is back in the yellow jersey this morning , following his third place in yesterday 's gruelling and bitterly contested stage from Sallanches to l'Alpe d'Huez , but there was no note of triumph in his voice afterwards .
Instead he spoke of the problems he had faced , not just from his rivals but from his own team , whose tactics went awry at a vital moment .
Yesterday the only thing climbing faster than the riders was the mercury .
While passing through the claustrophobic tunnel of humanity shouting and gesticulating along the eight - mile slog up l'Alpe d'Huez , the riders of the Tour de France endured temperatures rising close to 100F.
And Armstrong , sometimes held to be a superman , was not impervious as Iban Mayo , a Basque rider with the Euskaltel team , raced away to win the stage , followed by Alexander Vinokourov of Telekom .
This Tour is definitely no lap of honour .
Armstrong knew something was not right as he pedalled up the final kilometres of the giant Col du Galibier , the penultimate climb of yesterday 's 137-mile stage .
"" I did n't have the greatest legs today , "" he said .
"" At that point it was my decision to ride a conservative race .
You need experience to know that you do n't have to put on a show .
I decided to cover my losses . ""
Ever since his failure to win the prologue time - trial , after failing to reconnoitre the course and suffering a slight stomach problem , Armstrong has been closely monitored for signs of weakness .
His involvement in the big crash on the second day was an inconvenience , and a major effort by his colleagues in Wednesday 's team time - trial was required to push him up to second in the general classification .
Yesterday he was frank about his performance so far .
"" I do n't think I 'm perhaps as strong as in the other years , "" he said .
"" I had some issues at the start of the race , and now I 'm a little better .
But if you 'd asked me a month ago if I 'd be suffering like that on the Alpe d'Huez , I 'd have said , ' No way ' .
"" Whatever Armstrong 's feelings as the leaders came over the summit of the Galibier , 4 hours into the stage and with 40 miles to go , his blue - clad US Postal team - mates were putting on the expected show .
Half a dozen of them were surrounding their leader at the head of a group also including the overnight holder of the yellow jersey , Richard Virenque , and two of Armstrong 's most dangerous rivals , Jan Ullrich and Joseba Beloki .
On the long descent a break by Mikel Astarloza and Didier Rous was allowed to compile a lead of more than two minutes .
Behind them the bunch motored happily along , with Postal in control .
But just before the Chambon dam , 10 miles before the arrival at the foot of l'Alpe d'Huez , Armstrong was momentarily unsettled when his team - mate Roberto Heras fell beside him .
The group slowed to allow Armstrong to gather himself and Heras to remount but it was not a good omen .
As they swept off the main route nationale into the road that leads up to the village of Huez , the drama began .
It was here , two years ago , that Arm strong bluffed Ullrich , pretending to be suffering before switching on the power .
Now , without warning , the blue train took off , Manuel Beltran jumping into the lead with Armstrong on his wheel and two other lieutenants , Chechu Rubiera and Heras , poised to assist .
For a few seconds the destiny of the whole three - week , 2,140-mile Tour seemed to rest on this one explosive and seemingly devastating mass attack .
As Rubiera and Heras followed Beltran into the pacemaker 's position , great names and reputations were being left in the dust .
First Virenque cracked , then Ullrich .
Only Mayo , Vinokourov and the amazing Tyler Hamilton remained in their slipstream .
Beloki was barely hanging on .
But the sight of Beloki not only catching them but overtaking barely two miles into the climb gave a clue to what had been happening .
When Mayo and Vinokourov flew past , the horrible truth became apparent .
Beltran , a 32-year - old Spaniard who was added to the team in mid - May with the intention of giving Armstrong better support in the mountains , had taken his team- mates beyond their limits .
"" There 's no doubt about that , "" a pensive Armstrong said .
"" He 's new to the team
and I guess the system is n't clear enough .
A fast tempo is a good thing , but this was supersonic .
And that 's not good . ""
Now , as Armstrong accelerated across the giant stars and stripes painted on the road at the entrance to the village , he was left to scrap it out for third place , to accept the yellow jersey with a slightly rueful smile and to face the inevitable inquisition about his failure to dominate the day .
He added , although it did not need to be said , that this time there had been no bluffing ."
2003-07-15,"In an extraordinary departure from the norm , and from the prescribed race route , Lance Armstrong narrowly avoided disaster yesterday by briefly turning this year 's Tour de France into a cyclo - cross event .
The Texan , trying to win a fifth successive Tour , was forced to ride his bike into a field to avoid a horrific crash four kilometres from the finish of stage nine from Bourg d'Oisans to Gap .
The faller , last year 's runner - up Joseba Beloki , was in hospital last night with a broken right leg , elbow and wrist .
Wearing the yellow jersey of the race leader , Armstrong missed Beloki 's front wheel by a yard , narrowly avoided a gendarme and rode into the steeply sloping field .
Fortunately the lengthy drought in this area had left the soil rock - hard and he was able to ride down across the field , cutting off an entire hairpin bend .
He carried his bike up a small bank to reach the road , crossed it - making the group check their speed slightly - and then remounted .
It was his third lucky escape of this Tour .
Beloki had been leading the front group of cyclists on the descent from the final hill of the stage , the Côte de la Rochette , in hot pursuit of the eventual stage winner , the Kazakh Alexander Vinokourov , when he lost control of his front wheel on a patch of melted tarmac on a hairpin bend .
His tyre burst , he flew into the air at 35 mph and landed heavily on his right hip .
"" I was very afraid , and I was very lucky , "" said Armstrong , who avoided a penalty despite breaking Article 18 of the Tour 's rules which forbids taking shortcuts from the prescribed course ."
2003-07-15,"If Lance Armstrong manages to win his fifth Tour de France he will owe much to the quick reflexes which enabled him to avoid a horrendous crash 2 miles from the finish here .
Victory is , however , by no means assured , as yesterday the Kazakh Alexander Vinokourov threw down the gauntlet with an assured , aggressive stage win .
Ironically Vinokourov has an infinitely more aggressive approach to racing than Joseba Beloki , who departed the race yesterday in such dramatic style .
This was the third day in succession that the stocky 29-year - old from Petropavlovsk took the fight to Armstrong .
His first attack on the Col de la Ramaz on Saturday failed , then at l'Alpe d'Huez on Sunday Vinokourov finished 27 seconds in front of the Texan , which was not exactly a major concern .
Yesterday he zipped out of the lead group on the Côte de la Rochette , five miles from the finish .
The gap in Gap was 36sec , helped by the confusion that followed Beloki 's crash .
Because 20sec is deducted from the stage winner 's time as a bonus , he is now only 21sec behind Armstrong .
Even though the Texan claimed that he was feeling better than he had at l'Alpe d'Huez , this kind of effort and the strain of dealing with several challengers can eventually tell on a maillot jaune .
To notch up the pressure a little more , Armstrong 's nemesis at l'Alpe d'Huez , lban Mayo , gleaned an eight - second bonus for finishing third yesterday and is now only 1min 02sec adrift .
Vinokourov is nominally Santiago Botero 's first lieutenant at Telekom but , after Botero passed through the Alps with all the ease of one of Hannibal 's elephants , the Kazakh is now the team leader .
He says he is aiming for a place in the first three overall , "" but more may be possible "" .
If he continues to take the initiative in this way and does not weaken , much more may be possible .
Unlike the unfortunate Beloki , a follower by instinct , Vinokourov is a cyclist who is used to attacking and winning .
He is enjoying his best ever season , with victories already in two stage races a rung or two behind the Tour in importance , Paris - Nice and the Tour of Switzerland , and the Amstel Gold Race World Cup event in April .
His Paris - Nice win came after the death of his close friend Andrei Kivilev , who suffered massive head injuries in a crash .
It is impossible now to refer to Vino ' without mentioning Kivi ' - "" I owe this victory to him ; he gives me strength just like in Paris - Nice , "" he said yesterday .
Armstrong was also put under pressure early in the stage as the peloton plodded back up the Col du Lautaret after flying down it en route to l'Alpe d'Huez on Sunday .
David Millar is looking for a stage win and attacked repeatedly , each time brought to order by Armstrong 's team- mates , who were not willing to give him too much leeway .
Eventually the Scot flew away in the closing stages to pursue the four survivors of an escape which had hightailed it south among the towering rock pinnacles of the Col de l'Izoard .
Until Vinokourov made his charge a repeat of Millar 's stage victory of last year in Béziers looked possible , but it was not to be .
"" There was a stronger headwind in the valley than I had expected , so it turned out harder than I thought , "" said the Scot .
"" I was attacking all day , though .
I really wanted this stage and I 'll try again . ""
Bastille Day is rarely this mouvementé and the drama disguised the fact that , as so often is the case , the French were unable to warm the patriotic cockles of the nation by winning the stage .
The day 's main escape featured a Colombian , several Spaniards and a German , but not a single Frenchman .
Seven previous French Bastille Day winners were paraded on the podium after the stage , but yesterday the best placed was the national champion Didier Rous in 12th .
Today it is downhill all the way to the Mediterranean , and Marseille 's symbolic importance makes a long - distance try for the stage by a lowly Frenchman virtually inevitable ."
2003-07-16,"Lance Armstrong spent yesterday 's rest from Tour action looking forward to what he described as the "" most important time - trial of my life "" .
That happens tomorrow following today 's stage from Narbonne to Toulouse , and Armstrong said : "" I have already reconnoitered the time - trial course , but I will do again on the morning of the race . ""
Armstrong is taking no chances after his slip - up in the prologue time - trial in Paris at the start of the race when he decided against inspecting the course and produced a disappointing performance .
"" It will be the most important time - trial of my life , "" he said , "" but in the meantime I will be spending time with my family in Narbonne . ""
Armstrong , the four - times Tour winner , is the man in possession of the leader 's yellow jersey , but Germany 's Jan Ullrich , who won the 1997 Tour and is in sixth place in the current standings , just two minutes and 10 seconds adrift , believes he can haul in the American .
Ullrich reckons Armstrong may be vulnerable to an attack in the Pyrenees and said there was a chance he could win his first stage of cycling 's premier race in five years in the mountains of south - west France .
"" If I 'm on good form and I 'm feeling good on the day then it might be possible , "" he said .
"" The Pyrenees this year are tougher than the Alps and a lot can happen there . ""
Ullrich is also looking forward to tomorrow 's 47 km individual time - trial to improve his overall position before moving on to the Pyrenees .
"" I hope I can gain time on some of the mountain specialists and get a morale boost for the stages the Pyrenees , "" said the 29-year - old .
Ullrich , who was second behind Armstrong in 2000 and 2001 , thinks the American has never been in a trickier position going into the second half of the Tour .
He said : "" Lance had certainly expected to be in a better position at this stage .
In the last few years you never saw his main rivals just a few seconds behind him after the first mountain stages . ""
Armstrong , from Texas , leads the second - placed Kazakh , Alexander Vinokourov , by a only 21 seconds ."
2003-07-19,"The theme park that hosted yesterday 's stage finish currently consists of little more than a ski slope running into a vast hole in the ground and after yesterday 's time - trial here , suddenly Lance Armstrong is staring into the void .
It may well be that for all its complete lack of atmosphere , this bizarre place gains the same notoriety in the history of the Tour as the Les Arcs ski resort did when Miguel Indurain 's domination came to a sudden end in 1996 .
The Texan has lost only two time - trial stages in his four consecutive Tour wins , and each of those defeats was by a handful of seconds .
Yesterday , for the first time in the three times they have met in the Tour , Jan Ullrich gained the upper hand on him in a solo contre la montre , by a massive margin : 95 seconds .
For all that Armstrong retained the maillot jaune , this was a defeat of epic proportions for the man who has dominated the last four Tours almost as he pleased , and it leaves the Tour beautifully poised for four days of climbing in the Pyrenees .
Ullrich is now just 34sec behind in second place .
The Russian Alexandre Vinokourov cut his losses on Armstrong - another clear sign that the master is not what he was - and remains within a minute .
It is a position of unprecedented precariousness with a week 's racing to go , including another time - trial where Ullrich may well gain time , and Armstrong recognised that immediately after the stage .
"" I do n't have much time [ in hand ] , and I 'll have to attack in the Pyrenees , "" he said .
Half an hour later , however , in what smacked of a need to convince himself and the opposition , he had changed his mind .
"" I do n't know I have to take more time back . ""
Jan had a super day , but besides today , he has n't beaten me in a time - trial in the Tour .
I can still be confident .
It 's not my responsibility to attack .
If I start [ the time - trial ] in Nantes [ next Saturday ] with 34 seconds , I would n't lose sleep . ""
Perhaps not , but his rest might be a little disturbed .
This was billed by Armstrong as the most important stage of the five Tours he has ridden to win , but it turned into the most painful .
He finished with a fine white scum on his lips , and admitted running out of water in heat pushing 40C ( 104F ) .
"" I had an incredible crisis .
I felt like I was going backwards .
It 's the most thirsty I 've been in a time - trial .
I was thirsty from the beginning .
Perhaps I did n't drink enough .
"" It would perhaps have been unreasonable to have expected the centenary Tour to avoid theme parks , as they are a French obsession , which the Tour has indulged by visiting the bizarre Futuroscope and the tasteless Disneyland Europe .
Cap Decouverte is a vast restored open - cast coal mine , complete with rusting , redundant earthmovers , and its only connection with the two wheeled world is that in French cycling slang the term "" au charbon "" , literally to "" put on coal "" , means to go flat out .
Ullrich did just that , in a manner which has not been seen on the Tour since his arrival in 1996 and his victory in 1997 .
He has twice won the world time - trial championship since then , but otherwise he has always looked to be a man trying to live up to the great future everyone had predicted for him , and generally failing .
It is five years since his last stage victory , and it is 24 years since the legendary blue jersey he has worn for the last six weeks , Bianchi , last won a stage .
Yesterday , there was a touch of Indurain in the way he gobbled up the lime - tree avenues and little hills through the Gaillac vineyards , past little chateaux and red - tiled farms , and row upon row of sunflowers and sunshades .
The shoulders were steady , the stubbled jaw gaping , the legs whirling at 35 mph .
The much discussed embonpoint was merely his lungs forcing his stomach out .
He was , he said afterwards , "" ganz kaputt "" .
That actually applied to everyone else .
Indurain - style , the German was in a class of his own .
David Millar was a useful seventh in spite of a sore throat , but was almost four minutes adrift .
The climbers , as might be expected , had a torrid time and Iban Mayo is now 4min 29sec behind Armstrong , but together with his fellow Basque Haimar Zubeldia , he will surely attack in front of his home crowd today .
And tomorrow .
And the day after .
And next Wednesday , perhaps .
This passage of the Pyrenees promises true drama , but there was one crumb of comfort for Armstrong yesterday , or so he said .
"" I saw the forecast for storms in the Pyrenees .
That 's good news . ""
He did not specify whether they are meteorological or sporting .
Both are likely ."
2003-07-19,"Cycling 's prodigal son has truly returned .
A second Tour de France win is within Jan Ullrich 's reach after the German escaped from Lance Armstrong two kilometres from this little ski station high above the spa of Ax - les - Thermes to take second on the stage .
The German is now just 15 seconds behind the four - times Tour winner going into the mountain stages today and tomorrow .
Having crushed Armstrong in Friday 's individual time trial , yesterday Ullrich showed the climbing skill that he had seemingly lost since his Alpine stage win at Albertville in 1998 .
He crossed the line only seven seconds clear of the Texan , but the first three on each road - race stage in this Tour have a set number of seconds deducted from their times , and Ullrich 's 12-second bonus meant he more than halved his deficit in the space of a few minutes .
Armstrong was unable to follow Ullrich when he accelerated just after passing the two - kilometres - to - go flag , and blamed the after - effects of the unprecedented crisis that lost him Friday 's time - trial stage . '
It was too difficult [ on Friday ] .
It was a massive effort , I was hugely dehydrated and I did n't expect to be good today . '
Ullrich too has his problems : the stomach trouble that affected him in the Alps returned , and he was forced early in the stage to escape to a handily placed hedge .
Armstrong , Ullrich and the rider lying third overall , Alexandr Vinokourov , spent most of the stage watching each other like the hawks that circled above in the breathtaking heat .
The little Kazakh has harried Armstrong fearlessly since the race entered the Alps last Saturday , and he opened what seemed a decisive gap as the leading half - dozen - Armstrong and the men closest to him in the rankings - went under the banner .
For the first time in the past four Tours , Armstrong did not respond to a threat from an immediate rival , but pedalled like a man in a dream , and it was Ullrich who flew past into the slightly downhill last kilometre riding like a man possessed .
He was just over a minute behind the stage winner , Spain 's Carlos Sastre , who slipped a baby 's dummy into his mouth as a tribute to his wife and daughter , but that mattered little .
Armstrong recovered slightly and chased hard , but the damage was done .
Ullrich spent two Julys , 2000 and 2001 , watching Armstrong gain time effortlessly in time trials and mountains , and yesterday 's attack will be a vital psychological boost .
He now has ample opportunities to prove he is the stronger .
Two more mountain stages remain before Tuesday 's rest day , which is followed by the final day through the Pyrenees , and two flat days leading to a long time trial through Brittany .
All of which leaves the centenary Tour delicately poised .
It is 14 years since a Tour has been so open just one week from the finish .
That Tour , 1989 , was the year of the great duel between Greg LeMond and Laurent Fignon , and this year has the added savour of a third element in the equation , Vinokourov .
As well as Ullrich , Vinokourov and Armstrong , two others still have an outside chance .
The Basque Haimar Zubeldia time - trialled well on Friday , began the final wave of attacks on Armstrong yesterday , and finished just behind Ullrich to claw back 15 seconds from Armstrong .
He lies fourth , just ahead of the Tour 's miracle man , Tyler Hamilton , who ceded ground late on yesterday 's finish climb , but remains fifth , well beyond the wildest dreams of many with two working arms .
Armstrong came under early pressure 30 miles from the finish on the Port des Pailheres , never climbed before by the Tour .
It is a dramatic ascent , beginning in a steep gorge , scaling a vast hillside past a ruined castle , and zig - zagging up a vertiginous ridge on what is little more than a goat track with tarmac .
The Basque fans with their red , green and white ikurrinas appeared , and as the hairpins tightened , twice the reed - thin Basque climber Iban Mayo attacked and twice Armstrong had to respond , with Vinokourov and Ullrich following as if umbilically attached .
The three men 's proximity reflected the tightness of the standings after Armstrong 's crisis during Friday 's individual time trial at the Cap Decouverte theme park near Albi , and Ullrich 's equally incredible renaissance to win the stage - his first stage win in the Tour for five years - by a massive margin of 1min 35sec .
Mayo , meanwhile , had risen and fallen , putting Armstrong on the rack at l'Alpe d'Huez a week ago , moving up to third overall , and then showing on Friday that in common with many other mountain men , he can not time - trial .
Yesterday , for all his brief showing on the Pailheres , he spent the final kilometres ' doing the elastic ' - dropping off the back of the group , then fighting his way back on - and he is now more than five minutes adrift .
The great unanswered question of this Tour will concern Joseba Beloki , twice third overall and Armstrong 's runner - up in 2002 .
Quite what the little Spaniard might have achieved without his disastrous crash last Monday will remain open to conjecture .
There is no doubt about its effects on Beloki : he will not race until next season , and he remains in hospital in Spain being treated for a broken elbow , wrist and femur .
In what is turning into the tightest race in 14 years , he would surely have played his part .

2003-07-21,"WHAT HAPPENED AND WHO WON ?
Lance Armstrong increased his lead despite crashing in what was possibly the most dramatic stage of this year 's tour .
Sylvain Chavanel of Brioches la Boulangere led the field as they began to climb the final summit , the Col du Tourmalet , but the drama started as Armstrong began to attack Jan Ullrich in the chasing group .
The American came off his bike when a spectator 's bag appeared to catch his brake lever .
Bringing Iban Mayo down with him , Armstrong quickly remounted as the peloton , now led by Ullrich , waited for him .
As he desperately attempted to gain ground , Armstrong almost came off again as his foot slipped out of the pedals .
From there he produced an incredible fightback which should silence even his harshest critics , who believed until today that the Texan was no longer the force of old .
His determination , however , saw him attack immediately and reel in a struggling Ullrich , passing an exhausted Chavanel four kilometres from the finish and putting 40 seconds between him and his closest rivals .
Iban Mayo crossed the line second and Ullrich third .
After taking the stage , Armstrong has now increased the gap between himself and to second - placed Ullrich to one minute and seven seconds in the overall standings .
Kazakh Alexander Vinokourov remains in third place , but lost more time on Armstrong after struggling in the last two climbs of the day and now trails by 2min 45 .
WHAT ABOUT BRITAIN 'S DAVID MILLAR ?
He finished in 108th place , 34 minutes behind .
It leaves him one hour 24 minutes and 40 seconds off the pace .

2003-07-21,"If three people make for a crowded marriage , they are an even tighter fit in a yellow jersey .
Since he pulled on the maillot jaune at l'Alpe d'Huez eight days ago , Lance Armstrong has been squeezed almost daily by Jan Ullrich , and Alexandr Vinokourov , and it was the Kazakh who turned the screw a little tighter yesterday .
The five - and - a - half - hour day was drawing to a close when they tackled the final climb , the Col de Peyresourde .
It is not steep by Pyrenean standards but tough enough for Vinokourov to spring away , accompanied by l'Alpe d'Huez winner Iban Mayo , with both Armstrong and Ullrich opting to cut their losses , which ran out at 43sec .
After the weekend 's first two Pyrenean stages , both are within a whisker , Vinokourov 18 and Ullrich 15sec behind .
These are mere nothings : on a mountain such as today 's finish at Luz Ardiden , a minute can be lost in a single kilometre by a cyclist in crisis .
It is not the closest Tour ever , yet , but the race has never seen a three - way battle of such fine margins .
Each day the kaleidoscope is thrown up in the air and the three pieces - Armstrong 's yellow , for the moment , Ullrich 's light blue of Bianchi , Vino 's Telekom dark pink - fall in a different order .
On Friday and Saturday it was Ullrich 's , yesterday Vino 's : the one piece that never ends up in a better position is Armstrong 's .
Armstrong described Saturday 's finish , when Ullrich attacked two kilometres from the top of the final climb at the Ax - Trois - Domaines ski station , to gain a total of 19sec , as "" the crisis after the disaster "" .
Yesterday was the struggle after the crisis .
Each of the six mountains had its own character : thick pinewoods on the Col du Portillon , where France meets Spain ; the marbled memorial to the late Olympic champion Fabio Casartelli on the one - in - five hairpins of the Col de Portet d'Aspet .
The Peyresourde , yesterday 's battleground , is a pastoral af fair , great zig - zags through high hayfields .
What it witnessed was Ullrich saving Armstrong 's yellow jersey for him , as he led the pursuit of Vinokourov and Mayo , with the Texan clinging on , and clearly not enjoying the experience .
Effectively , that marked a statement by Ullrich that this Tour is as much his as it is Armstrong 's and , significantly , it was his Bianchi team that led the chase behind the day 's 17 escapees . ""
In our view , he is as much race leader as I am , "" said Armstrong .
Forced into a temporary alliance against the common enemy - for it is in Ullrich 's interests to limit his losses to Vinokourov as much as to gain time on Armstrong - they combined forces in passing through the throng of fans , mainly clad in the orange of the Euskaltel team and waving the Basque flag , and on to the high - speed descent .
That alliance will dissolve the moment the flag drops today .
The battle for the stage win was little more than a warm - up act , but it underlines how fortunes can turn in a race the length of the Tour .
The little Italian climber Gilberto Simoni had had a disastrous race , and was lying 73rd yesterday morning , infinitely below what was expected of the double winner of the Tour of Italy .
He has hung on manfully though , and yesterday slipped into the 17-man escape , which spent virtually the whole stage in front , surviving to outsprint Richard Virenque and the Swiss Laurent Dufaux .
For a man who , the day before , had been told by his team manager to go home due to his lousy form , it was quite a comeback .
All three are comeback - men in a different way .
Dufaux and Virenque are close friends , and survivors of the Festina debacle .
Simoni is still seething at the two positive tests for cocaine that ruled him out of last year 's Giro d'Italia , even though he was cleared after explaining that it was all a horrible mistake involving boiled sweets belonging to his auntie , who now has the same notoriety as Raimondas Rumsas 's mother - in - law .
Yesterday at least , one issue looks to have been settled .
Richard Virenque decided that with six mountains to climb , this was his best chance of sealing a sixth win in the King of the Mountains prize .
It was Virenque 's Quickstep squad that launched the early escape , in which he had two team- mates , Michael Rogers of Australia and the Italian champion Paolo Bettinig , to help with the pacemaking , and he led over four passes to take what looks like an impregnable lead .
There remain three key battlegrounds , each best suited to one of the three pretenders .
Today the route includes the highest pass of the Pyrenean stages , the Col du Tourmalet , and the fearsome finish on the bare mountainside at Luz Ardiden .
On paper , this is Armstrong 's best area , and Jan Ullrich 's weakest .
After Tuesday 's rest day in Pau , Wednesday 's leg westwards includes two steep climbs and a hilly run down to sea level at Bayonne , which is perfectly suited to Vinokourov 's attacking style .
Finally , there is the time - trial in Brittany on Saturday , where Ullrich will be favourite after his crushing win on Friday .
In this game of nip and tuck , the suspense may well last into those 31 miles .
A minute 's silence will be observed at today 's start in honour of the Estonian professional Lauri Aus , a member of the Ag2R team , which is racing the Tour , who was killed yesterday by a truck while out training ."
2003-07-21,"Lance Armstrong has not yet lost this Tour de France , but after hanging on to the lead with a desperate rearguard action for the third day in succession he is clearly coming to terms with the possibility that on Sunday he will ride into Paris without the yellow jersey for the first time in five years .
"" If I get to the time - trial in Nantes with 15 seconds [ lead ] and lose by 16 seconds , it will be the closest Tour de France finish in history
and I 'll go home , have a cold beer , then come back and try again next year .
I 'm not going to cry and whine .
"" There is another possibility : Armstrong may return to the effervescent time - trialling that marked his four Tour wins . ""
Everyone forgets a lot of things , "" he said yesterday .
"" If I have 15 seconds before the last time - trial , with the form of two or three years ago , I would be OK . ""
However , he also admitted what has become clear over the past week : he is not the man he was .
He accepted that talk of his decline was "" fair "" .
"" It 's obvious I 'm not as good as in years past .
You can look at the times for certain climbs , to ride four minutes slower up l'Alpe
d'Huez , you do n't need to be a rocket scientist to work out that I 'm not as fast as two years ago .
Something is not clicking .
Something has not gone right , but there 's nothing I can do about that .
All I can do is get up in the morning and do my best . ""
The change could be seen over the weekend .
On Saturday , when Jan Ullrich made his move two kilometres from the finish , Armstrong simply could not respond .
Until the gradient eased he looked devoid of power .
Yesterday on the Col de Peyresourde , while Ullrich made the pace behind Alexandre Vinokourov , Armstrong was unable to ride up the climb in his usual style .
In his four successful Tours he climbed sitting in the saddle , spinning the pedals at unnaturally high speed .
Yesterday , clinging on to Ullrich 's back wheel , he was forced to stand up - "" dancing "" , as the French put it - and use his arms to help force his legs round like a mere mortal . ""
I said to myself , ' Shit , I 'm standing up a lot . '
If it was in the rules that you have to climb sitting down , I 'd have been dropped .
I 'm still not 100 % and when you are lacking form you have to rough it . ""
And it shows : when Armstrong "" roughs it "" he looks ragged .
If he himself can not explain the reasons for his decline , they can be suggested .
There is probably no single reason but rather a combination of several factors .
He is now 31 , and it is usually held that a cyclist 's strength declines gently after he passes 30 .
The American had a troubled build - up to the Tour , from his marital difficulties to rumoured disagreements with his team manager and the cancellation of the Midi Libre race , which had formed an integral part of his 2002 preparation .
In addition Armstrong , who had not crashed badly in the six years of his comeback from cancer , finally encountered a little ill luck .
A high - speed crash in the Dauphiné Libéré stage race in June damaged his back , and the antibiotics to treat his cuts gave him a stomach upset .
The back pain resurfaced after his crash on the first road race stage of the Tour at Meaux , and a chiropractor was brought post - haste from Italy .
In building fitness , a cyclist seeks to improve every area , to gain half a per cent in , for example , 10 different fields .
The same applies when things go wrong ; one minor difficulty can be overcome , half a dozen can tip the balance .
Today is not quite Armstrong 's last chance , but he will not have a better one .
In his four previous Tour wins he destroyed the opposition in the mountaintop finishes .
Today is the last of the three such finishes in this Tour and it is probably his last chance to gain time on Ullrich .
"" I 'll go flat out and try my luck . ""
He has no alternative ."
2003-07-22,"Lance Armstrong 's luck has not deserted him in this Tour , and yesterday a semblance of his form of old returned as well .
Twice he was the victim of events , including a dramatic incident when a spectator toppled him off his bike on the final climb , but for the first time in this Tour he was able to impose himself and open a gap that may prove decisive .
After winning the stage here , he leads Jan Ullrich by more than a minute , an advantage that is not exactly comfortable but is healthy compared with the 15 seconds that separated them yesterday morning .
Almost as importantly , this Tour ceased to be a ménage à trois over the twin Pyrenean giants of the Col du Tourmalet and the climb to the finish : Alexandre Vinokourov slumped and is now almost three minutes behind .
The mark of the great Tour men is how they cope with events .
Armstrong has already shown in his recovery from cancer that he is beyond the norm in this area .
Yesterday , he was tested to the full as he attempted to stretch Ullrich on the lower slopes of this epic climb to a bleak ski station ringed by spiky peaks .
With the l'Alpe d'Huez winner Iban Mayo close behind , and Ullrich sprinting to maintain contact , Armstrong caught his right brake lever in a yellow cotton bag held by a substantial Basque cycling fan , and toppled to the tarmac , taking Mayo with him .
Ullrich performed a two - wheeled sidestep around the pair and , as professional cycling ethics dictate , the entire lead group slowed while Armstrong and Mayo remounted .
This is precisely how Armstrong behaved two years ago when Ullrich went into a field on the descent from the Col de Peyresourde , and he pointed that out yesterday .
"" What goes around comes around .
I 'm very grateful to Jan for remembering my gesture of two years ago .
What I did then was the correct thing , and what he did today was the correct thing .
"" It was an accident waiting to happen , given that the bags are handed out daily in their thousands by the bank that sponsors the yellow jersey , and a reminder that the Tour men are uniquely vulnerable in their proximity to spectators .
Frequently , they get too close .
In 1993 Alex Zülle fell foul of an onlooker 's plastic bag the day before a vital time - trial , and four years ago a fan taking a photo brought down the winner at l'Alpe d'Huez , Giuseppe Guerini .
All the race organiser Jean - Marie Leblanc could do yesterday was protest that they can not put barriers along the entire route .
Fired up by the adrenalin , Armstrong caught up , waited for a short while , then accelerated away again .
Ullrich was unable to hang on , but with Mayo still behind him , Armstrong almost crashed again .
This time , his gears - damaged in the accident - misfired , his right foot parted company with his pedal and he landed on his bike in most painful style .
It mattered barely a whit .
Ullrich ceded ground , then fought a desperate and futile battle to stay within reach .
In the end , with Armstrong 40 seconds ahead , he lost out to Mayo in the sprint for second .
If Armstrong was spinning the pedals with the speed that has won him the past four Tours , sweat dripping from chin and nose , Ullrich plodded as he did in coming second in 2000 and 2001 .
But he believed after the finish that he has kept close enough to challenge in Saturday 's time - trial .
The German had tried manfully to dispatch Armstrong on the lower slopes of the Col du Tourmalet , but Armstrong kept his head and clawed back the metres .
As it is now , the race could go to either of them .
Not that Armstrong is happy with the hand fate has dealt him , from his crash on day one to his near - miss en route to Gap and the dehydration that cost him last Friday 's time - trial .
"" This has been a Tour of too many problems , too many close calls , too many near- misses , "" he said .
"" It 's been a very odd , crisis - filled Tour , with problems I have mentioned , and some I have n't talked about .
"" The latter may include his troubled marriage .
The only Briton in the race , David Millar , has his problems as well .
He should make it to his adopted home of Biarritz - next door to the stage finish at Bayonne on Wednesday - but only after a tortured passage through the Pyrenees .
Yesterday he lost contact early in the stage as the pace hotted up , but struggled through with a chest infection . ""
He 's at the limit of what a cyclist can stand , "" said Jean - Jacques Menuet , the doctor with Millar 's Cofidis team .
"" He is on antibiotics and in any other race I would have sent him home .
The Tour is a race of excess . ""
And , as yesterday showed , some of the excesses spill on to the roadside ."
2003-07-24,"This is set to be the fastest Tour ever , which has excited a certain amount of controversy .
Up to yesterday , Lance Armstrong 's average speed for close on 1,800 miles was just over 25 mph , a little quicker than the record he set in 1999 .
It is a spectacular achievement , but the spectacular in cycling today rarely comes without a proviso .
Writing in the left - wing newspaper Libération , which casts a somewhat cynical spotlight on the Tour , the trainer Antoine Vayer has expressed surprise that speeds are currently higher than they were in the mid-1990s , held to be the high summer of drug abuse in cycling .
The area is an old one , and a grey one : often high average speeds are the result of a favourable wind , or an aggressive mood in the peloton .
Yesterday , for example , the stage winner Servais Knaven whizzed through the pinewoods of the Landes at a speed which would have seen off a vélomoteur : close to 29 mph for 113 miles .
He and his nine breakaway companions sped away from the peloton the second the flag dropped on the outskirts of the rugby - playing town of Dax , and their reasoning was easy to work out : of the 22 teams in the Tour , only 10 have won stages to date .
Tomorrow 's time - trial is for Lance Armstrong or Jan Ullrich ; Sunday is for the sprinters .
Time is running out for the majority who need to justify their existence here .
Yesterday , the 10 to break away included representatives of five of the teams who have drawn a blank so far : Bram de Groot of Rabobank , Paolo Bossoni from Caldirola , Ivan Parra of Kelme , Leon van Bon of Lotto , and David Millar 's Cofidis team - mate Mederic Clain , who is known mainly for his peculiar name , and lack of results .
The chase was intense for the first 25 miles of roads as flat as a crêpe but 10 men working together can be a match for most teams , and the leaders included several who fit the vague description rouleur , the sort of cyclist who is utterly at his ease in this game of long - range cut and thrust : iBanesto 's Vicente Garcia Acosta ; De Groot , who figured in a similar move en route to Marseille , and the swarthy Italian Salvatore Commesso , a stage winner in 1999 and 2000 .
Knaven was the joker in the pack : winner of the hardest single - day classic , Paris - Roubaix , in 2001 but until yesterday a domestique for Richard Virenque in the Belgian Quickstep - Davitamon squad .They have nothing to do with dancing , but are backed by a parquet floormaker , and a vitamin company .
The pressure is off Quickstep , who have won more money in this Tour than any other team , and the Dutchman waltzed ahead 10 miles out , whereupon the nine played into his hands by ceasing to work as a unit , handing himstage victory on a plate .
Stage finishes here are traditionally fought out by the sprinters and the peloton 's battle for 11th place outstripped the contest for the stage win in spectacle and interest .
The sprinters ' green jersey is being hotly fought this year : currently there are seven men in with a chance of overall victory , tightly packed behind the leader Baden Cooke of Australia .
Cooke 's fdjeux.com squad played a tactical blinder , placing one of their riders , Christophe Mengin , in the escape , which meant that they could sit back in the knowledge that Mengin would be able to go for the stage win and they would have to play no part in the chase , saving their energy for supporting Cooke in the sprint .
This was only partly successful : Mengin did not have his wits about him when Knaven fled the coop , and Cooke lost out in the sprint for 11th to his two biggest rivals , last year 's points winner Robbie McEwen , and the six times maillot vert Erik Zabel .
But he still has the lead , by a mere six points , and , as he said yesterday , this particular contest will go to the wire on the Champs Elysées on Sunday ."
2003-07-24,"Tyler Hamilton 's victory here was different in many ways though above all , in winning with a broken collarbone , he arguably pushed the pain barrier further than any Tour cyclist before him .
The American also publicly summoned his team car at the finish to thank his manager , the 1996 winner Bjarne Riis .
He was hugged by Lance Armstrong , his former team leader .
Finally , he shook the local dignitaries ' hands on the finish podium with his left hand .
His damaged right arm stayed tucked in .
Hamilton was not the only one keeping his hand close to his chest yesterday .
The 30-mile time - trial from Pornic to Nantes on Saturday will decide this Tour , and it was clearly already weighing heavy on the mind of both Armstrong and Jan Ullrich .
They barely took their eyes off each other for a moment up hill or down dale yesterday , and that will go on until they reach tomorrow 's finish on the plains of Poitou .
Hamilton can now look at Saturday 's contre la montre in a new light as well .
The CSC leader came to this Tour aiming for a high overall finish , and it is now within his reach thanks to this audacious long - distance attack .
With his lead over four minutes as he left the Pyrenees and began the mainly downhill final 50 miles , he looked poised to challenge Alexandre Vinokourov for third place overall .
A strong late chase from Vino 's pink - clad Telekom team scotched that , but even so , his total gain of nearly three minutes on the day means that on Saturday he may well overtake the Basque Iban Mayo for fifth .
As well as opening up new possibilities , the American 's victory here settled one issue : Hamilton 's CSC now have an impregnable lead in the team standings , thanks to his current sixth place and the ninth and 18th places of his team - mates Carlos Sastre and Peter Luttenberger .
Critically , that could earn them automatic entry to next year 's Tour .
All of this was far from Hamilton 's thoughts early on , however , as the race sped out of Pau and into the green , winding hills of the Basque country .
Early on , he found himself at the back as the peloton stretched and fractured , and he had to call five of his CSC team - mates back to haul him up to the leaders .
Another of his domestiques , Niki Sorensen , rode a tactical blinder , infiltrating the day 's early escape , so that he was perfectly positioned to drag Hamilton clear of the field when he made his completely unexpected move on the Colde Soudet , all twists and turns leading to a bleak plateau of pine trees and shattered rocks .
The Basques , as expected , were out in force , but their new hero Mayo was held up by a puncture at the foot of the day 's second , and toughest , climb , the Col de Bagarguy .
The locals turned the top of the mountain into a sea of red , white and green ikurrina flags , waved so densely that Hamilton could barely see the road , and forcing him to dodge between them - no easy task for a one - armed man riding up a one - in - seven slope .
Telekom 's intense chase behind Hamilton offered a hint of what to expect today and tomorrow .
The battle for the green points winner 's jersey is even tighter than that for the yellow of overall leader ; Telekom 's sprinter Erik Zabel , six times the points winner , was in yesterday 's chasing group and the current wearer of the jersey , Baden Cooke , was not , so the German took a handy 17 points by finishing second and moved into third .
There was no happy home - coming for David Millar , who lives in nearby Biarritz , and had started the stage with a Basque flag attached to the shoulder of his jersey .
The Scot spent the early miles trying to escape the pack , finally got clear on the day 's first mountain , the Soudet , but he had overestimated his strength , and ended in the gruppetto , the "" bunchlet "" of non - climbers , half an hour behind .
"" It was a nightmare , "" he confessed .
"" I was chez moi .I knew all the roads , and even though I 'm ill I did n't want to let down my team because of how they have kept me in the race .
I do n't have many cards to play , so I went for a long break .
It 's very hard to arrive in my home town in the gruppetto . ""
Like Armstrong , like Ullrich , his mind will now turn to Saturday 's time trial ."
2003-07-25,"If further confirmation of the tightness and tension of this Tour were needed , it came 30 miles into yesterday 's stage in the honeyed limestone village of Montendre , where Jan Ullrich and Lance Armstrong offered a unique sight : the two favourites , yellow jersey and pale blue , belting up the main street for the first intermediate sprint of the day .
The two or three intermediate sprints on each stage liven up the dull bit early in the day .
They are sponsored by the PMU betting company , which endorses the green jersey of best sprinter and is prominent in the publicity cavalcade with a fleet of Caterham cars driven by belly dancers .
The money is not massive -£570 , £ 320 and £ 210 to the first three across the line , plus points towards the green jersey .
The overall contenders do not usually bother with the sprints , leaving them to the also - rans and the sprinters going for the green jersey .
The point was made yesterday at Montendre : the winner was Robbie McEwen , who is now a whisker ahead of Baden Cooke in the battle for the green .
But the sprints also carry time bonuses : six , four and two seconds deducted from the overall time of the first three .
This may sound minuscule , and it is .
However , the closest Tour to date , the LeMond - Fignon epic of 1989 , came down to eight seconds , or first and third places in two bonus sprints .
Hence the surprising spectacle offered to the good burghers of Montendre , where Ullrich decided a few seconds would help the cause and Armstrong felt he had to respond .
It is a measure of how finely poised the race remains going into today 's flat 49 km time - trial from Pornic to Nantes .
After Ullrich 's sprint in Montendre , and Armstrong 's reply , the German clawed back two seconds for taking second to Armstrong 's third , which means he is 1min 5sec adrift .
It is big enough , or small enough , for both men to hope .
As LeMond 's former manager Cyrille Guimard put it yesterday : "" It is like a penalty shootout : the kicker will feel the goal is small and the goalkeeper is big , while the goalie will think that the goal is wide and he is small . ""
Armstrong has taken the final time - trial in all the four Tours he has won , twice beating Ullrich .
Given that all he has to do to conserve the maillot jaune is finish within 1min 4sec of the German ,
that makes him the favourite , on paper .
Ullrich , on the other hand , won the time - trial last Friday over a similar distance by 1min 35sec .
If he repeats that margin today , it should give him the Tour .
He also finished ahead of Armstrong in the time - trial prologue in Paris three weeks ago .
Yesterday the stage winner , Pablo Lastras of Spain , sped from Bordeaux to Poitou at over 30 mph , pushed by the wind to the second - fastest stage in the history of the Tour .
He and his fellow 15 escapees enjoyed a vast lead , over 24min at the finish , and produced a heart - stopping finale .
By the final kilometre Lastras was one of four in with a chance .
His compatriot David Canada was in the lead but fading and the Frenchman Carlos da Cruz sped past with 400 m to go , only to be overtaken in the final metres by Lastras , with the Italian Daniele Nardello close behind .
It was the second stage win of the Tour for the iBanestco.com team , once Miguel Indurain 's Banesto .
They will disappear at the end of the year
but they have gone out in style .
Today is the main event , though .
The Tour has been decided in the final time - trial only three times in the past 25 years and once in the past 15 years , at the climax of the LeMond - Fignon duel , and a contest with similar suspense can not be ruled out .
Hence the scrapping yesterday .
"" It 's not bad to lose two seconds , "" said Armstrong .
"" Tomorrow is the most important time trial I 've ridden
but I 'm confident and relaxed .
In the last four Tours I 've always been really good in the last time - trial .
I do n't see the Tour being decided by two seconds . ""
Perhaps not , but if one thing has characterised Armstrong 's Tour it is the role played by unforeseen events .
If either man enjoys a tiny advantage after today 's set piece - say under 10sec - both will have this in mind : there are two more bonus sprints en route to the Champs Elysées tomorrow ."
2003-07-26,"HEROES Lance Armstrong : Clear - headed and calculating , despite being on the rack for much of the second week .
Iban Mayo :
Spain 's next climbing talent , winner at L'Alpe d'Huez .
Gloriously inconsistent , but livened up the race .
Alexandr Vinokourov : Fought Armstrong all the way , attacking on every mountain until his legs gave out .
Tyler Hamilton : Went through the pain barrier daily , with an injury that would have put any normal man off work for three weeks .
The public : Decorated their villages as never before with a proliferation of garlanded bicycles , cows in cycling kit and giant cyclists .
VILLAINS
The public : Sometimes lost the plot and endangered the participants .
Armstrong 's crash at Luz - Ardiden was not the only crowd - related incident .
The unions : A mix of activists varying from Confédération Paysanne to part - time actors tried to stop the race and failed .
Alessandro Petacchi :
The Italian sprinter took four stages in the first week and went home at the sight of the first hill .
France 's cyclists : With the exception of Richard Virenque , failed to live up to the occasion .
A nation still awaits .

2003-07-26,"Stage crashes have dominated this Tour de France , and they played a key role again as Jan Ullrich 's challenge to Lance Armstrong ended on a slippery roundabout , virtually guaranteeing the Texan his fifth Tour win in a row , while fortune finally smiled on David Millar , winner of the stage in spite of falling himself .
France 's heatwave ended with a vengeance : leaden skies , torrential rain that turned the roads into a skating risk , and a howling gale out of the west bending the trees and driving the riders to average well over 30 mph for the stage .
The conditions were what the French call apocalyptique , and on the final six miles through the streets of Nantes they were positively dangerous with roundabouts , traffic islands and pedestrian crossings to negotiate , along with road surfaces coated with a film of oil .
In these conditions , the final showdown between Ullrich and Armstrong turned into a lottery , with the desire for speed tempered by the paramount need to stay upright .
Ullrich started the faster , gambled on using a large gear , but never opened a gap that suggested he would close the 1min 5sec that separated him from Armstrong at the start .
The pair were never separated by more than half - a - dozen seconds until the incident 12 kilometres from the finish that effectively settled the Tour .
Ullrich rode into a roundabout at about 30 mph , looked to have chosen the right line , but felt his front wheel skid slightly .
He adjusted with the back wheel , lost control and slid across the tarmac into the hay bales .
That ended the German 's challenge .
He was clearly shaken and on the next severe turn , came close to riding straight on and into a banner demanding the liberation of Jose Bove .
It also caused Armstrong to slow down , as he suddenly received a stern reminder of the risks , so the American took the final corners at almost walking pace , before crossing the line with his fist clenched , a huge grin on his face .
His lead at the finish over Ullrich was 11 seconds , giving him a 1min 16 second advantage overall , meaning that his place among the legendary winners of five Tours , Jacques Anquetil , Eddy Merckx , Bernard Hinault and Miguel Induraín , is all but sealed . '
My thing today was to start gently and ride my tempo , ' said Armstrong . '
I have a minute 's lead , it was n't neces sary to take risks on the corners in the rain .
When I heard Jan had crashed I said to myself , "" careful , careful , do n't take any risks "" .
I knew the last 10 km were dangerous , with a lot of roundabouts and paint on the road
so I slowed up a lot . '
For Millar , stage victory came as a complete surprise .
He fell off in the final kilometres , as did several others including the German Uwe Peschel , who broke a rib .
He finished half an hour before Armstrong had even left the start ramp , and clearly expected the American and the German to beat his time .
Instead , both Ullrich and Armstrong rode the end of the stage with the utmost caution , Ullrich clearly fazed by his fall and unable to calculate the right speed for the corners , and Armstrong taking each turn at walking pace to avoid his third crash of the Tour .
The upshot was that Millar wound up with the third Tour stage win of his career , in four starts , and with a result that made up for his appalling ill - luck three weeks ago , when a derailed chain cost him victory in the prologue .
Since then his Tour had turned into a nightmare due to a chest infection that left him with coughing fits and brought him to the brink of quitting the race in the Pyrenees , where on one stage he spent 75 miles chasing the backmarkers . '
I 've had three weeks of problems , and today I 'm happy , not so much because I 've won , but because I actually feel well for the first time in ages , ' he said .
' I 'm just happy to have good health again , not to suffer on the bike , I could take real pleasure in riding today . '
As a final reminder of the impact that crashes have had on this race , the American Tyler Hamilton took second on the stage , just nine seconds behind Millar , and moved to fourth overall , broken collarbone notwithstanding .

2003-07-27,"In the end the triumphal march did not go totally to plan for Lance Armstrong .
Yesterday , in honour of the Tour 's centenary , he and his US Postal Service team - mates dressed up in what they described as "" retro "" outfits , a sort of battleship grey rather than their usual dark blue .
It earned them a £ 3,100 fine for "" equipment that did not conform with the rules "" .
Given all that had gone wrong for Armstrong en route to his narrow victory over Jan Ullrich and his accession to the elite group who have won five Tours de France , that was a mere bagatelle , as was the fact that yesterday he finished 112th , dropping 15sec to Jan Ullrich .
All that mattered was the result .
"" I have won and survived this Tour , "" said the Texan .
"" I have dodged a lot of bullets .
This was absolutely the most difficult year for many reasons . ""
He also admitted : "" Physically I have not been super ; tactically I have made some bad mistakes .
My level this year was not acceptable . ""
On Saturday , in the deluge in Nantes , as Armstrong pulled on the yellow jersey after ensuring victory primarily by staying upright on roads which were barely fit for racing , the five - times Tour winner Bernard Hinault said to him : "" Welcome to the club . ""
Less than seven years after being close to death with testicular cancer , Armstrong has equalled Hinault , the late Jacques Anquetil , his close friend Eddy Merckx and the genial Miguel Indurain in winning five Tours , and has followed "" Big Mig "" in taking five in a row .
He will , he says , return next year to try for the absolute record : a sixth Tour .
"" I wo n't come back to take second but to return to the level I had in the first four victories . ""
The denouement on Saturday was , compared with the suspense of the preceding 13 days , a washout .
At the end of the hottest Tour since 1990 , a rainstorm that closed Nantes airport turned the roads in the great port into a skating rink .
It fell to Ullrich , 1min 5sec behind that morning , to set the pace in the hope that Armstrong would panic and come a cropper , but it was the German who fell .
His front wheel skittered as he rode into a roundabout , he compensated momentarily and his back wheel flew from under him , sending him sliding across the sodden road in a shower of sparks as his pedal scraped the tarmac .
His challenge to Armstrong left him down among the plastic- covered straw bales in the gutter .
The crash ended the contest , and ensured the stage win for Britain 's David Millar : both men concluded it was better to stay upright and in one piece than fight any more . ""
With a minute 's advantage it was n't my responsibility to take risks , "" said Armstrong .
"" The team reminded me , "" He 's the one who has to win . '
At times both my wheels were sliding ; it was a reminder that the difference between staying up and going down is very fine . ""
As he had all through the Tour - at Gap , where he was two metres behind Joseba Beloki as he fell , at Luz Ardiden , where the crash cracked his frame but it held up - he rode his luck .
"" I 'd rather be lucky than good , "" he concluded .
It could be argued that he made his own luck , in twice carefully going over the time - trial course , whereas Ullrich merely watched a video .
It was not the perfect suspense - filled shoot - out it might have been , but it was apposite : the centenary Tour will be remembered as the Tour of chutes :
Armstrong 's excursion into a field in the Alps ; Beloki splattered on the melting tarmac near Gap ; Armstrong again , tangled up in a fan 's freebie bag at the foot of the Luz Ardiden climb ; the field in one great heap at the finish line in Meaux on day one .
There was one issue remaining to be settled yesterday : the green points jersey , where Baden Cooke began the day only two points behind last year 's winner , his fellow Australian Robbie McEwen .
The sprinters tried their hardest to end the Tour with one final pile - up , jostling and barging as they sped across the Place de la Concorde , and McEwen and Cooke could not have been closer as they crossed the line , their shoulders entwined like The Lovers of the Pont Neuf , but on two wheels and at 45 mph .
Cooke 's front wheel was fractionally ahead , to ensure he snatched back the green jersey , but both were just behind the surprise stage winner , Jean - Patrick Nazon of France , who had worn the yellow jersey for a single day , during the team time - trial from Joinville to Saint Dizier .
A forgotten man since then , yesterday he found the gap at the right time and sped past Cooke and McEwen .
This had been a pitiful race for the home cyclists , but Nazon 's win - the first for a Frenchman on the Champs in 10 Tours - ensured they at least finished on a high note , with Nazon falling into the arms of his brother Damien , who was 10th for a rival team , Brioches la Boulangère , but still crossed the line with his arms in the air .
France has not won the Tour since 1985 , in which time America has taken eight wins , but in one sense its winner could not be more appropriate .
To reach its 100th year , the Tour has kept going through sabotage , riots , strikes and drug scandals .
Armstrong has overcome advanced cancer , a police investigation and drug allegations - not to mention this year 's crashes , dehydration , and illness - to join the nonpareils of his sport .
Cycling 's great survivor has triumphed in sport 's great survivor ."
2003-07-27,"Britain 's only Tour representative , David Millar , has run the full gamut of emotions in this year 's race , as he has tended to each July since his debut in 2000 , and yesterday he was still trying to come to terms with his shock stage win on Saturday in Nantes .
The third stage win of the Scot 's four Tours came in freakish style .
He finished the 31-mile time - trial from Pornic to Nantes 45 minutes before Lance Armstrong and Jan Ullrich left the start ramp , knew he had managed a fast ride - in the event his average speed of almost 35 mph was the second - fastest Tour time - trial ever - but did not dare believe he might win .
"" I started to think about it when I saw Ullrich start , "" said Millar .
"" I knew from the way he tackled the first kilometre that he was going to crash , and when he crashed I figured I could win .
He was stopped dead in the corners , just like I was . ""
Having changed , he watched part of the event on television crushed among the Tour fans in a buvette , a makeshift tent erected to sell drinks and hot dogs near the finish .
Like Ullrich , like many others in the field , Millar was a victim of the foul conditions , toppling over on a patch of oil some two miles from the finish .
"" I was taking it so carefully .
I took the whole thing really carefully .
My bike was completely upright when I fell , not leaning at all , it just went down and there was nothing I could do . ""
In a time - trial I have a lot of ability to stay cool , so I did n't get stressed , even when the mechanic was trying to get my chain back on and did n't manage it .
It was like , ' I 've crashed , oh well ' .
I figured 50 % of the bunch were going to crash today .
I had no illusions that I could win , so I just thought , ' Oh well , that 's going to be a pain in the arse to sleep on tonight ' .
"" Millar 's three stage victories place him level in the British record books with his unrelated namesake Robert , who took three mountain stages during the 80s , although both are some way behind the record holder Barry Hoban , who sprinted to eight stage wins .
It also places him level with Chris Boardman on three stage wins .
It was only 36 hours before winning in Nantes that Millar had lashed out at the Cofidis team doctor , Jean - Jacques Menuet , for not letting him quit the race when he was exhausted and ill . ""
I yelled at him , ' When are you going to let me go home ?
Will someone finally tell me to stop ?
I ca n't get better on this fucking bike . '
"" If Saturday 's stage win was freakish , in that it owed much to the fact that both Ullrich and Armstrong put the brakes on to avoid falling , it was still richly deserved .
Millar 's Tour had started in nightmarish fashion , with mechanical trouble depriving him of victory in the prologue time - trial , and leading to open conflict with his team , Cofidis .
Nine days later he made a wholehearted attempt for stage victory on Bastille Day in Gap , but was thwarted by a headwind .
By the time - trial stage 10 days ago , near Albi , he was suffering from a chest infection and en route he came close to stopping several times with coughing fits .
On one Pyrenean stage he spent 75 miles chasing the gruppetto , the bunch of non - climbers who band together for survival in the mountains , and on the leg that finished in Bayonne , close to his adopted home town of Biarritz , he again tried for the stage win but finished exhausted and ill on the coat - tails of the race .
He continued after persuasion from his team , and yesterday he could only conclude : "" They were right . """
2003-07-28,"The Franco - American cold war was rendered irrelevant by a bike race yesterday as the stars and stripes flew in all shapes and sizes just metres from Jacques Chirac 's garden fence on the Champs Elysées .
The heart of the "" axis of weasel "" , and its greatest sports event , the Tour de France , were swamped by cycling fans from across the Atlantic , who thronged to applaud Lance Armstrong 's fifth successive victory in the 2,200 mile race .
The garden of President Chirac 's official residence , the Elysée Palace , backs on to the Champs .
But the president , who is an enthusiastic cycling fan , did not lead the celebrations as Armstong took the centenary edition of the Tour to go level in cycling 's record books with greats such as Eddy Merckx , Jacques Anquetil and Miguel Indurain .
Some of the American fans had paid up to $ 11,000 ( £ 7,500 ) to attend the race , and they paraded the Champs clad in yellow jerseys , or the blue colours of Armstrong 's sponsor , the US postal service .
They were almost equalled in numbers by France 's security services , out in force because of fears of a terrorist attack .
The day before , Armstrong had said : "" In times of Franco - American tension , it 's great that American fans come here and stay in the hotels , eat in the restaurants and drink the wine "" - and the fans concurred .
"" It 's my first time in France , and I love it , "" said Luke Conover from Indiana , looking for a spot in the barriers to wave his flag after flying into Paris yesterday morning as part of a whistle - stop tour of Europe .
"" What 's gone on this year is between the politicians , and is totally irrelevant .
A Frenchman won the Indy 500 in my home town this year , so why should n't an American win this ?
"" There was one sop to wounded French pride .
At least the final sprint up the Champs went to a Frenchman , Jean - Patrick Nazon ."
2003-09-28,"What should have been a triumphant farewell from one of the sport 's best - known sponsors , the Spanish blind charity ONCE , turned into a debacle this weekend .
Not only did the team lose the Tour of Spain after leading for the entire race , the team manager Manolo Saiz lost his head and may face a lengthy ban for bringing the sport into disrepute .
Lance Armstrong 's team - mate Roberto Heras snatched the race lead - and overall victory - from ONCE 's Isidro Nozal in an epic final time - trial on Saturday to the top of the Alto de Abantos mountain outside Madrid .
Nozal had led the race for 16 stages but his strength deserted him over the seven uphill miles , and Heras overturned his 1min 55sec deficit , bursting into tears at the finish after sealing his second Vuelta win .
All that remained was yesterday 's brief stage in the centre of Madrid where the Italian sprinter Alessandro Petacchi took his fifth stage win .
Heras forged his victory by chipping away at Nozal 's lead - five minutes a week ago - in the final few days , culminating with an attack on Friday 's mountain stage over the Navacerrada pass in the Sierra de Madrid .
Nozal limited his losses but left Heras within reach before Saturday 's decider .
The wooded slopes of the Navacerrada also saw off Saiz who drove his car through the peloton and forced a television camera motorbike on to the side of the road where he and a mechanic threatened the driver and cameramen .
Saiz believed the motorbike had been assisting Heras by enabling him to sit in the slipstream , and the cameraman was on hand to capture his angry outburst : "" I shit on your whore - mother .
I will kill you and cut you into little pieces .
"" Saiz is famously intemperate - in the 1998 Tour de France he left the race with the words , "" I have stuck my finger up the Tour de France 's arse "" - and he had already threatened a marshal , but this was extreme even by his standards .
He was fined 800 Swiss Francs ( £ 400 ) and thrown off the race , which meant he was unable to support Nozal in his hour of need .
"" This is particularly serious as the whole world was able to hear Mr Saiz 's threats and insults , "" said the race 's disciplinary officer , Jean - Michel Voets .
Saiz may face an extended ban , but his future is unclear in other ways .
He has yet to announce a replacement sponsor for ONCE who are pulling out after 13 seasons .
Real Madrid have been mentioned as a possibility but the weekend 's events may have lessened any chance of a tie - up with Beckham et al ."
2003-10-10,"Scotland 's David Millar swept irresistibly to a time - trial gold medal here at the world road cycling championships yesterday , completing the 26-mile ( 41.6 km ) course more than 85sec clear of Michael Rogers of Australia in second and Germany 's Uwe Peschel in third .
But the 26-year - old time - trial specialist , who started favourite to win a world champion 's rainbow jersey in the absence of Lance Armstrong , Jan Ullrich and last year 's winner Santiago Botero , admitted he had almost worried himself out of his triumph when he arrived in Canada exhausted and anxious about his form .
"" I knew everyone expected me to win .
I was scared to death , "" Millar said .
"" Since the Tour of Spain [ in which he claimed a stage victory ] I felt terrible .
[ But ] this morning I went for a ride and for the first time in 10 days
I felt good .
It was : ' Yes !
Thank you ! ' . ""
Millar was the second last of the 44 riders to start and made a theatrical appearance with his completely black , purpose - built time - trial bike shrouded in a hotel sheet and carried into the start area by a British team official .
Moments later , Millar rushed in separately on a conventional machine .
Under unseasonably warm conditions , Millar exacted sweet revenge on Isidro Nozal , who had twice got the better of him in last month 's Vuelta , giving the Spaniard a 1 minute start and passing him en route to an unbeatable 36sec lead at the 20 km stage .
Chris Boardman took this title in 1994 and , like the Englishman , Miller wants to be Olympic champion too . ""
One of the reasons I wanted to win was because I wanted to be on the start ramp at the Olympics as the reigning world champion , "" he said ."
2003-10-24,"Faced with the task of avoiding an anticlimax after this year 's cliff - hanging centenary Tour de France , the organisers yesterday announced a radical structure for the 2004 course .
The move is an attempt to keep interest in the event simmering as Lance Armstrong goes for a record - breaking sixth successive victory .
In every recent Tour the time - trial stages have played a decisive role , by putting the mountain specialists at a disadvantage .
The 2004 Tour will include only one long , flat time - trial , on the penultimate day , but it also contains a solo leg up the most feared mountain of all , l'Alpe d'Huez , and that stage will come four days from the finish , lending the race a shape unique in the event 's history .
This will not put Armstrong at a disadvantage ; he can win such a stage .
"" It 's funny ; I was holding out hope for that , "" he said .
"" In Alpe d'Huez the gaps in the times could be substantial . ""
But the fact that there is no long time - trial early in the race , as is usually the case , means the mountain men will be breathing down the American 's neck until the last .
The climbers such as the double Tour of Italy victor Gilberto Simoni and Spain 's Iban Mayo were delighted at a subtle change to the rules of another stage against the watch , the team time - trial .
This is a stage where contenders can lose four minutes or so if their teams are underpowered , but the rules have been adjusted so that their losses will be capped at a minute .
Two of the Tour 's greatest mountains , the Cols du Tourmalet and Galibier , are omitted , and the prospect of the Tour starting in Belgium is hardly pandering to French national pride .
There is one return to tradition , however , with the inclusion of 2 miles of the fearsome cobbled roads that feature in the Paris - Roubaix Classic introducing still more uncertainty ."
2003-12-11,"Lance Armstrong 's attempt to secure a historic sixth Tour de France title may have to be accomplished without his right - hand man in the crucial mountain stages .
Roberto Heras is on the verge of leaving the US Postal team to join Spain 's Liberty Seguros .
It is a blow to the Texan who next year faces two major challenges from Jan Ullrich and Alexander Vinokourov .
At 29 , Heras knows he must strike out on his own if he is ever to have a chance of winning the Tour himself . ""
Winning the Tour in 2005 is my prime objective , "" Heras said recently .
"" I can no longer wait .
Every year it is costing me to accept to play second fiddle . ""
Armstrong 's team says Heras can go , provided Liberty Seguros buys out his contract , which still has a little over a year left to run .
Postal did the same when it signed the Spaniard from Kelme - Costa Blanca in late 2000 . ""
Heras is nearly 30 .
He has a chance at his age to sign for a new team for three years and make a lot of money , "" Postal spokesman Jogi Muller said .
"" Our policy is not to stand in his way . ""
The wiry , mild - mannered climbing specialist was crucial in helping Armstrong negotiate difficult Alpine stages on this year 's nightmarish Tour , when the American struggled with illness , accidents , equipment problems and the creeping of advancing age .
Armstrong just held on to beat Germany 's Ullrich by 62 seconds at the finish , the narrowest of the his victories .
It clinched a fifth successive title to match the record of Spain 's Miguel Indurain ."
2004-02-28,"The Tour de France organisers yesterday staged a dramatic u - turn by inviting the 2003 world champion and record - breaking sprinter Mario Cipollini - the self - styled "" fastest man in the world "" - to this year 's event after snubbing him for the past three Tours .
Cipollini 's squad , Domina Vacanze , was among seven outfits invited yesterday to make up the balance of the field , after the leading 14 teams - including Lance Armstrong 's US Postal and the German Jan Ullrich 's T - Mobile - had earned places of right via world ranking positions .
"" There is no question of a mea culpa , "" said the Tour organiser Jean - Marie Leblanc yesterday .
"" Our invitation is proof there are no hard feelings .
Cipollini phoned me about 10 days ago to say he was really keen to ride .
The first part of the Tour is longer , with more opportunities for the sprinters . ""
On his last appearance at the Tour in 1999 , Cipollini won four stages in a row , a feat achieved only once before in its history .
While in Italy he is celebrated for winning a record 42 stages of the Giro d'Italia in his 15-year career , worldwide he is celebrated for turning up at the Tour , winning sprints , wearing fancy outfits in the first week and then returning to Tuscany .
He is also legendary for wild marketing stunts .
Last year , when Cipollini was world champion , the Tour organisers ' failure to invite him to the centenary race earning them opprobrium in Italy .
The fact that "" Cipo "" was passed over in favour of a small French team caused particular offence .
In a bitter editorial headlined An Offence to the World , Angelo Zomegnan , a senior editor at La Gazzetta dello Sport , said the decision was "" a blasphemy "" .
At last year 's Tour , Cipollini 's mantle of fastest sprinter went to a fellow Italian , Alessandro Petacchi , 30 , who won four early stages in just five days .
Petacchi 's clash with Cipollini , who is a little past his sell - by date at 37 , will be eagerly awaited ."
2004-03-05,"The confrontation between Lance Armstrong and Jan Ullrich in this year 's Tour de France may be 130 days away
but yesterday the American showed he is already well ahead , as the two men went head to head in a time - trial for the first and last time before they meet again at the Tour 's prologue in Liège on July 3 .
There , Armstrong will be going for a record sixth Tour win , and Ullrich for a second title after a run of five second places .
Bizarrely , however , in view of their long - standing rivalry , the only race in which they share the same road space before the Tour is this week 's Tour of Murcia , a relatively obscure event in southern Spain .
It is early days yet , and both men are well short of their July best - Armstrong has completed one stage race , Ullrich only a single - day event - but already the American is the fitter , as Ullrich 's preparation has been delayed by an attack of flu .
On Wednesday the two men shared a cheesy handshake for the cameras before the start of the first road stage , with Ullrich having to be rounded up for the photo - opportunity - not because he did not want to meet Armstrong , but because he simply had no idea that anyone was interested .
Yesterday matters got more serious in the race 's time - trial stage over 21.3 km ( 13.3 miles ) around the town of Lorca .
The "" race of truth "" offered the only opportunity before the Tour to compare the two men in identical conditions over the samedistance .
Armstrong , who has already won one time - trial this season , came out on top , finishing 1min 6sec ahead of Ullrich , who was not at all fazed despite the large margin .
"" I was happy with the way it went , "" he said , "" but one of my main goals was to test my new time - trial bike . ""
He added : "" Everything ran according to plan .
We have to adjust a few more details .
I have to feel good on the bike if I want to go fast .
So it was important to test the time - trial machine in competition .
I certainly did n't ride at 100 % . ""
Armstrong , on the other hand , says he is incapable of riding a time - trial at less than full throttle , and he now lies second in the overall standings behind yesterday 's winner , the Spaniard Jose - Ivan Gutierrez .
Both accept that there are many miles to go yet , but the mind games have begun .
After his victory last week in Portugal , Armstrong said that if he had heard Ullrich was winning so early in the season , he would go and do an extra 50 press - ups , and he has begun questioning the structure of the German 's super - strong T - Mobile squad .
Now , the pressure on Ullrich has ratcheted up another notch ."
2004-03-06,"The five - times Tour de France winner Lance Armstrong has written an open letter criticising comments by the World Anti - Doping Agency president Dick Pound suggesting that doping is rife in cycling .
Pound made the comments to the French newspaper Le Monde last Saturday .
"" On behalf of myself and the professional cycling community , I am compelled to address statements made by Mr Dick Pound , "" Armstrong said in a letter to the sports daily L'Equipe yesterday .
"" I am saddened that a person with such responsibilities can issue such long - range declarations that clearly mean me or my colleagues are taking drugs , "" the 32-year - old American added . ""
Mr Pound , if you truly want athletes to be clean , go fight for that rather than slinging dirt at them in such an irresponsible manner .
Focus your efforts on the fight against doping rather than spending your time accusing innocent athletes without any evidence other than your own speculation .
"" My eyes are wide open . . .
[ but ] the way Mr Pound is pointing the finger of shame at us is offensive . ""
Armstrong 's sport has , of course , been hit by several doping scandals in recent years and yesterday French police added cocaine to the list of prohibited substances they have found in their investigation of the Cofidis team .
In January the French drug squad seized medical records of riders when they raided Cofidis headquarters and the office of a team doctor after a nine - month probe in which testosterone , the blood - booster EPO and amphetamines were found in riders ' possession .
· The season 's first major stage race , the eight - day 800-mile Paris - Nice , starts tomorrow with a time - trial in which Bradley Wiggins and David Millar , two of Britain 's best hopes for Olympic medals in Athens , will test their form ."
2004-04-27,"Lance Armstrong 's principal rival Jan Ullrich is currently unable to race because he lacks fitness , but his German team T - Mobile yesterday denied there was any panic about his chances of denying the Texan a record sixth Tour de France victory this summer .
"" There is no drama , no crisis .
It is an uncomfortable situation ; we have to cope with it and we will cope with it , "" the team spokesman Luuc Eisenga said yesterday .
But with only 10 weeks to go before the race starts , the contrast between Ullrich 's struggles and Armstrong 's effervescent fitness is glaring .
Over the weekend the Texan took the overall title in the Tour of Georgia , winning two stages along the way to take his victory tally this year to four .
For a man who was felt to be in decline at last year 's Tour , which he did not take in his customary dominant style , he looks in fine form .
Ullrich , by contrast , had to withdraw from two events last week , the Amstel Gold and Liège - Bastogne - Liège World Cup races , because he was not considered fit enough to gain any benefit from competing .
Oddly , he had written on his internet site earlier in the week : "" I feel better and better and am in total harmony with my objectives . ""
He also abandoned the midweek classic Flèche Wallonne after 100 kilometres , saying : "" It was too hard , given my current form .
Every kilometre felt hard . ""
He will not contest Germany 's biggest spring event , this Saturday 's grand prix of Frankfurt . ""
Obviously the form of a Tour contender is always a concern , but that 's different from it being a worry , "" said Eisenga .
"" We would have loved for him to ride one or two classics but we have to live with what we have got .
We are not worried about the Tour de France . ""
"" I probably underestimated the fact that I 'm another year older , "" said Ullrich , 30 .
""
Or I overestimated my body .
The amount of effort it takes to ride continues to increase .
That 's what I 've learned this spring . ""
In America , Armstrong must have followed the weekend 's racing with interest .
Though Ullrich is below par and the 2002 Tour runner - up Joseba Beloki is struggling to regain fitness after his crash last year , two other dangermen are looking good ; Alexandre Vinokourov , who finished third last year , was a close third in Liège on Sunday , and Tyler Hamilton , fourth in 2003 , was also in the frame .
Ullrich 's fight to gain fitness for the Tour de France is as much a part of the cycling spring as leaves on the trees and long evenings .
Since taking his only Tour win in 1997 he has gauged his build - up to the Tour correctly only once , last year , when he pushed Armstrong to the final weekend and lost by barely a minute .
In 1998 , 2000 and 2001 he had to engage in a desperate battle to find fitness and lose weight , and this year looks like being the same : he is currently ensconced in his home in Switzerland with his personal manager Rudy Pevenage and training for his next race at the end of May.
Ullrich 's travails have prompted regular criticism within the cycling world .
Eddy Merckx , the sport 's nonpareil in the early 1970s , commented : "" As usual he is clearly a few kilos overweight and has not worked hard enough . ""
For T - Mobile , who as Telekom have guided Ullrich since he turned professional in 1995 , there is , as well as deja vu , a sense of business as usual . ""
Jan is a different kind of rider compared to Lance , "" said Eisenga . ""
He has experienced this kind of situation in the past and has coped well .
We are confident he will be ready for the Tour . """
2004-05-08,"The local favourite Gilberto Simoni goes for a third win in four years when the Giro d'Italia starts today in Genoa , setting himself up for a possible challenge to Lance Armstrong 's supremacy in the Tour de France .
But most thoughts among the fans will turn to the nation 's late favourite son , the 1998 winner Marco Pantani , who died of cocaine addiction on St Valentine 's night .
Pantani will be especially remembered on one of the mountain climbs , the Mortirolo , but it is inevitable that his admirers will make their pres ence felt throughout and that riders will dedicate their stage victories to his memory .
Three recent Giri - 1999 , 2001 and 2002 - were hit by cataclysmic drug scandals , and Pantani 's passing will merely make this year 's race more subdued .
The only Briton competing is Charly Wegelius , who will race his second Giro for the De Nardi team in the service of the Ukrainian Sergei Honchar . ""
Among the riders , no one really talks about Pantani any more , "" he said , "" because people do n't want to go over the same things again and again , but I think we 'll see his fans out in the mountains , loads of banners , that kind of thing . ""
Because this is an event intended to unite Italy - as the Giro has done since the second world war - the symbolic town of Trieste will be visited on the 50th anniversary of its accession to the republic .
There are also brief incursions into Croatia and Slovenia .
If Simoni achieves his third victory in four years it will be a feat placing him on a level with the greats of Italian cycling .
The outright record of five victories belongs to Eddy Merckx and Alfredo Binda , but no rider has taken three wins since Felice Gimondi back in 1976 , and only four others have done that since the race was founded in 1909 .
"" I started the season much slower than last year and so I 'll start the Giro with not as good form as last year , "" said Simoni , pointing to the 2000 winner Stefano Garzelli as his main rival .
He will not be drawn on his chances . ""
For the moment the only sure thing is that I 'm the only one to have the courage to try and win both major stage races in the same year . ""
Today 's prologue time - trial will favour Australia 's Brad McGee , winner of that stage in last year 's Tour de France .
Tomorrow , en route to the vineyard centre of Alba , attention will turn to the duel between the sprinters Mario Cipollini and Alessandro Petacchi .
Cipollini took the record for career Giro stage wins , 42 , last year but did not finish the race and was eclipsed by the younger man , who won six stages and added four in the Tour de France .
Just as Simoni 's progress in the mountains will be watched closely by Armstrong , the sprinters ' battle will be a harbinger of bigger things to come in July .
· Lawyers for the Lithuanian Raimondas Rumsas , third finisher in the 2001 Tour de France , yesterday said an international warrant had been issued for his arrest on drugs charges relating to banned substances seized in a car driven by his wife in July 2001 ."
2004-06-02,"Riders of the calibre of Lance Armstrong and Jan Ullrich may appear on the nation 's streets this September in a revamped Tour of Britain .
It will be the first time in five years that the event , which is Britain 's equivalent of the Tour de France and will be held over five days , has been staged .
The race has been given elite status by the Union Cycliste Internationale , the sport 's governing body , as it will feature 16 of the world 's top teams .
The organisers say they have modelled the Tour of Britain on the Tour de France in that there will be no principal sponsor but a number of backers from public and private companies who will be involved with the different stages .
This , it is hoped , will help avoid the financial problems that have prevented it from being staged for the past five years .
The Tour of Britain will take place between September 1 - 5 , with the final stage in central London .
It will be televised live by the BBC , which will also be covering the rest of the event .
The first stage is planned to take place in the north - west of England , followed by a second through Yorkshire .
Other stages will take place in the east midlands and south Wales .
An estimated four million people are expected to watch the different stages of the Tour of Britain and organisers claim the event will create a "" community dynamic "" wherever it goes and allow towns and cities to benefit economically from its presence .
The Tour has the support of the Department of Culture , Media and Sport , a number of regional development agencies , tourism organisations and local authorities .
Organisers are hoping that if it proves to be a success then it may go on to form part of the new UCI Pro Tour which starts in 2005 .
They also claim that it could help Britain secure other major sporting events and provide experience in how to stage them .
The Tour is being organised by SweetSpo , a specialist sports marketing and events company .
Peter Moore of SweetSpo said : "" The Tour of Britain will be one of the most prestigious sporting events that Britain will stage every year for the foreseeable future .
"" It can count upon a huge residue of goodwill and support and , as a sporting spectacle that tours the country , it has the capacity to reach and influence huge numbers of people on their own doorstep .
It ticks all the right boxes for such a wide variety of organisations that have so much to gain from being associated with this world - class sporting event . """
2004-06-15,"Five - time Tour de France winner Lance Armstrong is set to sue the Sunday Times and its chief sports writer David Walsh over what he claims were false allegations that he took performance - enhancing drugs .
The champion cyclist has instructed law firm Schillings to launch a libel suit in the high court tomorrow seeking "" substantial damages "" .
Armstrong is also seeking an injunction banning the Sunday Times from repeating the allegations , originally contained in a book written by Walsh and French journalist Pierre Ballester entitled LA Confidential - The Secrets of Lance Armstrong .
The champion cyclist , who has always denied taking any performance - enhancing drugs , is also suing the French newspaper L'Express , which has published extracts from the book .
Schillings said Armstrong had reacted with "" concern and dismay "" to allegations made in Walsh 's book . ""
The allegations appear in a forthcoming book entitled LA Confidential , co - written with Pierre Ballester and published in France .
Extracts from the book have appeared in L'Express and some of the book 's allegations were repeated in the Sunday Times , "" the firm said in a statement .
The Sunday Times ' sports section published a full - page account at the weekend of the allegations contained in Walsh 's book and the resulting fall - out between the two .
The article , written by the deputy sports editor , Alan English , recounted how Armstrong had reacted to the book , including his description of Walsh as "" the worst journalist I know "" in a Dutch newspaper last week .
Two days later , it said , a letter arrived at the Sunday Times ' offices from the cyclist 's lawyers saying Armstrong had never taken performance - enhancing drugs and warning that any suggestion he had done so would trigger a "" declaration of legal warfare "" by Armstrong .
English wrote that the contents of Walsh 's book were a strictly guarded secret but that it "" raises serious new questions about drug - taking in professional cycling "" .
Walsh has reported on the Tour de France 18 times .
Three months ago he was voted sports writer of the year for the third time at the British Press Awards .

The same thing is being said of Armstrong after a below - par performance in his final Tour warm - up race , the Dauphiné Libéré , and there will be speculation as to why the Colombian Victor Hugo Peña , who wore the yellow jersey in last year 's Tour , has been dropped in favour of a littleknown Spaniard , Benjamin Noval , a Tour debutant .
Armstrong 's team manager Johan Bruyneel appeared to agree yesterday that the selection of the 25-year - old Noval will be a risk when the race starts in Liège on July 3 . ""
As for Noval , I selected fitness over experience .
This will be his first Tour [ de France ] but he has raced in three Tours of Spain .
He may be nervous in the beginning but that 's the risk you have to take . ""
Without Peña the team will be weaker on the flat stages , particularly in the team time - trial .
Also missing will be the double Tour of Spain winner Roberto Heras , a part of the set - up since 2001 , so the team should not be as strong in the mountain stages either .
Heras , who this time will lead the Spanish Liberty Seguros team , is replaced by the Portuguese rider Jose Azevedo , whose best finish in the Tour is sixth in 2002 .
The rest of the team is one of the most settled units in professional cycling .
It includes the Olympic time - trial champion Viatcheslav Ekimov , riding his 14th Tour at the age of 38 , and the American George Hincapie , the only survivor from the largely US team that helped Armstrong to his first victory in 1999 .
The American Floyd Landis , the Czech Pavel Padrnos and the Spaniards Jose Luis Rubiera and Manuel "" Triki "" Beltran complete the team .
The T - Mobile squad of Armstrong 's perennial challenger , Jan Ullrich , will be announced tomorrow .
It will be without the injured Alexandr Vinokourov , third in last year 's Tour ."
2004-07-01,"The first great set - piece confrontation of the Tour was eagerly anticipated and it took place yesterday , the eve of the race , when Lance Armstrong confronted his bete noire , the Sunday Times journalist David Walsh , co - author of the investigative book on the Texan 's career , LA Confidential , which is the subject of legal proceedings in London and Paris .
Walsh , who exposed Armstrong 's links with the Italian trainer Michele Ferrari , currently in court on drugs allegations , sat a few yards from the Texan , separated only by a bank of cameras and a baize table as the five - times Tour winner gave his press conference .
LA Confidential , which contains the extensive testimony of Emma O'Reilly , a former masseuse in Armstrong 's US Postal Service team , was mentioned once amid banalities about his form ( "" I feel stronger than last year "" ) , his rock - star girlfriend Sheryl Crow ( "" she 's here "" ) and the course .
The question asked most here , usually in a whisper , is "" have you read the book ? "" but Armstrong limited himself to a single Blue Peter - style statement , delivered with the sarcastic rider "" especially because our esteemed author is here "" .
"" I think extraordinary declarations must be followed up with extraordinary proof .
Mr Walsh and [ co - writer ]
Mr Ballester have worked for four or five years and have not come up with extraordinary proof .
The case is complicated and long but I will spend whatever it takes and however long it takes . ""
The defending champion has sought an injunction against the book asking that a card be inserted stating that it contains defamatory material .
The case was thrown out by a Paris judge last week but his appeal is due to be heard today .
Armstrong has made other accusations , notably that the writers "" spoke to hundreds , perhaps thousands of people and found only two willing to make totally false accusations "" .
The writers , however , insist that theirs is a serious investigation and they are merely presenting the information for the public to make up their minds .
Armstrong was more approving of the Tour organisers ' decision to refuse entry to riders involved in doping inquiries .
The Italian Danilo di Luca , who was brought to the race by the Saeco Coffee Machines team but has been placed under investigation with 14 other riders in Italy over doping allegations , was refused yesterday .
Tour organisers are examining the cases of three other riders : the Italians Stefano Zanini and Andrea Peron and the Czech Pavel Padrnos , a team - mate of Armstrong .
The cases date back to 2001 , in Italy , and their status is unclear .
There was no doubt over the case of the Spaniard Gorka González , who was thrown out yesterday after being found "" unhealthy "" in the blood tests carried out on all cyclists before the Tour begins .
He was found with an abnormal level of reticulocytes - young blood cells - which are checked to restrict the administration of EPO .
While not officially a drug test , he will be examined further and will not race until declared "" healthy "" ."
2004-07-03,"Alastair Campbell is n't exactly a big favourite in British broadcasting circles , so it 's with some interest that we turn to his chat show debut , Alastair Campbell Interviews Lance Armstrong ( Channel Five ) .
Armstrong , five - times Tour de France winner , cancer survivor and boyfriend of Sheryl Crow , seemed like an extremely intelligent , determined young man of whom any mother would be proud .
But let 's face it , nobody was watching the show for him .
We wanted to see how Campbell shaped up as a host and interviewer .
Campbell has a dour screen persona , no doubt , but it was his line of interrogation that put him in the second division .
Questions such as "" What 's it like , the Tour de France ? ""
and "" What was it like , the moment you got cancer ? "" are not the work of a grand inquisitor .
Fortunately for Campbell , his subject was thoughtful and articulate , and spoke with wisdom and humility .
What was going on under the surface was much more interesting .
There was a distinct suspicion that Armstrong had been chosen not just because he 's a great athlete , but also because he 's a mouthpiece for certain views towards which Campbell may be sympathetic .
There was much talk of "" getting another chance "" and "" coming out the other side "" of bad experiences .
Armstrong said : "" I like to know everything that 's going on , "" which seemed to mark a bonding moment .
This was the first in an occasional series of Campbell chats ; his future choice of guests will confirm whether the parallels between Armstrong 's heroic struggles and Campbell 's recent professional experiences were more than coincidence .
I 'd love to see a quiz show on a Friday night that does n't try to subvert the genre .
Headjam ( BBC3 ) was very nearly that .
Contestants ( two slightly famous , two not ) were asked lots of questions about popular culture , then there was a final in which the winner had to memorise eight answers before giving them , which was fun to play at home .
Occasionally host Vernon Kay tried to send it up , but , by and large , he resisted the urge to be ironic and was entertaining .
There were one or two toe - curling moments ( please , no more Bruce Forsyth impersonations ) but Headjam looks set to become a solid BBC3 workhorse ."
2004-07-03,"Short of actually winning the brief prologue time trial , which would have been of debatable benefit , Lance Armstrong could hardly have made a more satisfactory start to his bid to take a record sixth Tour de France .
Tours can be won and lost by seconds , and Armstrong is already ahead of all the danger men .
The Texan cancer survivor , in the silky - smooth form of his best days , was narrowly beaten over six kilometres in the heart of the ' Ardent City ' by the 23-year - old Swiss Fabian Cancellara , who covered the course in six minutes 52 seconds .
However , Armstrong gained vital seconds and psychological points over all his rivals , with Jan Ullrich putting in a below - par performance to lose 15 seconds to the five - time winner to finish in a morale - sapping sixteenth place .
Cancellara is a specialist , with 10 professional time - trial wins to his name to add to two junior world time - trial title . '
I came to win today , but my objective is just to finish in Paris , ' he said after managing the third - fastest average speed in a Tour time trial .
With light rain dampening parts of the course , and a buffeting wind gusting off the river Moselle , back wheels skittered on corners and bounced on the cobbled avenues .
These were not conditions for lightweight mountain climbers , and while Iban Mayo held his own for twenty - sixth , 19 seconds behind Armstrong , Roberto Heras is already 35 seconds adrift .
Tyler Hamilton , widely fancied as a serious threat this year , struggled to manage eighteenth , while the prologue threw up two surprises : Christophe Moreau , best Frenchman last year and regarded as an outside bet for the podium , managed eighth , while last year 's winner , Brad McGee of Australia , could only take fourth after spending Friday in bed suffering from a nervous headache .
Norwegian national champion Thor Hushovd managed fifth yesterday ; the former world under-23 champion can also sprint and will be favourite to relieve Cancellara of the yellow jersey today ."
2004-07-03,"In the history of a race built on epic head - to - head encounters , Lance Armstrong 's four - year , four - Tour rivalry with Jan Ullrich is one of the longest and the most closely fought .
Today 's time - trial is a brief encounter but the seconds will be counted and the runes read as intensely they have been since the pair first met in 2000 .
Theirs is a shared history that goes back to 1993 , and a showery , cool weekend in Oslo .
In that year 's world road - race championships Ullrich became one of the youngest amateur champions ; Armstrong one of the youngest professional title winners .
None present then would have dreamed that , nearly 11 years on , the pair would have turned into a double act as distinctive as Jacques Anquetil and Raymond Poulidor whose battles in the early 1960s , and in one Tour , 1964 , have come to define the entire race for French people of a certain age .
In the next three weeks , as the Texan cancer survivor searches for his sixth Tour , the absolute record , Ullrich will again be his most feared challenger in a classic contest between a massively talented but mentally fragile athlete , and a less gifted but indomitable individual .
That is the view of the Tour organiser , Jean - Marie Leblanc : "" Armstrong is perhaps not the most physically gifted , if you compare him to Ullrich , who I would describe as a thoroughbred , but he has won five Tours thanks to his mental strength , his character , his capacity for hard work .
"" A more in - depth analysis comes from Ullrich 's mentor of the last 12 years , Rudy Pevenage . ""
Jan can not ride away with a blistering uphill attack .
That remains the speciality of Lance .
As for race instinct , Lance is perhaps a bit better , but Jan has still learned to react well in the last few years . ""
Of the three Tours they have contested , 2001 provided two unforgettable images :
Armstrong looking back at Ullrich as the German faltered at the foot of l'Alpe d'Huez , and a handshake of mutual recognition as they approached the finish at the Pyrenean ski station of Luz Ardiden .
Since last year , there is a new edge .
Not only did Ullrich come closer than ever to beating the Texan ( a mere minute behind in Paris ) , he inflicted the only serious defeat of Armstrong 's five wins , in a baking - hot time - trial among the extinct coal mines north of Toulouse .
The pair differ over what happened after Armstrong fell off at the foot of the climb to Luz Ardiden , where he was to mount the race - winning attack .
Television evidence suggested the German waited - as the Texan had when Ullrich fell off on a descent in 2001 - but Armstrong implies the opposite .
Ullrich will not say it openly , but that rankles .
"" It 's weird , because straight after the finish he thanked me for waiting . ""
For all the difference in their backgrounds - Armstrong brought up in Texas , Ullrich in the old East Germany - they have a troubled childhood in common : Armstrong 's father famously disappeared before he was born while Ullrich 's auto - biography , All or Nothing , describes his father as an alcoholic who terrorised the family .
Among the constant questioning of Armstrong 's choice of coaches and loudly voiced doubts about the legitimacy of his victories , it is often forgotten that it is Ullrich who has served a drug ban , in 2002 , after a positive test for amphetamines he was given in a nightclub .
And few questions are asked about his trainer , Peter Becker , founder of the two - wheeled production line that created a string of East German champions .
There are distant resonances to the prospect of an American and a German doing battle in Liège : Ullrich , however , looks to have won his personal Battle of the Bulge .
A crash training stint saw him slough off the weight that worried him - as usual - in the spring ; when he turned up on Thursday for the pre - Tour medical he looked as lean as in his first time , 1996 , when he was a surprise second to his then team - mate Bjarne Riis .
"" I have been second often enough - this year I have put everything on getting back to the top , "" he said .
"" Everything else has been subordinate to this .
I am convinced I can beat Armstrong . ""
Armstrong , as ever , throws the pressure back .
"" I think it will be my toughest Tour yet .
I think Jan Ullrich is better prepared than we expected , better than in other years .
Jan tends to come into the race a bit below his best and then is very good in the final week . ""
With two time - trials , one uphill to l'Alpe d'Huez , in the final five days , that could be decisive .

Britain 's time - trial world champion David Millar , who has admitted taking the illegal substance EPO , has withdrawn from the Olympic Games .
Tyler Hamilton Age 33 Tours 7 Stage wins 1 Armstrong 's former domestique , the quiet New Englander has blossomed since striking out on his own , and was the unlucky hero of last year 's Tour , finishing fourth and winning a tough Pyrenean stage in spite of a broken collarbone .
Iban Mayo Age 26 Tours 2 Stage wins 1
The Basque climbing sensation won at l'Alpe d'Huez last year but lacked the stamina to match Armstrong .
This year , he was rampant in May and June , taking three stage races but may have peaked too early .
Roberto Heras Age 30 Tours 4 Stage wins Another former domestique of Armstrong 's who struck out on his own last year after taking his second Tour of Spain win .
The Spaniard is one of the finest climbers in the world but like Mayo he may suffer in the early flat stages of this Tour ."
2004-07-03,"When Lance Armstrong won his first Tour de France stage , at Verdun in 1993 , he was asked whether , in common with his namesake , Neil , he was aiming for the moon . '
Mars , ' said the brash young Texan .
His next giant step could take him into truly unknown and stellar territory : a sixth Tour de France win , the outright record that proved beyond Eddy Merckx , Bernard Hinault and Miguel Induráin .
Beating these legends is , says the Texan , not on his mind at the moment , but it has clearly entered it . '
If on 25 July I 'm in the yellow jersey then I can talk about it , but it 's a daunting task and I prefer to take it day by day .
This is a very difficult race , many things can happen ; I can flat - out lose to a better rider .
Everyone dreams of making history , but before thinking of that , I have to win this Tour . '
There are varying reasons why the big six eluded Merckx , Hinault , Induráin and the first man to win five Tours , Jacques Anquetil .
In the 1960s , when ' Master Jacques ' was in his prime , the notion of such a record simply did not apply .
In the 1970s , Merckx had the ability to win six , but in 1968 his sponsor put him in the Giro d'Italia instead and in 1973 he missed the Tour in favour of the Tour of Spain .
These might seem bizarre decisions now , but in those days the Tour did not enjoy its present overwhelming status and ranked equally with the other three - week events .
Hinault missed two Tours because of injury and was past his best when he finished second in his last , in 1986 .
Induráin was simply over the hill after five consecutive wins when he bid for the record 10 years after the Frenchman .
Armstrong 's record of winning five after surviving cancer will remain unique and is the main argument in favour of his making it six - the champion always has a psychological advantage in the Tour .
Weighed against this , his physical condition is open to speculation ; he is over 30 and has not looked at his best this year .
Each great cycling champion has his sell - by date and it is not yet clear whether the Texan 's is July 2004 .
Two other factors make this year 's race more open than any since 1999 , Armstrong 's first win .
To ensure that the biggest number of contenders have a chance to produce a close race and if possible a cliffhanging finale to match last year 's , the organisers have radically altered the balance of this year 's course , which is unlike anything seen in recent times .
Most importantly , they have taken the unprecedented decision to include two time - trial stages in the final four days , one straight up the Tour 's most feared climb - the eight miles of hairpin bends leading to the ski resort of l'Alpe d'Huez .
Equally vitally , the usual early , long flat time - trial , which tended to come about eight to 10 days into the race , to the detriment of the climbers , has been abandoned .
Finally , when the team time - trial takes place on Wednesday , all the teams ' losses will be capped at two - and - a - half minutes .
This again tips the balance in the climbers ' favour because in the past some have lost up to five minutes in this stage , effectively ending their race .
The other unknown quantity threatening Armstrong is the emergence of a new set of challengers .
In 2000 and 2001 , the only real threat to Armstrong came from Jan Ullrich , who , if he finishes runner - up again this year , will equal an unenviable record : six second places .
Last year , the arrival of the Basque climber , Iban Mayo , and the Kazakh Alexandr Vinokourov made the Texan 's life more complex ; this year , ' Vino ' is absent because of injury , but Ullrich and Mayo return , along with last year 's revelation , Tyler Hamilton , and a dark horse , Roberto Heras , of Spain , like Hamilton a former domestique in Armstrong 's squad and twice winner of the Tour of Spain .
Then there is the drugs issue , which will hang heavily on this Tour , as it has done on all Tours since the scandals of 1998 .
It has been given greater urgency by the dramatic confession of Britain 's David Millar to the use of erythropoietin ( EPO ) ; the drugs police have already descended on the race , stopping a team car at the border between Belgium and France on Wednesday and dismantling it , as they broaden their inquiry .
Millar 's admission that he had used EPO will focus minds .
He is not only a world champion , but a popular one , one of the most charismatic cyclists on the circuit , and was widely considered to be a leader of a ' clean ' generation of riders expected to emerge after the Festina scandal .
Much has been made of the test for EPO established in 2000 , but there have also been claims that it can be circumvented by judicious timing of injections and their quantity .
Millar 's use of it would have gone unnoticed had the drugs police not visited him as part of the inquiry into his team and this in turn puts the reliability of the tests in question .
Yesterday , Dr Mario Zorzoli , of the International Cycling Union , accepted that Millar 's case showed that tests can be fallible . '
We do n't know when he took the drug , but we know that if it 's taken a while before a test it can show up negative , ' Zorzoli said . '
It shows we need to increase the number of tests and target them more efficiently . '"
2004-07-07,"Lance Armstrong took the Tour de France yellow jersey for the first time this year when his US Postal team won the team time trial in Arras today .
US Postal clocked 1hr 12 mins 3 secs in the fourth stage from Cambrai to hand Armstrong , the five - time Tour winner , the 54th yellow jersey in his career .
Armstrong is ahead of George Hincapie and Floyd Landis , his team - mates , in the overall rankings by 10 and 16 seconds respectively .
The Swiss team Phonak came in second , more than one minute behind ( 1:13:10 ) while Spain 's Illes Baleares were third , a further eight seconds adrift .
US Postal clocked the third - best average speed in a Tour de France team time trial with 53.71 kph .
The stage was held in dreadful conditions , with rain falling steadily on a furiously windswept course ."
2004-07-08,"If Lance Armstrong eventually loses out to Tyler Hamilton or Jan Ullrich , and the margin is a handful of seconds , he will have every reason to look back at yesterday 's team time - trial and roundly curse the Tour de France 's rulebook .
For it may be that , because of that inoffensive - looking volume , Armstrong or someone else will finish the 2,000-mile race in the fastest time but not actually win it .
Yesterday the Texan 's US Postal Service team were dominant , earning him the yellow jersey and gaining their second successive win in this test of collective strength , yet a complex change in the rules to prevent weaker squads from being disadvantaged meant they were unable to ram that winning margin home .
"" There is no point in discussing it because that is the rules , "" said Armstrong , although his team manager Johan Bruyneel had called the change "" ridiculous "" .
"" I ca n't change the rules , "" Armstrong added .
"" The only consolation I can take is that when I see we put 1min 7sec on the next team
I know my team is the strongest and the best team in the race . ""
Indeed , the Postmen put in the ride of their lives to leave Hamilton 's green - clad Phonak team trailing .
The average speed of 33.5 mph in a stiff breeze and on roads which varied from flooded to merely soaking meant they were travelling for much of the 40 miles at 40 - 45 mph , allowing for taking each bend at walking speed . ""
Last year winning this stage was the highlight of my Tour de France , "" said Armstrong , adding that he had fallen in love with the team time - trial as a junior . ""
This event is something unique in cycling , because you can be four guys who are not so strong but if you work out properly how to take the pulls you can win .
"" It was a masterly , disciplined performance , and its planning and execution sum up why the Texan has made the Tour his own in the past five years .
He covered the course twice in a car as an aide - memoire to go with his previous reconnoissances .
Each rider had a pre - set place in the line so that his strength could be used to the full .
The blue train sped with the precision of a skein of geese in flight .
Armstrong was lucky , as , by and large , he has also been in the past five Tours .
Hamilton 's men suffered four punctures in the first 15 miles , destroying their rhythm , and for a few miles there was patent indecision among them whether to wait or continue .
Phonak is a hearing - aid manufacturer but communication was sadly lacking in the team it sponsors .
Among the also - rans - that is all the 20 other teams , for none was on the level of USP - there were flat tyres and crashes galore .
On a course from Cambrai to Arras via Bapaume , the historical resonances ran deep - the start in the old fortress at the heart of the Hindenburg line , the finish where the Somme offensive began , the straight wind- and rain - lashed roads through towns with hardly a single building more than 80 years old , among cornfields where each hillock seems to have its cemetery of white crosses .
The Tour 's first week has often been described as trench warfare , in that great effort is expended but not much ground gained , and in these surroundings it was perhaps appropriate that yesterday there was , if not stalemate , then no decisive breakthrough .
In past years , team time- trials have been decided on actual time taken for the first five riders in each squad to cross the line .
That time is added to each man 's overall time .
This year a bonus system was introduced , with a table of sliding time penalties according to a team 's finishing position .
It is a system which could have been devised only by the same beancounting minds that invented France 's labyrinthine employment laws , and once the slide rules had been put away it was decreed that Amstrong 's team had finished 1min 7sec ahead of Hamilton 's - but their gain was limited to 20sec .
They were 1:19 faster than Ullrich 's T - Mobile men but the German 's deficit for the day was cut to 40sec .
The New Englander and Ullrich are now eighth and 16th - 36 and 55sec behind - and can thank their lucky stars .
No one , however , would begrudge the Basque climber Ibán Mayo a bit of good fortune after his black Tuesday in Wasquehal , and his Euskaltel team managed a surprisingly coherent eighth place , disrupted only when a bike fell off one of their team cars dangerously close to a group of spectators .
Their actual deficit of 2:35 was adjusted to 1:20 .
Today 's flat run from one great cathedral city to another should see the fourth new race leader in as many days Armstrong made it plain that he would not ask his team to expend valuable energy in an attempt to cling on to the maillot jaune 2 weeks from the finish .
"" We need to conserve their strength for the second half of the race , "" he said .
"" I 'm not going to sacrifice the team to defend the lead in the north of France . ""
With the yellow jersey up for grabs , the racing should be intense .
There will be more wind and rain to numb the legs , but the riders ' nerves will again be jangling ."
2004-07-09,"Tom Boonen of Belgium won today 's sixth stage of the Tour de France , prevailing in a sprint finish in a winning time of four hours , 33 minutes and 41 seconds .
Boonen , riding for the Quick Step Davitamon team , finished ahead of second - placed Australian Stuart O'Grady and third - placed German Erik Zabel after an unsuccessful breakaway from Spanish rider Juan Antonio Flecha failed just one kilometre from home .
The race was once again marred by several spills with five - times Le Tour winner Lance Armstrong coming off his bike but remounting early in the day .
There was another pile - up at the ' flamme rouge ' - the red flag which signals there is just 1 km left to race ."
2004-07-12,"The Tour de France 's zero - tolerance approach to cyclists involved in drugs
inquiries by the police claimed two victims yesterday when the Slovenian Martin Hvastija and the Italian Stefano Casagrande , both of whom are under investigation in Italy , were excluded .
The Tour is also awaiting further information on two other riders , the Italian Stefano Zanini and Lance Armstrong 's Czech team - mate Pavel Padrnos .
Hvastija and Casagrande are not expected to participate in today 's stage .
"" We do not want them at the start , "" said the Tour organiser Jean - Marie Leblanc , who explained that the teams - Saeco for Casagrande , Alessio - Bianchi for Hvastija - had twice told the Tour that the riders were in the clear .
All four were caught up in the inquiries in San Remo and Padova that followed police raids on the 2001 Giro d'Italia .
Casagrande is under investigation regarding Eprex , a form of EPO , and a corticosteroid was the substance allegedly found in Hvastijaís possession ."
2004-07-13,"It is what the French call un coup de jeune - an influx of youth - and , as well as Lance Armstrong 's effervescent form , the usual series of horrendous crashes , and heavy rain , it is what has set the opening phase of the Tour de France apart .
It is many years since so many young riders made such an impression , and it could be that this Tour is eventually seen as a turning point , when one generation succeeded another .
When the Tour rides through Limousin today , it will be led by a 25-year - old , the French national champion Thomas Voeckler , whose tenure is likely to last to the Pyrenees at the end of the week , barring incident .
It is two years since Laurent Jalabert retired , and Richard Virenque will probably quit following the Athens Olympics , so France is urgently in need of new heroes .
Young , fresh - faced and good looking - une belle gueule as they say - Voeckler has everything it takes to be the next Virenque , if that is not a poisoned chalice .
He has an eclectic background - born in Alsace , bred in Martinique , formed as a cyclist in the Vendée .
Third overall is another 25-year - old Frenchman of whom great things are expected , Sandy Casar .
He and Voeckler accept that , eventually , Armstrong , Jan Ullrich and the rest will overtake them , but either is capable of wearing the white jersey of best young rider when the race finishes , something no home cyclist has managed since 1999 .
"" These guys are in their third or fourth year as professionals , "" said Thierry Bricaud , Voeckler 's manager at the Brioches - la - Boulangère team .
"" They have some experience , a bit of maturity .
They are also convinced of their own potential and ride intelligently .
They are not merely there to look good . ""
The rush of young blood began on the Tour 's opening day , with the prologue time trial falling to the 23-year - old Swiss , Fabian Cancellara , and has continued since then .
On Saturday , stage victory went to the youngest rider in the race , 22-year - old Filippo Pozzato of Italy .
A precocious talent , "" Pippo "" won the Tirreno - Adriatico stage race as a 20-year - old after coming to cycling from hockey , and showed a cool head to win amid a flurry of late attacks in Saint - Brieuc .
That same day , L'Equipe ran its Tour coverage under the headline Roulez jeunesse !
after the Belgian equivalent of Pippo , a strapping 23-year - old called Tom Boonen won in Angers .
Again , great things are expected of "" Big Tom "" , who has the broad shoulders of Eddy Merckx , a fine line in designer stubble , and was the object of a tug - of - love between the US Postal team and his home squad Quickstep .
By curious coincidence , it is the class of ' 98 making its mark .
The world championships that year in the Dutch town of Valkenburg were unusually wet and cold - like this Tour - and most of the young riders prominent in this Tour made their first impression there .
Cancellara was the junior time trial champion , Pozzato won silver behind him , while Thor Hushovd , winner of Sunday 's stage at Quimper , was the under-23 time trial champion that year .
Another junior world champion from 1998 is Ireland 's Mark Scanlon , and he has been quietly making an impression as well .
Scanlon figured in a 100-mile break on only the second day of the Tour , and has continually figured in the stage finishes working for his sprinters , Jean - Patrick Nazon and Jaan Kirsipuu .
His Ag2R team top the table of prize money earned so far , and he has played his part . ""
He is a very , very big hope for the future , "" said his team manager Vincent Lavenu .
"" A lot of young pros come to the Tour and find it is all a bit too much for them but Mark is showing maturity beyond his years .
"" The fact that these youngsters turned professional after the EPO - ridden mid-1990s will give rise to hope that they are not just new but clean , a suggestion which has annoyed some of the older generation .
France 's Christophe Moreau , a relic from the Festina debacle , says he is tired of the young riders going on about not doping . ""
No one doubts his sanctity , "" he said of Voeckler , "" but it hurts to hear some guys state that they are part of a new wave .
It 's as if they want to put us down like sick dogs . ""
But the young pups have arrived , and if Moreau 's grumbles are anything to go by , they may be here to stay .

2004-07-15,"Today the Tour returns to La Mongie , the grim little ski resort close to the top of the Tourmalet pass where Lance Armstrong took the race lead in 2002 .
It is the first summit finish of this Tour and , if the Texan rides to the script he has followed in each of the past five Tours , he will attack .
Though the Tour has gone Armstrong 's way so far , he faced a new challenge off the bike yesterday when his fellow countryman Greg LeMond , the triple Tour de France winner , questioned his integrity .
Armstrong frequently gives the impression that he thinks the world is against him , and he certainly has no time for Le Monde , the newspaper in which LeMond broke his silence yesterday .
"" Lance is ready to do anything to keep his secret , "" LeMond told Le Monde .
"" I do n't know how he can continue to convince everybody of his innocence . ""
Armstrong 's manager Johan Bruyneel responded : "" Le Monde is a newspaper whose intentions we know .
And if I can make a suggestion to the editor it would be that they change their sports and cycling pages into a doping page .
There 's nothing we can do to counter it . ""
The newspaper had broken the story of Armstrong 's positive test for cortisone - for which he was cleared when it was explained that it was because of the use of a skin cream - in the 1999 Tour , and in a stormy press conference the Texan asked the newspaper 's correspondent : "" Are you calling me a doper or a liar ? ""
The newspaper , regarded as the voice of the French establishment , has also criticised the organisers for their approach to doping and called for the race to be stopped .
The dispute between Armstrong and LeMond goes back to 2001 , when LeMond criticised Armstrong for his links with the controversial trainer Michele Ferrari .
"" I just wanted to dissuade him from working with a guy like Ferrari , because I was convinced that his relations with Ferrari were a disaster , "" he said .
"" The problem with Lance is that you can not talk to him .
For him you are either a liar
or you are trying to destroy cycling . ""
Le Monde and LeMond are not the only annoyances for Armstrong , who claimed yesterday that a French television station had been trying to gain access to his hotel rooms , and that he suspected they might try to plant something .
"" The scary thing is , if they do n't find anything and get frustrated . . .
well , who 's to say they wo n't put something there and say , ' Look what we 've found . '
"" On a day when doping undercurrents once more made waves the stage here was won by David Moncoutié , a rider who is adamant in his opposition to drugs .
He is the other David in David Millar 's Cofidis team and his lone win here continues their rehabilitation after a desperate spring .
This is turning into a fine Tour for the French , as Thomas Voeckler has now held the yellow jersey for longer than any Frenchman since Pascal Lino in 1992 .
Small , dark and a strong climber , Moncoutié was not only the régional of the stage but also , as a native of the Lot , the départemental .
French stage wins are rare , although this Tour has already seen three ; wins by régionaux at home are rarer still , wins by a native of the département hosting the finish are virtually unheard of .
For lovers of trivia , the last départemental stage win before yesterday was by Francis Campaner in Bordeaux on July 18 , 1974 .
Knowing his home roads , Moncoutié was aware of the perfect location to make the attack that carried him clear of his breakaway companions , the Spaniards Egoi Martínez and Juan Antonio Flecha .
He was understandably delighted but it can fairly be said that Armstrong 's Lot yesterday was not a happy one ."
2004-07-16,"The Pyrenees are famous for their capricious showers , which pour rain and hail on one mountainside while another is bathed in sunlight .
Yesterday the clouds , mist , thunder and lightning came and went , but Lance Armstrong was immutable and his rivals simply evaporated .
The race lead is not his - yet - but the race is now his to lose .
Each of Armstrong 's first four Tour wins followed the same pattern , with the Texan taking a psychological stranglehold on the first mountain - top finish .
The locations changed , the pattern was the same at Sestrieres in 1999 , Hautacam in 2000 , l'Alpe d'Huez in 2001 and here , close to the top of the Col du Tourmalet , in 2002 .
Whereas in 2003 at l'Alpe d'Huez Iban Mayo and Alexander Vinokourov had the edge , yesterday Armstrong reverted to type .
There was no one fulminating attack but , as one by one Tyler Hamilton , Jan Ullrich and Roberto Heras faded on the one - in-10-slopes , Armstrong applied the screw until only one man remained with him , the Italian Ivan Basso , the best young rider in the 2002 Tour , who was permitted to take the stage win .
Seeing every heavyweight rival struggling probably surpassed even Armstrong 's wildest hopes .
"" I do n't know how surprised you were , but I was pretty surprised , "" he said .
"" Today we started confidently .
I felt good for most of the day .
We have the best team in the race ; the question is whether or not the leader is the best . ""
There was little argument about that one .
There was no chance that Armstrong would relieve the young Frenchman Thomas Voeckler of his yellow jersey , but he almost halved Voeckler 's lead of 9min 35sec , in a single ascent , and is now only 5:24 behind .
Voeckler is suffering from "" minor digestive troubles "" .
Ullrich , Mayo and the rest merely looked to have little stomach for the fight .
Ullrich , his face a mask of pain on the first climb , ceded 2:30 and was outshone by his domestique Andreas Klöden .
Heras ceded 2:57 and Hamilton a shocking 3:27 .
For a rider who has built his season about the Tour , this was astonishing .
He has apparently been hit hard by the death of his dog , Tugboat , and yesterday his tail was very much between his legs .
Today the kaleidoscope will be shaken again , but on yesterday 's showing the men who will worry Armstrong this week come from two teams , the nominally Danish CSC , and the Spanish of the Balearic Islands squad , formerly Miguel Indurain 's Banesto .
Both have one advantage : numbers .
CSC have Basso , who looked more comfortable climbing to the finish than Armstrong , the Spaniard Carlos Sastre and the American Bobby Julich , and Illes Baleares can count on the Spanish national champion Francisco Mancebo and the Russian Denis Menchov .
Apocalyptic is a term used by the French media to describe anything from an April shower , but yesterday it would have been no surprise to see the Four Horsemen whirling over the Pic du Midi and descending through the thick cloud to the concrete apartment blocks as the hills echoed to the sound of thunder and torrential rain .
Although by the time the riders arrived the sun had returned .
The Basques were out in force , as they always are when the Tour nears Spain .
Some 85,000 are expected this weekend , and at least half of them turned up here .
Their orange T - shirts , hats and shorts , even orange codpieces proclaiming the liberty of Euskadi were sodden but proud .
Sadly , Mayo was merely sodden , losing a minute to Armstrong and any faint hopes of a place on the podium .
Voeckler punctured at the worst possible moment , just as the peloton was gathering pace up the valley before the Col d'Aspin .
He regained contact , strove manfully up the Aspin , but by the end of the stage his fight to retain his lead had a desperate feel as he zigzagged up the final kilometre , sometimes almost coming to a halt before regaining momentum .
Clouds of controversy still swirl around Armstrong .
The question yesterday was whether his Czech team - mate Pavel Padrnos would be able to continue in the race .
Padrnos will appear in a court in San Remo on October 27 charged with possession of a doping product and the Tour organisers had asked the race referees for permission to exclude him .
The Professional Cycling Council , the arm of cycling 's governing body which deals with professional racing , blocked the move , on the ground that Padrnos 's national federation had cleared him because the product involved is not on the banned list .
The PCC also requested that another rider , Stefano Zanini , remain in the race because he has served a seven - month suspension .
Patrice Clerc , head of the Tour organiser Amaury Sport Organisation , said ASO had appealed against the decision and he hinted that if the difference were not resolved the Tour organisers might not cooperate with the International Cycling Union 's ( UCI ) new ProTour , which will radically change the structure of the sport next year .
"" There is a real conflict in the positions of the UCI and Tour organisers , "" he said .
"" It has to be clarified in the next few weeks or ASO will not take part in the reorganisation of cycling . ""
Today the race heads east , with two first- and two second - category climbs before the finish , 5,000 feet up at the ski station of Plateau de Beille .
In 2002 , having won at La Mongie , Armstrong took an impregnable lead there , and he noted yesterday that "" the stages are in the same order this year , and I remember then I felt better on the second day "" .
History did not quite repeat itself yesterday but , given that the verdict of the first mountaintop finish rarely lies , he may well be in yellow this afternoon .
Hamilton 's loss tugs at hearts Tyler Hamilton , the US cyclist riding in the Tour de France who had to have his golden retriever Tugboat put down after it developed cancer , has been flooded with messages of sympathy on his website .
One fan wrote : "" Let us carry that grief for you while you finish the Tour .
And let us know how we can best honour his memory .
Win for Tugs !
We 're all still with you ! ""
Hamilton wore a black armband on the Tour on Thursday .

2004-07-16,"Lance Armstrong landed what could prove a decisive blow today with a performance which was predictable but no less devastating to two of the men who hope to deny him a record sixth Tour de France victory .
The Texan finished second behind the impressive Ivan Basso of CSC after the duo had engaged in a thrilling chase to the summit at La Mongie .
And the gallant young Frenchman Thomas Voeckler defied expectations once again by holding on to the yellow jersey with Armstrong moving up to second just over five minutes behind the 25-year - old .
But , of greater significance to the overall outcome of the race , was the fact that Armstrong established big leads over Jan Ullrich and Tyler Hamilton .
When the route for the 91st Tour was announced months ago , today 's 197.5 kilometre stage from Castelsarrasin to La Mongie was picked out as one Armstrong would attack on , just as he had two years ago .
Then , the Texan had the benefit of Roberto Heras by his side with the Spaniard taking much of the credit for dealing so effectively with the threat from Joseba Beloki , who would have to settle for second overall .
Today , however , the Texan had looked to be in trouble as his US Postal team - mates failed to give him the protection he would have expected late in the race , leaving him to battle alone against Basso .
The CSC rider won narrowly , announcing his status as a contender for the final podium , but Armstrong might have imagined he could see Paris from the finishing line , such was the disarray he had left many of his opponents in .
It is difficult to see either Hamilton - who trails his compatriot by over four minutes - and Ullrich ( over three minutes behind ) getting near to Armstrong this year after a testing day which found both men wanting .
Although the peloton left Castelsarrasin under fine sunshine , reports were soon emerging from distant La Mongie that a storm was gathering .
But the weather broke before they got there - on the punishing climb up Col d'Asprin .
And , with the rain falling , the peloton was soon strung out with the sprinters , including points leader Robbie McEwen , struggling and mostly failing to keep up .
Voeckler also looked in a bad way but there was no mercy from the front of the group where the US Postal team were setting a punishing pace as they approached the d'Asprin summit .
The Danish rider Michael Rasmussen attacked and was first over the climb .
He led through the descent and was still enjoying a slight lead as he began a final slog to La Mongie where the weather was improving .
D'Asprin had the predictable effect of splitting the peloton into several factions with US Postal represented strongly in the lead chasing group .
Rasmussen was caught but - as the men in red , white and blue continued to charge ahead - first Hamilton , then Ullrich found themselves in trouble .
Armstrong 's support fell away but there was no sign of panic from the 32-year - old , who looked around for a friendly face and - not finding one - attacked .
Basso joined him , as did Francisco Mancebo , although the Illes Balears - Banesto rider was soon dropped as the other two ducked between the crowds and beneath the snow shelters .
The Italian finished strongest but that will not have worried Armstrong , who is following a familiar path which has already led him to glory ."
2004-07-17,"Lance Armstrong 's serene progress towards what should be his sixth Tour de France can be summed up by one minor event .
The American punctured on the high - speed descent from the day 's fifth major climb , the Col d'Agnes , but that was the only glitch in two major mountain stages yesterday and on Friday which will have done much to decide this Tour .
Armstrong had hinted that yesterday 's stage over five mountain passes might cause more damage than Friday 's finish at La Mongie , and he proved right .
After winning yesterday 's stage as he did here in 2002 , he is just 22sec behind the leader Thomas Voeckler , and only the 26-year - old Italian Ivan Basso remains in a position which is even vaguely threatening .
The 1998 under-23 world champion was the winner on Friday and second place to Armstrong yesterday kept him just 1min 17sec behind the American .
This kind of margin can be lost and won on a single climb , but Basso at this level may well merely be happy to finish second . '
Ivan is very , very strong .
It was n't possible to get rid of him , ' said Armstrong . '
He 'll be good in the Alps .
It was our intention to get the race lead today .
It would have been nice to be in yellow , but Voeckler earned the jersey for another day . '
That , clearly , is only a matter of days .
As ever , the riders rode to the finish through a seething mass of spectators , and there were reminders aplenty that a repetition of Armstrong 's crash last year at Luz Ardiden was only one false move away . '
Ivan and I got through and said to each other it was unbelievable
we had made it without being killed , ' he said .
The casualty list yesterday was long , and the challengers who were defeated on Friday were routed .
The biggest casualty was Tyler Hamilton , who finished fourth last year in spite of a broken collarbone .
A relatively straightforward tumble at Angers nine days ago left him with a bruised back , making it hard for him to transfer power into his leg muscles .
He lasted almost 50 miles before climbing off his bike .
His team manager , Jacques Michaud , explained : ' He was suffering a lot , and seeing the profile of the stage today , he knew he was n't going to get through . '
Jan Ullrich , meanwhile , suffered again , and finished 2min 42sec behind .
He is now 6min 39sec behind Armstrong , and will struggle to finish in the first three , while his young team mate Andreas Kloden looks to be in better form .
Ullrich 's decline was a mere blip compared with the events of a bitter day for the orange - clad Basque team Euskaltel .
More than 85,000 of their fans were estimated to be making the trip over the Pyrenees for Friday and yesterday 's stages , and they thronged the final climb here brandishing Basque flags and posters calling for independence and the release of political prisoners .
What they saw was a catastrophe , with their hero of last year Iban Mayo coming close to abandoning on the day 's penultimate mountain , the steep , narrow Col d'Agnes .
He came in almost 40min behind .
His team - mate Haimar Zubeldia , who came fifth last year , quit with 10 miles covered .
The succession of disasters that have befallen Ullrich , Mayo and Hamilton merely underline the quality of France 's young discovery Voeckler .
His spell in the race lead has lasted 10 days , and he has a chance to wear the yellow jersey for longer than any Frenchman since Bernard Hinault in 1985 .
Having fought himself almost to a standstill on Friday , the 25-year - old , nicknamed ' Ti - Blanc ' , showed the same tenacity yesterday .
He was in trouble on the first steep climb of the day , the second category Col du Portet d'Aspet , a series of one in seven hairpins past the marble memorial to the Olympic champion Fabio Casartelli , and again later on the longer and steeper Col d'Agnes .
Each time he fought his way back to the leaders .
He was left behind by Armstrong early on the final 10-mile climb to the finish and spent the final eight miles through the cheering hordes riding a lone battle to limit his losses .
It was the equivalent of a final time trial that was fought to the second and he ended up 4min 42sec behind the Texan .
Having started with a 5min 24sec lead , he had 22sec in hand , and is likely to keep the yellow jersey at least until Tuesday .
Voeckler 's courage has epitomised a fine Tour by the home riders , who won two stages in two days on Wednesday and Thursday , the first time this has happened since 1994 .
They also lead the mountains prize , through Richard Virenque .
Voeckler 's courage has led to an upsurge of support on the roadsides , with Virenque 's position as the home darling under threat .
There were flags aplenty on the final climb to the finish here - Catalan , Basque , Norwegian and Danish to list the most numerous - but the Stars and Stripes will dominate the rest of this Tour .

2004-07-17,"Five times Tour de France winner Lance Armstrong yesterday won a commanding victory in the 205-kilometre Pyrenean mountain stage - from Lannemezan to Plateau de Beille - clearing the way to what appears a certain sixth tour win , the first rider to do so .
The American , who has survived cancer and weathered allegations - strenuously denied - of drug abuse , was bolstered in his campaign by the withdrawal with a bruised back of compatriot Tyler Hamilton .
Armstrong crushed his fellow contenders , including great rival Jan Ullrich , in the race 's 13th stage yesterday , with only a disaster or a complete meltdown likely to prevent him cementing his place as the most dominant rider of his generation .
Only Italian rider Ivan Basso managed to stay with the champion on the last of seven climbs in the Pyrenees .
With the Alps , where he excels , and two time trials left to negotiate this week , only a meltdown by Armstrong or an unforeseen accident appears to stand in the way of victory in Paris on 25 July ."
2004-07-17,"Every Second Counts , by Lance Armstrong ( Yellow Jersey , £ 8) Cyclist Armstrong , who is currently attempting to win an unprecedented sixth Tour de France ,
here presents the follow - up to his superb memoir
It 's Not About the Bike , describing his experience of and recovery from cancer .
Whereas that book was about death , as he puts it , this one is about life : about how to go on living after being spared .
His answer is to set up his own cancer foundation and to continue putting in an astonishingly gruelling regime of training , resulting in five Tour wins and a cruelly elongated and unfounded drugs investigation by French officials .
Armstrong 's descriptions of suffering mountain climbs and the mixture of intense rivalry and noble camaraderie among cyclists are crisp and vivid , and he has a pleasingly dry sense of humour .
"" A guy came up to me in an airport . '
Lance , I want to talk to you about your relationship with God , ' he said .
' It 's not going to be a long talk , ' I said .
"" Stiff , by Mary Roach ( Penguin , £ 6.99 )
This rather horrid book informs us about "" The Curious Lives of Human Cadavers "" .
Heads are cut off with chainsaws and stuck in roasting tins so that medical students can practise face - lift surgery ; the recently deceased are used as crash - test dummies ( so much more realistic than even the most advanced artificial bodies , you see ) , or as subjects in "" ballistics studies "" , in order to see how efficiently some super new type of bullet will buzz through flesh .
Roach , who is probably tired of people noticing how apt her surname is to such disgusting subjects , also tells us in fascinating detail exactly what happens when a dead body decomposes and what embalmers do to combat it .
She writes about the people who do forensic injury analysis on the victims of aeroplane crashes , and about the infant science of full - body transplants ( monkeys yes , humans no , so far ) .
The whole thing is so morbid that , of course , it becomes quite fun , but I would n't read it over breakfast ."
2004-07-17,"The most memorable day in this year 's Tour de France is likely to be Wednesday - and the time trial up L'Alpe d'Huez .
Tyler Hamilton said before his withdrawal from the race that this would be the decisive stage .
And until Lance Armstrong won the thirteenth yesterday , I was with him on that .
Now , though , I think this is where Armstrong will be looking to take an unassailable lead to clinch his sixth Tour victory .
If he is going to get the record , this is where he will do it .
The last mountain I rode up that was vaguely comparable was Plateau de Beille in the Route du Sud stage race .
It 's not quite as steep as the Alpe , but it is a bit longer , at 25 km , and it took me an hour of continuous effort .
The Alpe will be something like this but slightly shorter and a lot nastier .
The climb is 15.5 km from the village of Bourg d'Oisans in the valley to the ski resort at the top and the record for the ascension is about 50 minutes , set by Marco Pantani .
That 's a long time to be going flat out and what armchair viewers do not realise is that it will be a race for everyone , from the front - runners to the last in the classification .
The guys who are trying to survive will be dreading being eliminated by finishing outside the time cut , so they will be going flat out , too .
The sprinters will have as tough a day as Armstrong or the fading Jan Ullrich - they will suffer just as much , but the difference is that they will be going a bit slower .
It is good for the Tour having a day like this .
It has changed everyone 's way of thinking .
During the Tour of Switzerland I was talking recently to the American Bobby Julich , who was third in the 1998 Tour , and he was saying that a lot of guys have been riding their own private time trials up the mountain , choosing different equipment , bikes , working out which gears to use .
He pointed out that , even so , there 's no comparison between a ' rehearsal ' and the Tour because of all the spectators .
In rehearsal you ride up on an empty road so you can choose the best line around the hairpins , where it 's less steep , but with all the fans on the road on the day you have to go where the corridor opens , so you get forced on to the steep bits .
If I was riding the time trial , I would be in the same position as the sprinter , simply trying to pace myself so that I could get inside the time cut .
But that 's not as easy as it sounds , because in a flat time trial if you blow up you can still roll along at 30 miles per hour , whereas if you blow up on a climb , say with five kilometres to go , you all but come to a standstill .
The time gaps could be huge as a result .
Most riders will go up the Alpe on a combination of how they feel and what their pulse monitor is showing .
And there is another crucial difference with a flat time trial here .
Climbing alone uphill , you have far less of a sensation of how you are going .
On the flat you can tell by the speed - you think ' This is quick , I 'm going well ' .
Uphill , you have no sensation of speed or where you are .
That will play on the mind of any rider who feels he is in with a chance of preventing Armstrong from getting the record .
They will be looking at the time gaps , looking at their speed and wondering how much they are losing on Lance .
There will be so much going on in their heads .
It will make the stage fantastic to watch , hopefully as good as the last great mountain time trial in the Tour , which was the stage up Mont Ventoux in 1987 , when Jean - François Bernard won and everyone thought Stephen Roche had lost the Tour .
I was all of seven at the time , but I have watched it on video and it made a huge impression .
While this is going on , I am engaged in something rather shorter , preparing for the pursuit at the Athens Olympics .
It is the specific preparation stage , and I seem to be streets ahead of where I was last year .
The great thing about the pursuit is that you can measure every effort and relate it to other years , and I think if I can continue as I am I 'll be going fast in Athens .
It all seems to be coming into place and I ca n't wait for the next few weeks to go past .
For the guys at the Tour , though , it 's all about the next three days .

2004-07-19,"Lance Armstrong would only laugh yesterday when it was suggested to him that he had this race won three days before the much - feared time - trial to L'Alpe d'Huez , but few of his remaining rivals would disagree with Jan Ullrich 's summary of Friday and Saturday 's Pyrenean stages :
"" This year Lance is unbeatable again . ""
Ivan Basso , the only man who could live with the Texan at Saturday 's finish at Plateau de Beille , said simply : "" There was nothing I could do . ""
Francisco Mancebo of Spain was succinct : "" The Tour will now be decided between Armstrong and Basso .
The best anyone else can hope for is third . ""
As for the current leader Thomas Voeckler , his collapse on Saturday showed that he is unlikely to have the strength to hold on to the yellow jersey for much longer .
At the start of this Tour there was potential for Armstrong to be pushed at least as hard as he was in 2003 .
The course looked devised to favour his rivals , with no long individual time - trial before the mountains , and no chance for him to get more than a couple of minutes in hand in the team time - trial because of a change in the regulations .
Moreover , other heavyweight contenders had emerged alongside Ullrich , who had just won the Tour of Switzerland , albeit narrowly .
But yesterday , as the Tour prepared for its second rest day by speeding across southern France at 28 mph , Armstrong 's position could hardly have been stronger .
Basso is now the only man within two minutes of him , at 1min 17sec behind .
Ullrich 's team - mate Andreas Klöden and the Illes Balears rider Mancebo are 2min 56sec and 3min 6sec adrift and
the Austrian Georg Totschnig is almost six minutes in arrears .
None of that quartet has ever won a major tour race , and Ullrich , the one man Armstrong really fears , is more than six minutes behind .
Ibán Mayo , the rider the American claimed would be the favourite at L'Alpe d'Huez , was barely able to follow the pace yesterday on the flat roads of the Hérault and is in 49th place .
Likewise Roberto Heras is a mere memory in 35th , and Tyler Hamilton is back in Gerona mourning his dead dog and bemoaning a sore back .
Asked why Armstrong was in such a strong position , Basso 's manager at the CSC team , Bjarne Riis , said cryptically : "" There is no one reason .
There is a host of small reasons , and they all add up to where he is now . ""
First , Armstrong 's performance has been faultless .
So it should be , given the practice he has had in winning the race .
This is why the advantage in any Tour lies with the incumbent champion .
His team has also been impeccable , and it may be that their successful fight to keep his team - mate Pavel Padrnos in the race , despite his involvement in a drug inquiry , against the wishes of the organisers has forced US Postal to close ranks .
Perfection looks easy when there is no opposition .
An editorial in the French sports daily L'Equipe on Saturday wailed : "" What have they tried , Ullrich , Hamilton , Mayo , Heras and their team - mates , in the 2,200 kilometres which led to the Pyrenees ?
Nothing .
As usual .
On a daring course , anything looked possible .
It was a waste of time . ""
Hindsight suggests that they did nothing because they could do nothing .
None has been physically capable .
Hamilton 's demise came as a surprise , though , because he downplayed the severity of his tumble at Angers .
A week ago he was saying he had fully recovered , and after his epic fight against pain on last year 's Tour there was a general feeling he was superhuman .
Clearly he is not .
Mayo fell twice , at Wasquehal and Angers .
His managers denied yesterday that the pile - ups had affected him physically , claiming that his problem was in his head rather than his legs .
That seems unlikely .
In addition , the effects of the daily mental effort of keeping upright in the first week 's wind and rain are impossible to measure , as is the destabilising effect of losing a team - mate for failing a blood test .
For tiny climbers such as Hamilton , riding on the flat in the wet is stressful simply because they can not see over the other riders : the entire day is spent riding blind .
Different riders are affected in different ways , but a longer run than usual to the mountains may have exacerbated any problems .
Mentally and physically , Gilberto Simoni of Italy was in pieces in Brittany but compared with Heras and Hamilton he has done well to remain 11th with three mountain stages to come .
Heras , on the other hand , twice a winner of the Tour of Spain , suffered less on the flat , crashing once , in the same pile - up as Armstrong en route to Angers .
His only explanation for his failure in the Pyrenees was that "" the entire team is going badly and we need to rethink our approach "" .
Ullrich 's lack of form is relative , because he has not cracked but merely lost a little more time than in other Tours , but it is also mysterious given that he had a largely trouble - free first week .
One theory is that the cold and wet in the opening week did not permit him to lose weight , as the heat he prefers might have : an extra 1 kilos of embonpoint does not help on mountains .
The German blames a cold , but the explanation may be mundane : his usual lack of training over the winter .
He fought desperately , as usual , to lose weight this spring , and in June , when Armstrong and Basso were honing their fitness , he was racing merely to get condition enough to compete in the Tour .
Faced with a man who neglects no detail in winning the race , this was like pitting a Volvo against Michael Schumacher 's Ferrari ."
2004-07-20,"Lance Armstrong is back in the yellow jersey with which he has become so closely associated after a typically powerful surge to victory on stage 15 of the Tour de France .
Armstrong , who won his first tour just 18 months after surviving cancer , outsprinted Italian Ivan Basso and German rival Jan Ullrich to cross the line first in Villard - de - Lans today , showing remarkable strength after 180.5 kilometres in the saddle .
It was the 20th stage win of Armstrong 's Tour de France career and brings him ever closer to what would be a record sixth victory in the race .
It was a mesmerising statement of intent from the 32-year old American , who stepped up the pace in the closing stages to steal in front of Basso .
The Italian claimed second place in the same time - four hours , 40 minutes and 30 seconds - as Armstrong .
Ullrich , in third place , was a further three seconds off the pace .
Armstrong , who rides for the US Postal team , had gone into today 's stage 22 seconds behind race leader Thomas Voeckler , but he finished almost 10 minutes in front of the French rider who fell to eighth place in the overall standings .
Armstrong 's advantage over the rest of the field is now one minute and 25 seconds , with Basso of the Team CSC his nearest challenger - a gap that could prove crucial with the crucial Alpe d'Huez time trial taking place tomorrow .
German rider Andreas Kloden of the T - Mobile Team is in third place , 3:22 off the pace , with team - mate Ullrich down in fifth , a full 6:54 behind Armstrong .
Armstrong had looked in some danger early in the stage , when Ullrich pulled as much as one minute clear .
But Armstrong hit back and proved too strong for Ullrich , Basso and Kloden in the sprint .

2004-07-20,"As is customary on the Tour 's second rest day , the sports daily L'Equipe asked all the team managers to predict the top three when the race finishes in Paris .
Apart from Ivan Basso 's manager Bjarne Riis , who does not like such games , they speak with one voice :
Lance Armstrong will win .
The collective collapse of the other favourites - Roberto Heras , Tyler Hamilton , Ibán Mayo and , to a lesser extent , Jan Ullrich - means that behind Armstrong there is a new look to the list of candidates for a place in the top three and , just perhaps , overall victory should the great man stumble .
The theme that emerged in the first week of this Tour , when a fresh generation won stages and led the race , has been maintained , with a nuance .
Armstrong 's three closest rivals - Basso , Spain 's Francisco Mancebo and the German Andreas Klöden - are older than some , have all been outside bets to finish in the top three of the Tour in the past but have matured slowly .
Basso and Mancebo are past winners of the best young rider 's prize , the Italian in 2002 , Mancebo in 2000 .
Klöden shone in 2000 , taking the Paris - Nice "" race to the sun "" , the Tour of the Basque Country and bronze in the Sydney Olympics road race , but he has been anonymous since then .
Basso has made the biggest impression simply because he alone has managed to cling on to Armstrong 's wheel in both the Pyrenean mountain finishes , no mean feat in itself .
According to Bernard Hinault 's former manager Cyrille Guimard , the Texan has to take the Italian seriously . ""
Armstrong ca n't afford one false move because Basso has shown that he is as strong as he is , "" he said .
"" The slightest weakness on the part of either of them could prove fatal . ""
Basso bears a famous Italian cycling name but is no relation to the sprinter Marino , world champion in 1972 .
Apart from winning the world under-23 title in 1998 he has a reputation as a follower rather than a leader .
When he left the Fassa Bortolo team last year after finishing seventh in the Tour
his then team manager Giancarlo Ferretti dismissed him , saying he would "" not pay big money to a rider who never won "" .
Whereas Ferretti is legendary for a big - stick approach to management , the enigmatic Riis , who won the Tour in 1996 , has worked hard to build the confidence of the young man from Lombardy .
"" I 've been there for him , spent time with him , coached him , talked with him .
It 's all so that he can believe in himself , "" said the Dane .
Riis travelled with Basso to Boston to improve his time- trial position in a wind tunnel and rode alongside him in training on a scooter equipped with a measuring device that can record a rider 's power output .
In this way he ensured that his protege did not over- or under - train .
The 26-year - old has also done specific training - which Riis undertook with Tyler Hamilton too last year - to make sure he can hold Armstrong when the Texan suddenly ups the pace on a mountain climb .
Last Friday and Saturday it paid off in spades .
"" I 'm convinced that everything is still possible in the Tour
but we ca n't forget that Lance has won the last five , "" Basso said yesterday .
"" If there 's a possibility to win the Tour I 'll go for it , but you need the legs to attack .
It 's not as easy as it sounds .
"" I 've always done things one step at a time and that 's what I 'm going to do during the rest of the Tour .
I 've never been as strong in my life and if there 's just one chance of winning I 'll take it .
But I wo n't attack just to tease Armstrong .
If I attack , it 'll be to try to land a knockout blow , to win the Tour . ""
The only rider who has actually attacked Armstrong in this Tour is Mancebo , the latest product of the Navarran stable run by the former professional José Miguel Echávarri , who nurtured Pedro Delgado and most notably Miguel Indurain .
Mancebo 's move on top of the Col d'Agnes on Saturday was short - lived but it was a rare flash of aggressive intent .
Mancebo , whose personal hero is Delgado , "" not Indurain , because he was constantly calculating how much energy to spend "" , has finished three times in the top 10 of the Tour but has begun to show true winning ambition only this year , taking a tough stage of the Tour of Germany and the Spanish national title .
His target is the podium but a stage win would no doubt be dedicated to his late team- mate and friend from his home province of Avila , José María Jiménez , a talented climber who died of cocaine poisoning last year .
Klöden is the dark horse among the three , who has been thrust forward by the poor form of Jan Ullrich .
The German said yesterday that he would share team leadership with the 29-year - old , another product of the now defunct East German sports system . ""
Klödi has been a revelation , "" said Ullrich .
"" He was clearly the better man in the Pyrenees , so I 've given him carte blanche in the Alps . ""
All expectations are that tomorrow 's time - trial at L'Alpe d'Huez will be the defining moment .
But the final 60 miles of today 's stage through the Vercors to the ski resort of Villard - de - Lans has barely a level yard in it and in 1987 , Stephen Roche 's year , this is where the race was decided ."
2004-07-20,"Up to a million people are expected to line the 21 hairpins of L'Alpe d'Huez for today 's time - trial , the greatest set piece of this Tour .
They will see Lance Armstrong go off last of the 157 starters in the yellow jersey after taking his second stage win this year here yesterday , to end the young Frenchman Thomas Voeckler 's dream spell in the lead .
The young Italian Ivan Basso talked a good race on the rest day , but on the hilly roads breaking up the Vercors plateau yesterday he and his CSC team threw away a rare chance to put Armstrong under pressure , as Jan Ullrich finally discovered his racing legs and the aggressive spirit that enabled him to push the American to the limit last year .
Like Eddy Merckx , like Bernard Hinault and like Miguel Indurain , Armstrong now has the power to mesmerise his opponents like rabbits in a car 's headlights .
Basso and CSC will not say it openly , but riders in the team are making it plain that their priority is to win a place on the podium in Paris and they would rather not race aggressively and risk losing out .
Yesterday , they may well have helped Armstrong to take the yellow jersey , to the confusion and annoyance of Ullrich 's T - Mobile team .
Ullrich , who had put in extra training on the rest day , leapt away amid the beech and pine trees on the Col de l'Echarasson leading up to Vercors plateau .
He devoured the mountain road like a man possessed , and rapidly gained a minute .
The German had started the day almost seven minutes behind , but had his team - mate Andreas Klöden marking Armstrong , together with Basso .
"" I was n't very concerned ; we knew the course well and knew there was no real descent , so it was easy for two teams to work together , "" said Armstrong .
"" It would have been different if I had been isolated , but I had team - mates there . ""
He also had allies of circumstance in CSC , who were aware that Francisco Mancebo , one of Basso 's rivals for a place in the top three , had been left behind and also did not want Ullrich to threaten Basso 's second place overall .
As Ullrich rode through the remnants of an earlier escape which included CSC 's Jens Voigt , the team manager Bjarne Riis ordered Voigt to drop back and tow Armstrong and Basso 's group .
Ullrich was duly reined in , and at the finish in Villard - de - Lans Basso was not even capable of winning the four - rider sprint for the stage win . ""
Of course it was strange - I 'd say that if they wanted to win the race and Basso was good , then this was the day to go with Jan and chance everything , "" said a T - Mobile spokesman .
Ullrich 's mentor Rudy Pevenage was more succinct , terming the unofficial pact "" unsporting "" .
The Texan was clearly overjoyed at winning what the French would term a "" royal sprint "" , that is one between the four strongest riders .
Most of his stage wins are solo , either time - trials or lone mountain - top finishes , and he has not taken a sprint involving a group of more than two since his first Tour stage win 11 years ago .
The other priority was the 8sec time bonus for finishing first to Basso 's second . ""
Johan [ Bruyneel , Armstrong 's manager ] was screaming in my ear that I had to win .
Every second counts . ""
That phrase , the title of his second autobiography , applies here in spades .
For others , the gaps were counted in minutes .
"" Allez Thomas , France is proud of you "" and "" Thomas , right to the end "" read the signs on the roadsides , and yesterday the end finally came for the home fans ' new chou - chou ( darling ) , Voeckler , who was unable to stay with the leaders on the Echarasson as Ullrich 's team - mates upped the pace .
Voeckler has slipped to eighth overall and may lose more time today and tomorrow now that the maillot jaune can no longer weave its magic .
But his spell in yellow , 10 days , equalled Pascal Lino 's tenure in 1992 , which makes it the longest by a Frenchman since Hinault in 1985 .
He retains the white jersey of best young rider , but may be pushed hard for it by another Frenchman , Sandy Casar , and the Russian Vladimir Karpets .
French honour will also be upheld by Richard Virenque , who led over four of yesterday 's seven climbs and now looks likely to win a seventh King of the Mountains prize , one more than the current joint record holder , Lucien van Impe .
Today 's stage is dedicated to another climber with a controversial past , the late Marco Pantani , who was first to the ski resort in 1995 and 1997 , and holds the record for the ascent .
That was set in an EPO - fuelled era , but may well fall today .
As well as shaking up the overall standings , today 's mountain time - trial - the toughest in the Tour since 1987 's contre - la - montre up Mont Ventoux - will also challenge the backmarkers , who will have to fight to stay within the time limit , calculated at 33 % of the winner 's time .
The Basque Ibán Mayo , tipped three weeks ago by Armstrong to win today , will not even get to the Alpe .
Having made it as far as the rest day in Nîmes , he clearly decided yesterday morning that more rest was what he needed and he did not start ."
2004-07-21,"Lance Armstrong seized complete control of the Tour de France today with an awesome display of power cycling to win the 15.5 km individual time trial .
The American , bidding for a record sixth overall Tour victory , blasted round the 21 hairpins on the twisting climb to the Alpine ski resort in 39 minutes 41.47 seconds to annihilate his nearest rival , the Italian Ivan Basso .
Basso , one minute 25 seconds down at the start of the 16th stage , had no answer to Armstrong and finished 2:23 back after being overtaken by the U.S. Postal rider on the road .
Germany 's Jan Ullrich produced a typically gritty ride to take second place on the stage in 40:42.49 .
Ullrich 's T - Mobile team mate Andreas Kloeden was third , 1:41 back , to boost his chances of overhauling Basso for overall second place ."
2004-07-21,"Back in May the locals here would have seen a cyclist dressed in black accompanied by a single unmarked car climbing five times up the 21 hairpins leading to this little town of wooden chalets , apartment blocks , ski lifts and green meadows .
Having reconnoitred the climb in Clark Kent garb , Lance Armstrong returned yesterday as Superman to take his third Tour de France stage win in four days ' racing in front of - and perhaps in spite of - what looked like the biggest crowd the Tour has drawn to any climb in its 101-year history .
The line of parked cars , tents , campervans and every kind of human life lined four deep could be seen from miles away , winding up the mountainside like a giant snail trail .
They had begun arriving last week , had filled the mountain by 4 pm the previous day and had caused a 10-mile traffic jam lasting into the small hours .
It was a vast , largely lobster - red crowd , several hundred thousand strong , perching on the concrete barriers and roosting on the grassy slopes , but the numbers brought their own risks .
It is frequently said that the Tour 's own worst enemy is its sheer size , and yesterday that was the case .
In the first four or five kilometres , where the bulk of the fans were gathered , they were so numerous , waving so many flags , and so reluctant to get out of the way that the riders could not see where they were going even though each was accompanied by a police motorbike .
The mountains always bring out the idiot fringe , as was evident in 1999 when the Italian Giuseppe Guerini was knocked down here by a fan wielding a camera .
Yesterday the amateur snappers were concentrated on a single climb , and in places they stood three deep , viewfinders trained on the rider , unaware that he was a yard or two away .
Armstrong 's view was that the stage should not have been held . ""
At Plateau de Beille [ last Saturday ] there was one kilometre where people were standing close ; yesterday there were four or five kilometres of people all the time , "" he said .
"" I do n't know that 's a good thing for the Tour de France .
I do n't think it 's safe and we would all agree with that , and the organisers would all agree . ""
But the American stayed upright on the course and there were no glitches other than a minor contretemps with race officials over the weight of his time - trial bike , judged to be just below the minimum considered safe .
His team car , though , has been relegated to last place in the file for today 's stage after a run - in with a television motorbike .
A sixth Tour win and a place in the record books should be the Texan 's on Sunday , barring an act of God , but as usual Armstrong is not tempting fate .
"" I 'm careful about counting to six , although I can , but I 'll do it on the final lap on the Champs Elysées .
Today was just about getting through the stage and securing the overall lead . ""
His yellow jersey is secure enough , particularly because the young Italian Ivan Basso crumbled .
Not a time - triallist of repute , he was caught and passed by Armstrong with 4 km to the finish .
There could have been no more fitting demonstration of strength and contrast in style :
Armstrong spinning the pedals like a hamster on a wheel , Basso straining with every stroke .
The Texan had the advantage of starting behind the Italian so he benefited from constant time checks , and the chance to overtake his young rival was too good to resist .
"" I was surprised to see Ivan , although at the time check I knew he was 1min 15sec slower than me .
When you 're climbing and not going quickly it 's easy to see a guy 30 or 40sec ahead when the road gets straight , and when you start to see him it 's incredible motivation .
"" Basso is now 3min 48sec behind and will lose more time in Saturday 's flat time - trial , even if he holds on in today 's fearsome stage over four vast Alpine passes .
He and his CSC team rode to defend second place overall on Tuesday but even that is no longer secure ; the Germans Jan Ullrich and Andreas Klöden are getting stronger by the day .
Yesterday Germans predominated alongside Americans , Danes and Dutch in the throng .
While the Dutch opted as ever for raucous disco , outsize orange hats and bottles of Orangeboom , which they occasionally poured over passing race cars , the Germans went for neatly ordered garden chairs and placards greeting "" Ulli und Klödi "" on behalf of almost every town in the country .
Ullrich has no chance of overtaking Armstrong but second place yesterday means he is only 4min 3sec behind Basso , and his friend Klöden , third yesterday , is only 1min 16sec adrift of third place .
Ullrich may look as if he is suffering horribly
but yesterday he confirmed the good impression he made in attacking through the Vercors on Tuesday .
He attacked the climb with grim determination , grimace like a gargoyle , grinding rather than spinning the pedals .
There are murmurings that he fell ill in the opening week of the race and was on antibiotics ; if so , he has recovered .
Basso should beware today ."
2004-07-22,"Lance Armstrong , after winning his third alpine stage in a row , was met yesterday on the podium by Bernard Hinault , a fellow five - times winner legendary for his combative style . ""
Parfait , "" grunted the Badger , adding : "" Pas de cadeaux . ""
The Texan 's translation was "" no gifts "" and he delivered the phrase with the curtness of Clint Eastwood 's Dirty Harry .
Yesterday there was more than a little of Hinault in Armstrong 's hunger as he chased down Jan Ullrich and Andreas Klöden in the final few kilometres .
Stage victory for either German would have mattered not a jot overall , yet Armstrong was letting nothing escape him or his US Postal Service team - mate Floyd Landis .
This was Eddy Merckx 's way , and on occasion Hinault 's .
Armstrong achieved a feat which evaded the insatiable "" Cannibal "" ( Merckx ) and the incorrigibly aggressive "" Badger "" , however , taking three mountain stage wins in a row following his victories at Villard de Lans on Tuesday and L'Alpe d'Huez on Wednesday .
The last overall winner to achieve anything comparable was the Italian Gino Bartali in 1948 .
As at Villard de Lans on Tuesday , the finish was "" royal , "" that is fought out between the top men overall - Armstrong , Ivan Basso , Klöden and Ullrich - plus Landis .
In seigneurial style Armstrong attempted to let Landis win , pushing him gently ahead over the top of the final climb , the Col du Croix Fry , which was aptly named as the roadside fans were sizzling in 30C heat .
His master instructed Landis to "" run like he had stolen something "" but Ullrich gave chase , knowing he had a final chance to gain time on Basso and push for a place in the first three .
Armstrong pursued the German and for a few minutes they took the hairpins flat out , leaning their bikes at terrifying angles , pushing tyre adhesion to the limit and avoiding a trip into the pinewoods by inches .
The trio linked up at the foot of the descent and Ullrich waved his arms at Armstrong in dismay - "" Jan wanted us to work as we had two guys there , but Basso was dropped , so to me it was in his interests to do the work , "" explained the Texan .
Basso and Klöden linked up and in the final kilometre Landis stole away , chased down by Ullrich .
As Ullrich closed on Landis , with Armstrong and Basso close on his heels , the quartet eased and Klöden launched the classic counter - attack from behind , gaining 20 metres and what looked like an assured victory until Armstrong sped past him in the final 150 metres .
It was cut and thrust compared with the more common , yet purely mechanical spectacle of Armstrong winning one of the mountain - top finishes he has made his own .
A hat - trick is a rare feat even for a sprinter - Mario Cipollini managed it in 1999 - but for an overall contender it is almost unheard of .
This is largely because in the mountains the conventional strategy for a rider aiming for the ultimate triumph is to let some lesser lights , out of the race for the yellow jersey , fight out the stage while marking one 's closest rivals .
The trio who led for much of the stage can not be classed as lesser lights : the mountains leader Richard Virenque , last year 's best Frenchman Christophe Moreau and the double Giro d'Italia winner Gilberto Simoni , who has had a race to forget and said recently that he hoped he never had to return to the Tour .
He will not want to remember yesterday .
He had hoped to salvage his race with a stage win and escaped in the first kilometre .
He was swept up on the Croix Fry having stayed in front with a constantly evolving group of companions who kept joining up and fading away as the race travelled through the Chaine de Belledonne , the Massif de la Vanoise and the Massif des Aravis from north to south over four major passes .
Each pass has its own character .
The Glandon is all desolate rock faces and scree giving way to high pasture dotted with barns .
From the top , a thin white line could be seen snaking across a green peak some 15 or 20 miles distant through the haze - the top of the Col de la Madeleine , with fields of alpine gentian , orchids , clover and sorrel , with a distant view of Mont Blanc .
The Forclaz snakes through fields of hay and orchards of burgeoning apples .
The Croix Fry skirts a thick pine forest .
Armstrong is not the only rider here for whom a place in the history books awaits .
Virenque , as he topped the Croix Fry , punched the air .
He had been at the head of affairs since the Madeleine , earning a sackful of points towards the King of the Mountains prize , and his seventh victory is now assured , barring accidents .
He , Moreau and Simoni could all have hoped for a stage win when the escape 's lead nudged eight minutes but Armstrong was not in generous mood .
"" I 've given gifts in the Tour de France before and they 've rarely come back to help me , "" he said , referring to the victory on Mont Ventoux that he gave Marco Pantani in 2000 .
· The body of a spectator was found yesterday morning at the foot of a 120-foot drop on L'Alpe d'Huez , where the race finished on Wednesday .
The man , who has not been named , was aged 64 and came from the Paris area .
An autopsy will be carried out today ."
2004-07-22,"Lance Armstrong has won the 17th stage of the Tour de France to retain both the overall lead of the race and his yellow jersey .
Armstrong , who is on course for a record sixth successive Tour victory , finished just ahead of the German duo Andreas Kloeden , who finished second , and Jan Ullrich , in third , at the end of the 204.5 km stage from Bourg d'Oisans to Le Grand Bornand .
The stage which features five climbs , including the classic Madeleine Pass , was Armstrong 's fourth victory in five mountain stages this year .
Armstrong finished one second ahead of Italy 's Ivan Basso , who is second in the overall standings , though a distant four minutes and nine seconds behind Armstrong .
Kloeden remains in third place , over a minute behind Basso , with Ullrich fourth and Jose Azevedo fifth .
Armstrong was part of a group of 18 riders who broke away from the peloton to chase the leading pack of Christophe Moreau , Richard Virenque and Gilberto Simoni , who at one stage led by more than five minutes .
In the final 20 km , Armstrong reeled in the leaders on the category one climb up the Col de la Croix Fry to remain on track for the record sixth win .
Armstrong , 32 , acknowledged that he was in the form of his life . ""
This year I feel amazing on the bike .
I have recovered well after every stage , "" he said .
"" It was a tactical race , everyone was trying to win the stage , and I thought I would try my chances as well . ""
Veteran rider Virenque was first across the line in the third and fourth climbs and will be crowned King of the Mountains if he finishes the race ."
2004-07-23,"Juan Miguel Mercado of Spain won the 18th stage of the Tour de France , but it was race leader Lance Armstrong who made the headlines with a bizarre tactical performance .
Mercado edged out compatriot Jose Vicente Garcia Acosta to finish the 166.5-km stage between Annemasse and Lons - le - Saunier over 11 minutes ahead of the main bunch , including Armstrong , who maintained his overall lead of the race .
However , the main talking point was the performance of the five - time Tour de France winner , who appeared to carry out a personal duel with Italian rider Filippo Simeoni .
After three punishing days in the Alps , Armstrong had little interest in chasing down Mercado and five other riders who escaped early in the race .
Instead he seemed determined not to let the Italian get ahead of him .
At one point Armstrong surged off with Simeoni in pursuit of Mercado 's group , but after catching them up and staying with them for a while , the pair eased up and rejoined the trailing pack .
Simeoni , who rides for the Domina Vacanze squad , has testified against sports doctor , Michele Ferrari , with whom Armstrong has ties .
Ferrari faces allegations of providing performance enhancers to riders .
Johan Bruyneel , sports manager of Armstrong 's US Postal team hinted that Armstrong 's motives were personal . ""
It surely had something to do with what has happened , "" he said .
"" Nobody was expecting it , and it was n't planned , either . """
2004-07-24,"Lance Armstrong , showing all the diplomatic skills of a playground bully , stamped his authority on one of the rebels of the peloton , Filippo Simeoni , yesterday .
Armstrong frequently complains he is not universally popular with the public but the afternoon 's cameo will have done little to counter the feeling that he regards the Tour as his personal fiefdom .
Pippo 's only offence , after all , is that he has taken legal action against Armstrong in his native Italy after the American questioned his testimony against the Texan 's trainer Michele Ferrari .
Simeoni rode away from the peloton early in the stage , in pursuit of the day 's six - rider breakaway group , and what followed was bizarre .
As if to make the point that he has a personal beef with the Italian , Armstrong did not ask his team to chase him but caught up himself and the pair rode across to the leaders .
The peloton slowed as if it , too , could not believe what was going on .
It is unprecedented for the maillot jaune to behave in this way , letting a personal matter interfere with the racing .
In the little group Armstrong , Simeoni and Vicente Garcia Acosta had an intense discussion before Simeoni dropped back and Armstrong with him .
At the finish the Italian was a bitterly disappointed man .
"" I made a super effort to get to the escape but Armstrong said the peloton would not let the group remain in front unless I let them go , "" he explained .
"" I slowed down out of respect for the other riders there .
He should n't worry about little riders like me . ""
Armstrong said simply : "" I was just protecting the interests of the peloton .
"" If the common interest of the riders is that whistleblowers in drug trials are ostracised , perhaps he was but it is not a widely expressed sentiment among his fellows .
With Armstrong and Simeoni back in the peloton , normal service was resumed and the escape duly fought out the finish , where Garcia Acosta was narrowly beaten by his fellow Spaniard Juan - Miguel Mercado .
Today the final podium positions will be decided but yesterday showed one thing : Armstrong 's urge to dominate the Tour de France again extends as far down as 114th place in the standings , to the smallest fish in the shoal ."
2004-07-24,"I have raced with Lance Armstrong a couple of times during my career , in races that are just preparation for the Tour de France as far as he is concerned ; events such as the Midi Libre and Dauphiné Libéré in France .
I say ' raced with ' rather than ' raced against ' because usually he is just building up for the Tour de France .
He almost looks like an amateur as he is riding in the peloton - he has an unorthodox style , riding on his toes , and he usually wears black socks or has a peak on his helmet , something that sets him apart .
Even so , you realise that you are in the presence of someone special .
I rode with Lance at the Criterium International this year .
It is a two - day , three - stage event in the Ardennes and it was one of his first European outings .
He was just riding along in the bunch , chatting to guys who he had not seen for a while .
You feel as if you have to be careful not to get in his way .
He is there for only one thing , to get some racing in his legs to build up to the Tour , but even so he has free passage through the peloton .
There are always a couple of riders from US Postal around him .
He is a bit of a messiah .
You feel very small alongside him .
Usually , he seems relaxed because the races I ride are preparation events , but a couple of years ago I raced in Amstel Gold , the Dutch World Cup Classic one - day event , and he went for it .
He finished second , but he was on fire from kilometre one .
He had seven or eight of his team around him at the front of the bunch from the start .
There are Classic specialists , you see , taking it easy at the start of a race .
But not Lance - it is full on from the word go .
You have to bear that in mind with this Tour .
He has raced the event from the very start .
He was in the first 20 of the bunch for most of the early stages and that is probably why he was so good in the second and third weeks when it counted .
When he is going for it , you do not see him chatting in the bunch .
He is totally focused .
He has particularly impressed me in this Tour by his sheer dominance .
Normally he gives away a present or two to the other riders , but since the first stage in the Pyrenees , which he gave to Ivan Basso , there have been no gifts .
It is as if he is trying to make the point that he is the strongest and it is up to the others to fight for what they can get .
Jan Ullrich was annoyed last Thursday when Lance caught him in the final kilometres of the stage to Le Grand Bornand , but Lance 's gesture to him showed that he was not giving anything away and it was up to Ullrich to race .
He is at least as impressive as in 2001 , which I would rate as his best year .
Like that year , you have the feeling that he can do what he likes .
In 2001 , I would say that Lance was at the height of his ability and everyone thought that it would be downhill from there and he might struggle this year .
It has not been like that .
From watching this year 's Tour , I would say that he can continue winning for as long as he wants and the only time that he will lose the Tour is when he retires .
It is good for the sport to have a champion at the height of his powers .
It is stimulating and I love to watch Lance Armstrong as a fan .
But the other big development of this Tour is the arrival of a generation of riders who first showed themselves in 1998 - riders such as Filippo Pozzato , Sandy Casar , Thor Hushovd and Mark Scanlon .
They are a welcome injection of new blood .
I am one of that generation , too , because I won the world track pursuit as a junior in 1998 , and I am hoping that next year I will be there at the Tour with them , watching Armstrong race for real .

2004-07-24,"Lance Armstrong is poised to claim a unique sixth victory in the Tour de France .
He shares his achievement of five wins with four other riders , and many Europeans find it galling that an American ( from George Bush 's home state of Texas , no less ) is set to surpass the European quartet of Merckx , Anquetil , Hinault and Indurain .
Transatlantic rivalry is only part of the story .
Some cycling fans object to how Armstrong 's nine - man team operates with the sole purpose of ensuring their man will be wearing the winner 's yellow jersey as the riders enter the Champs Elysées tomorrow at the end of the three - week race .
Europeans like the idea of the noble individual , striking out from the pack to ride heroically and alone over the mountains and through the vineyards to claim his prize .
Merckx would attack , attack , attack , never content with second place .
This year the colourful French rider and six times king of the mountains Richard Virenque chose Bastille Day for a daring 130-mile breakaway , to the delight of the home crowd .
By contrast , Armstrong 's rides are carefully calculated ; he only unleashes his speed and endurance at key moments , to maximum tactical effect .
On the fast , flat days he will shelter behind his teammates , in the mountains he will use them as pacemakers .
In fairness , each of the teams in the tour has a hierarchy .
But Armstrong 's team has taken things to a new level , reflecting the special American love affair with team sports .
The three most popular American spectator sports are baseball , basketball and American football .
Big hitters like Babe Ruth , gravity - defying geniuses like Michael Jordan or quarterbacks like Joe Montana may have star status , but it 's the team that 's the thing .
Teams practice drills and set - plays , each member has clearly defined roles .
Working cooperatively , sacrificing your own glory for the greater good , a whole greater than the sum of its parts does n't fit with the view of America as a nation of rugged individualism .
De Tocqueville , to whom Europeans look for insights into the US character , remarked upon the abundance of voluntary "" associations "" ( churches and unions ) that performed many of the roles of the larger , more intrusive European state .
Sociologists like Robert Putnam have recorded the collapse of these civic institutions in recent decades .
But even if Americans are going down to the mall and - as Putnam famously observed - "" bowling alone "" , on TV they still love team sports .
Perhaps they find them comforting precisely because they reflect qualities of cooperation and social solidarity that are missing from the dog - eat - dog capitalist economy .
There is something almost socialist in the way that recently graduated college players are allocated to the professional teams : the worst - performing teams get first choice of the best players , so as to even up the competition .
And maybe it is because of our more uniform , egalitarian societies that we Europeans are attracted to the idea of the individual genius outshining the rest through natural ability ( though not through hard work , that 's so American ) .
For Americans the team is about working together for a common aim , and that common aim remains distinctively American .
It 's not playing beautiful football , or helping the lesser players rise up to the level of the best .
The goal is winning - at all costs .
Armstrong has a single - minded commitment to a single goal : winning the Tour de France .
He is an outstanding athlete and his team has been built around him , their egos subjugated to the task at hand .
They are drilled , disciplined and dedicated .
Now , there 's something very American about that . ·

2004-07-24,"There was no need for Lance Armstrong to ram home his superiority on the penultimate day en route to his sixth successive overall victory , but the Texan has been insatiable this week and in the 34-mile time - trial starting and finishing here in Besançon he took his sixth stage win of the race , including the team time - trial stage , and his fifth stage in eight days .
No one has achieved so many stage victories in one Tour since another five - times winner , Bernard Hinault , took seven when he was at his best in 1979 .
Armstrong led at every checkpoint , gaining time quickly in the opening section , where the course climbed out of town , then simply holding his lead . '
I 'm happy because it is almost over
and I am tired in my head and my legs and morally , ' Armstrong said . '
It is always a special feeling for all the peloton to arrive on the Champs Elysées and it will be very special for me this year . '
The only remaining issue yesterday was the destiny of second place , which was fought out between Ivan Basso and Andreas Klöden , two of the young riders to emerge in this Tour .
Basso matched Armstrong on the climbs in the Pyrenees , but he has no pedigree as a time - triallist , whereas Klöden had looked more at his ease in Wednesday 's ' against the clock ' race up L'Alpe d'Huez .
The Italian ceded ground steadily , finishing 37 seconds slower than the German , who will ride into Paris today in second place .
Second yesterday was Ullrich , favourite to win the Olympic time - trial title in Athens in Armstrong 's absence .
His final position today will be fourth , the first time in his eight Tours that he has finished lower than second .
Huge crowds packed every hill on this rolling course that was tailor made for Armstrong , who will finish this Tour 6min 38sec ahead of Klöden , not far off the standard he set in his first four wins .
The margin is irrelevant in one sense - this race has been in his pocket since the start in Liège 22 days ago .

2004-07-24,"Today Lance Armstrong will clinch the Tour de France in the final time - trial stage around Besançon but to understand the mind - set and approach that will give him a record sixth
Tour win
it is necessary to look back eight days , before the opposition crumbled in the Pyrenees and before Armstrong 's hat - trick of Alpine stage wins .
Racing into the little town of Figeac , up the slope to the finish line , Armstrong was prominent with the best sprinters in the race fighting out fourth place .
The prize money was irrelevant , the placing meaningless , but what mattered was the fact that in the uphill finish the peloton might stretch and split - as it did - and a few seconds might be lost to Jan Ullrich or Tyler Hamilton .
The race organiser Jean - Marie Leblanc spoke for many when he summed up Armstrong 's approach as "" methodical , even maniacal "" attention to detail .
He brings his own chef and rides up l'Alpe d'Huez five times in training .
Armstrong is obsessive in other ways as well .
Yesterday he rode out of the peloton in pursuit of the Italian Filippo Simeoni , tailed him to the day 's escape and appeared to foil his attempt to win the stage , which was hardly a noble act .
Simeoni is the principal prosecution witness in the trial of Armstrong 's trainer Michele Ferrari and is suing Armstrong for libel .
It left the impression that the boss of the peloton was throwing his weight around .
Armstrong 's sixth victory is assured and it will be as dominant as any of Eddy Merckx 's or Bernard Hinault 's greatest wins , with five stage victories to date in all disciplines : time - trial , team time - trial , mountain - top finish , sprint from a small group .
That domination is not born of any single factor , which is why talk that his success is solely down to the use of banned drugs is facile .
The modern Tour is not won in any one domain .
It is a kaleidoscope of small things which come together in a certain way .
Armstrong 's work with Ferrari , on trial for drug offences not related to the American , is merely one element in the greater whole .
Ferrari has a reputation for making riders win - by fair means or foul , depending which side of the argument you come from - so he has been hired and used to the full .
In this Tour every piece has fallen into place .
Armstrong timed his run to fitness so that his form peaked at the right moment whereas Ullrich has got fit too late , as usual , and Iban Mayo was dominant before the Tour began .
Misfortune , when it struck , targeted Hamilton and Mayo but in the Tour crashes tend to happen to riders who are a little below form and trying a little too hard .
Armstrong 's team have ridden perfectly .
The Blue Train has guided him through the mountains with devotion that seems to border on fear .
On Thursday , for example , Floyd Landis set such a pace up the final climb that all bar the best four were burned off , although in terms of winning the Tour there was no tactical need for it .
The Postmen are marshalled in military style , with the manager Johan Bruyneel pulling the strings from the team car where he watches the race on TV while telling the team what to do through their tiny radio earpieces .
Different domestiques are selected for different mountain stages , so they can recover from day to day .
The Tour team are welded together during camps in the mountains that seem harder than the race itself - eight or nine hours to reconnoitre the Plateau de Beille stage , for example - and they know that they have a leader who will probably win .
They have good reason to ride with conviction , and will probably be doing the same again next year .
"" We have n't yet discussed our programme for next season but one thing is sure , Lance will ride next season and it would be very difficult for him to motivate himself without the Tour de France , "" Bruyneel said .
This race itself has gone perfectly .
The bad weather of the first week did more damage to the climbers than it did to Armstrong and , having won the yellow jersey in the team time - trial , he had the sang - froid to let it go .
It went to a Frenchman Thomas Voeckler , who had the strength to keep the lead for 10 days , in which Armstrong did not have to make his team work and when he was able to avoid the media commitments which cut into recovery time .
This year 's victory has to be seen in the context of last year 's near defeat . ""
Last year was very beneficial , "" says Bruyneel .
"" We had ended up forgetting that there were other riders who prepared well for the Tour and that it could be difficult to win the race .
We almost paid for it
but it was a warning which took us back to basics . ""
When Armstrong gave his final interviews in Nantes a year ago having taken his fifth Tour , he criticised the mistakes he had made in the build - up .
None was major but they added up .
These have clearly been rectified by the man who , in terms of the Tour , is the God of Small Things ."
2004-07-24,"Halfway up L'Alpe D'Huez during Wednesday 's time - trial , 3,000 ft up the mountainside above the little village of La Garde , the neatly painted banner with a map of France coloured in with the Stars and Stripes was strung from the crowd barriers . '
Tour de France , American owned and operated since 1999 ' it read , on one side in English , on the other in perfect French .
This is as good a summary of the Lance Armstrong era as any .
Today , the Texan cancer survivor will ride along the Champs Elysées and set the seal on an unprecedented period of domination of the great race with his sixth win .
Last year he reached parity with the greats of the Tour - Jacques Anquetil , Eddy Merckx , Bernard Hinault and Miguel Induráin - and today he will surpass them .
On Thursday , after winning his third mountain stage in the Alps in three days - a feat that eluded even Merckx - Armstrong was asked if he was the twenty - first century equivalent of the ' Cannibal ' , the nickname given to the great Belgian because of his insatiable appetite for victory .
There was a long pause before he said : ' The answer is no . '
It is the only answer courtesy permits , but the silence told its own story .
It is facile to compare Armstrong to other athletes who have dominated a single event for more than half a decade .
The Tour de France is a unique event with unique demands , but Armstrong 's record must be entering the same domain as , for example , Martina Navratilova 's domination of the singles title at Wimbledon , Michael Schumacher in Formula One or Steve Redgrave in Olympic rowing .
It is equally hard to place Armstrong in the cycling pantheon , because , just as the Tour de France is unique in world sport , today 's Tour de France bears little comparison - other than in distance and duration - with the event in the 1960s or 1980s .
It is only recently , since the Induráin era , that cyclists and the world media have begun to regard the Tour as the only event in the 10-month cycling calendar worth winning .
The comparison with Merckx is telling , not for what it says about Armstrong but for what it says about the way cycling has changed in 30 years .
Between 1969 and 1973 , Merckx won 250 races in 650 starts .
In 1971 , he won 54 out of 120 races .
Armstrong races 60 to 75 events a year - counting each Tour stage as a separate race - and has managed five to 11 wins per year since his return from cancer .
Cycling now is a sport where quality is the watchword , not quantity .
Hinault , five times a Tour winner , is an Armstrong fan , but he accepts that there is no comparison between Armstrong and Merckx . '
If Merckx had taken his career at the same pace that Armstrong has , he would still be racing at 60 .
I do n't really give a damn whether Armstrong wins seven Tours ; he may do because times are not the same and neither is the opposition or the way of racing . '
There are similarities between Merckx and Armstrong , however .
One journalist wrote of Merckx in 1970 that ' he transformed himself into a machine with the utmost meticulousness .
He is half man , half bike ' .
The description could equally well apply to the obsessive Armstrong , who weighs out his food to avoid putting on weight , who ascends the Tour 's mountain passes again and again to leave no margin for error .
Merckx , too , showed obsessive attention to detail , and the two men have something else in common : they are driven by the fear of failure .
After winning at Plteau de Beille , Armstrong said that he had ' the fear that all champions have , of losing your place at the top ' .
Much of Merckx 's domination stemmed from the fact that he was ' never certain of winning ' .
As with Merckx , who was booed and on occasion was punched , Armstrong 's domination has not earned universal popularity .
A small number of spectators have whistled at him at stage starts .
He was apparently spat on during the Alpe d'Huez time - trial .
While most spectators ' placards have been supportive , there was the odd one referring to drugs - ' EPOstal ' , for example - and the motto ' Lance go home ' has been spotted .
For the past few years Armstrong has talked about how much he likes France , has praised the French riders and has spoken French , but the charm offensive has not succeeded . '
There are always signs of hostility towards a great rider , ' says Hinault . '
Induráin had it , I did , too .
I had a book thrown at my head in a time trial .
In Armstrong 's case I think it just makes him stronger . ' '
He 's not as popular as people make out , ' says former world number one Laurent Jalabert . '
He works hard at it , but he crushes the race and in France people do n't like that kind of domination .
He is a killer , but no matter how spectacular his performances , they leave no room for emotion .
He likes France , but he goes too far in getting sentimental about it .
It 's a bit incoherent because he lives in Spain . ' '
I do n't have overwhelming sympathy for his personality , but objectively I have a sort of admiration for the way he has continued to be motivated , ' says the race organiser , Jean - Marie Leblanc . '
I think he has a need to take revenge on the world because of his difficult childhood .
He is obsessed with winning and domination . '
Here , too , Armstrong is similar to Merckx , but with a more authoritarian streak .
On Friday , he stamped on the Italian Filippo Simeoni , who is involved in a libel case against him , by stopping him figuring in the stage - winning escape .
Clearly , he did not see or did not care that pushing the lesser lights around is not good PR ; as he has said , ' the Tour is not a popularity contest ' .
It was the act of a man who is bossing the race , who feels totally on top .
Hinault said last night that ' you need to be really in form , really confident to do what he did .
I would have done the same . '
' I first saw Armstrong racing in 1992 at the DuPont Tour , in America , he already had this trait in his character which leads him to try and crush everyone else , ' recalls the double Tour winner Laurent Fignon . '
He was arrogant in a way that the others were not . ' '
Armstrong imposes himself on the bunch , ' says his former team - mate , the Italian Andrea Peron . '
All the riders respect him to the extent that more or less consciously they end up becoming his subjects . '
Indeed , during the past week in the Alps , Peron 's team , the largely Danish CSC , were so submissive that they were riding for second place on Tuesday , even though there were two Alpine stages to come in which Armstrong might stumble .
Armstrong 's urge to crush Simeoni , who was a witness in the trial of the Texan 's trainer , Michele Ferrari , was a worrying reminder that the doping issue remains high in the public perception , even when he is about to enter the record books .
In one sense it is understandable ; no Tour winner has come under such scrutiny or been forced to answer such detailed questions about his integrity .
There are other ways of looking at the question .
Some followers of the sport say that Armstrong is irretrievably tainted by his association with Ferrari , who is on trial in Italy for drugs offences , and his unstinting support for him .
It is impossible to read ; there is no actual evidence that this is one more element that helps Armstrong to dominate the Tour , part of a whole spectrum going from his diet to his team 's travel arrangements .
For Armstrong 's predecessor Greg LeMond , the doubts have won . '
People will say I 'm jealous because I was the first American to win the Tour , but even with six wins that ca n't be compared with the past , ' says LeMond . '
Because of everything that 's happened in the last 10 years , it wo n't have the same value as Hinault 's five Tours , for example . '
That has not affected the American support at least .
Since the Texan 's triumph in the 1999 Tour , each year has seen more and more cycling fans from the US at the race .
There are at least as many Stars and Stripes as Tricolours waved by the roadside , although in the Alps last week , they were both outnumbered by the German fans ' displays .
Worldwide , Armstrong is taking a once obscure sport into a new dimension .
On Wednesday , after he won the stage at Villard de Lans , he made the front pages of every newspaper in the US .
His divorce followed by friendships with first the actress Sandra Bulloch and now the singer Sheryl Crow , have been grist for the gossip mill .
Love him or loathe him , doubt him or believe in him , Armstrong is one of the most complex Tour winners as well as the most successful .
He is no straightforward farmer 's boy like Hinault or Induráin .
Fiercely loyal , obsessed with detail , bitterly tenacious and totally uncompromising , he has a place of his own in sporting history .

His career could have been cut short when in 1999 he tested positive for an illegal performance - enhancing substance , synthetic cortocosteroid .
Armstrong argued the substance was an ingredient in a proprietary skin cream for saddle boils .
7 .
He is arguably the most popular personality of the cycling world but his relationship with Italy 's Fillippo Simeoni has been under the spotlight recently - the pair are involved in a legal wrangle over Simeoni 's testimony against the Texan 's trainer Michele Ferrari .

10 .
His future as an all conquering king of cycling is guaranteed as triumph in next year 's Tour will come easily to a man
who in persists in remaining in the record books"
2004-07-26,"In November 1997 I sat down with Lance Armstrong , his future ex - wife Kristin , and three bottles of red wine on the bare floor of a room devoid of furniture in a borrowed villa on the exclusive peninsula of St Jean - Cap Ferrat , between Nice and Monaco .
"" We 'll go out for dinner , "" Armstrong had said , and we did - to a supermarket , where we stocked up with wine , salad and pasta , which the couple cooked .
To look back at that evening reflects how far Armstrong has travelled in sporting and personal terms .
Back then , he and Kristin were so uncertain about his comeback to racing in Europe that they had no idea whether to buy furniture or not .
It was just over a year since he had been diagnosed with testicular cancer , and a comeback from tumours as acute as Armstrong 's had never been attempted in cycling or any endurance sport before .
The rest is history .
Armstrong is now the best Tour de France cyclist to have graced the planet .
His marriage has been and gone , leaving three children along the way .
When we met seven years ago , he had just driven a small rented car across Europe to pick up a borrowed mattress , and carried it back tied on to the roof with string .
Now , he is courting a rock star and courted by the President of the United States , who called Armstong yesterday soon after he crossed the finishing line to congraulate him on behalf of the American people .
To call him the greatest cyclist ever would be like saying Michael Schumacher is a greater driver than Juan - Manuel Fangio .
Like Schumacher , he is a creature of his time , "" a charismatic leader who has the best means available at his disposal , "" as Alain Prost said yesterday , but that merely underlines his achievement in getting the best on offer , and making the most of it .
His team - mate George Hincapie , the only member of the US Postal team to have ridden alongside Armstrong in all his six Tour wins , said : "" He is on the top of his game .
He is stronger than ever .
"" Few would disagree : in this year 's race he has proved strongest in every domain that matters to a Tour winner , taking mountain - top stages , sprint finishes from a small breakaway group , a mountain time - trial , a flat time - trial and the team time - trial .
Here too , the transformation is dramatic from even five years ago , when Armstrong led the Tour and was "" constantly nervous "" because he felt he could lose the yellow jersey at any moment .
In this Tour , as in his fourth success in 2002 , he is so far ahead of the opposition that he is turning his mind to helping his team - mates to win stages .
Yesterday , the lone star of Texas was flying alongside the barriers on the Champs Elysées , and from the Hotel de Crillon on the Place de la Concorde .
American cycle tourists had chained their bikes to the ornate columns and children in US Postal replica kit were being hoisted on to windows to watch sporting history being made .
Security around the American embassy was intense , as it has been around Armstrong all through the Tour .
The wave of cheering rippled up the avenue as eight of the US Postal team led their boss past the grandstands , his face as impassive as ever .
Amid the Armstrong victory parade the green jersey of points winner was the only issue to be settled yesterday .
This has been a tight three - way battle between Robbie McEwen , Thor Hushovd and Stuart O'Grady but the Norwegian was balked on the rush to the final corner yesterday behind the stage winner Tom Boonen of Belgium , and McEwen finished ahead of his fellow countryman to secure his second title in three years .
The other unfinished business yesterday was Armstrong 's personal battle with the Italian Filippo Simeoni , who is suing the Texan for libel .
It will rumble on after the Tour , but to make the point that he is not intimidated by Armstrong after the "" Boss "" prevented him going for the stage win on Friday , the Italian escaped soon after the start , and sped away again as the peloton approached Paris .
The convention is that the yellow jersey winner and his team lead the race on to the Champs Elysées so Simeoni 's attack was akin to breaking wind in communion .
He was chased down by the US Postal team and one of Armstrong 's domestiques , the Russian Viatcheslav Ekimov , made a "" horns "" gesture as he overtook the Italian .
He escaped again , and received similar short shrift from Hincapie .
Simeoni received the day 's "" combativity "" award but the episode was more redolent of the playground than the world 's biggest annual sports event .
It was , however , a reminder that Armstrong is not a straightforward hero .
The drugs suspicions remain largely unanswered and the contents of the biography , "" LA Confidential "" , unexplained and the subject of legal action .
The Simeoni episode perhaps helps to explain why Armstrong figured prominently in a poll of the French public 's most unpopular sportsmen in a Sunday newspaper yesterday .
He was not in the lead , but was not far behind Michael Schumacher and Nicolas Anelka .
Given that whenever he speaks he seems preoccupied by his popularity , or lack of it , he was probably relieved merely to be third overall .
Mr Popular or not , there seems no chance of Armstrong getting jaded just yet .
Seven years ago he told me that when he was diagnosed with cancer , two thoughts went through his mind : "" I might lose my career "" , "" I might die "" .
In that order .
After winning the 21st Tour de France stage of his career on Saturday , he made it clear he still feels that way . ""
This is probably the most fun year I 've had racing bikes .
I ca n't explain why a 33-year - old who 's been here for 12 years should be having more fun than ever . . .
It 's not about making history or money , just the thrill of getting on a bike and racing 200 other guys . ""
Speculation about Armstrong and a seventh Tour will remain intense .
Perhaps , now , his celebrity is such that he can afford to miss the race , as Eddy Merckx did in his prime , and take a sabbatical at the Giro d'Italia , the Tour of Spain , or the World Cup series of single day races .
That seems unlikely . ""
No other bike race has a million people by the side of the road , this is the one I love
and I ca n't imagine skipping the Tour de France .
I would only come with perfect condition and come ready to win .
I ca n't imagine not being here . """

Most recently , amateur cyclists have talked of "" dining chez Virenque "" , a reference to the seven - times mountains winner banned after the Festina scandal ."
2004-07-26,"Seven years after completing treatment for cancer so virulent that he was given only a 40 % chance of survival , the American cyclist Lance Armstrong yesterday became the first man to win the Tour de France , the world 's most gruelling sporting challenge , on six occasions .
After spending 83 hours 36 minutes and two seconds in the saddle since the race began three weeks ago , Armstrong pedalled over the cobbles of the sunlit Champs - Elysées to claim a victory that some believe sets the seal on the greatest story in modern sport .
The 32-year - old Texan 's tale has already been the subject of two best - selling volumes of autobiography , and his battle against the disease has inspired the foundation of a hugely successful cancer charity .
Brought up in a small town by a teenage single mother , Armstrong showed an early talent for running and swimming .
At 16 , having saved his pocket money , he bought his first bicycle and took up the triathlon .
A professional cyclist at 20 , he entered the Tour de France for the first time a year later and , as a brash unknown , became the youngest man to win a stage in the race since the second world war . ""
Even as a child , "" his mother said , "" he knew what he wanted , "" and his career was going nicely when , in the autumn of 1996 , he noticed specks of blood appearing when he coughed .
At St David 's hospital in Austin , Texas , he was told that testicular cancer had spread to his lungs and his brain .
A two - hour operation the next day was followed by three months of intensive chemotherapy in Indianapolis .
"" If I was n't in pain , I was vomiting , "" he wrote in the award - winning book
It 's Not
About The Bike , "" and if I was n't vomiting I was thinking about what I had .
Chemo was a burning in my veins , a matter of being slowly eaten from the inside out by a destroying river of pollutants . ""
Nevertheless , only 518 days later he was back in the saddle , competing in a race .
Yesterday many of his fellow riders were wearing the yellow bracelet that has been sold , for a dollar or a euro , all the way along the 2,000 miles of the Tour 's route .
More than $ 5 m ( £ 2.8 m ) will be raised by this means for Armstrong 's foundation , whose motto is "" Live strong "" .
His triumph has been shadowed , however , by persistent claims concerning his association with an Italian doctor , Michele Ferrari , who is under investigation for allegedly supplying EPO , a synthetic human growth hormone , to riders .
At the beginning of this year 's Tour the publication in French of a book entitled LA Confidentiel , featuring claims that his team had systematically used EPO , provoked an angry response from Armstrong .
After failing in a legal attempt to force the publishers to include his own statement in every copy , he has promised to sue the authors for libel .
The American 's success has come at a time when the phenomenon of widespread drug - taking within the sport is receiving greater publicity than ever before , thanks to the aggressive action of the French police and a handful of investigative journalists .
Several prominent cyclists , most recently the British rider David Millar , have been banned from competition .
Marco Pantani , an Italian who became the last man to win the Tour before Armstrong began his run of victories , died this year from an overdose of heroin and cocaine , his career ruined by a series of positive dope tests .
Armstrong , however , has tested positive only once , in 1999 , when minute traces of a synthetic cortocosteroid were discovered in a urine sample .
The authorities accepted his explanation that it had been part of a proprietary skin cream used to treat saddle boils , an inescapable feature of the cycle racer 's arduous life .
The public 's divergent views on the nature of his success were evident last week on the climb up to l'Alpe d'Huez , one of the Tour 's most famous features , where fans paint messages of support on the steeply winding roadway .
As he raced along , Armstrong 's eyes passed over a series of messages ranging in tone from "" RIP THEIR BALLS OFF , LANCE "" to "" EPO ARMSTRONG "" .
A few days earlier he was said to have been spat on by spectators .
Most cycling fans , however , accept that the use of illegal performance - enhancing substances goes back as far as the origins of the 101-year - old Tour .
When Jacques Anquetil , one of the quartet of five - times winners , was once asked about doping , he responded in exasperation : "" Do they expect us to ride up these mountains on mineral water ? ""
Until concrete evidence is produced against Armstrong , the majority appear content to welcome him to a unique place in the pantheon .
For the sixth year in succession the Star - Spangled Banner sounded on the Champs - Elysées as he ascended the podium to accept the trophy and don the yellow jersey under the eye of his girlfriend Sheryl Crow , the rock singer , who not only followed him around the race but accompanied him on the weeks of training runs with which he reconnoitred the course in the spring .
His friend Robin Williams , the actor , was also at hand .
Although Armstrong , who lives most of the year in Spain , has pointedly expressed his disapproval of George Bush 's foreign policy , the president , a fellow Texan , yesterday called him to congratulate him on behalf of the nation .
"" You 're awesome , "" he told him .
The minute thoroughness of Armstrong 's preparation , and the collective strength of his US Postal Service team , are among the factors contributing to the success that has made him a multimillionaire .
What is less easy to define is the origin of a ferocious competitive spirit that burned even more fiercely this year as he reduced his rivals to shattered wrecks .
Calling it revenge on the disease that tried to take his life is too glib .
Armstrong was a fighter from the start .
But cancer certainly gave him the experience of confronting and beating a bigger opponent than any he has faced on a bike ."
2004-07-27,"Lance Armstrong took time out recently from winning his record - breaking sixth Tour de France to telephone Britain 's leading cyclist David Millar to offer him his support after the Scot 's confession that he had used the banned blood booster erythropoietin ( EPO ) .
In his first interview since his confession on June 24 , Millar told the Guardian yestrday that he had received three calls of support from his fellow professionals .
As well as Armstrong , he was contacted by his team - mate Stuart O'Grady and the sprinter Baden Cooke , both close friends .
Armstrong has often said he would like the Scot to join his US Postal Service team , and has commented that he felt Millar 's Cofidis team - to whom he was contracted himself in 1997 - did not give him the moral and coaching support he needed .
Millar told the Guardian his recourse to EPO came from "" dozens of reasons , building up over the years "" .
They included pressure from Cofidis to race when he was injured and over - raced which led to resentment .
"" It was like a way of getting back at them - ' look what you 've driven me to ' , "" he said , adding that he felt under obligation to get results because he was the team leader .
The Scot 's disciplinary hearing is scheduled for August 4 .
His future plans will depend on the length of his ban , but he said yesterday that he would like his case to serve as a deterrent to young cyclists who may be tempted to use drugs .
"" I have made mistakes and I am ready to learn from them , "" he said .
"" I want to show how I got round the system and am willing to work with the International Cycling Union and British Cycling .
I would like to explain the dangers of drugs to young riders . """
2004-07-28,"Lance Armstrong cruised to an unprecedented sixth consecutive victory in the Tour de France on Sunday .
The American 's win was met by delight in the US papers , but by ambivalence in the French press , who have been particularly hostile to the cyclist , and have previously questioned his ability to do so well without the use of performance - enhancing drugs .
Armstrong vehemently denies such insinuations and has never failed a drugs test .
In Armstrong 's home state , Texas , the Houston Chronicle was rapturous . ""
Boxing had Muhammad Ali , basketball Michael Jordan , baseball Babe Ruth , but those great champions sometimes lost it when it mattered , "" the paper said .
"" Armstrong 's consistent performance as the favourite makes him a kind of human Seabiscuit . ""
The Chronicle was gratified that , at a time when French - US relations are strained , "" even the French acknowledge Armstrong is the great champion of bicycle racing "" .
Diane Pucin in the Los Angeles Times agreed as she described the scene at the finish line . ""
The applause was genuine , warm and honest , "" she said .
"" Fans with American flags were ... even kissed on the cheeks . ""
The International Herald Tribune 's Geoffrey Wheatcroft was more circumspect .
Armstrong 's victory "" rubbed more salt in Gallic wounds "" , he said .
"" American dominance in any European event at any time might be resented , but this is n't any other time , and the Tour is n't any other contest . ""
France "" faces an uncertain future in which a sporting decline is only a part "" .
It was simply frustration that caused the French to gripe , he concluded .
For the French it all came down to Armstrong 's personality .
L'Equipe criticised his coolness and arrogance .
"" Six Tours : immense respect .
But , really ... "" Bordeaux 's Sud - Ouest reckoned it could never get to trust the "" world master "" , because "" there will always remain some shady part of him that makes him suspicious "" .
In Le Figaro , Jean - Yves Donor reminisced about those great French winners of yesteryear whose record Armstrong had broken .
"" They were so alive , such rascals , "" he sighed .
"" We should take our hats off to Armstrong , "" he conceded , "" but the race belongs to France . """
2004-08-04,"They say the Tour de France is the toughest test of endurance in sport , but that only lasts for three weeks .
The race to be champion jockey spans eight months , from early spring to the first days of winter , and rarely allows the serious contenders more than a day or two to relax .
Lance Armstrong is certainly a remarkable athlete , but in terms of sheer determination at least , men like Kieren Fallon , Frankie Dettori and Seb Sanders are not far behind .
Fallon , who has 102 winners so far , is the only jockey in this year 's title race to have reached three figures , but with the champion sitting out the last afternoon of a four - day suspension yesterday , the chasing pack had a chance to reel him in .
This year 's championship could be the closest for several years , possibly even a three - way fight , and Frankie Dettori , who was on 97 winners at the start of the day , and Seb Sanders , with 95 to his name , both arrived here yesterday with several fancied rides .
Dettori was the first to make ground on Fallon , bringing My Princess with a well - timed run to beat Chantaco and Azuree in the opening race .
It was Sanders , though , who did the most damage , as he completed a double on Who 's Winning and Kirkham Abbey to move within a single winner of Dettori ahead of last night 's cards .
Just six weeks ago , Sanders was a wild outsider for the title , with barely half as many winners to his name as Fallon .
An extraordinary run of success in July , though , has brought him within striking distance , and his performances yesterday suggested that he is a very credible contender for the championship .
Sanders ' double came at a price , as he received a one - day ban for using his whip with unreasonable frequency on Who 's Winning , but he is a strong and clever jockey whose self - belief is growing by the day .
Kirkham Abbey , in particular , was a reluctant partner yesterday , hanging right on the firm ground as Sanders asked him to pass Fortune Point a furlong out .
He was not to be denied , though , and vigorous encouragement from the saddle soon persuaded the four - year - old that ducking the issue was not an option .
The only surprise about Sanders ' afternoon was that he did not have a treble , as the remarkable Masafi , his mount in the £ 30,000 Brighton Mile , the richest race of the season at the track , was a 4 - 5 chance to win his eighth race in the space of six weeks .
Masafi already held the record for the fastest seven - timer in modern racing history , but another record for eight in a row proved beyond him .
Sanders was ideally placed to challenge with three furlongs to run , but Masafi 's recent schedule may have finally caught up with him , and he dropped away as Aesculus came late under Nicky Mackay to see off the brave challenge of Flint River by a neck .
As the bulk of the 6,000 Brighton punters started to make their way home , both Sanders and Dettori were already on the way to Kempton 's evening meeting .
This title race could go all the way to the final days ."
2004-09-07,"Sean Yates , Britain 's most popular cyclist of recent years , is to team up next season with Lance Armstrong when he joins the six - times Tour de France winner 's team as a directeur sportif , or road manager .
Yates , who has spent the last two seasons working for the Danish CSC squad , will join Armstrong 's Discovery Channel team on a three - year contract .
"" I 've always wanted to work with Lance in some shape or form , "" said Yates , "" and the fact that it 's a three - year deal will give me some security .
"" The appointment is understood to have come at the specific request of the Tour de France record holder , who began his career racing alongside Yates at American team Motorola between 1992 and 1996 .
Armstrong has often spoken about his high regard for the Sussex racer .
Shortly after joining Motorola , the Texan made a point of persuading Yates , who by then was close to retirement , to remain on his bike so that he could benefit from his experience . ""
Discovery need an extra manager for next year , because they will be racing an enlarged programme that includes all the three major Tours , Italy , France and Spain , "" said Yates .
After ending his career , which included a stage win in the Tour de France and a day wearing the yellow jersey , Yates had a spell as team manager at the Linda McCartney squad in 1999 and 2000 and also worked as a builder and gardener before joining CSC .
At 44 , he is still riding his bike in amateur events , and occasionally shocks his professional charges by training before and after the stages in major events .
On Sunday he delighted London cycling fans by turning out to finish seventh in the amateur race that preceded the final stage of the Tour of Britain on a circuit in Whitehall .
That stage attracted an estimated 85,000 spectators , and the Tour of Britain organisers said afterwards that they will be attempting to increase the length of the event from five days to eight or nine next year .
They are also hoping that the race will qualify for the International Cycling Union 's ProTour , a series of events which the world 's top professional teams will be obliged to ride . ""
The ICU want there to be a British slot on the ProTour calendar next year
and they were waiting to see if this year 's race happened , "" said Tour of Britain technical director Mick Bennett .
"" They want the Tour of Britain to cover Scotland and Wales , and perhaps Ireland , so the length would have to be increased . """
2004-09-23,"A Texas insurance company has asked to see Lance Armstrong 's medical records before it pays the six - times Tour de France winner the $ 5 m ( £ 2.8 m ) bonus which became due to him when he broke the record for victories in the bike race this July .
As a result Tailwind Sports , the parent company of Armstrong 's team , and SCA Promotions Inc , based in Dallas , have become embroiled in a legal battle centred on allegations contained in the unauthorised French biography of Armstrong , LA Confidential , which was published in June .
Armstrong has launched lawsuits for defamation totalling £ 3 m against the book 's publishers and authors .
The Texan has emphatically rejected allegations in the book that the circumstantial evidence gathered by the authors implies that he may have used banned drugs .
Armstrong said he has never deviated from the applicable medical requirements nor detailed testing standards .
Following Armstrong 's third Tour victory in 2001 , Tailwind Sports paid SCA a $ 420,000 insurance premium , to ensure that the risk for his win bonuses in future years would be met by the insurance company .
SCA 's attorney John Bandy said that according to the policy the company paid Armstrong a total of $ 4.5 m in bonuses for his first five Tour wins .
Bandy added that under the policy Armstrong was due to be paid $ 5 m as a bonus for winning this year 's event but they have refused to pay the money as yet and instead have put it into a custodial account with JP Morgan .
SCA 's case is they need pay the bonus only if the claim is valid .
Tailwind 's case is that SCA is contractually obliged to pay the £ 5 m immediately .
"" We are trying to determine the validity of the claim , "" said Bandy , in emphasising the company 's normal practice .
"" Right now we are investigating allegations from the book .
If we determine it [ the claim ] is valid we will turn over the custodial account at once . ""
"" We have asked certain questions deriving from the book LA Confidential .
We have requested some medical data . ""
Tailwind claim that SCA is seeking information that has nothing to do with Armstrong 's undisputed victories .
According to a legal claim filed recently by Tailwind , SCA have asked them to provide all Armstrong 's medical data , and for his permission to examine the records and test results .
Armstrong has , however , never tested positive and has never fallen foul of any of the International Cycling Union 's blood tests to detect anomalies that could point to health risks or the use of illicit practice .
Tailwind said that "" all this has been examined in excruciating detail by medical professionals whose duty it was to test , investigate and ensure compliance . """
2004-10-02,"Lance Armstrong has moved to cut his ties with the Italian sports doctor and trainer Michele Ferrari , who was yesterday found guilty of sporting fraud in Bologna .
Ferrari was given a one - year suspended sentence , a fine of € 900 ( £ 620 ) , banned from working as a doctor for 11 months and 21 days and ordered to pay trial costs by the Italian judge Maurizio Passarini .
He was acquitted of distributing health - threatening doping products .
It is the first time a cycling doctor has been found guilty of sporting fraud in Italy , a charge which covers helping riders to dope , and therefore win races fraudulently .
Besides Armstrong , Ferrari has worked with the former Giro d'Italia winner Ivan Gotti , Armstrong 's friend and former team - mate Kevin Livingstone , the Athens Olympic bronze medallist Axel Merckx , Filippo Simeoni and Claudio Chiappucci .
Armstrong , who has defend - ed his ties to Ferrari , was not mentioned in the trial though he said in an interview last year that he would "" re - evaluate "" their relationship if the Italian physician was found guilty .
Yesterday the six - times Tour de France winner issued a statement that said : "" Dr Ferrari has been a longtime friend and trusted adviser to me and the USPS [ US Postal ] team , during which time he never suggested , prescribed or provided me with any performance - enhancing drugs . ""
He added : "" I have always said that I have zero tolerance for anyone convicted of using or facilitating the use of performance - enhancing drugs .
As a result of today 's developments , the USPS team and I have suspended our professional affiliation with Dr Ferrari as we await the release of the full verdict , which will contain Judge Maurizio Passerini 's reasoning . ""
Armstrong has always denied taking any perform - ance - enhancing drugs and has insisted that Ferrari only advised him on diet and training programmes .
Ferrari was found guilty following a long investigation into doping by Italian police .
Evidence included tapped telephone calls from a Bologna pharmacist , prescriptions of banned doping products apparently signed by Ferrari , a list of drugs found in Ferrari 's house during police searches and cyclists ' training programmes crammed with asterisks .
Armstrong was not mentioned in the documents .
Simeoni became the key witness after he said in court that Ferrari told him to take the banned blood boosting drug EPO and the steroid Andriol if he wanted to win races .
"" I 'm convinced I 'm innocent regarding all of the accusations , "" Ferrari said .
Ferrari 's lawyer Dario Bolognesi said they would appeal .
Simeoni has been a thorn in the side of Armstrong ever since he gave evidence against Ferrari in February 2002 .
Armstrong chased him down during this year 's Tour de France , sparking an investigation by Italian police to see if Armstrong attempted to put pressure on an Italian trial witness .
The investigation is continuing .
"" It 's an important sentence that proves I was telling the truth and discredits Armstrong for his close relationship with Ferrari .
In many ways it also condemns Armstrong , "" Simeoni said in Verona , where he will ride in the world road race championships tomorrow .
Stephen Farrand writes for Cycling Weekly"
2004-10-28,"Italian police investigating allegations that the six - times Tour de France winner Lance Armstrong intimidated a key witness in the trial of his trainer on drugs charges have passed a dossier of rider interviews to a prosecutor in Lucca , who will decide whether to proceed with the case .
A source close to the investigation said he felt there was sufficient evidence to merit further inquiry .
The investigation was sparked by an incident in this year 's Tour involving the Texan and Filippo Simeoni .
The Italian rider was a prosecution witness against Armstrong 's trainer Michele Ferrari , who was given a one - year suspended prison sentence on October 1 for sporting fraud , a charge which covers helping riders to dope and thus win races fraudulently .
None of the charges against Ferrari related to Armstrong , but the Texan was steadfast in his support for the trainer until he was found guilty , and two days before the Tour finish he rode across to an escape including Simeoni during the stage to Lons le Saunier in central France and , according to Simeoni , made it clear that the group would not be allowed to remain in front unless the Italian dropped back .
A source close to the investigation said yesterday : "" We have heard from Simeoni and the other riders involved in this well - known stage of the Tour and are waiting for the prosecutor 's decision before proceeding to the next stage of the inquiry .
It 's too soon to talk of a trial . ""
The source denied speculation that charges against Armstrong might include sporting fraud , which relates to his denying Simeoni a fair chance to contest the stage win , as Simeoni has claimed .
Armstrong yesterday said that he felt the Italian authorities had no grounds for pressing charges of any kind . ""
To try and make the case that I tried to intimidate a witness , that I 'm potentially guilty of sporting fraud because I was just contesting my sport
- it 's ludicrous .
As we know , the climate in Italy is very political right now and very motivated to keep the issue of doping in the forefront and this is just another subplot . ""
For the first time , the Texan admitted yesterday that he might have made the wrong decision in denying Simeoni his chance to win the stage .
"" We can all say : ' Lance , you should have done that or you should n't have done this ; you 're the yellow jersey and do n't waste your time doing that ' - that 's all fine .
I 'm fine with an editorial that says ' bad move , no class ' .
No problem .
But to then be investigated for intimidating a witness , sporting fraud and whatever the other charge is , that 's crazy . ""
Speaking to the website cyclingnews.com Armstrong added that he was unlikely to contest the Giro d'Italia next year for the first time because he was afraid the police might take him and his team , sponsored by the Discovery Channel , in for questioning .
"" I have to ask myself , do I want to subject myself and my team and my sponsor to a tremendous photo op for the Italian police , and
the answer to that is no .
Why would I want to show up and have them waiting at the airport and whisk me off ?
They are wasting their time for something that has no effect on their process over there and on what 's fair and right over there . ""
Management at the Texan 's team said the decision whether he will go for a seventh win on the Tour de France will not be taken until he begins racing in February .
Whether or not Armstrong is present , next year 's Tour seems likely to be without Mario Cipollini , the best sprinter of the 1990s .
The flamboyant Italian is expected to announce his retirement today .
The course for 2005 will hold no fears for the Texan .
The race does not return to L'Alpe d'Huez but takes in climbs in the Vosges and Pyrenees ."

2004-12-10,"Lance Armstrong has played down his chances of riding next year 's Tour de France by announcing that he will wait until early May before deciding whether to bid for a record seventh consecutive Tour title .
The Texan began his build - up to the 2005 season recently with a training camp in his home city of Austin , during which he told the daily Austin American - Statesman that the decision over the Tour will be left until after he has raced the spring one - day Classics .
"" Everything is clear in my head , I 'm relaxed and I feel better than I have in December in other years , "" said Armstrong , who added that he intends to continue racing for another two years .
"" Last year I was really very worried about everything that was being said .
No one had beaten the record before [ five Tour victories ] and sometimes you end up believing the stupid things people say . ""
An initial decision over Armstrong 's spring campaign will be taken at the end of January after his Discovery Channel team 's training camp at Solvang , California .
The Texan has confirmed that he will race the Tour of Flanders one - day Classic in early April and he will decide on the Tour when he returns to Texas for a break at the end of the month .
Making his mind up so late would leave Armstrong with only eight weeks to prepare for the Tour , which starts on the first weekend of July .
That in turn suggests that he is at best ambivalent about riding the French race .
One potential distraction for the Texan could come with the possible publication in 2005 of a US edition of the unauthorised and controversial biography LA Confidential , published this year in French and the subject of two court cases over its suggestion through circumstantial evidence that Armstrong may have used banned substances , which he strenuously denied .
"" We are in advanced negotiations with an American publisher and , if the book is published in the States , there will be a considerable amount of new material in it , "" said one of the book 's co - authors , the French writer Pierre Ballester ."
2005-01-11,"Lance Armstrong has confirmed that he will try to win a seventh Tour de France , but it may not be until 2006 .
Yesterday the 33-year - old said he plans to ride in several of the European spring classics before deciding in late April whether to try for a seventh consecutive Tour de France victory in July .
"" I 'll definitely be in France this summer , "" he said .
"" It just might not be on the bike . ""
Armstrong had been coy about his plans for the future but , at the launch of his team 's new sponsorship deal with the Discovery Channel , he indicated that the terms of his contract with the broadcaster require him to take part in one of the next two races . ""
The deal is that I will do a Tour , if not more , "" he said .
"" That could be in 2005 or 2006 , but I 'm fully committed to doing it . ""
Will it hurt to see somebody else sipping champagne ? ""
Armstrong said .
"" I do n't know if it 'll hurt , but it might make me a little hungry . . .
I 've read some stuff where the organisers say , ' Well , maybe it 's good if he sits out a year and lets somebody else win
and then he comes back
and there 's a rematch . '
That does sound like a good idea , but that 's not going to be what makes the decision . ""
The Texan 's team , now known as the Discovery Channel Pro Cycling Team , also announced its 2005 race schedule .
Their 28 riders from 15 countries will start 11 days of training in California today , but it is no longer focused on winning the Tour de France above all else , as it has in years past .
"" It 's definitely a departure , beginning the year not focusing on the Tour , "" said Armstrong , the only six - times winner of cycling 's most prestigious race .
Recently , Armstrong has pined for a chance to focus on some of the races he has ignored because his focus has always been on the Tour de France .
He said his tentative plans for this year include the Tour of Flanders , the Amstel Gold Race in the Netherlands , the Flêche Wallone and the Liège - Bastogne - Liège .
He has only won one of those races , the Flêche Wallone in 1996 , shortly before he was diagnosed with testicular cancer .
"" It 's time to finally go and win one of the monuments of cycling , "" Armstrong said .
If he chooses not to ride in this year 's Tour , Armstrong will probably compete in one of the other grand tours , either the Giro d'Italia or the Vuelta a España .
He has never competed in the Giro .
Armstrong 's final aim is to reclaim the one - hour cycling record held by Britain 's Chris Boardman ."
2005-01-11,"An item in Duncan Mackay 's column about Lance Armstrong 's libel claim against The Sunday Times , its chief sports writer David Walsh and Alan English ( Judge gives support to Armstrong , page 11 , Sport , January 8) misreported a recent decision of the court .

2005-02-16,"Lance Armstrong has confirmed that he will race in this year 's Tour de France and aim for a seventh straight win .
There was speculation , fuelled by the Texan , that Armstrong would skip the race which made his name in favour of cycling 's other landmark events .
However , the 34-year - old has announced he will compete this year after a strong performance in the 2004 edition , when he became the first man to win six Tours .
"" I am grateful for the opportunity that Discovery Communications has given the team , "" he said , "" and look forward to achieving my goal of a seventh Tour de France . """
2005-02-17,"Lance Armstrong ended speculation about his participation in this year 's Tour de France by confirming that he will attempt a seventh straight victory .
When Discovery took over as his team 's new sponsors from US Postal , who financed his first six Tours , it was part of the deal that he would do another Tour .
The big question was when .
The Texan had hinted before yesterday he would miss the 2005 event .
"" I am grateful for the opportunity that Discovery Communications has given the team and look forward to achieving my goal of a seventh Tour de France [ victory ] , "" said the 34-year - old who became the first man to win six Tours .
This summer 's Tour , on July 2 - 24 , will have 21 stages and cover 3,584 kilometres ( 2,222 miles ) .
The mountain - top finishes are less intense and the time - trials shorter .
Armstrong has excelled in both disciplines in the past .
The changes may mean he will have fewer opportunities to take huge chunks of time off his rivals .
However , there were similar fears in 2004 that the route might work against the champion but he adjusted well .
After his record - breaking Tour exploits in 2004 it was believed Armstrong would set his sights on some of cycling 's other landmarks , including the world hour record , held by Chris Boardman .
Armstrong had given an impression he might wait until next year before fulfilling his obligation to Discovery and race in the Giro d'Italia or the Vuelta a España instead of the Tour .
Those expectations were quashed yesterday when he revealed his provisional plans for 2005 .
He will start the season with the seven - day Paris - Nice race next month , the first event of the newly formed Pro Tour , as was initially confirmed .
"" I am excited to get back on the bike and start racing although my condition is far from perfect , "" said Armstrong .
"" Johan [ Bruyneel , the team 's sports manager ] and I will evaluate my fitness later this spring and possibly add some races to the calendar . ""

2005-03-05,"If any further reminder were needed of the distance that the six - times Tour de France winner Lance Armstrong has travelled since his recovery from testicular cancer , it will come tomorrow when the Texan sets out on the road from Paris to Nice in the first major race of the cycling calendar .
Last time Armstrong attempted the eight - day "" race to the sun "" in 1998 , he climbed ignominiously off his bike on a windswept hill south of Paris in the first road - race stage .
No one would have imagined that the next time he would be seen at the race would be seven years later , nor that he would return as the Tour de France recordholder .
That year Paris - Nice was the second race in Armstrong 's comeback , and he returned to Texas with his future in the balance , contemplated retirement and decided to continue racing only after a lengthy episode in which drinking beer and playing golf played a larger part than bike riding .
The rest is history .
Armstrong 's focus on the Tour de France since his decision to aim at the great race in 1999 has meant he has missed out Paris - Nice .
The event is generally believed to be too difficult , too early in the season , for a Tour contender to risk damaging his health and his form .
Over this 770-mile course , Armstrong will be backed by a strong team that includes most of the men who will help him try for a record seventh title in July , and he will start as the big favourite to improve on his second place overall in the event in 1996 .
The Texan is also present to show his support for the official opening of the season - long competition branded the ProTour by cycling 's governing body , the International Cycling Union .
This is the first of 27 races that will come under the ProTour banner .
The ProTour 's aim is to ensure the best riders and teams ride the world 's best races , and gathers 20 teams in stage and single - day events totalling 157 days of competition .
It is intended that the overall standings will designate the world 's best all - round cyclist .
However , the launch of the series has been dogged by a dispute with the major race organisers , led by Amaury Sport Organisation , who run the Tour de France and Paris - Nice .
They do not want a "" closed "" franchise - type system for the teams , as this restricts their freedom to have the riders they want in their races .
As yet they have agreed that their events can be part of the ProTour calendar , but have not applied for licences .
The British challenge tomorrow is led by the Olympic gold medallist Bradley Wiggins , who has his first major target of the season in the opening time trial around the Issy - les - Moulineaux area of Paris .
The distance , four kilometres , is that of the individual pursuit in which Wiggins won his Athens gold .
Wiggins has said he would like a top-10 placing in the overall standings as he begins the transition from Olympic track medallist to full - time road racer , but he is getting over recent illness and may not be at his best .
French police yesterday said that they have detained Laurent Biondi , the former professional who is directeur sportif of one of France 's leading teams , Ag2R. Biondi was held for questioning by magistrates in Bordeaux as part of a wider investigation into a drugs ring suspected of dealing in the cocktail of drugs known as "" Belgian mix "" ."
2005-03-08,"The six - times Tour de France winner Lance Armstrong has said he is willing to meet French investigators looking into drug allegations involving people linked to his team .
Speaking at the start of the eight - day Paris - Nice "" race to the sun "" , Armstrong said : "" My lawyers have sent a letter to the authorities to tell them that we are available anywhere , anytime to answer their questions . ""
A preliminary inquiry was opened late last year by the prosecutor 's office in Annecy after allegations made in the book LA Confidentiel , an unauthorised biography of Armstrong published in France .
Armstrong has always denied drug use , and is suing the book 's authors for defamation .
Armstrong added : "" I have nothing to hide and I am available .
If they [ the police investigators ] want to come to the race , there is no problem . ""
Yesterday , after the first road race stage of Paris - Nice , he finished 44th as the lead passed to the Dutchman Erik Dekker .
Britain 's Olympic pursuit champion Bradley Wiggins yesterday withdrew , returning home to be with his wife Catherine who is expecting their first child ."
2005-03-11,"Lance Armstrong has set a record of six consecutive Tour de France wins by getting his preparation spot - on .
Yesterday , however , his team manager Johan Bruyneel said that the demands made on the Texan last year had set him back in his campaign to stretch the record to seven wins in a row this July . ""
Last year , after his sixth win , the winter was crazy , "" said Bruyneel , speaking after Armstrong had pulled out of his first race of the season , the 750-mile Paris - Nice "" race to the sun "" .
"" His slow start [ this year ] is principally due to the number of things he has been asked to do . ""
Armstrong had already hinted that he was behind in his preparation because this winter he had spent longer than usual in the United States , where there are more distractions to prevent him from riding his bike . ""
When I am there I have difficulty reconciling the demands of my preparation and the things I have to do outside cycling , "" he said .
In Wednesday 's third stage he felt ill and that night he flew back to his Spanish base in Gerona by private jet .
"" If a rider does n't feel well and has feverish sensations he does n't want to race , "" said Bruyneel yesterday .
"" I was the first one to tell him that the best thing was to pack his bags and go back to Gerona . ""
It was not clear when Armstrong would be back on his bike either in training or racing because , according to Bruyneel , he has a virus which worsened during Wednesday night .
"" It is not the sort of thing you get rid of in two days , "" said Bruyneel .
"" We will have to see when he gets back on his bike . ""
The manager added that the snowy weather of this year 's Paris - Nice had made the race tougher than usual and had probably contributed to Armstrong 's illness .
Though Bruyneel said the illness was "" not a big problem "" it is a setback because Armstrong will have to try to make up the racing miles he has missed by riding in other events .
He has steered clear of Paris - Nice in the six years he has won the Tour , on the ground that it is too tough for a rider aiming to peak in July , and this outcome suggests he was probably right ."
2005-03-20,"Lance Armstrong did not race the first one - day Classic of the season , the 175-mile slog from Milan to the Riviera resort of San Remo .
Even if he had been fit , it was not on his schedule - the ' classic of classics ' , as the Italians call the event , is too tough for a cyclist who is planning to peak in July .
The Milan - San Remo was given a little extra piquancy yesterday as the first one - day race in the ProTour series , a new classification introduced this season to crown the year 's best all - round road racer , replacing the world computer rankings .
The ProTour 's 157 days of racing over 27 events will include the major stage races , such as the Tour de France and the Giro d'Italia , and all the great one - dayers , such as San Remo and Flanders .
The ProTour concept , which is the brainchild of Armstrong 's friend Hein Verbruggen , head of the International Cycling Union ( UCI ) , has had a reception as mixed - and in places as chilly - as the weather that marred the first event , the Paris - Nice ' race to the sun ' .
The teams have bought into the idea because it guarantees sponsors a place in the major races , including the Tour , if they take out a four - year licence and show that they have the financial back - up .
However , race organisers appear to see the ProTour as an attempt by the UCI , the sport 's world governing body , to gain greater control of their events and are against the system of ' closed ' franchises for teams , which they say does not give them control of who rides in their races .
Armstrong 's appearance at Paris - Nice , the opening event of the series , provided it with the endorsement it would have been looking for .
But the fact that he will ride just two other ProTour events - Flanders and the Dauphiné Libéré stage race - before the Tour suggests that , for him , the Tour de France is more important than the new season - long competition .
Armstrong 's form as he bids to push his Tour de France record to seven straight wins has turned minds towards the year 's centrepiece , which is just 14 weeks away .
The American returned to training last week after an illness that meant that he had made a surprisingly poor start to his season in the Paris - Nice .
Suffering from a sore throat , Armstrong quit the event , which was a major news item in itself because during the build - up to his six Tour wins , he abandoned only two races .
He also admitted that he wished that he had not chosen the race as his season - opener , while his team manager , Johan Bruyneel , put the illness down to the distractions of a winter in the US during which the demands on the cyclist 's time had multiplied .
There was a remote chance that Armstrong would return to racing in the Catalan Week race , which runs from tomorrow until Good Friday , but he was more likely to compete in a French one - day event , the Paris - Camembert on 29 March , followed by the Tour of Flanders on 3 April , before returning to the US for the Tour de Georgia , starting on 19 April .
The intense interest has been inevitable since Armstrong confirmed that he will go for the magnificent seventh win in the Tour de France , a choice he explained recently . '
I simply took my time to decide , ' he said .
' I had the option of not racing the Tour and concentrating on the Classics , in other words to do something else .
But thinking hard about it , I came to this conclusion : the Tour is the race I like best , the race to which I owe everything , the race I live for .
That 's the first reason I chose as I did . '
Armstrong 's contract with his new backers stipulates that he has to ride the Tour in 2005 or 2006 . '
The year was not important , ' he said .
' I just wanted to continue with the Tour .
I 'll go into it like the others .
The figure , the record do not matter .
It 'll be like the first or the second , just a question of winning the biggest race in the world . '
Armstrong is aware that the Tour is the only race that has a major public profile in the US . '
I hate to put it up on a bigger pedestal , but it is the greatest bicycle race in the world , ' he said .
' It 's the only race that 's gon na be on the front pages of The New York Times or the LA Times or USA Today .
It 's a natural fit , so why not do it one more time ?
Notwithstanding the dispute with race organisers , the ProTour is under way , but the fact that Armstrong is focusing on the Tour de France means that the new series will struggle to match the pre - eminence of the Tour ."
2005-03-30,"Lance Armstrong appears back on track in his bid to extend his record of Tour de France wins to seven in July after some hard training sessions in the mountains of the Canary Islands .
This is in spite of the fact that he surprisingly dropped out of his first race of the season , the Paris - Nice "" race to the sun "" in early March .
The Texan finished 24th yesterday in the hilly Paris - Camembert single - day race which finishes in the Normandy town of Vimoutiers , confirming that he is in shape for his first one - day Classic of the season , the Tour of Flanders on Sunday .
Asked what he had been doing since the Paris - Nice , Armstrong recently joked : "" Nothing - I 've just been partying , drinking beer , eating pizza , and reading the nonsense in the newspapers . ""
More seriously , he explained : "" I 'm working very hard at the moment .
I 've spent several days training in the Canary islands , and tried to focus on some longer efforts , longer climbs . ""
Armstrong was prominent in the peloton yesterday as the Paris - Camembert tackled several long hills in south Normandy , finishing in the main group seven seconds behind the winner , Laurent Brochard of France .
Afterwards , he disappeared into a car where his rockstar girlfriend Sheryl Crow was waiting .
The cancer survivor brought his return to racing forward to include last Sunday 's Fleche Brabanconne event near Brussels , in which he finished 43rd , 3min 43sec behind the reigning world champion , Oscar Freire of Spain .
This Sunday , the Tour of Flanders is planned to be the Texan 's final race in Europe before the Dauphiné Libéré stage race , his final Tour de France build - up event in mid - June .
After the Belgian Classic he will return to the US , where he will compete in the Tour de Georgia from April 19 to 24 . ""
The Tour of Flanders is a beautiful race , but do n't expect me to play a leading role .
I will be totally at the service of my team , "" said Armstrong , who is expected to help his team - mate George Hincapie .
Any doubts about Armstrong 's form are as nothing compared to the uncertainty surrounding his rival Jan Ullrich .
The German has been ill , will not start racing until the Circuit de la
Sarthe in France on April 5 , and yesterday his T - Mobile team received a public warning from their management about their poor results this season ."
2005-03-31,"This year 's Tour de France may be the six - time winner Lance Armstrong 's last appearance in the event , and there is speculation that he may announce in a few weeks ' time that he will retire at the end of this season . ""
The only thing that I am 100 % sure about is that I will be at the start of the next Tour de France , apart from if I have an accident , "" Armstrong said yesterday .
"" I 'll be there , I swear .
And it may be the last . ""
Armstrong , 33 , has been a professional cyclist since August 1992 , and yesterday , in an interview with the French newspaper Le Figaro , he said that travelling to Europe to compete was becoming ever more difficult as his three children by his ex - wife Kristin had begun to grow up .
""
The most painful thing when I am in Europe is being away from my children who are in Texas .
These repeated absences and the way the distances add up all mean that at some point I will say ' enough ' and go back to be close to them . ""
Armstrong delayed his decision to start the Tour this year and bid for a seventh win until shortly before returning to Europe for his first race , the Paris - Nice "" race to the sun . ""
He has confessed that he was undecided about what programme to adopt this season , and has since said that Paris - Nice was the wrong choice .
Such indecision is out of character for the Texan , whose Tour wins have been based on attention to every detail .
He has confessed that winning a seventh Tour can not compare with last year 's sixth win , when he broke new ground for any cycling great . ""
Taking a seventh Tour is my objective now .
But seven is just another one , while six was magical .
The Tour is still my obsession , a planned out , elaborate ambition , and after an up and down start to the season , I feel better now . ""
The Texan has clearly accepted the possibility that his cycling strength may be on the wane , even though he says that now , having finished two one - day races , he feels as strong as ever .
"" I know it [ decline ] can happen , and that it happens to any athlete who 's been on top for a long time .
The key is not to hang on too long , but to know how to stop when you 're on top .
I 'll make sure of that . ""
Armstrong has hinted that a major announcement will be made on April 18 , when he will give a press conference before starting the Tour de Georgia in the southern state .
"" I will have something important to say .
You 'll see .
You will know more in two weeks ' time . """
2005-04-01,"Lance Armstrong has been questioned by Italian police as part of the investigation into the intimidation of Filippo Simeoni during last year 's Tour de France .
The six - time Tour winner voluntarily travelled to the Tuscan town of Lucca on Wednesday to explain why he chased down Simeoni during stage 18 of the race , even though the Italian was not a threat to his sixth Tour victory .
"" I asked for the meeting , "" Armstrong told the daily Gazzetta dello Sport after leaving the Lucca police station . ""
The Italian magistrate seemed a smart guy .
I think he appreciated my willingness to see him .
I simply told him the whole truth . ""
The magistrate Giuseppe Quattrocchi had formally opened an investigation after Simeoni claimed Armstrong threatened him because he had given evidence in the trial of Dr Michele Ferrari .
The doctor was one of Armstrong 's key advisers until he was given a suspended one - year sentence for sporting fraud and supplying drugs .
Armstrong had always supported Ferrari , claiming he was an honest man but ended their professional relationship after the guilty verdict .
After giving his version of things Armstrong could still face charges of violenza privata by intimidating a trial witness , but he no longer risks being taken into custody whenever he travels to Italy .
On Tuesday Armstrong hinted he may retire after attempting to win a seventh Tour de France this July and announced an "" important "" US press conference for April 18 .
After Armstrong 's trip to Italy Gazzetta dello Sport speculated that Armstrong may have decided to face questioning now so that he can ride the Giro d'Italia next month .
Armstrong has never ridden the three - week race but has always said he would like to do so after living in Italy in the early years of his professional career . ""
Armstrong has always said he wants to ride the Giro at least once before retiring , "" Pier Bergonzi wrote .
"" If there 's chance that it may happen , it had to include resolving his Italian legal problems . ""
· Next year 's Tour de France will start in Strasbourg , with a 7.5 km time - trial on July 1 ."
2005-04-02,"A former personal assistant to Lance Armstrong has filed court papers in Austin , Texas , alleging he discovered a banned substance in the six - time Tour de France champion 's apartment early last year .
Armstrong , who has hinted he may retire after this year 's Tour , is currently involved in seven legal cases regarding accusations of doping and defamation .
Armstrong 's attorney , Timothy Herman , called the accusations by Mike Anderson false and "" absurd "" , telling the Austin American - Statesman newspaper they had expected drug allegations as an attempt to obtain a financial settlement .
Anderson worked for Armstrong in both Austin and the American 's home in Gerona , Spain , between November 2002 and November 2004 , doing shopping for him , driving a car behind Armstrong in training and repairing his bikes .
Armstrong ended the relationship last year and began legal action in December , claiming Anderson demanded $ 500,000 ( £ 264,000 ) in a settlement .
Anderson countersued , claiming fraud , breach of contract and that he had suffered the "" intentional infliction of severe mental distress "" .
As part of his counterclaim , during legal proceedings Anderson said he found a banned steroid in the bathroom cabinet of Armstrong 's home in Gerona . ""
The box was white with red and black lettering and had a normal label like any other prescription drug , "" the official Travis County court papers stated . ""
However , there was no doctor 's prescription attached .
Both the trademark name and the pharmacological name were on the front of the box .
The trademark name was Androstenine , or something very close to this . ""
Anderson said he looked up the substance on the websites of the World Anti - Doping Agency ( Wada ) and the US Anti - Doping Agency ( Usada ) and found that the substance was "" an androgen and on the banned substance list "" .
Armstrong has never tested positive for an illegal substance during his six - year Tour de France winning streak and has always denied taking performance - enhancing drugs .
According to the 36-page court document , Anderson said it was the only time he found the alleged substance , and that he never saw Armstrong taking banned drugs .
Armstrong is scheduled to ride the Tour of Flanders race in Belgium tomorrow before flying back the US .
He has called a press conference for April 18 to announce "" something important "" .
On Thursday he told the Italian paper La Gazzetta dello Sport : "" Four more months and that 's it . """
2005-04-19,"The Champs Elysées has a special savour for all Tour de France participants but this year 's finish will hold particular significance , marking as it will the end of Lance Armstrong 's 13-year career .
The Texan confirmed yesterday in Atlanta that on July 24 he will retire from racing after attempting to push his victory tally in the world 's toughest cycle race to a magnificent seven in a row . ""
Win or lose , the 2005 Tour de France will be my last race as a professional cyclist , "" he said , before attempting to defend his title in this week 's Tour de Georgia , which will be his last competition on US soil .
"" Having said that , I 'm motivated to try for a seventh win . ""
Armstrong added : "" I have thought a lot about it .
I have gone back and forth .
My time has come but I will definitely have the itch every now and again . ""
The American has three children from his marriage to Kristin Richards , which ended in 2003 , and as they have grown older he has found it harder to leave them time and again to prepare in Europe to race the Tour . ""
My children are my biggest supporters but at the same time they are the ones who told me it 's time to come home .
After July 24 is not an option .
"" I would like to win again .
I would love to go out on top .
I 'm 100 % sure of my decision .
It 's final .
I 'll try and help the team out , try to develop a new Tour winner with them . ""
Armstrong 's first Tour victory , in 1999 , came less than three years after he had been diagnosed with testicular cancer at the end of the 1996 season , and had been given a 40 % chance of survival .
In the centenary race in 2003 he equalled the great Miguel Indurain 's record of five consecutive wins , joining the other quintuple victors Bernard Hinault , Eddie Merckx and Jacques Anquetil , and last year he took six stages en route to the absolute record .
Armstrong has already said that he will also devote more time to the cancer charity he founded .
"" That is enough to keep me busy for the next 50 years , "" he said .
Along with his children , his charity and his racing , he has also had to find time for his relationship with the singer Sheryl Crow .
When he quits , Armstrong will have spent just short of 13 years as a professional cyclist .
Yesterday the Tour de France organiser
Jean - Marie Leblanc said that the Texan 's decision was "" due to mental rather than physical fatigue "" , and speculated that he might not be up to his usual standard in this year 's race .
"" You ca n't help thinking that a thread has snapped , and that may affect him , it may shake up his mind .
That 's not a wish or a hope , just a statement of fact .
"" Armstrong had hinted that , instead of the Tour , this year he might focus on the single - day Classics or the Giro d'Italia , or that he might make a bid for Chris Boardman 's hour distance record .
But the two - year deal he signed at the end of 2004 with a new sponsor , Discovery Channel , stipulated that he had to race the Tour at least once in those two years .
He explained yesterday that he will not break his contract , as there is no stipulation that the second year has to be spent racing .
Though one former team - mate , Jonathan Vaughters , described Armstrong 's ruthless mind set as like that of "" a cold - hearted killer "" , the Texan has always maintained that his Tour wins are an affirmation of life after cancer .
"" It 's a contest of purposeless suffering
but I think it may be the most gallant athletic endeavour in the world . ""
The end of that endeavour is just over three months away ."
2005-06-06,"The Tour de France has been called chess on wheels .
June , when the Tour men get serious about their build - up , is more akin to poker .
Lance Armstrong , his biggest rival Jan Ullrich and outsiders such as Ivan Basso and Roberto Heras need to show just enough form to sow a seed or two of doubt , while keeping anything that may give encouragement to the opposition close to their chests .
Armstrong and Ullrich rarely , if ever , meet on the same roads in June .
For either to give the other a close look at his form before the Tour would be akin to Arsène Wenger letting Sir Alex Ferguson attend Arsenal training , but last Wednesday , somewhere in the Pyrenees , their paths crossed .
Armstrong and his team manager , Johan Bruyneel , had just left their hotel in the team car to begin the day 's reconnaissance of the mountain stage , finishing at the Pla d'Adet ski station , when they spotted a distinctive little group dressed in the pink kit of the T - Mobile team .
"" I said , ' Holy shit , look at this , "" laughs Armstrong . ""
There were four T - Mobile guys , Ullrich , [ Oscar ] Sevilla , [ Tobias ]
Steinhauser going past - what a small world .
Obviously I was n't going to stop and say , '
Hey guys , can I tag along for four or five hours ? '
So we drove up the road and started in front of them . ""
He admits to riding faster than usual , to avoid the unthinkable : Ullrich and company sweeping past , getting their psychological blow in first . ""
They knew we were there , because there were a lot of German cycle tourists and they were obviously telling [ Ullrich ] .
We knew they were behind us .
It was like a mini - race .
It would have been funny to watch .
"" It is also a telling and hilarious image : the two favourites for the Tour de France engaging in a mini - pursuit match over a mountain stage , purely to maintain the mental high ground .
On one of the climbs , the Col du Peyresourde , the vast sweeping hairpins make it possible to see several kilometres back down the mountain .
"" I kept looking over .
Are they coming ?
I was afraid they were going to catch me . ""
Armstrong laughs when asked how Ullrich looked ? ""
Terrible .
I have to say that . ""
Yesterday afternoon marked the start of the final countdown to the last Tour of Armstrong 's career , which he hopes will end with a seventh consecutive victory on the Champs Elysées on July 24 .
He finished fifth in the prologue time - trial in Aix - les - Bains that opened the Dauphiné Libéré stage race , his principal preparation race for the Tour before all but one of his six wins .
Behind the piercing blue eyes and the jokes , his mind seemed to be absorbed in the same poker game as in each of the last five Junes , even though Armstrong is building up to his last Tour with absolutely nothing left to prove to the sporting world in terms of results .
A lack of conclusive evidence means that his other challenge , to prove his innocence of doping allegations , has boiled down to a matter of opinion .
As usual , he talks up the opposition and talks down his own chances .
"" I think Jan is ahead of schedule this year .
From what I 've seen looking at the internet he 's strong .
I do n't think you 'll see Jan off the podium this year . ""
Basso , last year 's runner - up , is "" more dangerous than ever "" .
Heras may prove the dark horse .
He even raises the possibility that he may opt for assisting his team - mates Paolo Savoldelli - winner of the Tour of Italy eight days ago - or the talented Ukrainian Yaroslav Popovych .
This is taking pre - Tour bluffing to a new level .
Part of the game is that Armstrong will not give away how he is feeling or whether he has doubts over his fitness .
The answers , as ever , are evasive , deliberately , sometimes jokingly so .
"" It 's tough to say how I am , because I have n't raced since [ the Tour of ] Georgia [ in late April ] .
Last year I thought I was good , came to this race and was told otherwise .
I 've ridden a lot . ""
How many miles ? ""
Enough , a lot , the same .
I 've not thought about it .
Frankly I do n't think I can win the Dauphiné , but it 's great to be racing .
Training gets old .
I need race days .
"" The runes will be closely read this week .
Armstrong is short of racing , with only 12 days of competition this year .
He has yet to win a race .
He has not started one of his nine Tours without winning a race in the build - up , but he acknowledges that "" it 's possible [ this year ] , I hope not "" .
For his own confidence - and to deprive Ulllrich et al of any grounds for optimism - he needs to strike this week .
Armstrong accepts that he is short of time - trial practice , so his performance in Wednesday 's contre - la - montre at Roanne - on a new , aerodynamic bike - will be closely watched .
The next day 's stage will also be significant , when he races for the last time up Mont Ventoux , a mountain where he has never won , where he has suffered horribly and would dearly love to set the record straight .
No matter how this week 's race goes , it would , says the six - times winner , take something cataclysmic to keep him away from the 10th Tour of his career .
"" I would have to be incapable of starting - an accident , a crash or a serious illness .
It would take a tragedy to prevent me starting . ""
Armstrong looks leaner than when he last competed , in the Tour of Georgia in late April , but it may be that he has some doubts over his fitness as he builds up to this Tour .
There have , after all , been signs all season that he is not as completely obsessive as in the past .
There was some confusion in March as to which race he should use to open his campaign , and he took the wrong option - the tough Paris - Nice "" race to the sun "" .
Bruyneel said that Armstrong had spent too much time in the United States , with its attendant distractions .
Armstrong even skipped a training camp recently to make a flying return trip to the US for a charity event .
He is not lacking in distractions , and these go beyond his extensive work for his cancer charity , the Lance Armstrong Foundation , his three children by his former wife Kristin , and his high - profile relationship with the singer Sheryl Crow , who escorted him seamlessly from awards nights , first nights and talk shows over the winter .
Also , he is involved in at least 10 legal cases in the US , Italy , France and England , most of which hinge in some way on doping allegations .
The Texan insists that he is not demob - happy , but simultaneously seems to acknowledge the possibility that he may be .
"" It 's not been a problem yet .
I 'm still having fun .
I 'm still suffering in the way that you are supposed to suf fer .
But the proof will come in the races .
"" We may come to the first hard stages of the Tour , the first hard stages in the Alps , [ and ] I 'm not anywhere near the front
and then you can say , ' Yes , he approached it as a retired athlete and it 's obvious in his performance ' .
I hope that 's not the case .
I 'm still hitting it , working as hard as I can . ""
Armstrong says he rarely stops to remind himself that on his bike these are the final days - the final inspections in the mountains , the last special time - trial bike put together by his personal team - but he recognises that this year 's Tour will mean different things to him .
The absolute record is his - ahead of legends such as Eddy Merckx , Bernard Hinault and Miguel Indurain
- so in 3 weeks the challenge will be purely to find a neat way of wrapping up an incredible career .
"" The big difference in winning a seventh against a sixth or even a fifth is that there was a lot of build - up with five - ' Can he get the record , join the elite club ? '
Seven for me is more of a personal goal .
I always wanted to win one final Tour and retire .
"" That 's not a record or something that will be written in any books , for me
it 's something I can live with for the rest of my life .
[ It would mean ] I retired at the top of my game , in a way that in the minds of other people says I could have gone on to win another one . ""
That would be the ideal situation , that 's the motivation to win again , hopefully to win convincingly , then retire and move on . ""
The last Tour great to start the event knowing it would be his last was Hinault , who raced the 1986 Tour in semi - suicidal style , attacking at unexpected moments for the sheer what - the - hell pleasure of it , without caring whether he won or not .
In the end he finished second behind his team - mate Greg Lemond .
Armstrong says he can not take that approach .
"" I ca n't lie .
When I roll down the start ramp on July 2 my intention will be to win that day and win overall .
I think you can have a good time and be fairly relaxed , I want to enjoy my last Tour and still win . ""
Tellingly , however , when he is asked how often he thinks about life after cycling at present , the answer is like a reflex : "" All the time "" .
· Two riders were declared unfit to race yesterday 's opening stage of the Dauphiné .
The Spaniard Isidro Nozal and the Italian Michele D'Abusco were found to have blood thickness levels over the permitted limit of 50 % , a test that can indicate possible red - cell manipulation , and will undergo further testing .
The prologue was won by Armstrong 's Discovery Channel team - mate George Hincapie in 9min 55sec ."
2005-06-09,"Lance Armstrong is on course for the Tour de France but will leave cycling without settling his five - year - old score with the Mont Ventoux , the legendary mountain upon which Britain 's Tom Simpson died of heat exhaustion in the 1967 Tour .
The Texan finished fourth in yesterday 's stage of the Dauphine Libere on the Giant of Provence but is now in second place overall , 21 seconds behind his compatriot Levi Leipheimer going into this weekend 's mountain stages .
Yesterday 's climb to the rocky , windswept finish near the memorial to Simpson , coupled with his third place in Wednesday 's long time trial stage , indicates that Armstrong is not far from the form which has taken him to six consecutive Tour wins , even if yesterday he was not satisfied .
"" I would not say it was great , I would not even say it was good .
I suffered a lot
and I 'm a little bit disappointed .
Maybe I was still a little bit heavy for a climb like that by a few pounds , "" he said .
Armstrong is well aware that it is hard to hit peak form in the Dauphine and maintain it through the Tour .
Last year 's winner , Iban Mayo , looked unstoppable in June but flopped in July .
"" You often see riders do well in the Dauphiné and a month later they are not so strong .
I have learned not to be impatient .
I 'm trying to gain some condition here , some race rhythm and to focus on the big objective . ""
Since July 2000 Armstrong has regretted his decision to gift a Tour de France stage victory on the Ventoux to the Italian Marco Pantani .
In 2002 he was unable to catch the Frenchman Richard Virenque on the way to the summit .
"" I think I missed my chance [ when Virenque won ] and [ the mountain ] never forgave me .
It held a grudge , "" Armstrong said .
Asked if he would return to the climb after his career is over , he replied : "" Yeah , to drink wine and eat tapenade . ""
In the immediate future he has to contend with tomorrow 's mountain stage , with four passes of between 3,500 and 5,000 ft above sea level ."
2005-06-13,"On July 2 , Lance Armstrong will start his 10th and last Tour de France .
He will roll down the start ramp on the Ile de Noirmoutier for the opening time - trial stage without having won a single race since he crossed the finish line on the Champs - Elysées last year as the justly feted winner of a record sixth successive Tour .
This will be the first time in those 10 Tours that Armstrong has not won in the build - up and that will be enough to give his rivals , led by the German Jan Ullrich and the Kazakh Alexandre Vinokourov some grounds to hope that the Texan 's focus has finally slipped as he builds up to his last Tour and prepares for retirement .
At times this season , Armstrong has seemed almost ambivalent about the Tour , declaring on the one hand that he is as motivated as ever , but on the other that he is thinking "" all the time "" about life after cycling .
If such contradictions offer encouragement to Armstrong 's challengers , however , it is largely because they need all the encouragement they can get .
In his six victorious Tours , Armstrong has only been threatened once , in the epic 2003 Centenary Tour .
Armstrong keeps a permanent eye on the performances of all his Tour rivals and he will have noted that yesterday , as he finished third in the final stage of the Dauphiné Libéré , Ullrich , the only rider he truly fears in the Tour , won the time - trial stage in the Tour of Switzerland in emphatic style to take over the race lead .
It will give Armstrong food for thought in the next few days as he reconnoitres the Alpine stages of the Tour , where he will need to ride the German off his wheel if he is to win the race for the seventh time .
But even if he is not at his very best yet , the Texan 's Discovery Channel team are looking stronger than ever , taking the first three places on yesterday 's stage , won by Armstrong 's most devoted domestique , George Hincapie .
Ullrich was , nonetheless , keen to get over a psychological point or two yesterday . ""
I wondered if I would win because I 'm still not 100 % , "" he said .
"" This is a good result .
This was an important test for me before the Tour de France .
I went flat out today to see where my limits were .
The course was not easy , there was a little hill at the start to break the rhythm , but after that I found the right pedalling speed even against the wind . ""
After finishing fourth overall in the Dauphiné Libéré , 59 seconds behind the surprise Spanish winner Iñigo Landaluze , and taking the prize for most consistent rider on daily stage placings , Armstrong acknowledged that he still has ground to make up .
"" What counts is July 24 [ when the Tour finishes ] and I still have some time left .
I still lack some punch . ""
"" Without being super , Lance is still really at the level where he should be , if you keep in mind that he has not raced a lot , "" said his Discovery Channel team manager Johan Bruyneel .
"" He started the Dauphiné with less to go on than last year when he raced the Tour of Languedoc - Roussillon .
Lance was very consistent here , so there is no need to worry .
Now he needs to do some specific training . ""
As well as Ullrich 's return to winning ways , Armstrong and Bruyneel will be concerned about the effervescent form of Vinokourov , who took third in the 2003 Tour after pushing Armstrong to the limit with his attacks .
In the Dauphiné , the Kazakh - who missed last year 's Tour after crashing - won the stage to Mont Ventoux , a climb where success has always eluded Armstrong .
Another possible rival to show strongly was the Colombian Santiago Botero .
He has not been at his best since finishing fourth in the 2002 Tour , but he won a time - trial stage and the toughest mountain leg in the Dauphiné , and came a close second overall , just 13 seconds behind Landaluze . ""
Vinokourov went very strongly on Mont Ventoux .
He will be a big threat , "" said Bruyneel , who remains convinced that the portents are still good for a seventh Tour win .
"" We 've looked at the other rivals , and the important thing is that Lance is already at the level of everyone else . ""
In 2004 , on the other hand , Armstrong looked below his best at the Dauphiné where he was soundly beaten on the Ventoux by his fellow American Tyler Hamilton .
The rest was history in the making ."
2005-06-27,"A close encounter with the Tarmac was probably the last thing Lance Armstrong would have wanted in the final count - down to his attempt to win the Tour de France for a seventh time , but the Texan revealed yesterday that he had fallen in training last week and was left with a black eye , a broken helmet and road rash .
The "" silly crash "" , as Armstrong described it , happened last Wednesday as he left Nice for a training ride on his time - trial bike .
There are climbs near the French city where he has established times going back to 1998 so that he can compare his form year by year .
These would be the final tests of his fitness before the Tour starts on Saturday . ""
The unfortunate thing is I hit my head which cracked the helmet in two , "" said the Texan .
He added that he had been riding slowly , but if the impact was sufficient to break a helmet the implication is that he may still have fallen heavily . ""
It was n't that serious and nothing was wrong - no breaks , no stitches ...
[just ] road rash and a little beat up , "" the 33-year - old added . ""
Fortunately I have n't felt any ill effects from the crash in terms of ... pedalling .
I feel I 'm just as fluid as I was before .
I feel very good on the bike
and I 'd even venture to say I feel better than I 've ever felt .
"" Even so , one thing should be borne in mind : the intense game of cat and mouse which Tour de France favourites play with one another through the media during the build - up to the race means that any incident that happens to a Tour contender will always be played down to keep the opposition guessing .
The crash will have had some effects as Armstrong builds up to his three - week swansong , after which he will retire from professional cycling .
Though the visible effects of a smash are clear , in terms of cuts and scarring , muscular damage such as whiplash , and loss of sleep and training time , are always hard to quantify and may be felt only in the longer term .
This is not the first time that Armstrong has crashed in training during his build - up for the Tour , although it does not sound as serious as his smash in May 2000 when a front tyre blew out at speed on a mountain descent in the Pyrenees .
On that occasion he also fell on his head , suffering two black eyes and cuts to his face .
Like this training crash , the news took a little time to emerge .
Those seeking omens should note that he also won the Tour by a country mile ."
2005-06-30,"Although Lance Armstrong has learned to better any human challengers in the Tour de France , even the man who conquered cancer can not overcome the passage of time .
Any tell - tale streaks of grey in his hair are concealed by his crew - cut but from 12 minutes to seven tomorrow evening , when his final Tour starts in the little port of Fromentine , he will be scrutinised for any signs of aging .
Armstrong acknowledged yesterday that time may be his biggest enemy here .
He will be 34 in September and in the last 60 years only two cyclists have won the Tour at an older age - Gino Bartali and Joop Zoetemelk are now regarded as two - wheeled miracles of longevity .
Miguel Indurain 's last Tour win came at 31 , Bernard Hinault 's at 30 and both men were safely retired by the time they reached the age Armstrong is now . ""
The older you get the more dangerous it is , the higher the risk that you lose , "" said Armstrong yesterday as he looked forward to his final Tour , after which he will retire from professional racing - although he has hinted he may turn out in the occasional amateur event .
"" Time is not on my side
but I feel strong , motivated and ready to go .
I ca n't complain too much about what my birth certificate says .
"" As ever , he surveyed the press here with what one sportswriter has termed "" the look "" : an intent , narrow - eyed gaze , scanning the room for potential enemies who might raise the "" D "" word - "" drugs "" allegations - or the "" F "" word , "" Ferrari "" , as in Michele , his former trainer , now banned on drugs charges not relating to the Texan .
Not one who admits readily to sentiment , Armstrong conceded yesterday that this Tour will not be like any other and that excess emotion may be another problem as he bids for a seventh win . ""
Every day will be special , every stage finish will be special , "" he said .
"" I ca n't let that feeling , that emotion , interfere with what I 'm trying to do .
It 's not a promenade around France . ""
He admitted yesterday , in as many words , that he has had to work harder than usual to acquire the necessary condition to race this Tour but the fact that the absolute record is now his , and whatever happens in the next three weeks can not change that , means he can relax to some extent .
"" I was nervous last year because I had the impression I was up against not exactly a demon but over 100 years some of the greats of cycling had not been able to win a sixth Tour and some people said it was not possible .
That was an incredible burden to carry .
[ This year ] I 'm not chasing a record , a legend , history .
I 'm here to have a good time and enjoy the good form I think I have .
"" It has sunk in , I 'm aware that this is the last time .
I 'll cherish these moments , the intense moments with the team , being at team meetings as the leader for the last time , certain dinners along the way with guys who have become my best friends .
My main motivation is that I love what I do , I cherish every day on the bike
and I 'll miss it .
"" The spectators rather than the riders will cherish the unusually unforgiving start to this Tour , with a longer time - trial than usual , over 20 kilometres rather than the usual six or eight , and place to place over the Pont de Noirmoutier rather than on a sheltered town - centre circuit . ""
One bridge , five roundabouts and a whole lot of wind , "" as Armstrong put it .
As in 2003 , the closest of his six wins , Armstrong expects the main challenge to his supremacy to come from Alexandr Vinokourov and Jan Ullrich , starting the Tour together for the first time in the pink jersey of T - Mobile , along with last year 's runner - up Andreas Kloden .
"" We expect a serious challenge , clearly , "" he said .
"" Vinokourov was climbing well and time - trialling well at the Dauphiné Libéré , and for various reasons is very motivated to do a good Tour .
Jan is in excellent shape and will get better as the Tour goes on , so we expect them to be a major threat .
"" Armstrong will not be drawn on his plans for a post - cycling career , where , presumably , the sky will be the limit .
He has , apparently , looked lovingly - in jest - at the Texan governor 's residence and yesterday he almost denied having designs to follow his fellow Texan George W Bush to the presidency .
"" You never know , "" he said , before adding : "" Actually I should n't say that .
I have no dreams of the White House . ""
Potential candidates for 2008 and 2012 can rest easy .
Ullrich , however , may not be quite so relaxed ."
2005-07-02,"Six years ago , when the Tour paid a flying visit to the Ile de Noirmoutier off the Vendée coast , Lance Armstrong took a serious option on overall victory by surviving a crash on the Passage du Gois , the slippery tidal causeway that connects the island to the mainland .
That year the eventual runner - up in Paris , Alex Zülle of Switzerland , fell off on a patch of seaweed ; Armstrong stayed upright and gained the minutes that eventually won him his first Tour .
The Gois will play no part in today 's time - trial , which crosses the half - mile Pont de Noirmoutier to finish on the island for the first time , but Armstrong is hoping to repeat history and gain time on his rivals over the 20 km , which he says will feel "" more like 30 "" if the wind continues to blow across the salt marshes as strongly as it has all week .
"" It is a serious stage and I will have to take time there [ on the others ] if possible , "" said the Texan , who looked over the course with the rest of his team on Thursday amid heavy showers and a strong breeze off the Atlantic .
"" If the weather is the same it will be a headwind all the way .
It 's long enough to create some time difference . ""
Like Miguel Indurain and Bernard Hinault before him , Armstrong has ridden so strongly in the Tour for so many years that the opposition appear ever more limited as each year their weaknesses are relentlessly exposed .
Only two men appear to have the credentials to win : his old opponent Jan Ullrich and the Italian Ivan Basso , who broke through last year to finish third .
Ullrich , who yesterday crashed into his team manager Mario Kummer 's car when it braked unexpectedly - smashing the rear windscreen and suffering cuts near his throat - is the only other man racing to have won the Tour but is a familiar sight in second place .
A sixth runner - up slot would place him level with the "" eternal second "" , Joop Zoetemelk of the Netherlands , but in finishing fourth last year he looked a shadow of his old self .
Basso is younger but the signs are contradictory .
His strong stage wins in a time - trial and a mountain stage of the Tour of Italy this year promise much
but they came after a stomach upset cost him all hope of overall victory . ""
He has improved dramatically and I do n't think he 'll be happy with the way the Giro went , "" said Armstrong .
It remains to be seen whether the Italian has the strength of character to shape the race .
The rest rank as outsiders .
The Spanish climbers , the birdlike Roberto Heras and the lanky Iban Mayo , have done nothing this year to indicate they will challenge , but that may be in their favour because they will hope to avoid drawing attention to themselves until the Alps in 10 days ' time .
The Colombian Santiago Botero is too erratic to be relied upon .
The only contender with a mindset to match
Armstrong 's is Alexandre Vinokourov , Ullrich 's co - leader at T - Mobile .
In 2003 , when the Kazakh finished third , he rode an under - par Armstrong ragged .
There are questions about his ability to last but , if he makes it into the final week , Armstrong 's seventh victory may not be a foregone conclusion ."
2005-07-02,"As a legendary hardman of professional cycling , Sean Yates was never one to mince his words , and when he was asked if he enjoyed his new role as directeur sportif in Lance Armstrong 's Discovery Channel squad
the reply was typical of the man : "" It 's better than bloody well slaving from nine to five in an office , and financially it 's better than cutting hedges .
"" Romance was never really Yates 's bag and that was probably why British cycling fans took him to their hearts .
Born in Sussex , educated at a Steiner school and a devotee of extreme pursuits - he lists ice climbing and bodybuilding among his interests - he has always been a man who simply gets on with whatever he is doing in his own understated way .
Clearly , that is how he will approach his Tour driving the second Discovery Channel team car behind the No1 vehicle with Armstrong 's mentor Johan Bruyneel .
"" I 'm just here to help out , run errands .
It 's a job and it 's a lot nicer than a lot of jobs out there .
With a team like this , with good riders out to win the Tour , it 's as good as it can be .
If everything goes to plan it wo n't be a problem
but if it gets a bit hairy the stress levels will rise a bit .
It 's largely a matter of trying to cut out most eventualities and I think everything is under control . ""
The role of directeur sportif is hard to define but it boils down to day - to - day team management : helping to plan tactics before the race , ensuring that the right bodies are in the right places between hotels and stage starts and finishes , and ensuring during the stage that the men on bikes have spare wheels , adequate food and drink and the right clothing when they want it .
This is the third team at which Yates has done the job , starting at the Linda McCartney Foods squad in 1999 .
With Discovery there is a little more to it than in his previous teams .
He and Armstrong have a shared history going back a dozen years , more than any of the Texan 's immediate entourage on the Tour .
Now , the 33-year - old Armstrong is feared and respected in equal measure by those around him ; in 1992 when the pair met after Armstrong signed his first pre - professional contract with the Motorola team , Yates was the one who inspired awe , with his grizzled , scarred countenance , varicose - veined legs and mastery of terse comment .
In one legendary episode at training camp , when Armstrong was still an amateur and riding with Motorola for the experience , the Texan was "" goofing around "" and Yates growled : "" You wo n't be laughing when you are a pro , boy .
"" It was enough to keep the young , boisterous Armstrong quiet for several days .
There are gentler images as well : the pair shared a room when on the road and sometimes , when Armstrong was hyper and could not sleep , Yates would ramble reminiscently and at length about racing in his younger days to calm him down .
When Armstrong took over leadership at Motorola after winning the world road race championship in 1993 , each autumn he would talk the ageing Yates into doing one more year at his side , prolonging the Englishman 's career to 1996 .
For Yates , Armstrong has not fundamentally changed since those days , notwithstanding cancer , six Tour wins , million - dollar salaries and Sheryl Crowe . ""
He 's always had the same character ; it 's the Texan way .
He 's ambitious , hard - headed , determined , aggressive , and along with his physical capabilities it 's put him where he is .
He 's as hard as nails , he 's a determined guy with no bullshit
and that 's why he wins .
"" Some things have changed but they are the things around him , the media , the trappings , the pressure , the obligations he 's under .
No one would have predicted he would win six Tours back then , but it was unheard of and I did n't look that far ahead .
[ Miguel ]
Indurain was dominant and that was as far as I looked . ""
Yates , now 45 , has nothing more to prove on two wheels , having finished the Tour 10 times in 12 starts between 1984 and 1995 , won a stage and worn the yellow jersey for a single , memorable day in 1994 .
Even so he is still racing between spells in the Discovery team 's second car , as well as playing in goal for his local football team in Sussex over the winter .
"" My aim this year was to do a good ride in the national 50-mile time - trial championship .
I was third , so I 'm happy . ""
In quiet moments on this Tour he will , naturally , ride his bike .
He does not believe Armstrong can be beaten this year and his thinking is based on mathematics rather than mere loyalty . ""
With the last few years in mind , the strength of the team and his current form , I ca n't see it unless something dramatic happens like a drop in form , a crash or illness .
He 's in as good form as ever , as motivated as ever and the opposition is weaker . ""
Last year he dominated the opposition and he has n't really raced since then , so he 's not burnt out .
He 's still young in my book even though only two guys have won the Tour at an older age .
Let 's say in the worst - case scenario he 's 5 % less strong [ through ageing ] ; well , in 2004 he could have won the Tour with 10 % less and this year he 's as good if not better . """
2005-07-03,"The locals here have an annual running race across the causeway that separates this windswept island from the French mainland , in which men sprint with the incoming tide chasing them .
When Lance Armstrong began his final Tour de France with an emphatic beating of the other overall contenders in the opening 19 km time trial , men of the stamp of Jan Ullrich and Ivan Basso must have felt they were up against as implacable a force as the sea rushing across the salt flats .
While Armstrong did not take the first yellow jersey of this Tour , finishing two seconds behind David Zabriskie , a 26-year - old Batman fan from Salt Lake City riding for the Danish CSC team , he was delighted with the evening .
With three kilometres to go , the Texan sped past his big rival Ullrich , who had started a minute before him , and had looked sluggish from the start , probably due to his training crash on Friday .
He remained close to Armstrong until the finish , but is already 1min 6sec behind overall . '
I thought I would start gently , then I got into my rhythm , ' said Armstrong . '
I saw Jan in front of me just before the first time check and said to myself , "" I ca n't be so bad today "" . '
I had a bit of an unfair advantage because [ in Ullrich ] I had one of the classiest riders of our generation in front of me .
He had a pretty serious crash yesterday and you never know how that affects someone .
I wanted to prove to the world that I 'm racing to win the Tour .
As for taking the yellow jersey , we 'll see in a couple of days . '
The only two of Armstrong 's rivals to limit their losses were the Kazakh Alexandr Vinokourov , who was 51sec slower than the Texan , and Armstrong 's fellow American Floyd Landis , who was 1min slower .
Basso , the Italian who finished third last year , is already 1min 24sec behind , while last year 's runner - up Andréas Klöden lost a massive 1min 59sec . '
What Lance has done today is incredible , ' said his manager , Johan Bruyneel . '
He has taken a lot of time out of all the favourites . '
Zabriskie 's yellow jersey also had a little of Armstrong in it , as , like the bulk of the US cyclists in this Tour , he used to race as Armstrong 's team - mate before striking out on his own to win a time - trial stage in this year 's Tour of Italy . '
I did n't think I would beat Lance today , but it feels really good , ' said Zabriskie .
Yesterday 's stage from the little sea port of Fromentine to this strip of land covered in lagoons for the production of sea salt was longer than the usual brief prologue .
The breeze blowing off the Atlantic was gentle and the only hill on the course was the half - mile bridge taking the riders across to the island , but it was enough to create substantial gaps that will set the tone at least until Tuesday 's team time trial on the banks of the Loire ."
2005-07-03,"With Lance Armstrong 's retirement just three weeks away , one subtext to this Tour will be the question of his successor . '
Big Tex ' will be an impossible act to follow , but in one area his succession appears relatively secure : the Armstrong era has seen the emergence of so many talented American cyclists that the US interest in the Tour looks set to continue well beyond the six - times winner 's departure for a well - earned holiday with Sheryl Crowe and his three children on 25 July .
Even without Armstrong , in terms of quality if not quantity , America is now stronger in the Tour than the host nation .
France has one man with a chance of placing in the top 20 , the aging Christophe Moreau , but as well as Armstrong at the head of the Discovery Channel team , two other squads in the race are led by Americans : the German Gerolsteiner team with Levi Leipheimer , and the Swiss Phonak with Floyd Landis , both of whom are looking for places in the top half - dozen .
On recent form , Bobby Julich of the Danish squad CSC has a chance of riding into the top 20 .
Wiry and ginger - haired with an apple - cheeked face and pointy chin , Landis is the man most followers of the sport tip to succeed Armstrong as America 's next Tour winner .
He is also the only American to nail the Stars and Stripes to the mast and say he believes he can follow the great man . '
With the physical abilities I have , if I have good luck , I can win the Tour .
I have to believe that I can
, I will not say that I will , ' he told Cycle Sport magazine recently .
Landis is just the latest of a plethora of Americans to have left Armstrong 's side and struck out on their own .
The rigid structure in the Texan 's team means that there are few opportunities for individuals to further their careers and earn more money .
As Landis said last year when asked about leaving the Texan 's US Postal squad : ' They try to tell me it 's a privilege to ride for 40 per cent less than what other teams offer . '
For all his 29 years , Landis is a relative newcomer to cycling .
His upbringing in a strict Mennonite community in Pennsylvania , where the message was that if he raced a bike he would face eternal fire , meant that when he moved to California in 1996 he had barely even seen the Tour on television , even though he had been racing a bike since the age of 16 , training in secret in the dead of night to evade a parental ban on his ' sinful ' pastime .
His first love was mountain - bike racing , the most unconventional arm of the sport , one that has its own subculture of wildmen , and it has made him a hard character who questions cycling 's received wisdoms .
In 2003 , he broke a hip in a crash , and kept training for the Tour in spite of being in agony from badly fitted pins in the fracture .
He is said to have asked for all of the $ 20,000 stage winning bonus after US Postal took the team time trial in the 2003 Tour .
Since leaving Armstrong 's side , it has not been plain sailing .
Landis quit Armstrong to join another ex - Postman , Tyler Hamilton , at the massively budgeted Swiss team , Phonak , sponsored by a hearing aid maker .
Hamilton is now banned for blood doping .
Phonak were initially barred from the new elite racing calendar , the ProTour , and started the season slowly .
Even so , Landis has no regrets about becoming his own man . '
The three years I spent with Armstrong in the team left me with a lot , ' said Landis last week . '
I saw how to prepare and train and the tactics of a team , the way of controlling the race .
They are all things to be used . '
As for making the transition from trusted domestique to leader in his own right , that is not quite so simple . '
It does n't seem a lot more stressful because there is as much pressure on Lance 's team , because he is expected to win and the eight guys with him have to be as good as they can be .
If anything I 'm more relaxed this year .
But everything will be different in this Tour , and I need time to adjust . '
In the 2004 Tour , Landis made his mark on the stage through the Alps to Le Grand Bornand , where he looked at least as strong as Armstrong as he made the pace over the final mountain pass and came close to winning . '
I still have the same legs , but I do n't know if they will work as well , ' he said .
' I 've trained as hard as last year , hopefully it 's possible to be as good as last year .
Bad luck can change the outcome though , so , like everyone , I will take it one day at a time . '
This week , his and Phonak 's main target will be to ride strongly in Tuesday 's team time trial , if possible winning and gaining time on his former master .
Landis does not have Armstrong 's ability to master a crowd yet , but he has his own brand of humour .
Asked this week whether this last chance to beat Armstrong in the Tour was an additional source of motivation , he looked at his two co - leaders at Phonak , the Colombian Santiago Botero and the Spaniard Oscar Pereiro and said dryly : ' It 's Lance 's last opportunity to beat Santi , Oscar and me , so perhaps that 's extra motivation for him . '"
2005-07-04,"When American cycling fans wonder who will succeed Lance Armstrong as the nation 's next Tour de France star , they probably have the fate of Belgium in the back of their minds .
It is 27 years since the great Eddy Merckx retired , and his apparent successor in terms of ability and charisma has only just appeared .
Yesterday a strapping lad named Tom Boonen sprinted into this little village at the front of a lead group of 23 to take his third Tour stage win in two years and take an early option on the green jersey of points leader .
Paris is 19 stages and three mountain ranges away , but Boonen is already many observers ' favourite for the award that goes to the best sprinter in the race .
"" This week will be really important for the sprinters , "" he said .
"" After the end of the week there are maybe one or two stages that are good for us , whoever holds the green jersey at the end of the week is in with a strong chance . ""
Boonen won 20 races last year , including the most prestigious finish of the Tour , on the Champs Elysées , in addition to the stage in Angers .
This April , in the space of a week , he added two of the sport 's greatest one - day Classics , the Paris - Roubaix and the Tour of Flanders .
He is 24 , is as at home in English as he is in Flemish , and was the object two years ago of a transfer battle between Armstrong 's US Postal and the Belgian Quickstep squad .
Together with his spiky hair and magnificently cultivated stubble , this is headier stuff than Belgium has known since the days of the "" Cannibal "" .
Yesterday there was power and panache in Boonen 's finish sprint , as he came off the wheel of the Australian Robbie McEwen , twice points winner in the Tour and regarded as the best of all the fastmen who traditionally dominate the first week of the race .
A few seconds and 250 metres later , by the finish line , Boonen was well over a bike length clear .
His victory salute included pointing inwards with both outstretched hands : "" Look at me , "" he was clearly saying .
For a man who was rushed to a dentist on Friday with an abscess under a tooth it was a remarkable performance , and in the absence of the Tour 's other dominant sprinter , Alessandro Petacchi , it may well be seen again in the flat stages that last until Saturday .
That Boonen relieved Lance Armstrong of the green jersey was barely a distraction for the Texan .
The green is awarded to the runner - up in the opening stage and was given to Armstrong after he finished second on Saturday to his fellow American David Zabriskie , who retained the yellow jersey yesterday , when Jan Ullrich 's dire start to the race continued , through no fault of his own this time .
Behind Boonen , the field split after a crash in the final kilometre ; Ullrich was the only race favourite in the first half , with Armstrong five seconds slower .
Initially the German was credited with the five seconds , but later the referees reversed the decision , on the grounds that the crash amounted to an outside incident in the final three kilometres , in which case the whole field is given the same time as the winner .
Given that Ullrich had lost 1min 8sec to Armstrong in his disastrous first stage time trial on Saturday , yesterday 's five seconds would not have changed much but it at least would have been welcome progress after a weekend in which Armstrong 's dream seventh victory looks a good deal closer , while Ullrich has merely had a nightmare .
If the collective dreams of an entire region counted for anything , the stage victory would have gone to the local team , sponsored by the phone company Bouygues Telecom , managed by the local hero of the 1980s , Jean - René Bernaudeau , and formed largely of home - grown riders from the Vendée .
Just what was meant by four fans dressed up as giant cardboard mobile phones - yellow , green and red polka dot - may not have been obvious , but the message rang through :
France needs a stage win or more from Bouygues ' charismatic leader Thomas Voeckler , the national hero last year after he wore the yellow jersey for 10 stages .
Yesterday was his Saint 's day , so "" Bonne fête Thomas , "" proclaimed the roadside banners and , rather optimistically , "" Thomas in the yellow jersey this evening "" .
Voeckler duly engaged in a quixotic escape throughout the stage , together with another Frenchman , Sylvain Calzati , the only Hungarian in the race , Laszlo Bodrogi - who finished fifth on Saturday - and the Spaniard David Canada .
The current dearth of French heroes was underlined by more than one banner lamenting the retirement last year of the drug - disgraced Richard Virenque , who made the polka - dot best climber 's jersey his own seven times .
The polka dots have become to mean much to the French roadside support in recent years , being about the only award within reach of the home men other than the daily prize for "" most combative "" rider .
Yesterday 's only ascent carrying points for the competition was a mere molehill but Voeckler sped up it to earn the coveted jersey .
Today , meanwhile , Tours awaits the Tour , with the finish at the end of the almost two - mile long Avenue de Grammont , finish of the Paris - Tours one - day Classic .
That race is known as the sprinters ' Classic ; today 's stage is almost flat and so Belgium will expect Boonen to deliver another blast from the past ."
2005-07-04,"In three weeks ' time the Tour de France will not merely bid farewell to Lance Armstrong , but to an entertaining spectacle which has accompanied the American since 2001 , played out each morning on whatever vast parking area is hosting the Tour 's daily stage start .
Yesterday the dance of the bodyguards , the bodies and the bus took place in the industrial hinterland of the town of Challans , between a petrol station and a vast exhibition hall .
The Discovery Channel team 's vast blue and grey vehicle , air conditioners humming like a spaceship and windows tinted tantalisingly , is parked up and cordoned off with red ribbon , against which a sweating mass of cameramen , journalists and fans pushes fruitlessly like high tide against a sea wall .
The back door of the bus is guarded by a burly Belgian ex - policeman , Serge , nicknamed the "" muscles from Brussels "" ; at the front stands the bespectacled , slight figure of Erwin , who looks as mild as a kitten in his perfectly pressed shirt .
In fact he is a martial arts specialist who has worked protecting George W Bush .
The ribboned area has the forbidden feel of a VIP area at a premiere , and that is heightened when Sheryl Crow - vast black mirror sunglasses , black slinky top , tight jeans - slips under the tape .
Those inside wear what seems to be almost a uniform for the Armstrong inner circle : crew cuts , shades , Nikes , and the yellow "" Livestrong "" wristbands , probably not bootlegs purchased on eBay .
The pecking order - and the way Armstrong 's accession to celebrity has turned traditional cycling values on their head - is shown when Crow goes straight into the bus , while her escort , the five - times Tour winner Bernard Hinault ( aviators , bald patch , a boxer 's walk ) waits 10 minutes before entering the sanctum .
A rockstar , and a woman at that , taking precedence over a two - wheeled legend at the Tour is something that would have seemed barely credible even 10 years ago .
It is 10 minutes before the start time when the inner members of the inner circle begin to emerge :
team manager Johan Bruyneel , bearing a briefcase , Brylcreemed hair and a big grin ; Armstrong 's team - mates , skinny , impassive to a man under more exotic sunglasses , some chewing energy bars .
They disappear astride their bikes and the "" ah - ing "" begins .
Every time the bus door opens , the crowd emits a collective sigh : perhaps it is Armstrong .
Non , non , non , comes the response ; all of five minutes before the start flag drops he emerges , signs autographs , mouths a few niceties and disappears , with Erwin and the Muscles parting the rows of fans like a speedboat in a choppy sea .
Armstrong has bodyguards , of a slightly different kind , allotted to him during the cycling part of each stage as well .
Yesterday , as is usual , two team members , George Hincapie and Benjamin Noval , were instructed to stay close to him to keep him from crashing .
There were four chutes during the stage , none serious , but Armstrong came through unscathed , avoiding a prone Frenchman , Samuel Dumoulin , in the hectic finale .
Today , the fourth of July , the yellow jersey will be on the back of another American , a clean - cut lad from Utah with a penchant for Batman .
David Zabriskie , who has a habit of putting off - beat interviews with his fellow cyclists on his personal website .
That should not distract , however , from the perfect start that Armstrong has made to his final Tour .
The only favourite within a minute after Saturday 's time trial was Alexandre Vinokourov , with the rest up to three minutes behind .
The daily performance outside the Discovery bus has a clearly defined purpose , and that will be pursued relentlessly in the final three weeks of Armstrong 's career ."
2005-07-05,"Lance Armstrong , the six - time winner of the Tour de France , took the yellow jersey today after a dramatic fourth stage during which leader David Zabriskie crashed three kilometres from the line .
Armstrong , who was two seconds behind CSC 's Zabriskie at the start of the day , now leads by 55 seconds after his Discovery Channel team won the team time trial , over 67.5 km between Tours and Blois , by just two seconds from CSC .
"" We tried to stay tough , its a hard event , "" Armstrong told reporters .
"" The team was unbelievable , everyone rolled through , everyone was great . ""
Meanwhile Zabriskie , who finished with his shorts and jersey ripped and blood pouring from several wounds after losing his balance and his bike before a nasty crash , rode in several minutes after his team - mates to drop down to ninth in the standings .
Jan Ullrich 's T - Mobile team came home third , 35 seconds off the pace .

2005-07-06,"Victory here at record speed in yesterday 's team time trial stage of the Tour de France installed Lance Armstrong in the yellow jersey for the first time this year , marking a major step forward in the Texan cyclist 's quest for the perfect exit from his sport .
The six times winner may relinquish the lead during today 's flat stage across central France to Montargis .
If he does so , however , it will be on his own terms , and to a fellow competitor - perhaps a team - mate - of his own choosing , in the knowledge that he is likely to regain the maillot jaune when the race reaches the Alps next week .
Armstrong said yesterday that his Discovery Channel squad may strike up an alliance with the team - mates of the Belgian sprinter Tom Boonen , who won the first two road race stages of the Tour on Sunday and Monday . ""
He 's that much faster than the others , he 's young and ambitious and I can see him lying in bed saying , ' I want to win six or seven stages . '
We may look to them for help , "" said Armstrong .
The American 's accession to the yellow jersey came after his compatriot David Zabriskie , who had defended the race lead since winning Saturday 's time trial , crashed heavily just under a mile from the line , losing 1min 28sec and slipping to ninth overall .
The crash robbed Zabriskie and his CSC team - mates of a possible stage win , as they were neck and neck with Armstrong 's Discovery men having led at both checkpoints before Discovery fought back strongly in the final kilometres .
They had just come out of a series of bends through the streets of Blois , and were descending at 40 mph towards the Loire when the yellow jersey lost control of his bike .
He slid down the road on his left side , cutting his arms , chest and legs , and possibly breaking ribs .
CSC 's Tour leader Ivan Basso narrowly missed crashing over his prone form , and when Zabriskie remounted he was unable to pedal properly .
He crossed the line alone , with his left leg dangling limply and his yellow jersey torn and stained with black tarmac .
"" I 'm extremely disappointed because we were very , very close to winning the stage and I was close to keeping the yellow jersey , "" Zabriskie said .
A team spokesman said last night that no bones were broken and Zabriskie would resume this morning subject to further tests on his knee ."
2005-07-06,"The story of this stage was told by the waving banners on the course , the swishing cornfields and the ripples on the river Loire .
A stiff breeze pushed the teams most of the way to Blois and the outcome was the fastest ever stage of the Tour , in any discipline , eclipsing Chris Boardman 's record set in the Lille time - trial prologue in 1994 .
"" The faster I pedal the faster I can retire , "" quipped Lance Armstrong this week , and yesterday his blue - and - white - clad Discovery Channel team had clearly taken the message on board , as they do most of their master 's orders .
The nine of them covered the 42 miles up the Loire in 1hr 10min at an average speed of 35.825 mph , whizzing in a perfect single - line formation like a line of migrating ducks between chateaux and vineyards and cliffs of delicate sunbleached yellow limestone .
This elegant little town with its finely turreted chateau had already seen the fastest road - race stage in the Tour 's 102-year history , a record set in 1999 by the Italian Mario Cipollini at 31.471 mph .
Armstrong and his eight teammates also overtook the fastest average for any team time - trial , which dated back to 1995 .
The Texan did not look particularly comfortable , however , and the stage provided the first sighting of what is known as the "" Dead Elvis grin "" - the corpse - like rictus , jaws locked , that marks Armstrong 's face when he is suffering .
Yesterday it was almost matched by his girlfriend Sheryl Crow 's display of tensed dentistry as the CSC team came within two seconds of defeating her beloved .
The favourable wind also reduced the time gaps at the finish , simply because the differences in strength between team - mates in any given squad are less marked when it is such plain sailing .
In any case the rules that limit a team 's losses in this discipline - to prevent the weaker teams being unduly penalised - meant that Jan Ullrich , for example , had his T - Mobile team 's 35-second loss on Armstrong capped at 30sec .
The outcome was that , though Armstrong increased his overall margin on all his rivals for that seventh win , he did not do so in definitive style .
The Italian Ivan Basso - the man he fears the most - limited his losses to two seconds along with the rest of CSC , apart from the unlucky yellow - jersey - wearer David Zabriskie .
Basso is now 1min 26sec behind Armstrong ; Ullrich and his T - Mobile sidekick , the Kazakh Alexandre Vinokourov , also remain handily placed , 1min 36sec and 1min 21sec behind .
Even the little climber Roberto Heras is less than 3min behind after his Liberty Seguros team managed a fine fourth place .
The rulebook was not on Zabriskie 's side , however , as the young American joined the elite group of unfortunates such as Boardman who have lost the yellow jersey because of an ill - timed crash .
Though riders who fall off during road - race stages are credited with the time of their group if the crash happens in the final three kilometres , the rule applies only within the final kilometre in a team time - trial , and Zabriskie came down 1,500 m from the line .
It was unclear precisely what caused him to tumble out of the CSC team 's line , but it looked like a simple bike- handling error .
That at least was Armstrong 's view : "" Team time - trials are so hard , at the end everyone is on the limit and a bit cross - eyed .
There were a lot of turns and a whipping wind , and it 's easy to make a mistake like that . ""
Zabriskie 's CSC team - mates felt differently , with their views perhaps coloured by the fact that his chute cost them the two seconds that lost them stage victory as they regrouped after he had gone down .
"" It was an unnecessary crash , "" said the German Jens Voigt .
"" We are bitter at losing the stage like that .
We did everything right and lost in a stupid way .
"" The windblown banners told another story yesterday : many of them were expressing support for Paris 's bid for the 2012 Olympics .
While the Tour men continue eastward pushed by the same breeze that has blown them all the way from the Vendée coast , most of sporting France 's minds will be in Singapore , focused on one of the few events that puts their great cycle race in the shade ."
2005-07-07,"Controversy seems to follow in Lance Armstrong 's wake as the little lamb went after Mary .
Yesterday it was the turn of the race judges to become involved in a spat with the Texan who claimed he had been threatened with expulsion from the race unless he wore the yellow jersey during the stage , as the Tour 's rulebook stipulates .
Whether the judges and organisers would have dared to follow this through seems unlikely but it is yet another first for Armstrong who was , after all , merely following a chivalric tradition .
In the past in the Tour after the race leader had lost the jersey due to a crash his successor would usually refuse to wear the maillot jaune the following day as a gesture of respect , in recognition that he was the beneficiary of circumstance .
This was what Armstrong felt had happened on Tuesday , when his fellow American David Zabriskie fell during the team time - trial and lost the lead . ""
After watching the race last night I realised David [ Zabriskie ] had been very unlucky , "" he said .
"" It did n't feel right to take the jersey on someone else 's misfortune . ""
The Texan signed on without the jersey - and , equally surprisingly , without his personal bodyguards running alongside him - and left the start wearing the blue and white of his Discovery Channel team .
The stage began against the backdrop of the magnificent Chteau de Chambord , one pinnacle piled on another like a magnificent wedding cake , but not even this could instil a spirit of romance in the men in blazers .
The race was stopped after rolling three miles to the point on the edge of the Chambord park where the flag was to be dropped for racing to begin and Armstrong was made to change into yellow .
"" There was no negotiation , "" said Armstrong .
"" Jean Marie [ Leblanc , the race organiser ] said , ' if you do n't start with the jersey , you wo n't start tomorrow with any jersey ' . ""
Leblanc said yesterday : "" The decision was made by the president of the [ judges ' ] jury , not by me .
You can talk about the spirit of chivalry in the past but the rule did not exist at the time . ""
The winner of yesterday 's stage , Robbie McEwen , is another man less than happy with the way the rules are being applied .
The mischievous - looking Australian is still angry at the decision to relegate him to 186th place in Tours on Monday for headbutting and leaning on his fellow Australian Stuart O'Grady at 40 mph in the finish straight .
Yesterday he kept his head and elbows to himself and responded in the most stylish manner in the final metres , by overtaking Tom Boonen of Belgium , winner of the opening two stages in Les Essarts and Tours , to win the sixth Tour stage of his career .
Boonen began his run for the line too early in the slightly uphill finish and the little Australian , twice a winner of the points prize , came out of his slipstream with just enough time to pip him on the line .
McEwen quoted Eddy Merckx and Sean Kelly - not the most compromising of sprinters - as sharing his view that "" no one should have been disqualified "" .
He added : "" It was pretty harsh .
I want to make it clear that I do n't want to place blame
but I did n't make the first move , it did n't affect the classification of the stage and it did n't affect other riders .
They should have let sleeping dogs lie . ""
The stage finished amid something akin to national mourning after the Olympic vote but French sports fans were spared the news of another victory for the British capital yesterday .
The Tour organisers said a newspaper report that London will be formally confirmed next week as the start location for the 2007 race was "" totally false "" . ""
No , no and no again
, "" said a spokesman for the Tour 's organising company ASO .
"" The decision will be taken in October , as we have always said .
"" The 2006 race route will be announced on October 27 , and the start city for 2007 will be confirmed in the two weeks before that .
Christian Prudhomme , the joint race director , said : "" I can confirm we will announce nothing next week .
During the Tour is not the best time to announce anything about another edition of the race .
There is no hurry . ""
Rotterdam , Florence , Utrecht , Lugano and the Danish town of Herning are the other candidates for the start in 2007 , alongside London , which is proposing to run the prologue time - trial in The Mall outside Buckingham Palace as the Guardian revealed in September 2003 .
It would be the Tour 's third visit to Britain after stages at Plymouth in 1974 and Dover and Portsmouth in 1994 ."
2005-07-08,"The consensus is that there is only one way to beat Lance Armstrong this year , and that is to carry the fight to him .
Waiting for the Texan to show signs of weakness has proved a dismal failure , as he has had only three or four bad days in six Tours .
The only solution , it seems , is to harass the defending champion unmercifully , worry him and his team , and look for any opportunity to claw back a few seconds .
Only one rider has attempted this in Armstrong 's six winning Tours : the little Kazakh Alexandr Vinokourov , who took third in 2003 .
Yesterday , as the race slid and splashed into this sodden city , "" Vino "" again decided to take the initiative .
He sped away on dangerous , oil - soaked corners and stayed upright to take second place behind the surprise Italian winner Lorenzo Bernucci , clawing back 19sec on Armstrong including a time bonus , and moving up to third overall .
It was never going to be enough to threaten the American 's overall lead but it is a psychological blow , a sign that there is life in the competition , and it indicated - after Vino 's fine ride in the opening time - trial stage last Saturday - that he is in form at least as good as in 2003 and may be set to take over leadership of the T - Mobile team from Jan Ullrich .
Yesterday 's stage looked flat but , according to the largest man in the race , Magnus Backstedt , this was a fallacy . ""
French flat , that 's what we call it , "" said the Swede .
The term is used by Tourmen to describe roads which look innocuous on the profiles issued by the race organisers but are in fact rolling , going continually up and down in a way which saps leg strength .
Yesterday , to make matters worse , it was raining in Lorraine and the peloton splodged glumly along in heavy showers through cornfields which hissed in the blustery breeze .
The wind at least was in their favour , and it has now been blowing on the riders ' logo - bedecked backsides since Monday , when the race route made a left turn somewhere in Anjou and began heading east .
A pattern has emerged in the flat stages which comprise the opening week of this Tour , whereby the peloton release a handful of also - rans who make the running and are duly swept up in the final kilometres in time for a bunch sprint .
Yesterday , however , the "" French flat "" road , the rather English weather and the determination of the local rider Christophe Mengin between them ruined the script .
Mengin infiltrated the day 's escape of five and then left them behind on the final climb before the 60 mph descent to the valley of the river Meurthe .
On the sodden roads of the city he clung on to a few seconds ' lead , to the delight of the local crowds and the French television commentators , who scented at worst a heroic home defeat and at best that rarity , a French stage win .
The team - mates of the sprinters Robbie McEwen and Tom Boonen had disappeared into the low cloud on the Meurthe and Moselle hills after the CSC team had decided to put in a show of strength over the final climb , and there was no sign of a concerted chase .
On the final corner , however , with less than a kilometre to the line , Mengin lost control of his front wheel and pirouetted across the road to land stunned against the crowd barriers .
Vinokourov was breathing down his neck and had to brake hard , almost stopping , and let Bernucci through for his first professional stage win .
A few seconds later the front of the chasing bunch , flat out for the final sprint , hit the bend , one man touched his brakes and the first 20 went sprawling to join Mengin at the bottom of the barriers in a cursing , squelching heap .
McEwen and Boonen were among the fallers and got up together to ride gently into the finish , comparing cuts and bruises .
Today 's stage finishes in Germany at the town of Karlsruhe .
Massive crowds are expected and the bulk of them will be decked out in T - Mobile 's pink colours .
After the finish in Sarrebruck in 2002 , this is another nod to the popularity of the Tour in Germany .
In the wake of Jan Ullrich 's 1997 Tour win , this has grown massively - rather as Ullrich himself tends to in the off - season . ·
The Tour will observe a minute 's silence for the victims of the London bombings before today 's start ."
2005-07-08,"Robbie McEwen won today 's seventh stage of the Tour de France after a dramatic sprint finish into Karlsruhe .
McEwen , riding for the Davitamon - Lotto team , took his second stage victory of the 2005 Tour as he pipped Wales - based Swede Magnus Backstedt for the win with Bernhard Eisel of Austria finishing third .
Race leader and six - times Tour winner Lance Armstrong retained the leader 's yellow jersey after the 228 km ride to the German city from Luneville in France .
Australian McEwen was a happy man in a week when the sprinters have had centre stage before the second week , when the peloton will tackle the onerous Alpine mountain stages .
He said : "" It was not just down to being the quickest - maybe I had a bit of luck and there was the fantastic work of my team - mates .
"" My two guys - Leon Van Bon and Freddy Rodriguez - looked after me and I was able to come through on the right hand side .
I managed to get through the gap .
It 's nice to end the first week on a winning note
and I am really happy .
"" It has been an eventful week for McEwen who , in addition to his two stage wins , was disqualified from Monday 's third stage for using his head to impede compatriot Stuart O'Grady .
Armstrong , meanwhile , remains comfortably ahead of nearest challengers George Hincapie and Alexander Vinokourov ahead of the mountain stages where the American often kills off any challenges to his supremacy .
For much of the race it looked as though the German crowd might be able to celebrate a local winner .
German rider Fabian Wegmann made a clear bid for individual glory on the day when the race crossed the border to visit his homeland .
Wegmann had at one point a seven minutes , 30 seconds lead on the peloton after making his breakaway early in the day .
Initially , McEwen tried to stick with the German rider but he soon relented and the 25-year - old from Munster was out there on his own .
The peloton worked hard to reel in the German and they gradually started to close the gap .
With 68 km still to race the lead had come down to 3mins 50secs for the Gerolsteiner rider .
Soon it was below 3:46 - had he maintained that lead the German cyclist would have taken the leader 's yellow jersey from the shoulders of Armstrong , who is hunting his seventh consecutive win in the race .
However , Wegmann had already done enough to ensure he would wear the red polka - dot jersey for the best climber when the eighth stage gets underway on Saturday although the top category climbs in the Alps and the Pyrenees still lie ahead of the peloton this year .
He still had a lead of two - and - a - half minutes as the race crossed the border and moved on to German soil .
David Zabriskie 's eventful tour continued when he was one of four riders involved in a pile - up but all four remounted without any apparent problems .
American Zabriskie had been the first rider to wear the yellow jersey this year but lost it in the team time - trial when he fell and sustained several injuries .
Wegmann was running out of steam and the peloton caught him with 23 km still to race .
McEwen 's team - mates ensured their man was put in the perfect position and the Australian took full advantage to snatch the win with a minor crash behind him not affecting the leading positions .
However , with the mountains beginning to loom on the horizon , it is Armstrong and his rivals for overall glory that will take centre stage next week .
Tomorrow 's eighth stage is a 231.5 km ride from Pforzheim to Gerardmer ."
2005-07-10,"The first week of this Tour de France has been run off at unprecedented speed , with the field averaging almost 30 mph over the 800 miles from the Atlantic coast to the German border .
There was considerable speculation about the effect this would have on the race when it reaches the mountains and the six - times winner Lance Armstrong and his Discovery Channel team seem to have adapted poorly .
Yesterday last year 's winner admitted he had had a ' crisis ' on the first major ascent of the Tour .
The 10-mile Col de la Schlucht in the pinewooded Vosges was the first juge de paix , or judge of the riders ' form , in this year 's Tour and the verdict was intriguing .
This was a relatively small climb , but Armstrong was put under pressure by the Kazakh Alexandr Vinokourov and lost a total of 39 seconds to last year 's runner - up , Andreas Kloden , who was encouraged by a massive crowd of fans who had driven over the border from his native Germany .
Most significantly of all , not one of the Texan 's team - mates in the Discovery Channel squad was able to stay with the leading group of 33 men that formed over the Schlucht .
This was a nightmare day for the ' dream team ' , as Armstrong has called them , who had looked so strong last Tuesday in winning the team time trial from Tours to Blois at a record speed of almost 35 mph . '
A shitty day , ' was Armstrong 's summary . '
We had a bit of a crisis in the team .
We have to re - evaluate the position and try not to let it happen again .
I ca n't remember the last time when there were 35 riders in front and none from our team . '
I asked them what happened
and they had no explanation .
I was n't great and was definitely isolated and was definitely suffering . '
He had no illusions about what this could mean for the rest of the Tour : ' If it 's two more weeks of days like that we 're in trouble , that 's clear . '
The Texan 's team has been a major asset to him in all six of his Tour wins , and for them to go missing at a moment like this will offer massive encouragement to Armstrong 's rivals , particularly as the Schlucht is hardly on the scale of the Alpine passes that will be encountered on Tuesday and Wednesday , and this was hardly a major sort - out .
The stage fell to the 24-year - old Dutchman Pieter Weening , riding his first Tour de France , who was one of seven low - ranked cyclists who escaped early in the stage .
Weening left his comrades behind soon after they had begun to climb the Schlucht , Kloden swept him up on the summit and the pair sped down the 50 mph descent to the finish together .
The pair produced one of the narrowest stage finishes the Tour has witnessed at the end of a tense sprint , where the verdict was pronounced to be victory for Weening by half of a tyre 's width .
It was virtually a dead heat , with perhaps a fifth of an inch between them at the end of a stage of almost 150 miles .
Kloden was the day 's major beneficiary , making up to some extent for his poor opening time trial , but Vinokourov , his team - mate in the T - Mobile team , is looking increasingly like the major threat to Armstrong . '
Vino ' , who finished third in the 2003 Tour , attacked the six - times winner no fewer than five times as the main group raced up out of the town of Munster and up the long drag of the Schlucht .
Armstrong 's team - mates were soon conspicuous by their absence and the Texan had to respond to Vinokourov on his own and was unwilling to chase when Kloden made his effort one - and - a - half miles from the summit , because he knew that if he retrieved the German , the taciturn Vino would merely attack again : ' I just limited the damage . '
The going was tough in the finale , but the scenery could hardly have been more impressive , with a sea of neatly ranked vineyards and sweetcorn fields in which black and white storks were hunting .
The backdrop on the climb had a hint of the Alps , with high - eaved , wooden - shuttered houses , mountain hayfield and dark pinewoods .
Yesterday brought the first real wave of casualties among the 189 riders who set out from Fromentine eight days ago , with five men quitting .
Three days ago , on the rolling stage to Nancy , the first signs of fatigue among the field appeared , according to Armstrong . '
I think in general the riders are tired , ' he said . '
When you add in the tailwinds , the crosswinds , the rain , the weather and the high tempo the teams are riding on the front , that adds up to some tired guys , ' said Armstrong , who could hardly have expected his own team to be among their number ."
2005-07-11,"After the crisis , the show of strength .
Yesterday , as the Tour tackled five stiff climbs in the Vosges , Lance Armstrong and his Discovery Channel team could not afford a repetition of Saturday 's unprecedentedly weak display on the first mountain pass of the race , and the squad formerly known as US Postal Service duly delivered .
Armstrong flew south to the Alps last night without the yellow jersey but that was a mere tactical withdrawal .
Discovery began yesterday 's stage with A Cunning Plan : to show their control of the race by relinquishing the lead to a fellow competitor of their choice - "" rival "" would be too strong a term - and the ecstatic beneficiary was the genial German Jens Voigt .
The 33-year - old is an indefatigable attacker who won the Tour stage to Sarran in 2001 and who spends most of his Tours in one escape or another .
He had been kept on a tight leash by his team manager at CSC , Bjarne Riis , from the start of the Tour , but was finally given his head yesterday .
For Armstrong , he was the perfect foil : strong enough to make the running , but not a climber who will be any trouble in the Alps .
His tenure of the lead is unlikely to be longer than that of 2001 , when he wore the jersey for a single day .
Voigt spent much of the stage leading the chase behind the day 's lone attacker , the Dane Mickael Rasmussen , who led over each climb to open up a healthy points gap in the King of the Mountains contest and stayed ahead to the finish here to give the Dutch Rabobank team their second stage win in two days .
On Saturday in Gérardmer Pieter Weening had out sprinted Andreas Klöden by the minuscule margin of 9 mm .
Yesterday Rasmussen had a rather more emphatic three minutes in hand on Voigt and the Frenchman Francis Moreau , whose home town of Belfort is just down the road .
Moreau 's involvement in the Festina drug scandal of 1998 is a distant memory , as indeed is his fourth place overall of 2000 .
Like Rasmussen , he has an interest in the polka - dot climbers ' jersey , which has become a fixation for French riders and media since the heroic exploits of Moreau 's fellow Festina survivor Richard Virenque .
He and Rasmussen are likely to scrap for the measled tunic in the next few days .
But this was all a distraction from the main message of the day , which was that like all dictators , Armstrong can not afford to allow his subjects rebellious thoughts .
On Saturday 's second - category climb , the Col de la Schlucht , Alexandr Vinokourov and Klöden had been looking rather uppity and the entire caravan spent the evening engaging in its favourite pastime : speculation .
None of Armstrong 's eight Discovery Channel team- mates had been able to stay with their leader in the 33-man lead group that formed over the Schlucht as "" Vino "" accelerated time after time .
It was rather like a four - man relay team turning up with only their anchorman .
No one could explain their weakness , and as Armstrong 's close friend and team - mate George Hincapie put it , "" the sharks began circling "" .
To make the point that Saturday was merely a blip , Discovery spent almost the whole of yesterday 's 107 miles leading the peloton in a compact blue and white bloc , with Armstrong in their wake and "" Vino "" and Jan Ullrich shadowing the Texan .
It was gunboat diplomacy on two wheels .
"" The criticism made us angry , "" said Hincapie afterwards .
"" We won the team time - trial and no one said ' good job ' but if we have a bad day everyone writes about us .
It 's motivating to hear that we are a bad team . ""
Armstrong merely has to wipe his nose for gossip to begin that he has a cold , and over the weekend his every move was intensely analysed after his admission that on Saturday he was not at his best .
Armstrong had been seen sweating more than usual .
He had apparently ridden with his jersey open for the first time .
There had been sightings of the rictus nicknamed the "" Dead Elvis Grin "" which fixes his face when he is suffering .
This confession of weakness could , of course , merely have been a double bluff to raise the opposition 's hopes .
Yesterday Armstrong looked in rude health and so did his team .
The same can not be said of all the rest of the field .
The welter of crashes , and the cold rain of last week , are taking their toll and each day the medical communiqué issued by the Tour doctors seems longer .
Yesterday Jan Ulrich was on the list after falling into a ditch early on in the stage .
He bruised his back and further examination will be made today .
Ten riders quit over the weekend , including Igor Gonzalez de Galdeano , who finished fifth in 2002 , and the first yellow jersey of this Tour , David Zabriskie .
The young American never got over his heavy crash in the team time- trial last Tuesday .
With the average speed for the first 900-odd miles of the Tour unprecedentedly nudging 29 mph , today 's respite in Grenoble will be more than usually welcome ."
2005-07-12,"Coming up to the finish yesterday a fan dressed in a Superman outfit pretended to fly alongside Lance Armstrong , fist pointing up the mountainside , as the Texan left the bulk of the field grovelling in his wake . ""
Superhuman "" is a facile tag : Armstrong exhibits frailties that are all too human .
Unfortunately for the half - dozen souls who felt they had a chance of winning this Tour , he shows none of those weaknesses on the bike .
What has set him apart from the mere mortals during the last six - and - a - bit Tours de France is his ability to rise to the same challenge again and again .
Yesterday , at the first summit finish of the Tour , the knockout blow came in the usual way .
On arrival at the foot of the 14-mile climb to this ski resort
Armstrong 's Discovery Channel team put the pressure on and the race turned into a matter of mere survival .
Jens Voigt ceded the yellow jersey early on and plummeted from first to 72nd place overall , but that was to be expected .
Ten miles from the finish the triple winner of the Tour of Spain , Roberto Heras , disappeared ; the Colombian Santiago Botero went with nine miles remaining .
At eight miles to go came the coup de grace : Armstrong gestured to his Ukrainian team - mate Yaroslav Popovych and saw off Alexandr Vinokourov , Jan Ullrich and Andreas Klöden all at once .
T - Mobile 's trio de choc looked suitably shocked .
To underline his physical superiority , like a boxer whistling at the count , Armstrong immediately began to perform stretching exercises on the bike ; the others were the ones being pulled to their limits , however , and five miles from the line
last year 's third - place finisher Ivan Basso gave up the struggle .
Only three remained on equal terms , none of them on the Texan 's list of danger men : the current King of the Mountains , Mickael Rasmussen , and the Spaniards Alejandro Valverde and Francesco Mancebo from the Balearic Islands team , the direct descendent of Miguel Induráin 's Banesto .
The finish sprint at Couchevel 's chilly altiport went to Valverde , but it barely signified .
As always , Armstrong had a point to prove afterwards : that he resents allegations that he is lucky .
"" It 's not respectful , it 's not honest , it 's not true and it 's not reality , "" he said .
"" We 're not a team , a director and riders that won six Tours de France because we were lucky .
I ca n't lie , I saved that on the hard drive . ""
Since July 13 1999 - a rainy , cold day at the Italian ski resort of Sestriere - Armstrong has now demolished all recognised opposition at the first mountain - top finish of the Tour and taken a serious option on overall victory six times - subject to the usual provisos about crashes , illnesses and acts of God .
The places and dates are worth naming : July 10 2000 , Hautacam in the Pyrenees ; July 17 2001 , l'Alpe d'Huez ; July 18 2002 and July 16 2004 , the Pyrenean resort of La Mongie .
It has been sporting serial murder ; each time he has killed the race as a serious contest , and it is utterly compelling .
The act is as predictable as night following day and the very lack of surprise is what makes Armstrong 's ability to do it so impressive .
The opposition all know what is coming , but they can not shape the race themselves to prevent it happening .
"" We are in a good position , "" said Armstrong with magnificent understatement .
Only one man remains capable of challenging him , and that is Rasmussen , the hollow - cheeked Dane who won Sunday 's stage across the Vosges . ""
Chicken legs "" , as the thin - pinned former mountain bike world champion is known , is only 38 seconds behind the Texan , in second place .
This is , however , uncharted territory for him , and Armstrong and his henchmen will give him no latitude from now on .
On paper , Rasmussen could attack Armstrong today over the "" roof of the Tour "" , the 8,000 ft Col du Galibier .
Thunderstorms are expected , and race followers were warned of lightning strikes on the mountain 's bare slopes .
That may be as threatening as it gets : most probably Rasmussen will be content with the polka - dot King of the Mountains jersey .
Stretching the imagination a little , the Italian Basso and Christophe Moreau of France remain just within the frame , 2min 40sec and 2min 42sec behind , if Armstrong were to have a crisis .
But Valverde is over three minutes back , and he can not time trial .
Ullrich and Klöden are over four minutes behind , while Vinokourov is 6min 32sec adrift .
Ullrich complained yesterday that "" the devil "" was in his legs , but he and the rest can take one small grain of comfort .
Armstrong retires at the end of this Tour , which means they will never have to be humiliated in this style again ."
2005-07-12,"A stunning ascent up the Courchevel returned Lance Armstrong to yellow as the pressure told on almost all of his leading rivals on stage 10 today .
The American was pipped to the stage victory by Spain 's Alejandro Valverde , one of only three riders to keep with the blistering pace , as Jan Ullrich , Alexandre Vinokourov , Andreas Kloden and Ivan Basso were all dropped on the final climb .
The 181-kilometre stage from Grenoble saw Arnstrong and his Discovery team use the first mountaintop finish of this year 's race to stamp their authority on the tour .
Among the six - time winner 's leading rivals , only Dane Mickael Rasmussen , the winner of stage nine , could stay in touch , moving him up to second , 38 seconds adrift of the Texan .
Jens Voigt , who started the day in yellow , dropped a long way down the standings while Ullrich is now over four minutes off the pace .
Armstrong said : "" It was the first great day for Discovery Channel .
They are a superb team to give the right tempo in the beginning of a climb . ""
Today I had good legs and so did three other riders .
I could not drop them all . ""
As for the stage winner , he added : "" With Valverde , everybody has seen the future of cycling .
He 's fast , he 's strong ,
he 's intelligent .
It 's impressive . ""
Armstrong 's team chief Johan Bruyneel said : "" We knew that today 's stage was very important and the team worked fine .
Lance managed the finish to perfection and it was difficult to win the stage with Valverde in the group .
It was a great operation for Lance . """
2005-07-12,"Even though the Tour de France has become ever more international during the Lance Armstrong era , the British presence in this year 's race is limited , if not quite non - existent .
The Italian Dario David Cioni , who is lying 52nd overall and figured strongly in Sunday 's stage through the Vosges , was born in Reading and went to university in Glasgow .
The big Swede Magnus Backstedt , who finished second in Friday 's stage to Karlsruhe , lives near Cardiff .
The Sussex hardman Sean Yates , now a directeur sportif at Armstrong 's Discovery Channel team , could well be part of the Texan 's seventh overall win , if the race goes to form .
And that is it .
This dearth of British representation has coincided , ironically enough , with the 50th anniversary of the first two cyclists from the UK to finish the great race , when a Yorkshire undertaker 's son named Brian Robinson and a former navy electrician Tony Hoar rode into Paris as the sole survivors of the 10 riders who made up the British team that was invited to the race .
The current low ebb will , however , not stop the celebrations : most of the 50-plus British cyclists to race the Tour will be reunited on August 13 at a dinner organised by Robinson , who finished 29th in his first Tour , having watched his team - mates return to Blighty one by one , as boils on behinds , broken bones and a spate of punctures caused by poor tyres took their toll .
Robinson , now an avuncular 74 , finished 14th the following year , and went on to win Britain 's first two stages in the race , and subsequently helped the young Tom Simpson negotiate his first professional contract . ""
He was the pioneer , the ambassador , the man who made us all aware that British cycling existed , "" said the Tour 's official historian , Jacques Augendre , the only journalist still involved in the race who also covered the 1955 event .
Looking back at Robinson 's first Tour for my history of the British and the Tour , Roule Britannia , was to be reminded that , while the fundamentals remain the same - round France in three weeks , some 2,500 miles through the Alps and Pyrenees , finishing in Paris - pretty much everything else ahas been transformed . ""
Now , the race is all enclosed .
It 's a village that you need a pass to get into , "" said Robinson .
"" In my day we sat down in the market place among the crowds and waited for the start .
There was more contact with the public , you would sign stuff , chat to them as well as you could .
"" These were less formal times in other ways : incredibly , the 1955 team were selected by Fleet Street 's cycling correspondents , because in Britain the sport had two governing bodies and the Tour organisers did not know who to deal with .
This was , perhaps , not so surprising in a more homespun time when riders rode for their countries , not for commercial sponsors , when they were still issued with their kit by the race organisers ( "" two jerseys , a tracksuit , goggles and a rain cape in an aluminium suitcase which had to be returned after the race "" , recalled Robinson 's team - mate Bob Maitland ) , and when the Tour supplied food to the teams - a quarter chicken , 10 prunes and 10 sugar lumps during a stage , a litre and a half of wine to each rider with his dinner . ""
The sport today is totally meticulous , "" said Robinson .
"" The riders have charts of everything they do and are constantly monitored .
We just got on with it and got it done . ""
Now , Armstrong and the other race leaders take only the Tour seriously ; back then , the Yorkshireman and company "" had to race wherever we could , simply to make the money .
I raced my sleeves off all year .
It 's all far more technical and focused , the riders have far more control over their lives .
I 'm not sure I 'd have liked the responsibility that a rider like Armstrong has , focusing solely on the Tour . ""
Robinson is not easily overawed - hardly surprising in a man who was preparing corpses with his father in his early teens - and he does not play up his achievement or his pioneering role .
"" Obviously it comes to mind as people still say it was great , but at the time you do n't think much of it , you just think of getting through . ""
He is more upbeat about the mountains , his great passion , and he will watch every Alpine and Pyrenean stage - "" when I see them going up through the crowds I wish I could still do it "" - while hoping , no doubt , that next year he will have at least one Briton following in his tyremarks .

2005-07-13,"With the Alps now behind him , Lance Armstrong remains in command of the 2005 Tour de France after today 's 11th stage honours went to Alexander Vinokourov of Kazakhstan .
Vinokourov , who finished third overall behind Armstrong and Jan Ullrich of Germany in the 2003 Tour , pipped fellow escapee
Santiago Botero of Colombia to win the stage after a 172 km ride from Courchevel to Briancon .
Armstrong came in one minute and 15 seconds behind in a group of riders and did not contest the sprint that saw France 's Christophe Moreau take third place on the day .
However the Texan is still the proud wearer of the leader 's yellow jersey with a lead of 38 seconds over Michael Rasmussen of Denmark .
The day also saw the Tour further tarnished by another drugs scandal with Italian rider Dario Frigo quizzed by police after banned substances were found in a car driven by his wife .
Vinokourov also picked up 36 bonus seconds but is only 12th overall and some 4min 47sec behind Armstrong who looks to be as strong as ever in his final ever ride in the Tour he has dominated since his near - miraculous recovery from life - threatening cancer in the late 1990s .
The American is still well on course for a seventh consecutive win in the race - no other rider has won more than five - his last of an outstanding career before retirement .
With the Pyrenees still to come though , there is still a long way to go before the Star Spangled Banner is played on the Champs Elysees for the seventh consecutive year .
Vinokourov had been one of many riders who had been blown away by a superb Armstrong in Tuesday 's 10th stage but at least the Kazakh rider could celebrate his third career stage win in Le Tour on Wednesday .
"" I am satisfied , I wanted this stage , "" he said .
"" I lost a lot of time yesterday .
I did not have the legs yesterday
so I knew I must attack and that I would keep going until the end .
"" It was good today - I had a tailwind .
Myself and Santiago we had to go all the way ourselves .
"" Botero had joined long - time pacesetter Vinokourov some 15 km from the end of the stage but the Kazakh remained on his shoulder before sprinting for glory 200 m from the end .
Vinokourov does not believe his bad day on Tuesday has eliminated him from the race for overall honours despite Armstrong 's grip on the yellow jersey looking tighter than ever . ""
The Tour is not over , "" said the Kazakh champion .
"" There are still 11 days to go and with this team my morale is a lot higher . ""
In truth , with a six minutes 38 lead at the start of the day over Vinokourov , Armstrong was never concerned about chasing the Kazakh , and only Botero made a serious attempt to contest the stage .
The American instead , surrounded by his usual praetorian guard of riders from the Discovery Channel , remained in charge of the peloton and although at one point Vinokourov had three minutes on the Texan the gap dwindled on the descent of the Col du Galibier , one of the most famous climbs in the Tour .
Vinokourov 's display and Armstrong 's dominance were nonetheless overshadowed on Wednesday by the controversy surrounding Frigo , who was detained , and could not start the race .
The incident follows the expulsion of Russian rider Yevgeny Petrov , who was thrown out after failing a drugs test .
The peloton has a relatively easy 187 km from Briancon to Digne - les - Bains on Thursday ."
2005-07-14,"Frenchman David Moncoutie stormed to the finish line to claim a Bastille Day victory on the 12th stage of the Tour de France between Briancon and Dignes des Baines .
The Cofidis team rider claimed first place in a time of four hours and 20.06 minutes over the 187 km stage .
Sandy Casar came second to make it a French one - two , leading home a chasing pack of seven in the sprint , while six - time winner and yellow jersey holder Lance Armstrong was able to hold on to his overall lead despite coming home in the peloton ."
2005-07-16,"Lance Armstrong resents the suggestion that he has been lucky in taking his six Tour de France victories , but it can certainly be said that fate has not spared his rivals .
A brace of crashes weakened Jan Ullrich before key moments in this year 's race , and yesterday tendinitis saw off one of the few men who had been capable of living with Armstrong in the Alps , the Spaniard Alejandro Valverde .
When the 25-year - old outsprinted Armstrong to win Tuesday 's key stage to Courchevel he was still suffering from knee pains which had begun when he hit his leg on the handlebars in the team time - trial a week earlier .
Yesterday morning he was lying fifth overall , only 3min 16sec behind the Texan , but with the knee pain intensifying he bade farewell to his team - mates as the race approached the feeding station at Uzès , near the Pont du Gard , and climbed into a team vehicle in tears . ""
Physically I 'm in good shape
but it 's not possible to go on like this , "" he said .
Asked this week what he would do if he were in the position of Ullrich , Ivan Basso and co and wanted to win the Tour , Armstrong laughed and said : "" I 'll tell you on Sunday . ""
His point was that today 's and tomorrow 's Pyrenean stages will probably decide whether he ends his career in eight days with a seventh consecutive overall win .
Today 's stage to the ski station at Ax Trois Domaines includes the steep , narrow Col de Pailhères , ranked "" super category "" ; tomorrow 's 129 miles includes four first - category passes and the 6-mile climb to the finish at Pla d'Adet .
"" It will be the hardest day of the Tour , "" the Texan said yesterday .
It is terrain which will suit the rider lying second , Mickael Rasmussen of Denmark , who has promised to take the race to Armstrong ; and Ullrich and his T - Mobile colleagues Andreas Kloden and Alexandre Vinokourov have nothing to lose after their disastrous showing at Courchevel .
The sprinters will be fighting for survival this weekend , but yesterday 's flat , baking - hot stage across southern France gave them one last chance to mark up points towards the green jersey .
Three riders are in contention for the award , the Australians Stuart O'Grady and Robbie McEwen and the Norwegian Thor Hushovd , and yesterday their teams played a game of cat and mouse behind the day 's five - man escape .
McEwen was the favourite for yesterday 's finish ; he won two stages in the opening week and his disqualification for headbutting in the finish at Tours meant he had points to make up on his two rivals .
With these factors in mind , O'Grady and Hushovd 's directeurs sportifs refused to allow their teams , Cofidis and Crédit Agricole , to participate in the chase .
It fell to McEwen 's Davitamon - Lotto team to reel the escapees in , and the double points winner was duly rewarded when he sprinted out of the final corner past the final two attackers , Sylvain Chavanel of France and the American Chris Horner , to win the stage from O'Grady .
Only 22 points separate the two Australians and Hushovd at the top of the points table but their battle will take a back seat until the race leaves the Pyrenees on Tuesday ."
2005-07-17,"TWO YEARS AGO , Lance Armstrong rode into this ski station an exhausted man contemplating defeat in the 2003 Tour , clinging on to the yellow jersey of race leader by a handful of seconds .
Yesterday , however , Armstrong rode a perfect tactical race to strengthen his grip on the race lead and move a step closer to his seventh win , with only one truly difficult mountain stage remaining .
In baking heat , Armstrong 's only serious rival , the hollow - cheeked Danish climber Mickael Rasmussen , was unable to hold the pace set by the Texan on the six - mile climb to the finish here , and finished 51sec behind .
He held on to second place overall 1min 41sec behind the Texan , but it will now take an act of God or a truly bad day for Armstrong to miss out on victory next Sunday . '
It was a very tactical day , ' he said .
' There were the attacks from T - Mobile on the Col de Pailhères , the heat , the descents , it was a very difficult day .
I felt good , I had good legs , but the only small problem was that I was on my own at the bottom of the mountain with no team - mates .
The T - Mobile guys went really hard .
I did n't think I could hang on more than a couple of kilometres
but I came round . '
The stage victory did , however , escape the Texan , who finished second behind the Austrian Georg Totschnig , who finished seventh in last year 's race .
Totschnig escaped soon after the start in the holiday resort of Agde and hung on for almost 125 miles over the day 's two major climbs , finishing in tears just 56sec ahead of Armstrong , who would probably have overtaken him if the climb had been a kilometre longer .
This is Austria 's first stage win in the Tour , and the first for Totschnig 's team , Gerolsteiner , who come a distant second in profile and budget to Germany 's leading squad , Jan Ullrich 's T - Mobile team .
They are sponsored by a mineral water company , which will cause a wry smile or two as ' riding on mineral water ' is cycling slang for refusing to use drugs .
The race is now on for second place behind Armstrong , or so it seemed when the two riders who were able to live with Armstrong on the final climb , Ivan Basso and Ullrich , appeared to be racing each other rather than the Texan .
Basso raised the pace when Ullrich cracked in the final two kilometres , and now lies third , 2min 46sec behind Armstrong , but with Rasmussen 's second place definitely within his reach .
Ullrich is 4min 34 sec behind the Texan in fourth place and he too will now have his sights set on a podium finish .
After a lengthy run west through sunbaked vineyards - and past a demonstration by local wine producers - the initial sort - out took place on the spectacular Col de Pailhères , a narrow goat track that began amid the tunnels and caves of the Aude gorges , twisted past a medieval castle perched on a rock pinnacle and ended by running along a narrow ridge with only the sweltering blue sky above and the remains of vast snowdrifts just below .
The T - Mobile team had been expected to make a move since the race entered the Alps and finally went on the offensive , with Alexandre Vinokourov - winner of the stage to Briançon on Wednesday - last year 's runner - up Andreas Kloden and Ullrich making fruitless attempts to dislodge Armstrong , along with Basso .
As ever , Armstrong was equal to their best efforts , then brushed them aside in the finale .
Most significantly , on the Pailhères , Armstrong 's team - mates at the Discovery Channel squad were unable to keep up .
With their help , he had taken control of the race on Tuesday at the Alpine ski resort of Courchevel , using their strength to help him blast the field apart , and on Wednesday , over the two toughest Alpine climbs en route to Briançon , his team - mates maintained an iron grip on the race .
Clearly , however , Armstrong was well up to the task on his own yesterday .
Today the riders tackle a second Pyrenean stage that Armstrong has described as ' the hardest stage of the race ' , a 130-mile leg from Lézat - sur - Lèze to the Pla d'Adet ski station . '
It 's actually a stage that we do almost every year and the amount of elevation gain for that day is just the hardest thing , ' said Armstrong .
If the Texan survives today 's stage without mishap , however , he will have every chance of retiring in a blaze of glory when the Tour reaches Paris in seven days ' time .
The Texan was unable to win yesterday 's stage and will be increasingly frustrated that he has yet to cross a finish line in first place this season , so he may well try for the ' full house ' of a stage win that makes his overall lead impregnable ."
2005-07-18,"The dangers of a heatwave are well known in France after the high death toll of summer 2003 , and there was another reminder in the sight of Saturday 's stage winner at Ax-3-Domaines , the Austrian Georg Totschnig , lying prostrate on the road at the finish line after leading the race for 200 kilometres through the sunbaked hills .
Yesterday , after riding for over six hours in temperatures that at times nudged 40C ( 105F ) the riders crossed the line here with sunken eyes , hollow cheeks , sunburnt arms and with tide marks of salt in their clothing where the sweat from the climbs had evaporated on the descents .
Lance Armstrong fell victim to the heat during the Tour of 2003 , suffering horrendously in the 40C temperatures at the time - trial at Cap Découvert .
He says he has learnt the lessons of that episode .
"" Everybody 's performance suffers in the heat , "" he said , adding that if the hot weather continues , he expects a large number of riders to drop out .
Much of France is on drought alert at present , and the Tour 's medical team is also on the qui vive .
According to Pascal Rivat , one of the race doctors , many of the Tour field are currently suffering from digestive troubles , caused by drinking too much cold water too quickly .
"" There is another problem , which is that the riders do n't recover well in the heat , "" says Rivat .
"" They have a difficult stage like today 's
and then they do n't sleep well because of the heat and do n't recover .
"" The result is that the cyclists can get into a spiral of decline in which they get sick and have no opportunity to recover .
In the 1950s and 60s , the received wisdom was that it was bad for Tour cyclists to drink on hot days because consuming too much liquid weakened an athlete , a belief that led in part to the collapse and death of Tom Simpson on one of the hottest days of the 1967 Tour .
Riders would limit themselves to four small bottles , and were forbidden to get bottles from their team cars because it was believed that they would take tows .
Today , the cyclists are actively encouraged to take on liquid ; the Tour organisers kit out special motorbikes with bottle carriers to enable riders to get water whether or not a team car happens to be there .
"" You have to fill up with water , because you lose so much , "" said Birgit Krohme , who is Jan Ullrich 's personal physiotherapist at the T - Mobile team .
"" If a rider does n't drink until he 's thirsty , it 's too late .
You have to be drinking , drinking , drinking . ""
Added to the heat , the long transfers in team buses between starts and finishes involved in this year 's race are increasing the demands that the event makes on the riders , something that Armstrong has condemned as "" unacceptable "" .
Intense heat carries other risks .
Whereas heavy rain makes the roads slippery and increases the risk of accidents , hot sun melts the surface which can cause crashes , such as the heavy fall that put Joseba Beloki out of the 2003 race .
Over the weekend water trucks could be seen spraying the road on the descents in an attempt to cool the surface down .
There is one further risk : bizarre as it seems , racing in the heat carries the risk of colds and bronchitis caused by the abrupt change in body temperature that can happen when a cyclist suddenly stops going uphill in the heat and goes downhill .
Which is why yesterday , once they had wiped the sweat off , the cyclists could be seen pulling on thermal hats to go back down the mountain ."
2005-07-18,"There is a standard range of platitudes that the Tour de France leader usually comes out with after the final major mountain - top finish : the Tour is not over until Paris ; the toughest stages are behind us , but there are tough stages ahead ; the race is not won yet .
These are things that have to be said , to avoid tempting fate as much as to avoid sounding arrogant .
Yesterday , with almost three minutes in hand on the Italian Ivan Basso , Lance Armstrong said the right things but he might as well have spared all present and said the truth : this year 's race is over , barring illness , crashes or act of God .
The magnificent seven , glorious retirement and a celebration with cold beer and Sheryl Crow await in Paris on Sunday .
Yesterday , as on Saturday , Jan Ullrich , Mickael Rasmussen and the rest were unable to match Armstrong .
Only Basso remained on equal terms - or as good as - at the mountain - top finishes here and at Ax-3 Domaines on Saturday , and his poor stage to Courchevel means he is not close enough to worry the American .
"" I tried on the climbs yesterday , I gave it everything , "" said Basso . ""
But Armstrong is too strong .
He never weakens . ""
The weekend 's stages over eight tough climbs in the Pyrenées ran to the same pattern : an early escape of men who were no threat to the top of the standings , and a late battle between Armstrong , Basso and Ullrich , which went the way of the Texan .
Ullrich rode up the 6 mile climb to the finish here at his own pace , without entirely falling to pieces , and is now in a position to challenge Rasmussen for third overall .
Just occasionally in the tightly structured world of professional cycling , openings appear for those who do the legwork of chasing rivals , fetching water bottles and sheltering their leader .
Not every domestique has his day , but yesterday was the turn of George Hincapie , a New Yorker in Armstrong 's Discovery Channel squad who is the only team - mate of the Texan to have ridden in all his six winning Tours so far .
Hincapie is as slow - eyed and bumbling as Armstrong is razor - sharp , and his lanky build has meant he has tended to focus on the spring one - day classics .
Yesterday he was permitted to mark the morning escape on the premise that he would be ahead later in the stage to assist Armstrong .
But he ended up the winner , to a mix of delight and disbelief , of his own and the caravan .
There is no precedent for a one - day classic specialist winning a mountain - top finish of this severity .
The only comparable case might be Sean Kelly 's stage win at Pau in 1982 , but that came in a sprint finish 35 miles after the last mountain . ""
No one has done anything like that in 30 years , "" said his team leader .
Armstrong had said , somewhat viciously , that he did not expect so many Basque fans to turn up this year .
The implication was that they would stay away because their team , Euskaltel , are climbing like lead balloons .
But they packed the final climb , swathed in the red , green and white ikurrina , quaffing cider , clad in orange from head to foot , and parting like a tangerine - coloured sea as every rider and vehicle passed .
As a reminder of the distance the race travelled , each climb had its own character : vertiginous hairpins on the descent of the Col du Portet d'Aspet , where Italian fans lit candles around the memorial to Fabio Casartelli ; great beech trees atop the neatly stepped hairpins on the Col de Menté , where a plaque on a wall on a right - hand bend shows the place where the maillot jaune Luis Ocana fell and lost the race in a thunderstorm in 1971 .
Flyfishermen stood thigh - deep in tranquil rivers ; farmers were baling hay in the high mountain meadows .
There was a brief incursion into Spain via the Col de Portillon and the faded spa town of Luchon .
The Col de Peyresourde was all hayfields , wildflower meadows and heather banks before a notch in the hills from which , on the opposite side of the valley , could be seen the ribbon of parked cars shimmering in the heat haze that marked the penultimate climb , the Col de Val - Louron - Azet .
Once atop the Val - Louron ridge , the ski station finish could be seen on its mountain shoulder across the valley .
Quite what that did to the cyclists ' mental state can hardly be imagined , but merely being on the mountain was clearly a little too much for some of those Basque fans .
One was run over by a television camera motorbike as he attempted to run alongside Armstrong and Basso ; others had a confrontation with French police and expressed their disgust by stoning media vehicles .
Armstrong and other cyclists spent the stage with wristbands bearing the name Fabio , in honour of Casartelli , who will be officially remembered in a memorial ceremony today .
There were other messages along the way .
At the foot of the Col de Menté , the riders pedalled into the feed zone in the little village of Saint - Beat .
There were still 60 miles to go , but the saint 's name summed up the fate of all who have come up against Armstrong in the last seven years .
Why should the next seven days be any different ?"
2005-07-19,"Oscar Pereiro of Phonak won stage 16 of the Tour de France today , taking the victory in a four - man sprint .
The Spaniard surged ahead of Cadel Evans , Eddy Mazzoleni and Xabier Zandio in the final metres of the 180.5 km stage from Mourenx to Pau .
Australian Evans moved up the general classification from 11th to seventh , while six - time winner Lance Armstrong retained his lead of two minutes and 46 seconds over second - placed Ivan Basso after finishing comfortably in the pack .
"" It 's something special now , so I have to enjoy every moment until the end of the Tour , "" said Armstrong , who is retiring after this year 's race .
Zandio had been in the leading three riders who crossed the day 's first major obstacle , the Col de Marie Blanque , before the peloton attacked the beyond - category Col d'Aubisque .
Some Australian riders wore black armbands as a mark of respect to Amy Gillett , who was killed in an accident while out training with the Australian women 's road racing team on Monday in Germany .
Five other team members were badly hurt when they were hit by a car .
Robbie McEwen said : "" It 's a tragedy .
I have n't stopped thinking about it since hearing the news .
My thoughts go to the girls and their families . """
2005-07-21,"Marcos Serrano claimed victory on the 189 km 18th stage of the Tour between Albi and Mende after prevailing in a three - way battle .
The Liberty - Seguros rider from Spain was a member of an initial group of 10 that broke away from the peloton , including race leader Lance Armstrong , at the 20 km mark and stretched their lead throughout the race .
Serrano 's win , the fifth in his career and his first Tour success , came in a time of 4 hours 37 minutes and 36 seconds .
After attacking on the last climb of the day , the second category Cote de la Croix Neuve , Serrano comfortably beat Frenchman Cedric Vasseur , who finished second , and Belgian Axel Merckx , who came home third .
Armstrong was safe some 11 minutes behind the winner , after resisting an attack by Italy 's Ivan Basso .
German Jan Ullrich , fourth overall , followed up with a break of his own and reduced the gap on third - placed Dane Michael Rasmussen , who finished more than 30 seconds further back ."
2005-07-21,"The stiff ascent to the bleak aerodrome high above this little town is known as the Croix - Neuve , but it has been named "" the Laurent Jalabert climb "" in honour of the local man 's dramatic if unsuccessful attack on Miguel Induráin 's yellow jersey on Bastille Day 10 years ago .
Yesterday that memory only served to underline the lack of drama in the Lance Armstrong era of total , clinical control .
There was a distant connection with the "" Jaja "" years , however : the stage winner , the Spaniard Marcos Serrano , rides for Jalabert 's former team Once , if under the new colours of the insurance company Liberty Seguros .
He had been told in the morning to attempt the win in honour of their old leader , and his victory made up in part for a disastrous Tour after the team 's leaders , Roberto Heras and Joseba Beloki , rode poorly in the mountains .
Two separate battles , for the stage win and the minor placings overall , were contested 15 minutes apart on the two miles of steep hairpins .
The stage was fought out by the survivors of the day 's escape - Serrano ; Axel Merckx , son of the great Eddy but never a stage winner on the Tour ; Thomas Voeckler , who is still the darling of the home crowd after wearing the yellow jersey for 10 days in 2004 ; his fellow Frenchman Cédric Vasseur ; and the Spaniard Xabier Zandio .
There was no need for tactics : the steepness of the climb ensured that the decision came down simply to legs and lungs .
Merckx , for all that he had wanted to win on Belgium 's equivalent of Bastille Day , la fête nationale , is not quite the equal of his illustrious father , Vasseur is too heavily built for a climb of this steepness , and Voeckler has looked short of horsepower every time he has escaped in this Tour .
Serrano , a 32-year - old from Galicia , is a rare bird in cycling , a Spaniard with a major single - day win to his name , the Milan - Turin .
Yesterday he simply rode away from the others on the climb at his own pace , with the stage victory assured well before he breasted the summit and swooped down on to the plateau .
He shares his name with a type of Spanish ham but it was the others who were "" cooked "" , as cycling slang has it .
It could be said he had truly hung them out to dry .
This was a stage run through the land where Roquefort cheese is made , with as varied a backdrop as France can offer .
The early part of the stage offered 50-mile vistas across a patchwork of fields and woods as the race sped along a ridge , the latter the "" causses "" , vast rock bluffs with a hint of Death Valley about them .
There were ancient hill towns and ruined castles , the 1,000ft - plus towers of the new motorway viaduct at Millau , and the rather more earthy sight of a streaker running alongside the riders on the final hill .
The stage started in the shadow of the vast red - brick cathedral in Albi , built in the 14th century to symbolise Catholic domination over the heretic Albigensians .
Armstrong has crushed any signs of rebellion this year , and as ever he was implacable on the final ascent , responding to an attack from Ivan Basso and setting a pace which only the Italian , the German Jan Ullrich and the Australian Cadel Evans were able to live with .
Yesterday the brief , intense sort - out over the final hill meant that the pecking order behind Armstrong was shuffled again , with Ullrich continuing his relentless quest for third place , currently held by Mickael Rasmussen .
The German pulled back 37 seconds on the Dane yesterday and is now only 2min 13sec adrift , a margin which can be wiped out tomorrow .
Armstrong , with today 's brief run through the Massif Central , tomorrow 's time - trial - which he hopes to win if he can beat Ullrich - and the final stage in Paris on Sunday , now has only 220 miles to race before his retirement .
He is spending his final days in typically combative style .
Yesterday he was apparently somewhat discomfited at being selected for a random blood test in addition to the usual urine test .
He had words with Evans after the Australian outsprinted him for 10th place , and complained to a journalist from l'Equipe after the newspaper wrote that he had forced the pace on Wednesday 's stage in order to keep his former team - mate Floyd Landis from rejoining the main group .
"" I 'm thinking about the end a lot , especially as it gets closer , "" the Texan said yesterday .
"" To be honest I 'm ready for the end ; I 'm ready for this period to be over and to move on to something else . """
2005-07-21,"It was said of "" The Cannibal "" Eddy Merckx that he would sprint whenever a chequered flag was waved , no matter how small the prize .
Lance Armstrong has never shown Merckx 's penchant for competing through an entire season , but in the last two Tours he has shown an appetite of Merckxesque scale .
Last year Armstrong took five stages on his own plus the team time - trial , as well as topping the overall standings .
But this year , like a feudal lord scattering largesse , he has started letting his loyal servitors have their share .
Yesterday his Discovery Channel team took their second stage win in three , with their Italian Paolo Savoldelli outsprinting the Norwegian Kurt - Asle Arvesen in the final metres .
With George Hincapie 's win on Sunday at Pla d'Adet and their victory in the team time - trial , Discovery have now taken three stages .
The presence of Savoldelli 22 minutes ahead of the field in the day 's escape of 17 riders enabled them to take over the lead in the team rankings - calculated by adding up the times of each squad 's best three riders - ahead of Jan Ullrich 's T - Mobile .
Discovery also head the best young riders list through their Ukrainian Yaroslav Popovych , who is 12th overall , and that gave rise to the most surprising sight of yesterday 's stage .
After Ullrich had sprinted up the final hill above the town with the rest of the top six overall clinging to his back wheel , it was Armstrong who made the pace in a small group which escaped the field .
The Texan led the 10-man group up the finish straight as if they were about to sprint for first place , not 18th .
But the placing was irrelevant .
What mattered , apparently , was that Popovych was with him and the rider lying second to the youngster in the under-25 prize , the Kazakh Andrey Kashechkin , was in the next group and here was a chance for Armstrong to strengthen his team - mate 's hold on the standings .
There was more than a little of Bernard Hinault about Armstrong yesterday as well , on the day he equalled the great Frenchman 's tally of 77 days spent in the yellow jersey .
In his final Tour in 1986 Hinault seemed to be racing for the sheer competitive hell of it and yesterday Armstrong took particular delight in showing Ullrich his strength .
The German 's team had set a ferocious pace to the foot of the final climb to launch an attack from their leader , who wanted to gain some time on the rider currently lying third , Mickael Rasmussen .
It was spectacular , but fruitless .
T - Mobile wear pink and black and the latter must have summed up their mood yesterday .
They lost last year 's runner - up Andreas Klöden , who started the stage with his wrist in plaster after a crash on Tuesday but climbed in a team car after 10 miles .
The Kazakh Alexandr Vinokourov also announced yesterday that he intends to leave T - Mobile at the end of the season to become a team leader .
To add to the German team 's chagrin , yesterday 's stage winner spent two completely blank years in their employ in 2003 and 2004 .
This was due primarily to a horrendous accident in which he collided with a motorbike travelling at 60 mph .
He also spent 2004 recovering from a virus , and left T - Mobile partly because he felt their jersey brought him bad luck .
Savoldelli 's links with Armstrong go further back , however .
The Italian is a former client of Armstrong 's notorious former trainer Michele Ferrari , convicted in the autumn of drugs charges not relating to the Texan , who recommended him to Armstrong in 2002 when the Texan 's team were unable to afford him .
Delicate and accident - prone Savoldelli may be but he is also highly talented and has won the Giro d'Italia twice .
Yesterday he pounced immediately when the Frenchman Sébastien Hinault - no relation to Bernard by the way - attacked on the final hill and overhauled Arvesen relentlessly in the final metres .
At over 150 miles , yesterday was the race 's longest stage , partly because of a final loop to show off Revel 's pride and joy , the Lac de Saint - Ferréol .
One French rider commented rather bitterly : "" The lake was beautiful , but are n't we tired enough already ? ""
The field split to bits as T - Mobile made the pace at the end , and the same can be expected today on a shorter and hillier stage in the Massif Central ."
2005-07-23,"On an early June afternoon , the day after Eddy Merckx 's sixtieth birthday , the greatest cyclist ever , rode for 40 miles near his home in the suburbs of Brussels with Lance Armstrong , the man who has inherited the ' cannibal 's ' status as the most redoubtable cyclist of his generation . '
He told me his plan for ending his career and made it clear to me that he did not contemplate being defeated in this Tour , ' said Merckx . '
He said , "" Another seven weeks and it 's over . "" ' Like Merckx , Armstrong is not a man who has ever expected defeat and , as the American predicted to the old champion , he has come to the final day of his final Tour with his seventh victory in the bag .
As happened last year after Armstrong 's sixth victory , the Texan will be compared with ' the cannibal ' , who dominated cycling between 1968 and 1977 , winning 476 professional races in a 13-season career .
Merckx won five Tours de France to Armstrong 's probable seven , but he missed the race in 1973 to pursue other races and took a total of six wins in the other great Tours , Italy and Spain , neither of which Armstrong has won .
The ' cannibal ' still has his distinguished air , his high cheekbones that some compared with those of a sphinx , and he is as combative as ever .
Speaking to The Observer en route to this year 's finale , Merckx was as keen to fight his corner as might have been expected of the most successful professional cyclist of all time . '
I was a more aggressive rider than Armstrong .
I would attack more often .
He waits for the other guys , then counter - attacks . '
Merckx acknowledged that Armstrong shares his insatiable hunger for victory ' particularly last year , when he won five stages ' , but added that the Texan ' races more in the style of [ fellow five - times winners ]
Jacques Anquetil or Miguel Indurain ' . '
Master Jacques ' and ' Big Mig ' were noted for targeting certain stages , whereas the Merckx way was to attempt to win every stage .
The ' cannibal ' feels that the way he and Armstrong raced makes comparisons invidious . '
The two eras are totally different .
I raced from 1 February to 31 October every year , competed for everything .
When [ like Armstrong ] you are the best rider in the bunch and contest one race a year .... ""
Merckx is too polite to say it , but the message is similar to that of another five - time winner , Bernard Hinault , who said : ' With Armstrong 's racing programme , I would still be competing today and so would Eddy . '
There are similarities , however .
Both have pushed the boundaries of dedication to their sport and both are perfectionists to the point of obsession .
Merckx was legendary for getting up in the middle of the night to check his saddle height and had a cellar full of tyres ; Armstrong has a workshop with a pile of discarded saddles that have failed to come up to scratch , he reconnoitres every mountain stage and receives constant updates on his rivals .
Merckx does not believe that the way Armstrong races is beneficial for the sport , with its sole emphasis on one race , the Tour de France , putting the rest of the calendar in the shade . '
It 's not good for cycling , but how else can you race when the Tour is so important ? '
he said . '
The only event that counts is the Tour , it 's the only race that all the media go to .
It 's far more important than it was in my time , but as I see it cycling is more than the Tour de France . '
The old champion and budding star first met when Armstrong raced on one of Merckx 's bikes at the Barcelona Olympics in 1992 .
Subsequently , Merckx supplied bikes to the Texan 's first professional team , Motorola , and the pair became close , particularly after Merckx 's son , Axel - who will finish the Tour this year for the Davitamon - Lotto team - joined the squad . '
Eddy told me I could win a Tour de France some day , but that I needed to lose weight , ' wrote Armstrong in his autobiography
It 's Not About the Bike .
The book has a photograph of Merckx , corpulent and suited , visiting a lean , frail - looking Armstrong in hospital when the Texan was in remission from testicular cancer in late 1996 .
Armstrong insisted that the ' cannibal ' accompany him on his first bike ride after the illness . '
He was determined to come back to what he had been
and I was impressed , ' Merckx said recently in an interview with L'Equipe . '
No one believed in him at the time .
Even I would never have thought he was capable of coming back and winning the Tour de France . '
The friendship between the two has become tense in public on one occasion only , when Merckx accused Armstrong of racing to make Axel lose in a big one - day event , the Liege- Bastogne - Liege , but the ' cannibal ' feels that Armstrong has been misunderstood . '
The press has often been unjust where he is concerned , ' he said .
' What is said about him has to be measured .
Before his cancer he had already shown immense class , becoming world champion in Oslo in 1993 , ahead of Indurain , who is not just a nobody . '
He did n't transform himself thanks to the grace of God , but by building on all his setbacks , by training like hell and sorting out his lifestyle .
To begin with he ate anything , drank quite a few beers , even before a major race .
The cancer slimmed him down , but it also weakened him , I believe , quite a bit , and that 's why he has limited what he does to the Tour de France .
Without the cancer he would have had a racing record far beyond the norm . '
As of this afternoon , when Armstrong rides up the Champs Elysees to win his seventh Tour , a new problem will confront him : dealing with retirement .
Like many great athletes , Merckx had difficulty adapting to life outside sport - he famously said that at one point he could envisage no other existence than that of a professional cyclist - and he has some inkling of what awaits Armstrong . '
I stopped because I was tired of always racing , ' said Merckx . '
It was n't difficult for me to stop .
I was mentally exhausted .
But after that you need to find new goals , new things to aim for . '
In Merckx 's case , he put his energy into his bike factory , but it took him several years , in which his weight ballooned .
This week , even as he raced his last mountain stage , his last hill - top finish and watched his team defend the yellow jersey for the last time
, Armstrong said that he has yet to feel any emotion about leaving racing behind ; he was neither sad nor happy at the thought .
Quite how the most competitively minded and obsessively dedicated cyclist since Merckx will cope remains to be seen .
His old mentor is optimistic , feeling that cancer has given Armstrong contact with the everyday world that many athletes lack . '
I do n't know if Armstrong will find it hard to get into normal life .
You ca n't really compare our cases , ' said Merckx . '
He is a racer , too , but he has had cancer and has found other things in life which are important .
He will find new goals to occupy his time without too much trouble . '

2005-07-23,"Lance Armstrong will ride into Paris and retirement today as the winner of the Tour de France for the seventh year in a row , with his race complete after he won his first victory of the year in the 34-mile time - trial stage .
His second win of 2005 , and his last , will follow at about 4 pm BST on the Champs Elysees at the end of the fastest Tour de France in history , with the 2,200 miles covered at more than 26 mph , thanks mainly to a strong westerly breeze that whisked the riders from the Vendee to the Vosges .
The Texan cancer survivor crossed the line and fell into the arms of his immediate family - his three children , Luke , Grace and Isabel , his mother , Linda , and his girlfriend , Sheryl Crow , with the former Democrat presidential candidate John Kerry nearby .
All that remains of his cycling career now is a train journey to Paris this morning and a 90-mile stage through the French capital 's suburbs . '
This is a dream for me , ' said the 33-year - old . '
My kids are the most important thing in my life .
They were n't able to be here last year
and it was important to have them here to see their father in the yellow jersey .
It was not essential to win the stage , but it was essential to show I deserved the yellow jersey and was the strongest in the race . '
The stage over two tough climbs came down to a three - way battle between the three men who will finish in the top three positions today - Armstrong , the Italian Ivan Basso and Jan Ullrich .
Basso started fastest and was 7sec ahead of Armstrong at the first time check after four miles .
Over the first climb , however , the Cote de Saint Heand , normal service was resumed as Armstrong took over the lead , with Basso fading badly over the second ascent , the Col de la Gachet .
At the summit , with 25 miles covered , he was 1min 18sec behind Armstrong and he suffered horribly in the final miles , where Armstrong , who had started three minutes behind , was close to overtaking him .
The American rode as he had done throughout this Tour , not at his crushing best of last year , but utterly consistent , finishing 23sec ahead of Ullrich at the finish in one of this industrial town 's less prepossessing industrial estates .
It was a low - key backdrop for an astonishing achievement , his sixth win in the Tour 's final time trial in the last seven years .
Yesterday 's 34-mile loop out into the hills around this former centre of the French cycling industry was a tough proposition , with two long climbs up through fields of maize and the stubble from recently cut wheatfields , and narrow descents covered at 50 mph through tight , bumpy hairpins .
With Armstrong secure in the yellow jersey and the runner - up Basso a healthy margin ahead of Ullrich , the main interest in the stage hinged over the battle for third place overall between Ullrich and the wafer - thin Danish climber Mickael Rasmussen , who will wear the red polka - dot King of the Mountains jersey into Paris today .
Rasmussen got off to the worst possible start when he lost control of his bike on a roundabout soon after he had been launched down the start ramp and fell heavily .
His cause was not helped when he punctured and was unable to get a quick wheel change .
He then lost his temper with the mechanics following in his team car and had to make a second bike change .
The nightmare continued when he went head over heels over the handlebars on a descent , and he was then caught by Armstrong , who had started six minutes behind .
At the finish he was a desperately disappointing seventy - third place behind Ullrich and slipped down the standings from third to seventh overall .
Ullrich , on the other hand , moved up into third .
He will today finish on the podium for the seventh time in eight Tours and was only 43sec short of overtaking Basso for second place .
The day belonged to Armstrong , however , as this whole Tour has done since he overtook the German 22 days ago on the Ile de Noirmoutier ."
2005-07-23,"It is 15 years since Greg LeMond rode into Paris to take his third Tour without a stage win to his name , and today 's challenge for Lance Armstrong - and it should be his final challenge as a professional - is to avoid emulating his fellow American by winning the time - trial around Saint - Etienne en route to what should be his seventh title .
Surprising as it may seem that Armstrong has not registered even one individual victory since finishing in Paris last year , that merely reflects his conviction that the Tour alone is worth winning and everything else can be sacrificed for the cause .
He has no other need to win today .
He has taken the final time - trial in five of his six Tour wins , so it has no novelty for him , and with a 2min 46sec lead over Ivan Basso he has the race wrapped up .
However , his pride will demand it , and the Tour has seen many times in the past six years how powerful a motivator that is .
Today the hierarchy behind the Texan will be settled , and Jan Ullrich in particular will have his eye on closing the 2min 12sec gap that separates him from Mickael Rasmussen , and third place behind Armstrong .
If he manages it , he could achieve his seventh podium finish in eight Tours , a remarkable record of near - misses .
Whatever the outcome of his duel with Ullrich , Rasmussen is assured of the polka - dot jersey of best mountain climber , with such a big lead that he was not put under pressure by the presence of his principal challenger in the contest , Oscar Pereiro , among the quartet who fought out yesterday 's stage finish .
With the peloton five minutes behind , Pereiro , the Italian Franco Pellizotti , and France 's Sandy Casar were outwitted by the oldest and wiliest of the four , Ullrich 's T - Mobile team - mate Giuseppe Guerini , a climber who took the Alpe d'Huez stage in Armstrong 's first Tour win , 1999 .
En route to that win Guerini was knocked off his bike by a fan trying to take a photograph , but yesterday the 35-year - old had only to deal with the fact that he was the slowest sprinter of the four .
But he picked his moment well to surge clear , less than a mile from the line , as the others began to mark each other .
"" They looked at each other for a moment and that was enough .
I seized the moment , "" he said .
With its great cathedral and vast bronze statue of the Madonna , this little town stands at the start of the Via Podiensis , one of the designated pilgrim routes to Santiago de Compostela .
Yesterday Le Puy was the start of the end of the Tourmen 's private one - way road of suffering and sacrifice .
All those who finished yesterday should make it through to Paris .
There is only one major issue to be settled : the green jersey for best sprinter is still a three - way fight between the Norwegian Thor Hushovd and the Australians Stuart O'Grady and Robbie McEwen .
It will go to the wire , with Hushovd needing to finish no worse than five places behind O'Grady to ensure victory ."
2005-07-23,"Suddenly the end of Lance Armstrong 's career is a matter of hours away .
Today he will spend a little over 60 minutes attempting to take his first win of this year in the 34-mile time - trial stage around Saint - Etienne .
This evening , he will give his last formal press conference at the Tour .
Tomorrow he will sign a race registration sheet for the last time as a professional .
He is often fined for missing registration because he likes to keep clear of the crowds until the final minute before the stage starts , but presumably he will not miss this one .
He will ride 90 miles through the Paris suburbs , speed up and down the Champs Elysées , and that will be it .
Finis .
This Tour will only be won when he passes the mark for 3 km remaining , after which , if Armstrong crashes and breaks a leg , he will be adjudged to have finished with the stage winner .
There is still the potential for a stray fan , a misjudged corner , or , heaven forfend , the terrorist threat that will see 2,500 police patrolling the Champs Elysées tomorrow .
Even if an act of God were to deprive Armstrong of his seventh triumph , however , this race would be morally his .
He has dominated the event from the moment he overtook Jan Ullrich on the wide , straight road through the saltpans of the Ile de Noirmoutier three weeks ago .
The only moment of doubt came on the Col de la Schlucht in Alsace two weeks ago , and there it was his team who looked a little groggy rather than their leader .
Since 2000 , when he confirmed that his victory of 1999 in the Tour was no fluke , Armstrong has belonged to a rare breed of athlete , those whose aura and reputation is such that whenever they target an event , their rivals are already at a psychological disadvantage .
Such competitors usually come around only once or twice in a generation .
The American 's dominance of his sport will be remembered in the same way that Jack Nicklaus 's name has become synonymous with golf , Muhammad Ali 's with boxing and Juan Manuel Fangio 's with motor racing .
The outcome of the past five Tours has seemed predetermined , Armstrong 's rivals transfixed like rabbits in headlights .
The overwhelming feeling has been similar to that expressed by Colin Montgomerie last week about golf tournaments when Tiger Woods is there : second is all that is on offer .
Even in 2003 , when the Texan was visibly in trouble , neither Ullrich nor Alexandr Vinokourov was able to take advantage .
Armstrong is not the first cyclist to have such a stranglehold .
"" There is an Armstrong complex among the opposition , but there was also an Hinault complex and a Merckx complex , "" said Raphael Geminiani , a 1950s podium finisher and King of the Mountains , this week .
The defending champion is always in a position of strength , but in Armstrong 's case there is a little more to it than that .
Firstly he is known to be vindictive , a man who stores up slights "" on the hard drive "" as he puts it , then dishes out punishment . ""
He 's a bitter man , "" said the former hope of France , Laurent Jalabert , recently .
"" He wants to win , to crush the race with his authority .
It 's very American , is n't it , to squash the smaller ones when you are strong ?
It 's like my children crushing ants . ""
When crossed , Armstrong produces an intense , narrow - eyed gaze that those close to him refer to as The Look .
Unlike the other five - time winners of the Tour , Armstrong is also a master of psychological warfare , as his attitude to Ullrich shows .
"" Lance 's angle on Ullrich is to praise him , "" the Discovery Channel team chiropractor Jeff Spencer claimed in a recently published book on the Texan . ""
What Jan does n't like is pressure .
If you want to get into his head , praise him to the skies .
It starts a seed of doubt . ""
And sure enough , on Thursday , out came the warm words . ""
Jan Ullrich may be the favourite for Saturday - he seems to be getting stronger day by day , "" said the Texan .
He has said similar things about Ullrich every July , to the same effect even though he has been heard , off the record , to express far less flattering sentiments .
Even if he finishes this Tour without winning a stage , Armstrong is set to become that rare item : a sportsman who quits on his own terms at a time of his choosing with the most prestigious of victories .
In cycling , that is the one achievement that eluded Fausto Coppi , Jacques Anquetil , Merckx and Miguel Indurain , all of whom pedalled on beyond their sell - by dates .
Of the five - time winners , only Hinault set a date and stopped with his reputation undiminished .
Outside cycling , there are parallels : the middle - distance great Herb Elliott , who quit in 1961 on 44 straight wins and Rocky Marciano , who went undefeated throughout his career .
More recently , Steve Redgrave and Martin Johnson walked away from international competition after their greatest moment .
It is a rare privilege , the product of a strong mind and complete self - confidence .
But the cricketer Clive Lloyd put it rather differently - "" It 's time to retire when your eyes go , your legs go and your friends go "" - and on that basis Armstrong is good for at least one more Tour .
The Look is as piercing as ever , on recent evidence his legs are as good as ever , and the only friends he has lost are those who he feels have put themselves beyond the pale .
Armstrong is going before his time , and he is going with his head high .

2005-07-23,"American Lance Armstrong all but sealed a record seventh Tour de France victory , by taking the penultimate stage on Saturday .
His first stage win of the race .
Six - times Tour winner Armstrong retained the overall leader 's yellow jersey , comfortably beating off Germany 's Jan Ullrich , who finished second 23 seconds behind in the demanding 55.5-km time trial around St Etienne .
Ullrich 's team mate Alexander Vinokourov of Kazakhstan came home third .
"" It 's a great day , Lance wanted this stage badly .
It was a hard course , "" said Armstrong 's manager Johan Bruyneel Ullrich , who was fourth overall before the start , leafrogged Michael Rasmussen to third place and looks set for a seventh podium finish in the world 's most popular stage race .
Dane Rasmussen , the holder of the polka dot jersey for mountain specialists , had a nightmarish stage , suffering two falls and changing his bike three times .
He dropped to seventh overall after finishing 77th , more than seven minutes behind Armstrong .

Sunday 's final stage will take the pack over 144.5 km from Corbeil - Essonnes to Paris ."
2005-07-23,"The following correction was printed in the Guardian 's corrections and Clarifications column , Wednesday July 20 2005
In the following article , we said that only three people before Lance Armstrong had won the Tour de France five times .
In fact , four people have won it five times :
Anquetil , Merckx , Hinault and Indurain .
Barring some monstrous accident , tomorrow 's procession along the Champs Elysées will be less a bicycle race than a passing - out parade for its American winner , Lance Armstrong .
At that point he will have sealed a very strong claim to be cycling 's greatest - ever champion by winning the Tour de France for a seventh consecutive time .
Only three other riders have won as many as five Tours .
Seven straight wins is a record unlikely ever to be equalled .
The day also marks his retirement .
For the consummate sports professional , whose preparation is never less than meticulous and whose training regime is famously punishing , it seems appropriate that Armstrong should crown his career by going out so emphatically at the top of his game .
Those rivals who still have a season or two left in their legs will heave a sigh of relief .
The statistics of sporting success are one thing , but what Armstrong has brought to cycling transcends the special interest of any given sport .
Lance is , above all , a great story .
The son of an impoverished single mum , he triumphed to get a foothold in a notoriously tough sport , became one of its youngest - ever world champions - and then faced a cancer that threatened to end not just his career but his life .
And then the comeback to end all comebacks : he returned from surgery and chemotherapy , his very physiology and psychology seemingly reconstructed by his near - death experience , to win one of the most extreme tests of fitness and endurance in sport .
And not once , but five , six , seven times .
Even the timing of his back - from - the - dead feat was perfect .
In 1998 the Tour de France had suffered the worst doping scandal of its history when a team helper was caught with a boot - load of illegal drugs on the eve of the race .
With people wondering whether there was a single clean rider left in the professional peloton , the Tour desperately needed to recover its prestige .
Armstrong 's 1999 win could not have come at a better time .
Many since have questioned whether his remarkable transformation from an unfulfilled young talent to the post - cancer world - beater that he has become could have been achieved without artificial stimulants .
But Armstrong has never tested positive and sues anyone who calls him a cheat .
He is as unrelenting and aggressive in defending his reputation as he is in riding his bike .
And that reputation has been considerably enhanced by the bestselling books about his life .
The first and best , It 's Not About the Bike , turned a minority - sport athlete into an inspirational cancer survivor in the eyes of the public .
Since then Lance 's Livestrong campaign has given the world a new fashion item - the charity wristband .
It may be impossible not to admire Lance , but it is hard to warm to him .
His chiselled features are due to a very low body - fat ratio , but they speak also of an armoured flawlessness , a calculating ruthlessness .
That , with his apparent physical invulnerability and virtually superhuman performance , suggest something of the replicant or android : is he human , is he real , or some kind of bionic man ?
His perfect career admits no error or blemish .
He seems now to ride less a bicycle than a seamless conveyor belt to stardom .
So what next ?
There is speculation that , back home , he may run for governor .
Minnesota had an ex - wrestler , California has a former bodybuilder , so why not a one - time racing cyclist for Texas ?
At least , it is noted , he would be more liberal than some former governors of the state : Armstrong has criticised the invasion of Iraq , and his partner , the singer Sheryl Crow , is positively right on .
The only authorised version , however , is that he is looking forward to spending more time with his kids .
Of course .
Perfect .
And what of his legacy ?
It is hard to imagine any rider ever exercising such a single - minded domination of the sport .
Arguably , it will be good for the Tour de France that Lance is retiring .
Mere mortals will have a chance to compete and win .
It will be a race , rather than a kind of rolling roadshow of one man 's supremacy .
At the same time , Armstrong 's retirement will leave a vast and gaping vacuum - a sense that whatever follows will somehow be smaller , diminished .
For once , the sports cliche about "" the end of an era "" is apt .
I fancy that those watching on Sunday afternoon as Lance crosses the line for the last time will have a ghostly apprehension of a banner reading "" The End "" and , in their mind 's eye , the credits will begin to roll .
Already the idea of the Tour without Lance feels like an epic without a hero .
The real question is not whether cycling will ever again produce such a great champion , but whether it will ever again have such a great story . ·
Matt Seaton is the author of The Escape Artist , a cycling memoir matt.seaton@theguardian.com"
2005-07-24,"They say Lance Armstrong never gives up , but he had given up that evening in 1993 as he lay motionless on his bunk in a hostel in the Alpine ski resort of Serre - Chevalier .
An hour after trailing behind 85 other riders at the end of the Tour de France 's first day in the mountains , he was ready to pack it in .
"" I was hurting today , "" he said , exhaustion rendering his voice barely audible .
"" It was a strange feeling ; complete emptiness .
Tomorrow may be my last day .
I do n't want to kill myself . ""
Armstrong was 21 then , and barely a week into his first Tour .
In Verdun three days earlier he had surprised the world by becoming the youngest man ever to win a stage of la grande boucle .
Accepting the applause , the former junior triathlon champion from Texas made no secret of his belief that this was merely the start .
But when he hit the Alps for the first time , and the classic ascents of the Glandon and the Galibier , he discovered the true extent of the challenge he had taken on .
""
Those climbs today , "" he said , "" they just kept on coming .
Boom , boom , boom .
It 's demoralising when you see a sign at the bottom that says ' 21 kilometres to the summit ' .
I did n't even get the chance to go hard .
I was just too wasted . ""
Armstrong got out of his bunk the next morning and mounted his bike , but he lasted only one more day .
He would retire from the Tour again the following year .
But even when he made it all the way to Paris for the first time , in 1995 , there was little to suggest that his name would become synonymous with the great race .
Ahead lay the cancer diagnosis , the surgery to his brain and testicles , the deep chemotherapy to remove cancerous tissue from his lungs , the recovery , the return to competition , and the astonishing single - mindedness that brought him back to the Tour in 1999 .
By winning the race just once he encouraged fellow cancer survivors around the world to look at their lives in a different light .
The success of his charitable foundation , and the £ 23 m raised from the sale of the yellow Livestrong wristbands , are achievements unmatched by any other sportsman in history .
By winning it seven times in a row he bought himself a place among the immortals , and yesterday 's arrival on the Champs - Elysées represented the final chapter of a story without equal in sport .
Armstrong came into European cycling as a brash American who knew little or nothing about its traditions and protocols .
He learnt fast , and the last few years have provided numerous examples of his understanding of the sport 's complex etiquette .
But what unites him with other serial winners in contemporary sport - Michael Schumacher and Tiger Woods being the obvious examples - is not only an extreme work ethic , a profound interest in the minutiae of his craft and an understanding of the need to build a successful team around him , but the ferocity of his competitive edge .
His apparent feigning of distress on the lower slopes of Alpe d'Huez four years ago , in a successful attempt to lull Jan Ullrich into complacency , was one relatively mild example .
The darker , harsher side could be seen last year , when Filippo Simeoni , an Italian rider who had given testimony to a doping inquiry against Armstrong 's friend Dr Michele Ferrari , broke away on a stage of the Tour and the American personally chased him down to let him know that he would not be allowed to win the day 's award .
And yet , when set against Armstrong 's achievements in the face of huge challenges on and off the bike , these seem like very minor pieces of business .
Few of us are without flaw , and it would be unrealistic to expect a chap who can beat cancer and win the Tour de France a record number of times to be an angel as well .
There remain the frequent but always unproven accusations of doping .
As he has often pointed out , he is the most drug - tested athlete in the world , but nothing illegal - apart from the corticoid cream used to treat a saddle boil in 1999 - has ever been detected .
In a sport that continues to discover elevated haematocrit levels ( the red blood cell count of whole blood ) , and flasks of human growth hormone in the cars of riders ' wives , his innocence will be impossible to prove to everyone 's satisfaction , but the 11 pending legal actions against those he considers to have libelled him will be followed with interest .
It is typical of Armstrong 's approach to life that instead of saying farewell to cycling and walking off into the sunset , he seems intent on pursuing his accusers .
Had he possessed a forgiving nature , he would have forgiven himself for quitting the Tour de France at the top of a mountain all those years ago .
Instead , like every reverse in his life , it became a springboard .
And even in his distress that evening in Serre - Chevalier , he said something that resonates even louder now .
"" I can go to the start line , "" he said , "" and look at the other guys and say ,
well , there 's no way they want to win more than I do , because I want to win more than anybody . ""
Which he did , in every sense ."
2005-07-24,"The rain in Paris meant a gloomy finish to this year 's Tour de France , but the reign of Lance Armstrong still shone as brightly as ever .
Even those who do not follow sport know that the tour is one of the toughest events of any discipline .
Merely completing the gruelling 23-day race , with its combination of flat - out sprints and gut - busting mountain stages , takes vast reserves of mental and physical fitness .
To battle back from life - threatening cancer and return to cycling , as Mr Armstrong did , is remarkable .
To win the event seven years in succession , as he did yesterday , is incredible .
But even more extraordinary is Mr Armstrong 's decision to do something that few competitors , in politics , arts or sports , manage to achieve :
retire while at the top of their profession .
Miguel Indurain , the great Spanish rider , won five Tours in a row before finishing 11th in 1996 , his career blighted by allegations of drug use .
Others have proved just as unable to gauge when best to take their final bow .
The temptations of ego and financial gain prove stronger than tiring sinews .
Muhammad Ali ended his career unrecognisable from the nimble genius who transformed boxing .
Some activities , such as golf , are more generous to the fading of the light .
Others are more brutal .
The ageing Rudolf Nureyev became a figure of fun by the late 1970s for insisting on dancing lead roles after his physical gifts had deserted him .
Even a Nobel peace prize was not enough to save David Trimble when the tide of Unionism moved against him .
Those who make it out at the very peak are few and far between .
The five - time Olympic gold medallist Steve Redgrave and the nonpareil baseball pitcher Sandy Koufax are the exceptions to a rule , but it hard to think of politicians who leave gracefully rather than being pushed out the door .
Presidents Reagan and Clinton left the stage because of term limits in the US , and are regarded more fondly as a result .
Is there a message there for Tony Blair ?
As one old baseball manager said : "" If you do n't win , you 're going to get fired .
If you do win , you 've only put off the day you 're going to be fired . """
2005-07-24,"Bernard Hinault , five times winner of the Tour de France , is not a man who dispenses praise lightly or at length .
Last year , when Lance Armstrong won his third Alpine stage in a row , he grunted admiringly "" no gifts "" , a motto taken up by Armstrong 's sponsor and printed on T - shirts sold throughout this Tour .
The previous year , when Jan Ullrich 's crash in a time trial guaranteed Armstrong 's fifth win , he greeted the Texan with the words "" welcome to the club "" .
Yesterday as the riders prepared for the final stage into Paris , the legendary "" Badger "" professed himself duly impressed . ""
He has been head and shoulders above the rest all the way through this Tour .
It 's just been total control .
He had the strength and he showed it at once .
When you get 50 seconds on all your rivals in the opening time trial , like he did , it 's a colossal asset .
He has worked hard and it pays .
"" You can not place him in the pantheon because the sport has changed so much .
If Eddy Merckx had raced the way Armstrong does , targeting only one event a year , Merckx might have won 10 or 15 Tours .
You can not say who is best .
All you can say is Armstrong is the champion of the moment . ""
Hinault 's opinion is shared by the great Merckx , whose record will never be surpassed , because cyclists no longer compete for every race on the calendar , from February to October , as the "" Cannibal "" did in the late 1960s and early 1970s .
"" The two eras are totally different , "" says Merckx .
"" The press has often been unjust where [ Armstrong ] is concerned .
Before his cancer he had already shown immense class , becoming world champion in Oslo in 1993 , ahead of [ Miguel ] Indurain , who is not just a nobody .
He did n't transform himself thanks to the grace of God , but by building on his setbacks , training like hell and sorting out his lifestyle .
Without cancer he would have had a racing record far beyond the norm .
"" Those who know Armstrong say he had qualities that set him apart from the average well before his fight against testicular cancer in 1996 . ""
The most obvious difference between him and a lot of others was that when we met for the first time he had a lot of self - confidence .
He knew exactly what he wanted to do , which is something many athletes struggle with later in their careers , "" said Armstrong 's first professional team manager , Jim Ochowicz .
"" He came from triathlon and had huge physical ability but cycling was new to him .
He knew that he wanted to come to Europe , measure himself against the best guys and race the Tour de France .
He won a stage in his first Tour , and even then he had the ability to read a race .
He looked at everything , watched , took it in .
He understood things quicker than the others . ""
According to Ochowicz , Armstrong soaked up information from two riders at Motorola , the Australian Phil Anderson and the Sussex hardman Sean Yates , who spent the Tour working as a team manager at Armstrong 's Discovery Channel team .
Yates was fulsome in his praise for his boss : "" When you see someone superhuman in action you are always going to be impressed .
He just has a greater limit than anyone else . """
2005-07-24,"Lance Armstrong rounded off his glittering career in style this afternoon by securing his record - breaking seventh Tour de France victory in the streets of Paris .
Armstrong , surrounded by his Discovery Channel team - mates , crossed the finishing line on the Champs Elysees towards the back of the peloton in the final stage which had been won by Alexander Vinokourov of Kazakhstan .
Handed a microphone by Tour legend Bernard Hinault , Armstrong paid tribute to second - placed Ivan Basso and his long - time rival Jan Ullrich who finished third .
Ullrich , who won the Tour in 1997 when Armstrong was sidelined from the sport with cancer , has been the American 's main rival during his glory reign . ""
To end my career on this podium , it 's a really great podium , "" he said , flanked by Basso and Ullrich .
Turning to Ullrich he said : "" This is really the guy who has challenged me - he is a special man and a special person . ""
Referring to Basso , he said : "" Ivan , he 's tough , too tough to race because he is a friend
and maybe he is the future of the Tour de France . ""
Armstrong fired one parting shot at critics who have used several recent drugs controversies to cast doubt on the integrity of cycling .
He said : "" To people who ca n't believe in cycling - the cynics , the sceptics - I feel sorry for you .
I 'm sorry you ca n't believe in miracles . ""
He ended in French , saying "" Vive le Tour "" .
Armstrong ends his career as the most successful rider in the 102-year history of what is widely considered sport 's most gruelling challenge .
No other man has won more than five Tours ."
2005-07-24,"Given the control Lance Armstrong has exerted over the last seven Tours de France , the weather could hardly have been expected to spoil his last exit .
No one was going to rain on his parade , not even the French skies - they probably did not dare - and after a day of rain , the sun came out for the Texan on the Champs Elysées .
It bathed the lone - star flags that hung from the boutiques below the Arc de Triomphe and the stars and stripes that bedecked the crowd barriers .
It warmed the Americans and Danes and Britons as they craned their necks at the cafe tables and stood up the streets that slope off the Champs , the better to see over the throng , waving their yellow paddles that proclaimed "" Lance fan "" .
And it dried out the cobbles for the final , hectic sprint , won by the Kazakh Alexandr Vinokourov .
Armstrong 's Tour had actually been won when the riders crossed the finish line for the first time .
The race rules permit the final laps on the Champs to be "" neutralised "" in wet weather if its cobbles are ruled to be so slippery as to be dangerous , in order to avoid a cyclist getting to the finishing circuit with the race won , then losing it due to a heavy crash .
In a first for the Tour , and in acknowledgement of what he has achieved , he was given a microphone and invited to share his thoughts with the crowd from the winner 's podium .
Armstrong congratulated the men alongside him , the Italian Ivan Basso and Jan Ullrich , who has now finished second or third to the Texan four times . ""
The dream podium , "" he called them .
Ullrich looked a little dubious .
In tones reminiscent of an Oscar winner he thanked his back - up team - naturally omitting his controversial Italian trainer Michele Ferrari - and added a final plea against the unbelievers , "" cynics and sceptics "" who have doubts about the probity of this most demanding of sports .
"" You need to believe in these athletes , "" he said .
"" This sport is the most difficult in the world . ""
After a party last night at the Ritz , today Armstrong will fly to the south of France with his close friends and family to begin his retirement with a week 's holiday .
He acknowledges that his competitive spirit is such that he may be seen in mountain - bike races , cyclo - cross events , triathlons or possibly a marathon .
Fortunately for the running world , he joked , he does not expect to break 2hr 15min .
Armstrong had never looked like losing this Tour , but it was a managed win rather than a crushing victory .
He admitted on Saturday that there had been "" no moment like in 2001 and 2002 when I rode away alone .
I was always matched in the mountains "" .
Indeed , since those two Tours his domination has been psychological and tactical more than completely physical , reflecting the fact that after the age of 30 a cyclist 's strength slowly ebbs .
However , his tactical style - analysing the opposition , focusing on one or two key days - also reflects a confidence in his own ability which is born of experience and cold - blooded analysis .
"" The Tour is about riding consistently , "" he said .
"" I sat down with Johan [ Bruyneel , his team manager ] and said ' how many attacks does it take to win a Tour de France ? '
One - one good attack , two good time - trials .
"" That is pretty much what he has produced in the last three Tours , to equal the greats of his sport and then create his own record , one which is unlikely ever to be surpassed .
This Tour win was born of a superlative opening time - trial in the Vendée , blowing Ullrich , Basso and Vinokourov away at Courchevel and then it was sealed on Saturday with his 22nd career stage win in the time - trial at Saint - Etienne .
And he leaves , as might be expected from a man who has never seemed over sentimental , with no regrets .
"" I 've had an unbelievable career .
I 've been blessed to ride 14 years as a professional .
I have no reason to continue .
I do n't need more .
It 's time for a new face .
"" As might be expected Armstrong left the Tour in combative style , bringing a wayward Belgian , Philippe Gilbert , to order with what looked like a stream of invective after the youngster dared to attack in the streets of Paris .
Shortly afterwards he had the last nervous moment of his career , when three of his team slipped on the greasy Tarmac and he narrowly avoided falling with them .
While the finish on the Champs is traditionally contested by the sprinters , yesterday saw the most dramatic finish of the Tour won solo by Vinokourov , who had begun the stage just two seconds adrift of fifth place overall after a strong ride in the time - trial in Saint - Etienne .
He won six seconds in a time bonus at an intermediate sprint which put him ahead of the American Levi Leipheimer and then he went for the jackpot , sprinting the final two kilometres as if his life depended on it .
Here was a moment of sheer , naked aggression which surpassed Armstrong 's race - winning attack at Courchevel last week in its style if not its overall impact .
Earlier Armstrong and his Discovery Channel team had played one final trick on the French public .
Yesterday morning , as the crowd stood six deep around their bus waiting for the Texan to emerge for the last time , a yellow shoulder poked tantalisingly out of the door .
There was a chorus of "" oohs "" until the crowd realised that , in honour of their leader 's exit , the whole team had put on jerseys with one yellow shoulder and this was not Armstrong but one of his domestiques .
At 1.19pm his bodyguards forced their way through the throng and he climbed the podium to register for the last time as a professional .
In his halting French , drawling the consonants as he always does , he addressed the crowd .
"" It 's been 14 years , super for me . ""
"" Maintenant "" , he admitted , he was "" emu "" - emotional . ""
Merci bîen , "" he added , and slipped away to the start - line for the last time ."
2005-07-24,"Lance Armstrong , the cancer survivor whose yellow wristbands are worn around the world by some 40 million contributors to his Livestrong charity , rode off the Champs - Elysees and into sporting history last night after fulfilling his ambition to become the first man to win the Tour de France seven times .
Armstrong was breaking a record he set a year ago , when he took himself clear of the four men - Jacques Anquetil , Eddy Merckx , Bernard Hinault and Miguel Indurain - who had won the race five times .
But the real record was established long ago , when he proved that it was possible to survive radical treatment for cancer and go on to victory in the world 's most gruelling sporting event .
In the course of his seven consecutive victories , Armstrong pedalled more than 15,000 miles up and down the Alps and the Pyrenees , through the vineyards of Bordeaux and Provence , and past innumerable chateaux and sunflower fields .
At 33 , nine years after his testicular cancer was diagnosed , he is taking his trophies and his record into retirement .
His career has been studded with incident and controversy , and yesterday 's rainstorms as the race approached the finish in Paris almost cost him his concluding appearance on the podium .
As the riders passed through the suburb of Issy - les - Moulineaux , three members of his Discovery Channel team were involved in a crash .
After narrowly avoiding the fallen riders , Armstrong ordered the field to ride more sensibly on the treacherous surface .
The readers of his two best - selling volumes of autobiography -
Every Second Counts
and It 's Not
About the Bike :
My Journey Back to Life - are familiar with his approach to adversity .
He was born in Texas , the child of a car salesman who disappeared when he was two years old and a teenage girl who worked with a single - minded devotion to bring up her son .
After making his first impact as a schoolboy swimmer and triathlete , he switched to bicycle racing and in 1993 the prickly , combative 21-year - old became the youngest man to win a stage of the Tour de France .
Three years later he was told that cancer had spread to his lungs and brain .
His preparation for surgery and chemotherapy began at that moment and the intensity with which he approached his recovery ensured that 518 days after his last race he was competing again .
The sequence of tour victories began a year later , and now forms one of the most remarkable stories in the history of sport ."
2005-07-24,"A period of instability and uncertainty has followed the retirement of each of the great Tour de France champions , and once Lance Armstrong 's seventh Tour de France win was in the bag , a week ago at Pla d'Adet , the Texan 's succession became the only major question remaining in this year 's race .
The issue is more complex than usual , because Armstrong 's dominance has been so complete for so long .
Jan Ullrich 's 1997 Tour win belongs to another era , and Ivan Basso and all the other pretenders have never had the chance to show whether they can shape a Tour to the form they want .
As France 's former points and mountains winner Laurent Jalabert said this week : "" It would be unwise to assume that the guy who finishes second this year will be first next year .
Just by being there Armstrong sorts out who finishes in what position without anyone really being aware of it . ""
The list of contenders is headed , logically , by Basso , who has finished second and third in the last two Tours but without showing anything like Armstrong 's competitive spirit .
The Texan himself is a big fan of the Italian , whom he tried to hire for his Discovery Channel team . ""
Ivan proved this year he 's a great climber and perhaps the future of this race for the next few years . ""
Purely on past performances Ullrich will start as next year 's favourite but at 32 he will be past his sell - by date .
Armstrong clearly feels the German has underperformed and he said rather patronisingly on Saturday that he would relish the chance to put his old rival on the right track .
"" We 've said , ' Why not take Jan [ on our team ] ? '
He clearly can win the event but he has to show up in a little better shape , a kilo and a half less at the start , a bit better preparation and he wins .
"" Armstrong has also talked up the chances of the young Spaniard Alejandro Valverde , who outsprinted him for the stage win at Courchevel , then pulled out with a knee injury .
What sets the 25-year - old apart is his undoubted ability as a single - day racer capable of winning medals in the world championships .
Armstrong , of course , also began his career as a one - day specialist .
While the young Italian tipped as cycling 's future star , Damiano Cunego , has failed to shine this year because of an attack of glandular fever , another strong climber has emerged in this year 's Tour , the Dane Mickael Rasmussen . ""
Chicken legs "" had one outstanding day in this Tour , his win on the stage into Mulhouse , but could not hold the pace in the final week .
Like many climbers he has problems in time - trials , and his performance on Saturday 's stage was a disaster , with two crashes betraying complete panic in which he lost his third place overall to Ullrich .
Armstrong will return to the Tour next year but he will be in a management role at Discovery - of which he is a part - owner - and has begun to suggest that his successor may come from within the squad , beginning with his close friend George Hincapie , who has improved in the mountains in recent years .
"" What would happen if a guy like George focused on the Tour de France ? "" said Armstrong .
"" He 's a much better athlete than any of them ; he 's someone who can ride at the front every day in the Alps and Pyrénées . ""
The other possible contender within Discovery is the Ukrainian Yaroslav Popovych . ""
He is going to win the white jersey , which speaks for itself .
He 's very well rounded , very solid in the group and might be the next team leader .

2005-07-26,"On Sunday , Lance Armstrong broke his own record to become the first man to win the Tour de France seven times .
The American cyclist 's seventh consecutive victory had added poignancy as it also marked his retirement . ""
Will he be missed ? "" asked Owen Slot in the Times . ""
Like hell he will .
He has exerted an all - powerful , unchallengeable influence over the event , but you will not find too many bemoaning his departure . ""
European cycling fans "" can dream again of hailing their own heroes "" , noted Slot .
French enthusiasts especially had never taken to the American , whose "" unprecedented streak remains clouded by doping suspicions among some observers , even though he is the sport 's most tested athlete and has never failed one "" , wrote the Wall Street Journal Europe . ""
Yet in the end Armstrong seems to have won a measure of begrudging respect from the French ...
[ who ] tend to be fonder of heroes once they 've surrendered the pinnacle . ""
The International Herald Tribune sympathised with Gallic frustration that a Frenchman had not won a Tour de France in 20 years . ""
But it should be a matter of satisfaction to France that Armstrong has endowed the race , and the sport , with true international sex appeal . ""
Noting that he had faced life - threatening cancer , the Washington Times reckoned that "" Armstrong 's impact is twofold : as a champion athlete and an inspirational survivor .
Although he retired [ on Sunday ] from his role as the former , we know he will never cease to be the latter . ""
The Sun agreed .
"" To win the Tour de France just once takes strength , courage , skill and guts , "" it marvelled . ""
So what does it need to win it seven times - after beating cancer of the testicle , lung and brain ?
It needs a superman - Lance Armstrong . ""
So what did the future hold for him ?
The Daily Mail 's Leo McKinstry noted that the cyclist had "" shown some interest in politics , with talk that he might run for governor of his home state , Texas "" .
But George Vecsey , in the New York Times , advised against it .
"" If anybody proposes politics to Armstrong ... he should fix his best glower on them ...
Armstrong seems to have the right idea ...
[ On Sunday ] , he said he was likely to string guitars for his girlfriend , Sheryl Crow , the rock singer . """
2005-07-26,"Matt Damon is in talks to star in a film about the life of seven - time Tour de France winner and cancer survivor
Lance Armstrong , according to US reports .
Sports channel ESPN 2 reported the Oscar - winning actor was Armstrong 's own preferred choice to play him in the long - proposed movie , which is expected to be based on Armstrong 's biography
It 's Not About the Bike :
My Journey Back to Life .
According to US film site
Ai n't
It Cool News ,
Damon is a biking enthusiast and more than keen to get in shape for what would be a physically demanding role .
Armstrong discovered that he had testicular cancer , which had spread to his brain and lungs , in 1996 .
After surgery and aggressive chemotherapy he returned to cycling in 1997 and two years later won his first Tour de France , as the lead rider of the US Postal Service team .
He then repeated his victory for a record - breaking five years in a row before winning for a seventh and final time earlier this month .
Armstrong 's harrowing account of discovering and beating cancer , which was cowritten by Sally Jenkins , won the William Hill sports book of the year award in 2000 and a sequel , Every Second Counts , was published in 2003 ."
2005-07-26,"In keeping with his declaration that he wishes to keep out of the public eye for the near future , Lance Armstrong yesterday denied recent press rumours that he would run for the governorship of Texas in next year 's elections .
Armstrong yesterday began his retirement by flying to the south of France for a beach holiday with his girlfriend , the rock star Sheryl Crow - whose next album is inspired by her love affair with the seven - times Tour de France winner - and his children Luke , Grace and Isabelle and close friends .
His plan , he said before the Tour ended , was to have a preview of his life "" for the next 50 years - no stress "" .
That may not be quite so easy to achieve in the medium term , if the list of impending legal cases involving him is anything to go by .
As in so much that he has brought to his sport , litigation on this scale is a first for professional cycling , where lawyers were hardly involved until the 1980s and where they have tended to limit their activities to the occasional contractual dispute .
All the legal disputes have a common theme : drugs allegations involving either Armstrong or his former trainer Michele Ferrari , with whom the Texan officially cut all ties after Ferrari 's conviction in October on drugs charges .
A recent biography of Armstrong estimated that he is employing 11 lawyers on eight cases in three countries : the US , Britain and France .
Several of the cases centre on allegations made in the 2004 biography LA Confidentiel : Les Secrets de Lance Armstrong , which uses what is apparently circumstantial evidence to support its claim that he may have used performance- enhancing drugs .
Armstrong has brought libel suits against the authors , the Sunday Times journalist David Walsh and the former L'Equipe sportswriter Pierre Ballester , and against the Sunday Times , as well as against two of the witnesses quoted in the book .
Armstrong is also fighting a Dallas company , SCA Promotions , over his $ 5 m ( £ 2.86 m ) performance bonus for 2004 .
The company withheld the bonus , saying that it wished to look into the allegations in LA Confidentiel further and asking to examine Armstrong 's medical records .
The case is in arbitration and is expected to stay there until at least the end of the year .
In a further case to be heard in the US , Armstrong faces a case brought by his former personal assistant Mike Anderson , who claims he was sacked by the Texan in February 2004 after spotting a box containing steroids in Armstrong 's bathroom .
Armstrong denies the claim and has issued a counter - suit .
Finally , Filippo Simeoni 's case for "" public defamation "" against Armstrong will be heard in Paris in March .
The Italian cyclist was a key witness in Ferrari 's trial and sued Armstrong after the American claimed in an interview with a French newspaper that Simeoni was "" an absolute liar "" .
Whatever the outcome , Armstrong has confirmed that he will return to the Tour next year in a consultant 's role with the Discovery Channel team .
"" I 'll be on the Tour a little , probably bothering [ the team manager ] Johan [ Bruyneel ] , begging for a place in the car . ""
He already part - owns the management company that runs the team .
His immediate task , he accepts , will be to find a new US star to front the team .
""
The Tour is the only time that cycling crosses over to the newspapers and networks .
For the American public to stay interested in cycling and the Tour they have to have an American guy , an American face . ""
As well as his close friend George Hincapie , Armstrong has named another , younger rider with the team , Tom Danielson , as a possible future leader .
Speculation that Armstrong will eventually find his way into politics was heightened when the White House confirmed yesterday that he had taken a telephone call from George W Bush , a fellow Texan , shortly after finishing his final Tour in Paris .
President Bush and last year 's Democratic presidential candidate John Kerry are both keen cyclists .
Kerry was at the Tour over the weekend and said that Armstrong would be a force to be reckoned with if he went into politics , "" but I hope he goes in for the right side "" .
Armstrong has never openly declared his allegiance ; he is on President Bush 's cancer commission but apparently opposed the Iraq war , and his girlfriend 's left - wing credentials are well established .
Armstrong denied at the start of the Tour that he had any immediate ambitions for a political career , citing his dislike of press conferences .
"" I do n't like this setting , "" he said .
"" Why be president and have this setting every day ?
But politics and the good of my country interest me . ""

2005-07-28,"Is the Tour de France winner endowed with a supreme athletic physiology by a genetic freak ?
Or does he just work harder than the rest ?
There is circumstantial evidence for the freak theory .
Armstrong has particularly long thigh bones , for instance , making him biomechanically suited to cycling .
His heart is a third larger than the average male 's .
His maximum heart rate is over 200bpm .
His VO 2 max ( the amount of oxygen the body can use in a given period , a standard measure of aerobic performance ) is one of the highest recorded at about 83 ml / kg / min .
All these are factors , but relatively insignificant ones .
All professional cyclists , for example , will have much bigger and more efficient hearts than untrained individuals .
Most will have VO2 max numbers in the 70 - 80 ml / kg / min range .
Where Armstrong stands out is that he seems to have an innate capacity to train exceptionally hard , recover quickly and reap the fitness benefit .
One study found that between the ages of 21 ( when he was already a pro ) and 28 ( after winning his first Tour ) , his muscular efficiency had improved by 8 % .
After surviving cancer , he also became more focused about managing his weight , so that this 8 % was actually worth an 18 % increase in his power - to - weight ratio - crucial for cycling up the Alps and Pyrenees .
And this was achieved with a workload that would make most elite cyclists break down .
Even Armstrong 's own teammates , who would be continually worrying about picking up a virus , marvelled that Lance never seemed to get sick .
A natural athleticism combined with a remarkable immune system and an incredible work ethic : that seems to be Armstrong 's recipe for success ."
2005-08-23,"One month after winning a record seventh Tour de France , cycling legend Lance Armstrong has angrily rejected allegations that he tested positive for a performance - enhancing drug , and insisted he is the victim of a "" witch hunt . ""
Despite undergoing regular tests , Armstrong has never before tested positive for a banned substance .
And he dismissed today 's claims in French newspaper L'Equipe emphatically . ""
Yet again , a European newspaper has reported that I have tested positive for performance - enhancing drugs , "" he told his official website . ""
A French sports daily , is reporting that my 1999 samples were positive .
Unfortunately , the witch hunt continues and the article is nothing short of tabloid journalism . ""
The paper even admits in its own article that the science in question here is faulty and that I have no way to defend myself .
They state , ' there will therefore be no counter - exam nor regulatory prosecutions , in a strict sense , since defendant 's rights can not be respected ' .
"" I will simply restate what I have said many times : I have never taken performance enhancing drugs . ""
Armstrong has been dubbed by many as the greatest athlete of all time , after recovering from testicular cancer to win one of the world 's toughest endurance races more times than anyone else .
Just before announcing his retirement last month , he delivered a message to people who questioned hoiw he achieved such a feat . ""
For the people who do n't believe in cycling - the cynics , the sceptics - I 'm sorry for you , "" he said .
"" I 'm sorry you ca n't dream big
and I 'm sorry you do n't believe in miracles . """
2005-08-24,"Lance Armstrong was hoping for a quiet life after retiring last month after his seventh consecutive victory in the Tour de France , but yesterday those hopes were shattered when the American was accused by the French press of having tested positive for performance - enhancing drugs .
L'Equipe , whose parent company organises the Tour , alleged that he had taken the banned blood - boosting drug erythropoietin ( EPO ) .
It published results of tests done recently on urine samples that had been taken originally in 1999 when Armstrong won his first Tour de France .
A test was not available for EPO until 2000 .
L'Equipe claimed that traces of EPO were found in six of 15 urine samples provided by Armstrong .
After being contacted by L'Equipe , Armstrong moved quickly to deny the allegations , describing the paper 's investigation as "" tabloid journalism "" and a "" witch hunt "" .
"" I will simply restate what I have said many times : I have never taken performance - enhancing drugs , "" Armstrong said on his website .
The Texan had never failed a doping test during his 14-year career .
Yesterday L'Equipe printed results of tests carried out in the Paris laboratory of Châtenay - Malabry , which is registered with the World Anti - Doping Agency .
The samples were recently retested as part of scientific research co - ordinated with Wada .
They had been preserved at -20C to prevent molecular transformations that could lead to false positive results .
"" There is no possible doubt about the validity of the result , even though the analysis was carried out five years after the sample was taken , "" the newspaper quoted Professor Jacques de Ceaurriz , the director of Châtenay - Malabry laboratory , as saying .
The EPO test was first introduced at the Olympic Games in Sydney and has been used since the 2001 Tour de France .
None of the tests have subsequently showed Armstrong as being positive .
The Wada president Dick Pound said he was looking into the allegations .
"" It 's a pretty serious story if it is true , "" he said .
"" We have not decided what we would do because I have not looked at all the details .
We will look at the information available and then we will decide the best way to get as much light on this as possible . ""
Just how L'Equipe obtained the test results and identified Armstrong 's urine samples and results remains unclear .
The laboratory denied leaking the information but confirmed tests on samples from the 1998 and 1999 Tour have recently been carried out .
L'Equipe refused to reveal its sources .
The L'Equipe journalist Jean - Pier Bidet , who followed Armstrong closely during his Tour de France victories , said that the paper had been investigating the test results for four months but only received the final piece of the jigsaw on Monday afternoon when official documents showed the samples were taken from Armstrong .
Although a total of 12 positive samples were discovered during testing , L'Equipe only made the allegations against Armstrong because the newspaper could confirm his identity with the official anti - doping test documents .
The laboratory said all tests were anonymous and had been transmitted to the Wada providing they would not take disciplinary action .
When a rider gives a urine sample he signs documents admitting that it is his sample .
A copy of the document goes to the International Cycling Union and another to the Ministry of Sport in France , while the sample is sent to the laboratory marked by a code so that the testers do not know the identity of the rider .
L'Equipe had claimed to have matched leaked documents to the codes on the laboratory samples .
Because the tests were not part of official anti - doping testing and because no counter - analysis can be carried out Armstrong can not be disciplined and banned .
However he could be placed under police investigation in France and the United States Anti - Doping Agency ( Usada ) told L'Equipe the tests results could be used against him .
The accusations could also hurt Armstrong in the pocket .
The US insurance company SCA refused to pay out a $ 5 m ( £ 2.8 m ) bonus when he won a sixth Tour de France in 2004 following allegations made in the book , LA Confidentiel : Les Secrets de Lance Armstrong , which contained allegations of doping .
Armstrong is already involved in seven legal battles against the writers of the LA Confidentiel book , fellow riders and former assistants .
The director of the Tour de France , Jean Marie Leblanc , told the French radio station RTL he felt let down by Armstrong and said L'Equipe 's report seemed "" very complete , very professional , very meticulous "" and that it "" appears credible "" .
However , he warned that Armstrong , his doctors and his aides should be heard out before any final judgment was made .
The International Cycling Union president Hein Verbruggen said : "" We have to wait and see if this is true .
Only then will we be able to ask ourselves whether there should be any legal action and whether this is a further blow for cycling .
I have to say this is not pleasant but , for the moment , it only involves Lance Armstrong and France . ""
Armstrong has always dismissed the allegations against him and criticised those who refused to believe in his comeback from cancer and in his seven Tour victories . ""
To all the cynics , I 'm sorry for you , "" Armstrong said after his final Tour triumph in July .
"" I 'm sorry you ca n't believe in miracles .
This is a great sporting event and hard work wins it . """
2005-08-24,"Just over a century ago , in its earlier guise as L'Auto , the French daily sports paper L'Equipe was responsible for founding the Tour de France .
Its feelings of proprietorship towards the great race , then , are hardly surprising .
And one way of interpreting yesterday 's allegations of traces of EPO discovered in samples of urine taken from Lance Armstrong during the 1999 Tour is to see it as the French cycling establishment 's attempt to take back the race from an American who colonised their most precious sporting event as effectively as Hollywood , rock ' n ' roll and Levi jeans took over the minds of French teenagers 50 years ago , to the disadvantage - some would say - of the indigenous culture .
In France , a certain element has always resisted this kind of US imperialism .
For Greg LeMond to win the Tour three times was one thing .
It was quite another for Armstrong to obliterate the record of five wins first established by one great French cyclist , Jacques Anquetil , and equalled by another , Bernard Hinault , as well as by Eddy Merckx of Belgium and Miguel Indurain of Spain , all representatives of cycling 's Old World .
The absence of a single Frenchman among the pretenders to the Texan 's throne is another source of frustration to L'Equipe 's writers and , perhaps , its readers .
After initially finding him difficult to love , eventually the French cycling public more or less capitulated to the cowboy with - as one of the newspaper 's correspondents put it yesterday - the voice like ice cubes , the steely gaze , and the lips forever on the brink of a smile full of menace .
Not to mention the posse of bodyguards and the hotline to the White House .
On the centenary Tour two years ago there was certainly little sign of resentment as Armstrong drew level with the record held by his four great predecessors .
Only the tidal wave of spectators from the other side of the Atlantic , turning the verges of the routes départmentales into a sea of stars and stripes , might have irked them during the two more recent tours .
They were there to celebrate as Armstrong first set a new mark and then , in a crushing example of American might , doubled the distance between himself and those he had surpassed .
Yesterday 's publication of what are claimed to be the a posteriori tests of Armstrong 's B samples , however , reawakens all the old doubts that led to cries of "" dopeur ! ""
being directed at him from the roadside earlier in the decade .
Those were the days when L'Equipe could only express its doubts about the nature of some performances in coded headlines referring to "" Le Tour
à deux vitesses "" - the two - speed Tour , meaning one speed for the dopers and another , slower , gear for those who raced clean .
There is also , perhaps , the question of moral revenge for the shadows cast over French cycling in 1998 by the Festina affair , when the discovery of drugs in the vehicle of Willy Voet , one of the team 's soigneurs , led to the disgrace of Richard Virenque , France 's pin - up boy .
Virenque spent years adamantly denying that he had used illegal substances .
But then he cracked , and served a nine - month suspension before being welcomed back as a prodigal son when he won the climb up Mont Ventoux in the 2002 Tour .
Armstrong 's first Tour victory came the year after the Festina scandal , at a time when the race organisers were attempting to promote a new , drug - free image for the event .
EPO was already illegal , but there was no test capable of determining its existence .
That arrived in 2000 , although the authorities were not ready to use it on samples from the Tour 's riders until a year later .
Yesterday L'Equipe published the results of Armstrong 's Tour dope tests between 2001 - 2004 , in other words after EPO had become detectable .
In 36 separate tests during the four Tours , no illegal substances were discovered .
In 1999 , however , riders using EPO had no reason to suppose that it would ever be detected .
And even now the retrospective analysis of that year 's tests can not be used as the basis for stripping riders of their prizes , since only the B samples have been tested .
The A samples , which would be used to corroborate the initial findings , no longer exist .
So Armstrong 's lawyers could presumably claim that while evidence may exist , proof does not .
Questions hang in the air , and some of them will probably remain there .
In the light of the lengthy investigation conducted by the Paris police into the possible use of drugs by Armstrong 's US Postal team in 2000 , why did the French authorities wait until December 2004 , more than four years after the test was developed by scientists in the national drug - screening laboratory at Châtenay- Malabry , before examining samples that were already five years old ?
And why has it taken until now for the results to be leaked to L'Equipe ?
Those preparing to confront Armstrong 's legal team in the variety of court proceedings in which the rider is bringing actions for defamation will heartened by yesterday 's news .
For one or two of them it will be like seven Christmasses arriving at once .
Less easy to assess is the effect it will have in the wider world on the reputation of a man whose victory over a virulent form of cancer inspired countless thousands of fellow suffers around the world .
To make a historical analogy is to venture on to treacherous ground .
But it can be said with some confidence that L'Equipe is unlikely to be casting similar aspersions on the achievements of Anquetil , whose five Tours were won on amphetamines and goodness knows what else .
It is almost half a century since Maître Jacques posed the most famous rhetorical question in the history of cycling : "" Do they expect us to ride the Tour on mineral water ? ""
His Legion d'honneur ribbon , and his sacred status , went to the grave with him .
Armstrong might not be so fortunate ."
2005-08-25,"The allegations that Lance Armstrong tested positive six times for erythropoietin en route to victory in the 1999 Tour de France could cost the Texan dear , according to a lawyer acting for the insurers SCA Communications , who are contesting Armstrong 's performance bonuses for five of his seven Tour wins . ""
In the coming weeks and months Mr Armstrong will be fighting not merely to keep or lose his race record , winning or losing $ 5 m [ the bonus for winning his sixth Tour ] , but to keep the image that he has built for himself and which , if it were to be shattered , would ruin him in terms of his reputation and thus economically for the rest of his life , "" said Thibault de Montbrial on the radio station RTL yesterday .
The lawyer told the French sports daily L'Equipe that the allegations it made on Tuesday of the positive tests could prove "" a turning point in the legal argument "" .
Armstrong denied the allegations and described the paper 's investigation as "" tabloid journalism "" and a "" witch hunt "" .
"" I will simply restate what I have said many times : I have never taken performance - enhancing drugs , "" Armstrong said .
The Texan rider has not failed a drugs test during his 14-year career .
L'Equipe published an investigation into tests carried out for scientific purposes in 2004 on urine samples frozen after the 1999 Tour which it said show six positive tests for Armstrong .
Armstrong retired after winning his seventh Tour in July and it is unclear whether he could be stripped of his 1999 win as the tests were not formal anti - doping tests .
SCA began to question Armstrong 's probity after the 2004 Tour after the publication of the unauthorised biography LA Confidential : the Secrets of Lance Armstrong .
They refused to pay his $ 5 m ( £ 2.75 m ) bonus for winning a sixth Tour de France that season and requested access to his medical records .
Armstrong filed suit and the case remains in arbitration .
Armstrong has strongly rejected the reports in L'Equipe but if the allegations were correct this would strengthen SCA 's case , according to De Montbrial , who is also acting for the publishers of LA Confidential , the company La Martinière , in a separate case against Armstrong .
The Tour de France organiser Jean - Marie Leblanc has defended Armstrong 's reputation in the face of previous doping allegations but yesterday he said that the American needed to explain himself . ""
For the first time these are no longer rumours and insinuations .
He owes us explanations , to us [ the Tour organisers ] and all those who follow the Tour . ""
In Leblanc 's view , the revelation that specimens can be analysed some years later with newly developed technology will change the fight against doping , even if it does not alter Armstrong 's Tour record because retrospective sanctions can not be taken against him .
"" It is another weapon , which will mean that no one can cheat with a feeling of impunity .
It means that in two , three or four years , if science progresses , it will be able to tell us that this sportsman or that one have been cheating . ""
The EPO test was first introduced at the Olympic Games in Sydney and has been used since the 2001 Tour de France .
None of the tests have subsequently showed Armstrong as being positive ."
2005-08-26,"The seven - times Tour de France winner Lance Armstrong yesterday said that he may contemplate legal action against the French daily sports newspaper l'Equipe over its allegations that he tested positive six times for the banned blood booster erythropoietin during the 1999 race .
Speaking at the headquarters of his sponsor Discovery Channel in Washington , Armstrong denied the samples had EPO in them . ""
When I gave those samples , there was not EPO in those samples .
I guarantee that . ""
He said that "" [ legal action ] would cost a million and a half dollars and a year of my life .
I have a lot better things to do with the million and a half ; a lot better things I can do with my time .
Ultimately I have to ask myself that question "" .
The Texan added that he had spoken to the Tour de France organiser Jean - Marie Leblanc yesterday and dismissed the Frenchman 's contention that he had "" misled "" the cycling world . ""
To say that I 've fooled the fans is preposterous .
I 've been doing this a long time .
We have seven years of A and B samples .
They 've all been negative . ""
Since the 1999 Tour , when the French paper Le Monde revealed that he had traces of a banned corticosteroid in his urine - for which he was cleared by cycling 's governing body - Armstrong has maintained that he has been victimised by the French press .
Yesterday his team manager Johan Bruyneel called the revelations "" a witch hunt .
We know there are people out there who would do anything to get Lance "" .
Armstrong said : "" At the end of the day , it 's all about selling newspapers .
And it sells . ""
Le Monde , meanwhile , revealed that during the rest day in Pau on this year 's Tour , a six - man undercover team from the French drug squad monitored Armstrong 's team hotel for more than 12 hours .
They were apparently looking for a man who had been spotted entering the team 's hotel during the first rest day at Grenoble , carrying an icebox , but their search seems to have been fruitless ."
2005-08-27,"Lance Armstrong 's vehement defence of his reputation in the face of this week 's doping allegations continued yesterday as he questioned the procedures which appear to indicate he tested positive for the blood booster erythropoietin ( EPO ) six times during the 1999 Tour de France , the first of his record seven victories .
Appearing on the Larry King show on CNN , Armstrong attacked the procedure that led to news of the apparent positive tests being leaked to the newspaper L'Equipe .
The samples were analysed as part of a research programme to refine the current test for EPO , which came into use at the Sydney Olympics in 2000 .
"" No protocol was followed , "" said Armstrong , "" and then you get a phone call from a newspaper that says : ' We found you to be positive six times for EPO . '
Since when did newspapers start governing sports ?
When does a newspaper decide they 're going to govern and sanction athletes ?
That 's not the way it works . ""
Later Armstrong added : "" Who opened the samples ?
What protocol was followed ?
Nothing .
It was all thrown out the door .
We ca n't build trust in an anti - doping fight if we do n't have faith in it . ""
Armstrong repeated his contention that when he delivered the samples during the race , there was no EPO in them , and hinted that they may have been tampered with , saying that now he has retired "" I do n't have to worry any more about giving a urine sample that will be manipulated . ""
However , the head of the Paris anti - doping lab which carried out the analyses , Professor Jacques de Ceaurriz , has stood by his test .
He said : "" We have no doubt about the validity of the results .
EPO is a protein , and it either breaks down over time and becomes undetectable , or it remains as it is . ""
Armstrong did , however , appear to back down from his threats to add legal action against L'Equipe to his cases against The Sunday Times and a French publisher La Martiniere .
He said : "" I 'm taking this a little easier than some allegations because I 'm now retired so I do n't have to worry about going back and dealing with these people . """
2005-09-03,"This year 's Tour de France was , famously , a three - week lap of honour by the one and only Lance Armstrong , super endurance athlete .
Armstrong aficionados will regret the retirement , along with their hero , of the tinted - windowed Subaru Legacy estate bearing a ' Do n't Mess With Texas ' sticker on the back windscreen and known familiarly as Air Force One .
This vehicle was driven on the Tour by Armstrong 's bodyguards , the bullet - headed Belgian cop known as the Muscles from Brussels ( Serge to his friends ) and the mild - mannered , murderous - looking Erwin , a bespectacled martial arts expert once hired by George W Bush .
AF1 's role was to get Armstrong as close as possible to his team bus in the morning and to park as close to the finish podium in the afternoon , so he could be whisked to and from the race with minimum exposure to possible assassins or , heaven forfend , cycling fans .
As The Observer 's cycling correspondent , I spent the Tour in my own version of AF1 , a £ 24,950 Legacy Outback nicknamed Sheila .
The Outback is an all - wheel - drive version of the Legacy , sadly without AF1 's tinted windows but , in our version at least , kitted out with the ultimate Tour de France sunroof .
When you spend up to seven hours a day in a vehicle , usually with two or three other people , fresh air - and relief from foot odour - becomes a thing of obsession .
Our sunroof also enabled us to stand up in the back and enjoy a grandstand view .
Official vehicles on the Tour have vast customised sunroofs , which allow corporate guests to stand and wave glasses of free champagne at the sweating cyclists , and organisers to wave at the crowds of fans playing chicken as the race passes .
On the autoroute , Sheila was surprisingly silent for a four - wheel drive .
For a heavy vehicle , the power steering was light , helped by something called limited slip differential .
Offroad , she was equally handy .
During one traffic jam in the Massif Central , a steep bank into a meadow proved a handy escape route , although we never went as far as one colleague who , in a bid to dodge gridlock in the Alps , went down a series of cross - country ski runs with no apparent ill effects .
There was plenty else to keep the occupants happy : handy drinks - bottle holders , cunning storage spaces and a dashboard which left little to be desired .
But there was a price to pay , in the reduced head and load space to accommodate the extra ground clearance ; the boot , which was hardly cavernous ; and the head - room - adults sitting in the back found themselves looking above the windscreen rather than through it .
In performance terms , loaded and unloaded , the Legacy was a conundrum .
Advance notice had to be given that acceleration might be required , and to achieve it the engine revs had to be kept high .
Even the 2.5-litre version could only manage around 30mpg , making our own Air Force One less a slimline , aggressive Lance Armstrong than the four - wheeled equivalent of his more ponderous but utterly lovable German rival Jan Ullrich . ·
Martin Love returns next week"
2005-09-07,"Lance Armstrong has admitted he 's tempted to come out of retirement to bid for an eighth Tour de France win .
The 33-year - old Texan raised the possibility of a comeback as he announced his engagement to rock star Sheryl Crow yesterday , and a further statement added weight to the suggestions that the seven times Tour winner could well return to the saddle . ""
While I 'm absolutely enjoying my time as a retired athlete with Sheryl and the kids , the recent smear campaign out of France has awoken my competitive side .
I 'm not willing to put a percentage on the chances
but I will no longer rule it out , "" said the Texan .
The story has caught the rest of the Discovery Cycling organisation - most of whom are on the Tour of Spain - on the hop , with Armstrong 's spokesman Mark Higgins insisting the Texan was "" 100 % retired "" .
Discovery sporting director Johan Bruyneel then admitted it was "" not impossible "" that he could make a comeback before the team manager Dan Osipow said : "" If there 's a certain rider from Texas who wants to join the team , we 'll have space . ""
Bruyneel said Armstrong 's return was "" definitely an open possibility , I know he is on the bike . ""
Recent stories in the French media accuse Armstrong of using the blood booster EPO in the first of his victories in 1999.The Discovery Cycling Team Director went on to say , "" I think he 's been very offended .
If you know him , he does n't need a lot to find some motivation .
I think it woke up the competitive side of him . ""
Discovery Cycling appear willing to give Armstrong as much time as he requires to make his decision .
Bruyneel has said the Texan could make his final decision as late as February and expects him to attend winter training : "" He absolutely wants to be part of the training camp in December , and wants to get fit to compete with the guys there , "" he insisted In a further twist Discovery Cycling have admitted they have made little progress in preparing for life after Armstrong .
"" We did n't really look for somebody to replace him , "" Bruyneel said .
"" For one , there is nobody - not a strong leader like he was .
Without him , we have a very good team ... but not the favorites . ""
Armstrong , who turns 34 later this month , won this year 's Tour by a comfortably - 4 minutes , 40 seconds ahead of nearest rival Italian Ivan Basso and 6:21 clear of his oldest adversary Jan Ullrich of Germany .
Bruyneel went as far to say he could fully envisage the Texan winning another Tour : "" The way he won this year ... everything pretty much under control and he never showed any weakness .
He has another Tour in his legs yet . ""
The Amaury Sport Organization , which runs the Tour and owns L'Equipe newspaper , would not comment on the speculation .
"" We will express ourselves only if and when he decides to come out of retirement , "" spokesman Christophe Marchadier said .
"" There is nothing to stop him from coming back on the Tour as a professional cyclist . """
2005-09-16,"Lance Armstrong announced he would not be making a comeback next year after all , while his agent accused Dick Pound , head of the World Anti - Doping Agency , of making "" false and misleading statements "" .
The Texan had considered returning to the saddle in the wake of allegations he had used EPO in winning the first of his record seven Tours de France in 1999 .
However , the 33-year - old has since decided to stay retired as Pound and International Cycling Union president Hein Verbruggen were drawn into a row over the allegations against Armstrong in French newspaper L'Equipe . ""
Sitting here today , dealing with all this stuff again , knowing if I were to go back , there 's no way I could get a fair shake - on the roadside , in doping control , or the labs , "" said Armstrong .
"" I think it 's better that way .
I 'm happy with the way my career went and ended and I 'm not coming back . ""
The announcement was made during a press call , also involving Armstrong 's agent Bill Stapleton and his attorney Mark Levinstein , in response to Pound 's claims that it was Verbruggen who had leaked medical documents identifying the American as the source of positive tests from the 1999 Tour .
L'Equipe claims to have evidence that Armstrong was the source of six positive EPO results uncovered when urine samples from the 1999 Tour were used as part of a research programme designed to improve testing for the banned blood booster .
There has been speculation about which body leaked the information needed to connect the positive results with the source of the samples - the UCI , the French doping authorities or Wada .
Verbruggen has promised an investigation but that drew ridicule from Pound who yesterday claimed he had a letter from the UCI president in which he admitted giving the American 's medical records to l'Equipe reporter Damien Ressiot .
He said : "" It 's quite clear .
Mr Verbruggen told us that he showed all six of Armstrong 's doping control forms to the journalist of L'Equipe and that he gave them a copy of at least one of the forms . ""
Armstrong accused Pound of simply getting his facts wrong , revealing that he approved the release of one of the forms to Ressiot , who wanted to check whether the UCI had granted him any medical exemptions during competition .
"" There have been rumours around the press room for years that I was allowed because of my illness , because of my situation , to use EPO , to use anabolics , "" said Armstrong .
"" I heard that going back to 1999 .
Ressiot came along and said , ' Look , I want to help you guys out , everybody 's talking about this
and I just want to look at one of your forms ' .
"" So we said ' sure ' , but the point being , he looked at one form but they showed six in the newspaper . ""
Stapleton went further , accusing Pound of deliberately creating a smokescreen to obscure what he called a "" breakdown "" in doping procedure .
He insisted the key was not the control forms but the results and codes from the samples . ""
What Mr Pound did today , giving false and misleading statements that try to misdirect and divert the attention away from himself by alleging that the UCI is the source of the leak is wrong , "" said Stapleton .
"" The fact is what Damien Ressiot got are the testing forms that Lance filled out when he took his tests in 1999 .
Those forms have a name and a number , but the issue is that there were codes attached to anonymous samples that were leaked to the press . ""
That is where the system broke down here , and is the fundamental question here in terms of the system and whether we can have confidence in it . """

Those forms have a name and a number , but the issue is that there were codes attached to anonymous samples that were leaked to the press . ""
That is where the system broke down here , and is the fundamental question here in terms of the system and whether we can have confidence in it . """
2005-09-16,"Dick Pound , president of the World Anti Doping Agency , yesterday said allegations that a sample given by Lance Armstrong during his first Tour de France contained performance - enhancing drugs were almost certainly leaked by head of cycling 's international governing body .
Pound said he was in possession of a letter from , Hein Verbruggen , president of the UCI , that left him in no doubt that Verbruggen had provided the critical information to the French newspaper L'Equipe . ""
It is obvious where the information came from , "" said Pound . ""
Mr Verbruggen said to us that he had shown all six documents signed by Mr Armstrong and his team to the journalist , and that he had given that reporter at least one of those files . ""
The story in the sports daily L'Equipe last month claimed that erythropoietin ( EPO ) was found in samples of Armstrong 's urine taken in 1999 , the year of his first Tour victory , after linking the numbered - but - anonymous samples to him .
Armstrong has denied ever taking performance - enhancing drugs . ""
When I gave those samples , there was not EPO in those samples .
I guarantee that , "" he said .
Armstrong announced his retirement after winning this year 's Tour de France .
Pound , who has regularly crossed swords with the seven - times Tour de France winner over doping issues in cycling and Wada 's role , has studied the results from the Paris laboratory from which was leaked the information on the 1999 samples and believes there is evidence of doping .
Wada , however , has no jurisdiction in the case because it happened before its foundation in November 1999 but Pound said it was happy to help the UCI in its investigation .
There has been criticism of the UCI , namely by Sylvia Schenk , the former president of the German cycling federation , that it has been more interested in finding out who leaked the information than investigating whether Armstrong had taken banned drugs .
Pound said that if plugging leaks was the UCI 's only concern then Wada had "" no interest "" in being involved in any investigation . ""
Our suggestion to him [ Verbruggen ] has been : ' why are you looking further than UCI for disclosure ? ' "" said Pound .
Verbruggen was not available for comment yesterday .
L'Equipe alleged Armstrong had tested positive six times for EPO in the 1999 race .
At the time an effective test for EPO had not been formulated and testing on the samples from 1999 , and those of 1998 , for the purposes of research , began only in 2004 .
The alleged positive results pertaining to Armstrong came from the re - testing of the B - samples since the original A - samples had been destroyed at the time of the test .
Armstrong has denied the claims and a UCI statement earlier this month said they would not take any action against the Texan .
Pound 's comments came on the same day that Schenk , Verbruggen 's fiercest critic , claimed Armstrong was receiving special treatment from the UCI . ""
Since 1998 the UCI has done a lot to combat doping but everything is different where Armstrong is concerned , "" said Schenk .
Schenk is also concerned that Armstrong made a personal donation to the UCI to help fight doping .
The gift coincided with the publication of the controversial book LA Confidential by the Sunday Times journalist David Walsh that linked Armstrong with using performance enhancing drugs without uncovering conclusive evidence .
"" There is obviously a strong relationship with Armstrong , "" Schenk said .
Armstrong retired in June and is embarking on a number of court cases , included bringing a case against the Sunday Times and the French publishers of Walsh 's book ."
2005-09-20,"Fresh scientific doubts about the effectiveness of the test for erythropoietin ( EPO ) may impact on high - profile cases such as Lance Armstrong 's .
Allegations that the American used banned performance - enhancing drugs during the first of his seven consecutive victories in the Tour de France in 1999 have thrust EPO back into the headlines .
When a test to detect it was developed in 2000 it was hailed as a breakthrough in the fight against doping , after the drug came to prominence in 1998 when it nearly wrecked the Tour de France .
But now the cases of Armstrong and three triathletes , who have had bans lifted or who avoided punishment after testing positive for EPO , have caused some experts to question the test 's reliability .
Moreover the Olympic 1500 metres silver medallist Bernard Lagat is threatening to sue the International Association of Athletics Federations for $ 500,000 ( £ 277,000 ) after he was alleged to have tested positive for EPO in 2003 .
He was cleared when a second urine sample tested negative .
The blood - boosting substance , originally developed to treat kidney patients , has earned a reputation as a wonder drug which increases endurance , and its widespread use has affected the credibility of sports such as cycling and distance running .
Dick Pound , the chairman of the World Anti - Doping Agency , has insisted the test , originally developed in France , is as close to reliable as is possible but the case of the Belgian triathlete Rutger Beke gives rise to doubt .
He was banned for 18 months after testing positive for EPO but his suspension was lifted last month when researchers at the Catholic University in Leuven , Belgium , said he had been found to "" naturally excrete proteins that would yield a positive test "" .
During the research several athletes gave false positives for EPO after strenuous exercise . ""
EPO is a protein , "" Beke said .
"" Everybody has it in their body .
The main problem is when I do high physical activity , especially anaerobic , I produce a lot of proteins .
The problem is that with everybody else there is a filter in the kidneys that stops your proteins from ending up in your urine .
When I do anaerobic exercise the filter does n't work properly and all these proteins end up in my urine . ""
Now the big problem is that the anti - doping agencies do n't see that the EPO proteins I produce are the same as synthetic .
So I had to prove that mine are natural .
Unfortunately it took 10 months . ""
Then last week the Spanish triathletes Virginia Berasategui Luna and Iban Rodríguez Martínez were also cleared because of doubts about how EPO came to be in their bodies .
"" We are not concerned about the viability of the test - the test is quite reliable , "" said Pound .
"" What we have to follow is whether there are exercise - induced circumstances that might occur . ""
Wada is now advising all its accredited laboratories to check with scientists in Paris or Lausanne , where the EPO test was largely developed , when there is any doubt about a positive test .
The problem may not be with the test but those analysing the results .
"" I knew nothing about it before but now I 'm a big expert , "" said Beke .
"" The EPO tests are little bars .
The bars for synthetic protein and my natural protein - the same protein that shows up in everyone 's body - show up in the same size and same place .
The bars for natural EPO are in another place in these tests - except my proteins are in the same place as synthetics .
"" They do n't see the difference .
They look at the test and see and say , ' Oh , it 's EPO . '
But the problem is the test is one - dimensional . ""
The director from the Flemish doping lab for nine months has been saying , ' It 's impossible to have an exception , the test is 100 % sure . '
Now , three weeks ago , he wrote a letter to the Flemish commission to say they 're not so sure any more .
They say it is possible to have a phenomenon , that they are looking into new testing and will have results at the end of September . ""
Lagat commissioned his own research in 2003 after the allegation that he had tested positive for EPO .
Dr Hans Heid of the German Cancer Research Centre in Heidelberg criticised the basis on which the test had been constructed , particularly the lack of consideration given to possible influences of different nutritional , ethnic or physiological backgrounds .
Dr Martial Saugy , head of the Wada - accredited laboratory in Lausanne , agrees that , unlike most banned drugs , it is not simply a matter of looking at what is in the sample and declaring whether an athlete is guilty .
"" You are looking at numbers and signals but in the end what is most important here is the experience of the eyes of an expert , "" he said .
"" It 's the ' now we see it - this looks like someone who has injected EPO ' . ""
Though publicly backing the EPO test , Wada is also funding research to develop a more clear - cut method of detection .
"" This is not like a pregnancy test , where you are either pregnant or you 're not , "" said Nicolle Packer , an executive vice president at Proteome Systems in Sydney , which has received one of the research grants .
"" It has to be prepared carefully and interpreted by an expert , who can mostly call it , I believe .
But it is definitely skill - based , and that is why Wada is looking for a more clear - cut test . ""
Until that is developed , it seems premature to condemn Armstrong and others as cheats .
The negative positives Bernard Lagat ( middle - distance runner )
Kenya 's Olympic 1500 m silver medallist is threatening to sue the IAAF for suspending him briefly in 2003 after an EPO test ; he was cleared when the B sample proved negative .
Commissioned his own scientific research which questioned the credibility of the current EPO test .
Virginia Berasategui Luna ( triathlete )
The Spaniard tested positive for EPO after winning the Lanzarote Ironman in May.
She angrily denied EPO use and claimed there were a number of procedural errors in how the test was administered .
Last week it was announced that no further action would be taken against her or Iban Rodríguez Martínez , another Spanish triathlete who allegedly tested positive for EPO in the same event .
Rutger Beke ( triathlete )
The Belgian , who finished second in the 2003 Hawaii Ironman , was banned last year for 18 months after a positive test .
After seeking help from the Catholic University in Leuven , Belgium , he proved that his body was capable of producing EPO naturally , so leading to a false positive ."
2005-09-21,"After simmering for several months the conflict between the International Cycling Union and the World Anti - Doping Agency boiled over yesterday when the governing body accused Wada 's chairman Dick Pound of "" obstructing and delaying "" their investigation into drugs allegations involving the seven - times Tour de France winner Lance Armstrong .
"" It has been three weeks since we initiated the investigation at Wada 's request and Wada has failed , to date , to provide all the documents and information we have requested , which we need to conduct the investigation , even though Wada has stated its willingness to assist the UCI , "" the governing body said in a statement issued late on Monday night .
In another dig at Pound , the UCI also called for the anti - doping body to "" assign responsibility for complete co - operation by Wada with the UCI investigation to an individual who will honour Wada 's obligations of ethical behaviour and transparency "" .
Pound was at a Wada executive committee meeting yesterday and was unavailable for comment .
The dispute centres on bar codes on urine samples provided by Armstrong during the 1999 Tour de France .
The codes were leaked to the French daily L'Equipe , who matched them to tests made on urine samples from the race last year , and alleged that Armstrong had tested positive six times for the blood - booster erythropoietin .
Armstrong denied the allegation and described the paper 's investigation as "" a witch hunt "" .
Last week Pound claimed the leak must have come from within the UCI , and possibly from its president Hein Verbruggen .
The claim has clearly enraged the cycling body , if the length and vehemence of its response is anything to go by . ""
Mr Pound 's transparently erroneous statements about the UCI being the source of the forms are difficult to explain , except that they appear to be an attempt by Mr Pound to draw attention away from his efforts to obstruct and delay the UCI investigation , "" said the UCI statement .
"" Mr Verbruggen has never been involved personally , contrary to what Mr Pound said in another statement .
However , it is also apparent that reporters were given at least five and perhaps 15 of Lance Armstrong 's doping - control forms from the 1999 Tour de France , and it is certain those forms did not come from the UCI .
"" It was just the latest twist in a war of words over the investigation , which Pound has already said he fears may merely be intended to investigate how the Armstrong information was leaked to the press . ""
We 're waiting to see whether they have a commitment to get at the truth and the whole truth before we decide to participate further in the investigation , "" Pound said at the time .
"" If one of the issues that the UCI wants to explore is how some of this information became public , that 's fine .
But we 're not prepared to sit by and participate in an investigation that focuses only on how the information became public . ""
The bad blood between the Wada chairman and Verbruggen and Armstrong began when cycling delayed signing up to the Wada code until shortly before the Sydney Olympics .
In 2003 , the UCI was incensed when a report by Wada observers on the 2003 Tour de France was leaked and in 2002 Verbruggen accused Pound of acting like "" a sheriff in the Wild West , shooting at every target "" .
Armstrong , meanwhile , called for Pound 's resignation in March 2004 , in an open letter responding to the Wada chairman 's assertion that eliminating the doping problem in cycling was far from easy .
The cyclist stated that Pound seemed to believe that negative test results did not mean drugs were not being used and added : "" Should such a person be heading the most important anti - doping agency in the world ?
I say no . """
2005-09-22,"Politics have dominated proceedings this week at the world championships in Madrid .
The governing body , the International Cycling Union , has gone to war on two fronts : with the World Anti - Doping Agency over Lance Armstrong 's drug tests , and with the Spanish cycling federation , which is hosting this week 's racing .
The latter dispute , over tomorrow 's ICU presidency elections , culminated in a mass walkout by the sport 's top brass , who decamped on Monday to deliberate in Geneva rather than the Spanish capital in protest at a legal challenge by the Spanish - which was lost yesterday - against the current president Hein Verbruggen .
Politics are also on the mind of Britain 's best hope for a medal , Bradley Wiggins .
Last year 's triple medallist on the track in Athens will go for a medal in the road time - trial over a 27-mile course this afternoon , hoping to emulate his former mentor Chris Boardman , who won the inaugural time - trial championship in 1994 .
But the wheeling and dealing worrying Wiggins has nothing to do with the battle of the blazers .
The 25-year - old needs to find a new professional team to support him in attempting to win the prologue time - trial in the Tour de France and defend his Olympic track pursuit title in Beijing in 2008 .
Negotiations are under way with several squads , but a medal today would be the perfect carrot for a potential new backer .
Fortunately , Wiggins just happens to be in the form of his life .
Ten days ago he took the first road - race victory of his four - year professional career , winning the toughest mountain stage in the Tour de l'Avenir , the "" Tour de France of the future "" for riders aged 25 and under .
"" I 'm confident .
It 's been my goal for the last few months and I ca n't get more fit than I am now .
Tests have shown that I 'm as good now as David Millar was in 2003 when he won it . ""
Millar won the title that year but was stripped of the honour in 2004 after confessing that he had used banned substances in the build - up , and the drugs issue has worried Wiggins this year as it has since he began riding the road as a professional .
The lanky Londoner leaves no one in doubt that he is clean , but he is still coming to terms with the fact that some of his opponents may not be .
"" It has frustrated me this year .
You do n't see the result for the same effort as you do on the track .
There have been a lot of questions in my mind about what people are up to , but then I begin to think , am I using it as an excuse ?
It 's always going to be there . ""
Having achieved his initial goal of an Olympic track gold medal , this year his aim was to transfer his talents to road racing but by the middle of the season he was contemplating a return to the track . ""
After the Giro d'Italia [ in June ] I had a bit of doubt about whether I wanted to continue with the road malarky , but we decided I had to pick something and hit it with as much effort as I made for the track in Athens . ""
Selecting today 's race as his sole purpose for the past four months has suited Wiggins , who felt at odds earlier in the season with the approach chosen by his French professional team , Crédit Agricole . ""
Physically I 've coped well but mentally I ca n't deal with getting up for the win week after week .
"" I 've always targeted two or three things and hit them full - on .
They did n't feel they had the time to let a rider prepare for something like the prologue time - trial in the Tour de France .
But now I 've picked my goals and the results have come .
And now it 's important to find a team who will have confidence in me and let me build a programme for the Tour prologue in Strasbourg next year . ""
Today 's race , on a rolling course with two little hills , will prove to potential backers whether Wiggins has the ability to target major goals on the road , and that in turn will dictate the colours he wears as he builds up to the next Olympics .
"" I need to stay professional if I want to win in Beijing .
I need this level of competition to get the fitness . ""
Also at the back of his mind is the imminent decision on whether the Tour will visit his home town in 2007 .
"" If I can do two more things in my career , the Tour de France prologue time - trial in London and the Olympic pursuit title in London would mean I would be made for the rest of my life as a sportsman . """
2005-09-30,"Pat McQuaid , the new president of world cycling 's governing body , yesterday joined calls for an independent investigation into the controversy over the alleged discovery of the banned blood - booster erythropoietin in urine samples provided by the seven - times Tour de France winner Lance Armstrong during the 1999 race .
The head of the International Olympic Committee , Jacques Rogge , recently said he was "" in favour of a thoroughly independent investigation , accepted by all parties "" , and yesterday the head of the World Anti - Doping Agency , Dick Pound , agreed that such an investigation should be "" entirely at arm 's length from the federation [ Union Cycliste International ] "" .
Yesterday McQuaid , who was elected on Friday , said : "" We have no problem with a independent investigation .
That would be our view as well : someone outside the UCI . ""
Asked about the time scale of such an inquiry , McQuaid said it should happen "" as soon as possible "" .
The UCI launched its own investigation shortly after the French newspaper L'Equipe revealed that tests carried out in 2004 on the urine samples taken on the 1999 Tour had apparently shown 12 positives for EPO , of which six were on Armstrong 's samples .
Armstrong denies any use of EPO during that Tour , and he has strenuously denied use of performance - enhancing drugs throughout his career , which ended after he won his seventh successive Tour in July .
The new UCI president also denied that a gift from Armstrong to the UCI 's anti - doping programme this year , well before L'Equipe made its allegations , had resulted in any potential conflict of interest with an investigation by the governing body .
He did , however , accept it might been perceived that such a conflict did exist .
"" I am aware that there is a danger of that perception being there , "" he said .
McQuaid confirmed reports , published by a French newspaper in June , that Armstrong had donated a sophisticated blood centrifuge to the UCI .
"" I think that report is correct .
I do n't know what the state of play is , whether he has promised to contribute [ it ] , "" McQuaid added .
"" I do n't think there is any connection with it [ the investigation ] .
If someone has provided assistance in the fight against doping , that does n't prejudice the independence of the UCI in the anti - doping fight .
Certain people might perceive it as [ a conflict of interest ] , but intelligent people would n't . ""
Pound , however , sees the situation differently .
"" I think there is a legitimate reason for someone in your position [ the Guardian ] to say that if there is not an actual conflict of interest , there may be an apparent conflict of interest . "" Since L'Equipe published the allegations , the UCI and Pound have been engaged in a war of words over the terms of the investigation .
The Wada head repeated yesterday what he said when the UCI first announced it would inquire into the allegations : "" I have said we are not prepared to participate in an investigation which only looks into one thing : how this embarrassing information happened to find its way to the public . ""
I think the investigation should include the substance of the matter -whether or not the test is correct and whether or not the link with certain athletes is correct .
The UCI have not expressed the slightest interest in the substance : was it or was it not a positive test , was it or was it not Armstrong ? ""
McQuaid also reiterated his body 's position yesterday : that any inquiry should be into the procedure by which the alleged test results were made public rather than if there were positive tests and who they did or did not involve , because the results can not be declared a positive test for anti - doping purposes as there is no "" control "" sample that can be tested .
"" If we expect athletes to follow ethical lines we all have to do the same , "" he said .
"" In this case the protocols were not followed so we can not look at sanctions . """
2005-10-13,"Who says the Swedes have no sense of humour ?
This week Sven - Goran Eriksson allowed it to be known that he intends , against the general assumption , to see out his contract with the Football Association , which ends - thanks to the generosity of Mark Palios - in 2008 , after the payment of a further £ 9 m plus win bonuses ( if any ) .
As a joke at the expense of an entire nation , this ranked with Lance Armstrong 's teasing remark , after L'Equipe recently published allegations concerning positive tests for erythropoietin in the 1999 Tour de France , that he intended to come out of retirement and compete in next year 's Tour , "" just to piss the French off "" .
At least Eriksson would irritate only the 49 % of the English who believe , according to last week 's Guardian poll , that he should be dismissed .
Eriksson also said that , as far as he was concerned , unsatisfactory results would provide the only pretext for resignation .
What else would his critics expect him to say ?
Like any employee he is required to abide by the terms of his contract and entitled to anticipate that his employers will respect them in turn , even if it were to cost them that £ 9 m .
It is impossible to say whether Sepp Blatter , the president of Fifa , had Eriksson in mind this week when he accused the game he governs of indulging the appetites of the rich at the expense of nourishing the game 's roots .
But England 's head coach could at least mount a defence based on getting his team to the final stages of three major tournaments in a row , and of securing qualification for next summer 's finals with last night 's game still to go , the first time this has happened to England for 20 years .
A victory over Poland allowed England to preserve their perfect home record in Group Six , with five wins out of five to put against three wins , one draw and a solitary defeat away .
Eriksson 's familiar promise that his team would play "" better football "" was largely fulfilled in the opening 45 minutes last night , although the equaliser , a few seconds before the interval , came as a useful reality check .
Until then England had been intent on demonstrating their ability to attack in numbers against a team they considered to be their inferiors .
It was odd to hear Michael Owen , one of the more mature members of the party , slighting last night 's opponents by implication when he suggested during the build - up that England are at their best against "" proper teams "" such as Brazil , Argentina , Germany and France .
So Poland , Austria , Wales and Northern Ireland are not "" proper teams "" ?
Of course they are and any suggestion to the contrary merely confirms the impression of the unreal world in which England 's young footballers exist .
Has Owen never heard of Lato , Gadocha and Boniek , of Austria 's Wunderteam , of John Charles or George Best ?
Even Azerbaijan , the weakest members of Group Six , were beaten in Baku only by a solitary Owen goal .
True , it was a bitterly cold and wet night , the sort of occasion on which , according to Owen , England find it difficult to perform .
But it was cold and wet for the Azeri footballers , too .
So the volley with which Tomasz Frankowski found the net in first - half stoppage time last night represented a blow for all those who do not fall within Owen 's definition of "" proper teams "" .
Poland approached the fixture , in which pride alone was at stake , as though pride were something for which it was worth giving everything , as Poles have often done before , on the football field and elsewhere .
This was , then , a perfect test for England and for Eriksson .
It was not a friendly match in which he could switch off the first - choice team at the interval and use the second half to mess around with substitutes .
The head coach had to treat it as a full game in which his team would be required to win the second half by playing better than they had in the first - something that Eriksson 's teams almost never do .
Largely this seems to be through his inability to make tactical changes and personnel in anything other than a defensive mode .
If the attacking side of the team is not producing , a clever solution is unlikely to be forthcoming from the brains trust .
In the extreme , of course , such a requirement sometimes defeats even the finest minds in the game , as those who saw Jose Mourinho throwing the giant defender Robert Huth on at centre - forward against Liverpool in the Champions League last spring will attest .
And so , with 25 minutes to go , Eriksson replaced the tiny Shaun Wright - Phillips with the beanpole Peter Crouch , a decision greeted by the most mixed reception imaginable .
First England 's supporters booed the decision to remove the little Chelsea winger .
Then , as he left the field , they gave him a standing ovation .
Finally , as Crouch crossed the touchline , he was received by a chorus of jeers , probably from those who had read that the Liverpool forward was jeered on his previous appearance and imagined it was the correct thing to do .
But Poland , urged on by thousands of travelling fans , were still giving almost as good as they were getting when , at the end of a slick counterattack , Owen crossed for Frank Lampard to restore the lead .
Eriksson 's players deserved their win , and criticism of the coach will now be muted as a result .
But there were two proper teams out there last night and England had better not forget it ."
2005-10-28,"In a move likely to infuriate the Union Cycliste Internationale , the sport 's governing body , the Tour de France organisers yesterday called on the World Anti - Doping Agency to carry out more unannounced tests on the top riders at their training camps before next year 's event .
At yesterday 's presentation of the 2006 race route in Paris , Jean - Marie Leblanc , the organiser since 1989 , said cycling 's authorities appeared unable to resolve the doping problem within the sport completely .
This summer allegations were made that the blood - booster erythropoietin had been found in urine samples supplied by the seven - times Tour winner Lance Armstrong during the 1999 race . ""
As organisers , all we can do is provide sports bodies with the means necessary to carry out tests .
But we do have the capacity to act as a warning system , "" said Leblanc.""Because the federations are not managing to completely cut out this canker
, we are appealing to the supreme authority , the World Anti - Doping Agency . """
2005-11-09,"The four - times Tour of Spain winner Roberto Heras , a former right - hand man to Lance Armstrong , yesterday denied reports that he had tested positive for the banned blood - booster erythropoietin en route to his record - breaking overall victory in the last edition of the Vuelta in September .
"" I am convinced this is a mistake , because I never took anything , "" he said yesterday .
The Spanish rider , who was with Armstrong 's US Postal Service team from 2001 - 2003 , was provisionally suspended by his team 's management company , Active Bay , on October 27 when it was officially informed that EPO had been found in the A sample he provided after finishing a close second in the race 's final time - trial .
The result of his B sample test is expected on November 21 . ""
To respect the presumption of innocence and to wait for the result of the obligatory counter analysis , the council of the society [ the management company ] took the decision not to publicise the facts until its confirmation , "" a team statement said yesterday .
Referring to the B test , Heras said : "" My lawyers and the team are working on the case .
I do n't want to start speculating about whether the samples could have been mixed up , but when they open the samples for the second test we want to be there . ""
Heras 's team , sponsored by the insurance company Liberty Seguros , have been in the drugs spotlight since the late spring , when two of their riders , Isidro Nozal and Nuno Ribeiro , failed spot blood - checks intended to discover possible manipulation of oxygen - carrying red cells and the squad dismissed their doctor .
If Heras 's positive test is confirmed the runner - up , Russia 's Denis Menchov , will be awarded the 2005 overall victory , Heras is likely to face the ending of his career because the major teams have agreed not to hire riders testing positive after the start of 2005 , and the Vuelta will suffer a potentially fatal blow to its credibility .
The 31-year - old Heras is the second rider from this year 's Vuelta to fail a drugs test , with the 2002 winner Aitor González being officially notified that he tested positive for the anabolic steroids metandriol and metiltestosterone , two recovery and muscle - growth agents that are on cycling 's banned list .
González strenuously denies taking any banned substance .
Last year 's race was also badly hit , with positive tests for blood transfusions for Tyler Hamilton and Santiago Pérez which are still being contested .
Of the three major tours - the others are France and Italy - the Spanish tour has struggled to draw star riders and big crowds in the 10 years since its move to a September slot .
The race will only suffer further if the country 's biggest winner since the retirement of Miguel Induráin is found to have feet of clay .
Heras 's alleged positive test is a third body blow for cycling in the past few months , which have also seen allegations in the French newspaper L'Equipe that Armstrong tested positive for EPO during his first Tour win , in 1999 , a claim the rider denies , and a report from the Belgian police that the top one - day racer of the 1990s , Johan Museeuw , used EPO and another blood - booster , Aranesp .
He too denied the charges ."
2005-11-12,"A year - long legal dispute between the seven - times Tour de France winner Lance Armstrong and his former personal assistant Mike Anderson has been settled out of court following mediation and on terms which remain undisclosed .
A brief press statement said : "" Lance and Mike have wished each other the best of luck in the future . ""
A court last week threw out one of Anderson 's claims , that Armstrong owed him $ 300,000 ( £ 172,400 ) to set up a bike shop , which left one charge , of defamation .
Armstrong has also recently won a case against an internet sales company which registered three domains in the name of the Texan 's Livestrong charity bracelets ."
2005-11-26,"The quadruple Tour of Spain winner Roberto Heras , a former lieutenant to Lance Armstrong , faces the end of his career after the analysis of a B sample he provided on his way to this year 's victory confirmed that he tested positive for the red blood cell - booster erythropoietin . ""
The test is positive , "" said a spokesman for Heras 's team , Liberty Seguros .
"" The process is not yet over as the rider has presented allegations over the procedure . ""
The rider has denied any doping .
Heras , who is 31 , has already been suspended by the team and is likely to receive a two - year ban .
The Tour of Spain title will be awarded to the second - placed rider , the Russian Denis Menchov .
It is a body blow for Spanish cycling .
Heras is the first winner of one of the big three Tours - France , Italy and Spain - to test positive since Ángel Arroyo was disqualified from victory in 1983 Vuelta .
The future of his sponsor , Liberty Seguros , is also in jeopardy with their American parent company reported to be considering pulling out .
The result was due to be announced late on Wednesday but the Madrid laboratory carrying out the analysis of his urine sample requested a 48-hour delay for further tests .
Heras and his lawyers then called for the process to be halted on the grounds that the test , made after the penultimate stage of the race , was not reliable ."

He said this weekend that next July he would be "" in France but not at the Tour "" after what he described as "" a witch - hunt "" by the race organisers and French media over doping allegations . ""
The race organisers can sleep peacefully : they wo n't have to look at Armstrong eye to eye , "" the seven - times winner told Belgium 's Het Nieuwsblad in his first interview with a European publication since the allegation in August that he had tested positive seven times for the blood - booster erythropoietin during the first of his Tour wins , in 1999 .
Armstrong , a cancer survivor , reiterated that he would not take legal action against the newspaper L'Equipe , which published official documents showing the results of tests on urine samples from the 1999 Tour , nor against the French anti - doping laboratory that conducted the tests .
"" It 's their biggest dream , that I take action .
Sorry , guys .
The newspaper has no proof .
It 's a publicity coup and a witch - hunt . ""
Asked whether he had indeed used EPO in the 1999 Tour , as the drug test results obtained by L'Equipe indicate , he replied : "" In 2001 the EPO test was there but I went even quicker .
If this whole thing is true , why have they not taken my 1999 success away from me ?
"" The question is purely rhetorical : because the tests were carried out for research and there is no B sample , no sanctions can be taken .
The Texan has maintained that he is the victim of a French campaign to denigrate his record - breaking achievements .
At the presentation of the 2006 Tour in October the organisers barely mentioned him in their round - up of this year 's race , and the man who runs the Tour , Jean - Marie Leblanc , has backed L'Equipe . ""
Jean - Marie Leblanc never misses a chance to criticise [ me ] .
The Tour is angry [ with me ] because its history has been rewritten by an American , "" alleged Armstrong . ""
Bernard Hinault [ a five - times winner ] would not have had the same problems as me because he is French . """
2005-12-23,"Investigations into doping allegations against the seven - times Tour de France winner Lance Armstrong will continue into the new year .
"" It 's not going to go away , "" said Dick Pound , president of the World Anti - Doping Agency .
"" We 're dealing with all the spins out there right now but behind scenes there are investigations quietly proceeding . ""
After Armstrong 's seventh Tour victory in July the French newspaper L'Equipe published a story alleging that the American had taken the banned blood booster erythropoietin ( EPO ) in 1999 .
Armstrong , 34 , who retired after the race , has denied ever taking performance - enhancing drugs ."
2006-01-17,"Lance Armstrong enjoyed another legal success when a Paris court threw out a libel suit brought against the seven - times Tour de France winner by the Italian cyclist Filippo Simeoni .
The Italian was a key witness in the drug trial of Armstrong 's former trainer Michele Ferrari , who in 2004 was given a 12-month suspended jail sentence for malpractice not involving Armstrong , and he filed for defamation after Armstrong allegedly called him "" an absolute liar "" in Le Monde .
Outstanding cases involving the Texan involve win bonuses withheld by an insurance company , SCA , as well as libel suits against a French book publisher and the Sunday Times ."
2006-01-20,"The Sunday Times ' award - winning chief sports writer David Walsh - author of a controversial book about Lance Armstrong - is leaving the paper after almost a decade to concentrate on writing more books .
Walsh , three - times British sports writer of the year , has several book deals lined up including one on the champion jockey Kieron Fallon .
He has worked for the Sunday Times ' sports desk since 1996 , and been chief sports writer for the past three years . ""
David has , in my opinion , been one of the most outstanding sports journalists of the past decade .
Few other journalists can write so authoritatively on such a range of sports , "" said the paper 's sports editor , Alex Butler .
"" He 's played a big part in building the reputation of the paper for quality sports writing and he 'll be greatly missed .
"" Walsh has already written books on the Tour de France , including La Confidential , a controversial investigation into the life of Lance Armstrong .
The seven - times Tour de France winner is taking legal action against Walsh and his co - author , French journalist Pierre Ballester , over allegations that he may have taken performance - enhancing drugs .
Armstrong , who has always denied taking drugs , is also suing the Sunday Times for libel over a review of the book . ·

2006-01-27,"After a 3½-year legal saga the affair of the cyclist , his wife , his mother - in - law and a car boot full of drugs was brought to an close yesterday when Raimondas Rumsas , the Lithuanian who was third in the 2002 Tour de France , and his wife Edita were given suspended four - month prison sentences and fined € 6,260 ( £ 4,290 ) for importing illegal medicines .
A court in the Savoy town of Bonneville also handed down a 12-month suspended sentence to a Polish doctor , Krzysztof Ficek , for supplying some of the arsenal of 37 different medicines ranging from homeopathic remedies to banned substances found in Edita Rumsas 's car .
The Rumsas scandal began when Edita was stopped by a customs patrol near the Mont Blanc tunnel on July 28 2002 , the day her husband finished a surprise third in the Tour behind Lance Armstrong .
As well as a hoard of drugs , the gendarmes found empty syringes with traces of the blood - booster erythropoietin and a centrifuge of the type used to measure blood thickness , as well as human albumin , which can be used to dilute the blood to circumvent random tests .
Though Edita Rumsas never clearly explained what the drugs were for , in spite of being held by French police for 75 days , her husband claimed they were destined for his mother - in - law , Yakstenia .
His protestations of innocence were given a different perspective when he tested positive for erythropoietin in the 2003 Tour of Italy and was banned for 12 months .
The Rumsas affair raised serious questions about the efficacy of the anti- doping tests used in cycling because he had been tested twice during the Tour and been negative .
Though blood doping was never proved , he underwent a blood test late in the race which showed that his blood had thickened slightly during the Tour , which can be caused by dehydration but can also be caused by the injection of EPO or the use of blood transfusions .
"" Rumsas 's third place in the Tour has been seriously tainted , "" said Paul Mauriac , a lawyer acting for the French cycling federation , which was awarded a small damages payment .
The FFC yesterday requested disciplinary action against Rumsas , who is nevertheless unlikely to lose his Tour third place ."

2006-02-06,"Lance Armstrong and Sheryl Crow have ended their relationship . ""
After much thought and consideration we have made a very tough decision to split up .
We both have a deep love and respect for each other and we ask that everyone respect our privacy during this very difficult time , "" the statement said .
The seven - times Tour de France champion and the rock star announced their engagement last September .
Armstrong , 34 , and the 43-year - old Crow met in October 2003 and began dating shortly after , becoming one of the most talked about couples in the United States ."
2006-02-12,"Valentine 's Day may be around the corner , but that has n't stopped a harvest of celebrity hearts being broken .
Lance Armstrong , the US super - cyclist , for instance , has split up with singer Sheryl Crow , only months before their wedding .
He said she was ' one of the smartest , wisest , most gifted people I 've ever met ' - but , somehow , it still was n't quite enough .
Actress Heather Locklear is to divorce the Bon Jovi guitarist Richie Sambora after 11 years of marriage , owing to ' irreconcilable differences ' , while Madonna and Guy Ritchie 's relationship is allegedly also in difficulties .
And then , of course , there is the big one - or at least the one that has been most commented on : actor Ralph Fiennes has been shown the door by his partner of 11 years , Francesca Annis .
Cue lots of chat about infidelity and forgiveness .
( By the way , 11 is the year of living dangerously when it comes to divorce and separation . )
It was reported that the split came after Fiennes , 43 , had an affair with 31-year - old Cornelia Crisan , a Romanian singer described in time - honoured fashion as a ' stunner ' and half Annis 's age .
The media 's instant diagnosis of the Fiennes - Annis separation carried a warning to all ' uppity ' women everywhere : Annis might be sexy , successful and smart , but what all men really want is a 20-year - old beauty whose passions are cooking , cosseting and copulation .
As an analysis of what contributes to the success of a long - term relationship in the 21st century , this is the equivalent of a couple of very small pieces in an increasingly complex jigsaw puzzle .
What 's perhaps more relevant to those both in and out of the spotlight who are going through their own relationship tribulations is to consider whether it is possible to rebuild a relationship after infidelity .
Is it worth the effort ?
And how ' irreconcilable ' are today 's ' modern matrimonial difficulties ' ?
Eighteen months ago , I placed an advertisement in two newspapers .
It read : ' Marriage under stress ?
Writer seeks a couple for a book .
Married five years or more with children willing to discuss relationship on a regular basis and have access to expert advice - to see if relationship can be improved over a 12-month period .
Anonymity is possible . '
Those who replied included a couple called Ingrid and Tom .
Adultery was n't a problem , but they did have numerous and varied ' differences ' that sparked constant arguments and animosity .
They agreed to let me into their lives for a year , as a last chance to save the marriage .
I interviewed them every month , then discussed what they told me with Gillian Walton , a counsellor , and Penny Mansfield , a sociologist and director of One Plus One , an independent body that researches relationships .
The aim was to try to take an almost forensic look at what was really happening in Tom and Ingrid 's marriage .
It turned into a kind of matrimonial detective story , calling in ' evidence ' from the latest research that , hopefully , has relevance to any couple concerned that the ' chemistry ' they once shared is increasingly toxic .
What unfolded over the year is revealed in a book published in April .
One element that emerged from the outset is that , in the business of successfully staying together , love is never enough .
Tom and Ingrid were from very different backgrounds .
Tom , who is English , was 35 and came from a traditional family background ; his parents have been married for more than 40 years .
Tom 's father was the bread - winner , his mother the home - maker .
Ingrid , who is Scandinavian , was brought up by her mother , a single parent , with much input from her aunt and grandmother .
Tom 's family were working - class ; Ingrid 's middle - class .
From there they built a marriage .
Tom saw his role in traditional terms , working hard , putting food on the table .
Ingrid wanted more emotional engagement , not a traditional lifestyle .
They made it through , but it was n't always easy .
Forty years ago , people were much more likely to marry the boy or girl next door , come from the same backgrounds and stay in the same geographical area .
Now we meet a far wider range of people , and marry or live with people with very different histories .
That puts relationship under new pressures .
Tom and Ingrid experienced all of that .
The ideal of a monogamous , contented , long - term union is still the goal of many .
When the American writer Joan Didion wrote The Year of Magical Thinking , a moving articulation of her grief at the death of her husband , John Gregory Dunne , she found to her surprise that her book tours attracted thirtysomethings less concerned with her loss and more interested in how she and Dunne had made a success of a 40-year relationship . '
They seem to be reading [ the book ] as a marriage manual , ' she said .
Today we have a mania for personal growth and self - examination , yet when it comes to living in relative harmony with another human , many of us have little idea how to make a relationship flourish .
It 's what US clinical psychologist Michael Vincent Miller calls ' the contemporary crisis in intimacy ' .
Many of us still do n't know to deal with sex and power and vulnerability , let alone the practicalities of who does what , when and why once we live as a couple , whether heterosexual or homosexual .
Instead , ' love ' often becomes a set of battle moves embracing mind games and domestic guerrilla warfare .
Generations have been reared on the TV soaps ' depiction of marriage in which the main characteristics are predatory sex , anger and betrayal , while advertising pumps out propaganda that says only the sad , lost and devout choose to be ' tied down ' .
Yet , in a secular society falling in love offers the last chance of salvation for many .
So , how do we manage autonomy and interdependence - and that push and pull between a fear of abandonment and a terror of becoming trapped and emotionally engulfed ?
The solution for some is to flee into the arms of another .
There are many reasons why an individual has an affair - opportunity , boredom , immaturity , profound unhappiness , a coup de foudre , narcissism , and the constant hunger for adulation , and/or because the adulterer knows he or she will / would be forgiven if found out .
But can a marriage be rebuilt ?
Yes , but the terms may vary hugely .
At best , as Penny Mansfield and Gillian Walton point out , it is possible ( though not easy ) to renew a sense of commitment .
As the years go by , the importance of fanning the flames that sparked the relationship may be overlooked , until a rival steps in .
Some survive the crisis but remain miserably married .
Two US psychologists , Joanne Davila and Thomas Bradbury , have carried out a study that helps to explain why , even in the era of ' easy ' divorce , there are still some individuals propelled to live a lifetime in profoundly unhappy unions .
They looked at 172 newly married couples over four years and found that there were a number who , almost from the first weeks , were unhappy .
These people were overly dependent , had low self - worth and showed a fear of abandonment .
Depression was often an issue .
They had poor communication and gave each other inadequate support .
Thus they increased the very sense of insecurity that kept them together , locked in a matrimonial dungeon .
Marriage , once forged by external restraints - moral , religious and social - now often relies on self - restraint : I stay with you not because I must
or I ought to , but because I want to .
But , sometimes , I do n't know why .
John Gottman , a US psychologist who has spent more than 25 years studying couples , concludes that a relationship will work as long as there are five times more positive feelings and interactions than negative .
A perhaps glib equation with nevertheless more than a grain of sense .
He has an advisory list : be polite ; show interest ; be affectionate ; respect a partner 's view ; enjoy a joke and show appreciation ( and sharing domestic duties would n't go amiss ) .
All very obvious , however .
In a culture in which paid work is ever more intrusive and stressful ( or mind - numbingly repetitive ) , it 's easy to have a public face of charm and affability - the angel behind the desk - only to become accused of creating ' irreconcilable differences ' .
Reality is another surprising element that can undermine a relationship .
Madonna said , talking about how the early years of her marriage to Guy were almost scuppered by her unrealistic expectations : ' I got married for all the wrong reasons .
My husband did not turn out to be everything I 'd imagined him to be . '
Luckily , ' God ' , helped her through the crisis .
The partner you know now is recognised as very different from the idealised person you married .
A sign of maturity is the ability to recognise that no relationship is perfect , but , in the process of making it ' good enough ' , according to research , it is possible for two people to rediscover each other in a more grounded , mutually supportive and even uniquely erotic way .
In a study of happiness published last year , Professor Andrew Clark suggested that : ' Happiness is not getting what you want ; it 's wanting what you have . '
Love coaxes us into marriage or cohabitation but the story we tell ourselves - on a daily basis - about its success or failure plays an even bigger part in securing our chance of living happy ever after .
It is down to a lot of factors : the influence of the first relationship we witnessed ; the relationship of our parents ; self - worth ; a capacity to change ; and a commitment not just to the person , but also to the notion that a long - term relationship may offer its own rewards , emotional , sexual and financial .

The observer panel : Should you forgive a partner 's infidelity ?
This totally depends on what the arrangement is . '
Partner ' is a politically correct but very loose term .
If the deal is exclusivity then to break it is unforgivable .
This applies to all relationships - married or otherwise , same or different sex .
To break the deal is like the biblical concept of original sin - there 's no going back .
Whether people can live together afterwards is for negotiation , but things will never be the same again .
Trust will have evaporated .
Text messages and emails make hiding infidelity more difficult today - you 're simply more likely to get caught .
So if you ca n't talk about something with your partner - do n't do it .
Karol Sikora is a cancer specialist Infidelity is a symptom of a problem , not the cause of a break - up .
The question is not whether you should just shut up shop
but ' why did it happen ? '
To what extent were you involved ?
Have you been bad - tempered , sexually unapproachable , critical of performance , lacking tenderness ?
There 's a list of things that could drive someone to seek comfort elsewhere .
So the intelligent thing to do is talk .
You may find that if you talk honestly about the why s and wherefores , both parties need to forgive each other because it grew out of the relationship .
Treated this way an act of infidelity can strengthen a good relationship .
Claire Rayner is a former agony aunt You should try to if it is an important relationship but so much would depend on the circumstances .
You could probably never put things back to how they were , so the question is whether it is possible to get to grips with what has gone wrong and then build a new relationship .
Where children are involved , there is an additional responsibility to try to make it work .
However , an economist might argue that a willingness to forgive would shape marriage expectations .
Game theory suggests that , before the event , the answer should be a non - negotiable ' Never ! '

2006-02-26,"Singer Sheryl Crow is fighting breast cancer , weeks after splitting up with the cyclist Lance Armstrong .
Crow had surgery in Los Angeles last week but suffered no complications and is expected to mark a full recovery , the singer 's publicist reported .
In a statement posted on her website , Crow said she would have to postpone a US concert tour due to begin in March .
Crow 's former fiance Armstrong , who has recovered from testicular cancer , said he was devastated to learn the news ."
2006-02-28,"The head of medical services at the International Cycling Union ( UCI ) , Dr Mario Zorzoli , yesterday announced that he was temporarily stepping down after the UCI confirmed that a member of its staff had released confidential documents at the heart of the controversy over Lance Armstrong 's alleged positive drug tests . ""
Dr Zorzoli himself requested that he should be suspended until the matter is cleared up , "" a representative of the governing body said yesterday .
Zorzoli 's duties include supervising the UCI 's blood - testing programme .
The UCI yesterday confirmed that all 15 of Armstrong 's anti - doping control forms from the 1999 Tour de France had been passed to the journalist Damien Ressiot with the American rider 's approval .
Initially it had stated that only one of the forms had been released .
Ressiot was investigating whether Armstrong had clearance to take medicines on the banned list as part of his cancer treatment , but he also used the barcodes on the forms to link Armstrong with positive tests for erythropoietin , which the Texan denies using .
The admission is embarrassing for the UCI , which had initially denied releasing all the forms ."

2006-04-01,"Lance Armstrong Day job :
Seven - times Tour de France champion Day off : Harley - Davidson biker ' Stick a motor on it ! '
As a cyclist you hear it so often , bawled from passing cars as you labour up a hill , that you wonder whether the word combinations available to humanity are running out .
Having spent more time speeding up hills on a bike than most of us , Lance Armstrong must have heard it more , too , and it may have got to him .
Something , anyway , has to explain his passion for big motorbikes .
Armstrong 's fascination with fast machines is a lifelong passion .
At the age of 16 he was already earning $ 20,000 a year as a triathlon prodigy .
The money bought his first car - a Fiat , used and red - which he used to drag - race home from his nightshift at Toys ' R ' Us .
Lance traded in the Fiat for a Camaro Iroc Z28 ( Iroc is short for International Race of the Champions , a Nascar - like motorsport series ) .
The Camaro went when his cycling sponsor , the owner of a bike shop in Texas , who was Lance 's credit guarantor , found out about the midnight races and stripped him of his prize motor .
Lance was still only 17 .
Fast forward to spring 1998 , when he was beginning his comeback after cancer .
During the Paris - Nice race , in cold , wet conditions , he coasted to a halt at the roadside , abandoned the race and decided he would never cycle again .
On the flight back to his French home in Cap Ferrat , he saw a Harley - Davidson advertisement in the in - flight magazine .
The slogan was a quotation from the poem ' If I could live my life again , I 'd ... ? '
One of the things was , ' see more sunsets ' .
He tore the page out and showed it to his then wife , Kristin . '
This is what 's wrong with cycling , ' he said , reflecting on the ad 's message . '
It 's not what my life should be . '
But Armstrong did n't take the Harley - Davidson route out of professional sport , and the following year , he won the first of his seven Tours de France .
Even so , the Californian motorbike manufacturer has still been part of his life .
The entrance to his home in Austin , Texas , has long been guarded by two Harley Davidsons , while viewers of Discovery channel 's American Chopper series will have seen the engineers of Orange County Choppers create a mean machine for the Lance Armstrong Foundation , which he dutifully collected in the presence of his then significant other , Sheryl Crow .
That relationship has now been consigned to history ; so too , has Armstrong 's cycling career , despite intermittent comeback threats delivered to annoy the French .
Now , when he 's not appearing on the media as the nation 's chief cancer pundit on occasions such as the death of Christopher Reeves 's wife Dana , working with the Discovery Channel cycling team ( of which he 's part - owner ) , tending to the various court cases he 's involved with , and generally managing the millions his career earned him , he can be seen low - riding the Texas hill country - this time , with motor attached .
Jamie Redknapp Day job : Footballer turned pundit Day off : Editor and publisher
The idea for Icon magazine came from Tim Sherwood , a former team - mate at Spurs .
We were both about to retire and he thought it would be good idea to produce a magazine for professional footballers and their partners .
We wanted the magazine to be aspirational - there are adverts for luxury brands and hotels .
But we mail it out to all professionals , not just to those in the Premiership .
That 's important , I think .
When I was playing for Bournemouth , I was always interested in the lifestyle of the top pros because theirs was the kind of life I wanted for myself .
I was inspired by what they had achieved and how well they lived .
I want our readers to be inspired as well .
Our first issue was a family affair .
[ Former pop star ] Louise , my wife , interviewed Colleen McLoughlin , Wayne Rooney 's girlfriend , and I interviewed my cousin , Frank Lampard of Chelsea .
He was our first cover star .
My dad [ Portsmouth manager Harry Redknapp ] reviewed the new Bentley Continental car for us .
The magazine is bi - monthly and we 've just interviewed Michael Owen and Ryan Giggs .
Stevie Gerrard has said he will do something with us , and we 'd love to go to Madrid to interview Beckham .
The mag is as much about lifestyle as it is about sport - about fashion , homes , interiors , where to go on holiday and where to play golf .
I 'm not the best writer in the world , but I 'm fascinated by the process of interviewing and feel the players open up to me because they trust me .
I love making a magazine - negotiating to find the right paper , choosing the photographs and the layouts .
Can it last ?
I knew that we would take some stick in the press and that they would say that we were producing a sports Hello ! for the Footballers ' Wives generation .
But anyone who has seen the magazine knows it 's a serious publication .
Jo Fenn Day job :
Middle - distance runner Day off : Singer / songwriter
I became a singer because of athletics .
When I was 18 , I went to the Haringey and Essex Ladies ' annual dinner dance .
Halfway through the evening the band took a break and , because I enjoyed singing so much , I took my chance to grab the mic .
Soon I had everyone joining in with me on Peggy Lee 's ' Fever ' .
There was a guy at the dinner who managed a rock covers band .
He invited me to audition and , for the next few years , when I was n't training or competing , I was touring around Essex with the band as a singer .
When I was injured a few years ago , my husband bought me a guitar , which is when I began to write my own songs .
These are influenced by the composer John Barry [ who wrote the music for many of the James Bond films ] .
In 2002 one of my songs , ' Let Me Down Gently ' , reached number 13 in the European country music charts .
But it 's not country music in the way you would usually think of country : it 's more what I would describe as high - energy , Spanish - style .
My own thing !
I do n't see music and athletics as competing against each other .
If anything , it helps to have another passion to keep you occupied when you step away from the track .
Although this year , because I 've been so busy , I 've had to sacrifice my season ticket at Arsenal , which is no bad thing when you consider the way we 've been playing at times .
My immediate goal is to be fit and in form for the 800 m race at the European Championships in the summer and , beyond that , for the Beijing Olympics in 2008 .
However I do have an album I 've recorded with the singer Judie Tzuke out in the autumn .
But once I 'm through with athletics , I 'll go back to performing with my band , the Business .
I need the drama and intensity of trying to captivate people and of building up to a big performance .
Les Ferdinand Day job :
Footballer turned pundit Day off :
Helicopter pilot
My old Newcastle manager Kevin Keegan made me set myself goals outside football .
He said being at Newcastle was like living in a goldfish bowl and he wanted me to stay out of trouble .
I learnt how to cook , ride a motorbike and play the saxophone during my two years there .
Learning to fly a helicopter took me just under two years .
The idea came to me while I was still playing for Newcastle , but it was n't until I joined Tottenham , in 1997 , that I had my first lessons .
I was hooked instantly and fell in love with the freedom of flying .
I sit in the cockpit with no distractions or worries , apart from the radio controller .
I was a bit nervous before my first solo flight , but once you get in the air , your training takes over .
Obviously , there is that moment when you have a sudden realisation that if it all goes wrong there is no one to save you .
Fortunately I 've managed to hold myself together so far .
When I joined Bolton , in 2004 , I commuted by helicopter and stayed in hotels .
My team - mates gave me some stick - all the usual chopper jokes - but they were genuinely interested .
People are nervous the first time I fly them in my helicopter , which is understandable if you 've seen me drive .
But once airborne they usually relax and enjoy it .
Last summer , I flew a couple of mates to the Isle of Wight for lunch .
That 's what I love about my helicopter : it gives me the chance to do things that are different .
It was nice to be in a restaurant by the beach and then home in under an hour .
Yes , it 's an expensive luxury , but it did n't cost as much as the cars you see some players driving .
And I never have to sit in a traffic jam .
Serena Williams Day job :
Grand slam tennis star Day off : Designer and actress In July 2004 , Serena Williams entered the press room at the All England Club wearing a pink tracksuit and carrying an elaborately decorative handbag .
Earlier that day , she had lost the Wimbledon final to Maria Sharapova . '
As a tennis superstar , ' one journalist began , deferentially , ' how will you respond to the emergence of Maria ? '
Serena was shocked by the question . '
A tennis superstar ! '
she said .
' I 'm not a tennis superstar .
I 'm a superstar .
Period .
Like Britney Spears . '
Indeed she is .
Since winning the 2005 Australian Open we have seen an awful lot of Serena , and at almost no point has she been playing tennis .
The two - time Wimbledon champion , whose battles with fitness and injury have restricted her training , now spends much of her time either furthering her acting career ( her most recent television appearance came on the medical drama , ER , where she played a mother whose child is trapped inside a burning building ) or starring alongside her sister , Venus , in a reality TV series .
Oh , and let 's not forget Estee Lauder 's cosmetic range , Flirt , where she is ' a guest creator ' for its Exotic Jewels range .
She has still more passions , including her own fashion label , Aneres ( Serena , spelt backwards , if you had n't noticed ) , which she set up with Venus , herself an aspirant designer .
Serena works on evening wear , Venus on prêt - a - porter .
Asked recently about her rivalry with Sharapova , one of the few female athletes whose appeal is as attractive to advertisers as her own , Serena said : ' I do n't think about her or anyone else on tour ...
I have a fashion company
and I 'm working on a really intense line for the fall .
I 'm an actress .
I 'm working on an animation series .
I 'm working on so much stuff ...
I actually have to go because I have to get my line together . '
The only runways that Serena has been near lately , it seems , involve supermodels rather than private jets to take her to tournaments .
And , if that 's not enough , she has even started thinking like a fashion designer , anxious not to appear on the ' Sack The Stylist ' pages of gossip magazines . '
That 's the problem with fashion , ' she says .
' I 'm photographed too often .
I can only ever wear a dress once . '
With $ 16 m career earnings and a reported $ 8 m a year in endorsements , you 'll cope , Serena , we 're sure of that .
Ricky Hatton Day job :
World boxing champion Day off :
Del Boy
When did you start watching Only Fools and Horses ?
When I was a boy .
I used to record all the episodes .
Now I 've got them on DVD .
When I 'm preparing for a fight , I live like a monk :
I need to have a laugh at the end of the day .
What do you like about the show ?
Wherever you live , there 's always a Del Boy .
He 's a shyster but even if you found out he had tried to do you for a tenner you would n't fill him in because there 's something lovable about him .
If you 're from the north , like me , you think that cockneys are a bit flash and Del reflects that .
How did you begin collecting the memorabilia ?
I loved the show and wanted more .
I could n't believe it when I found out you could buy the three - wheeled van they drove .
I 've also got a bottle of the Peckham Spring water that they once produced and a sign for the Nelson Mandela House flats where Del Boy and Rodney lived , and an Only Fools and Horses alarm clock in my bedroom .
I just need the Del Boy coat and cap now .
How else do you relax ?
When I 'm not training , I do let myself go a bit .
I like to enjoy my food and Guinness , especially now my best mate runs a pub nearby .
I 'm also a big fan of Manchester City where I have a box .
I know the manager Stuart Pearce well .
He carried my world title belt into the arena for my last fight .
His nickname as a player was Psycho but to meet him now you would n't believe it .
How do you spend fight day ?
I 'll have a big meal
then go for a walk so that it does n't sit on my stomach .
For the rest of the day , I 'm just trying to relax .
I 'll watch Soccer AM and Sky 's Soccer Saturday to find out how City are getting on .
I 've been on Soccer AM four times now , which has been a great thrill .
I usually fight around 10 pm
so I 'll get to the arena in Manchester around 7.30 .
Then it 's all about staying calm and focusing your attention .
What does the future hold ?
Although I 've been successful in the last year [ he added the WBA title to his IBF light welterweight crown last November ]
things have been difficult outside it because of my split with promoter Frank Warren .
The focus now is on making it in the States .
There have been many great British champions over the years , but few of them have made it in the States .
That 's my goal now .

I love dogs .
I always used to nag my parents to let me have one , so when they refused I went to work at a kennels .
They let me have one eventually
and I 've always had at least one since .
I love how loyal and dependable they are .
Even if I 've had a bad day they are always pleased to see me and make me feel good about myself .
They do n't answer back or expect anything , except maybe a bit of attention .
Mollie [ the Border collie ] is 11 now and can be a bit of a moody old cow at times , but I love her to bits .
She is definitely the boss of Billy [ the Doberman ] , who is only three .
If Billy gets any ideas above his station she soon puts him in his place .
Billy is n't keen on strangers yet
but they are both pretty well behaved .
I take them over the moors for a run as often as I can .
It gives me some peace and a chance to reflect .
They have the run of the house .
I 'm a big softie with them , really ."
2006-04-16,"We do n't do hills .
As a family of highly amateurish and raggedy cyclists - who would n't know Lance Armstrong if he hurtled straight into us - we are used to the subtle undulations of the Norfolk landscape .
So for us the prospect of Île de Ré , with its network of dedicated cycle paths and flat topography , offered the ideal of a low level activity holiday a neat step up from the cycle track lifestyle of Center Parcs , with wine , oysters and beaches thrown in .
The allure of Île de Ré , sitting just off the coast of Poitou - Charentes in sight of La Rochelle , was already known to us .
We had spent a long day trip on the island the year before and were quickly seduced by the beaches , the sunshine and the unspoilt feel of the place .
Île de Ré is apparently to Parisians what the Hamptons are to upper - class New Yorkers , and French city dwellers are fond of buying up increasingly expensive second homes there .
But the feeling here is far more democratic and less elitist than its American counterpart .
Which is what we were looking forward to as we undertook the epic drive from Norfolk to La Rochelle , taking the fast ferry crossing from Portsmouth to Caen and driving south , with three children - ranging in ages from 20 months to five years - throwing toy dinosaurs at our heads and shouting ' the wheels on the bus ... ' and ' are we there yet ? ' .
As we finally cruised past La Rochelle airport - noting wistfully its convenient proximity to Île de Ré - the soaring road bridge connecting the mainland to the island was a heavenly sight .
Paying the steep £ 10 toll , we swept across and went in search of our villa in the picturesque village of Le - Bois - Plage - en - Ré .
The bridge , completed in 1988 , opened up the island to tourism as never before .
But strict controls on building and development have helped preserve the character and charm of the island .
New houses must adopt the local character , generally white - washed low - slung buildings with shutters painted in aquamarine tones , from almost grey through to turquoise .
Our own home for the week , which my wife Faith had found listed on the internet , fitted into the pattern with a pool thrown in and a peaceful location in a cul - de - sac on the edge of the village .
This is a place of secret alleyways and pathways , a modest maze of routes which next day , dumping the car , we began to explore by bike , enjoying backstreet rides past hollyhock gardens and vegetable patches .
We soon discovered the covered market , stacked with fruit , fish and every class of oyster , as well as essentials such as the bakery , jam shop and play park .
The best of the beaches are on this , the southern side of the island , with Le - Bois - Plage - en - Ré one of the most popular and picturesque .
The island is totally geared up for the bicycle .
Every village , park and beach has neat banks of bike racks .
Cycle shops are two a penny , for repairs , accessories ( a new cycle helmet for Florence ) or rentals .
We had brought our own equipment , along with bags of toys which remained unopened .
Faith 's bike was attached to a neat folding Shetland trailer that carried our two youngest , Cecily and Noah , with room for a beachbag and a baguette .
Attached to my bicycle was the ever - intrepid Florence , sitting on a neat tag - along bike that turned us into a tandem , cutting a wobbly dash across the countryside .
The island is only 30 km long by 5 km wide , but has 100 km of cycle paths .
Most are dedicated tracks , no cars allowed , making them safe for family biking , occasional joggers and the odd rollerblader .
They take you along routes more picturesque than any of the main roads , winding through fields , salt pans and oyster farms .
There are no hills and much of the island is below sea level .
It also clears the island of a lot of the kind of traffic that chokes places like the Hamptons .
Here the car comes to seem like an unnecessary affectation , something to forget about .
We soon found that the harbour village of La Flotte is an easy cycle ride away , as is the capital , St - Martin - de - Ré , where the cycle path takes you right through the stone gates of the town .
Sitting out on the Atlantic , Île de Ré has always been vulnerable to invasion , especially by the British , but has remained decidedly French in every way .
In the 14th century , Charles V gave the people of the island special rights of trade and royal privileges in return for keeping guard over their stretch of coastline and helping repel invasion .
Such privileges and tax breaks helped St - Martin become a thriving international port .
The English and Dutch had a go at taking the town in the 17th century and failed miserably .
The fortifications surrounding this elegant town and harbour , and its citadel , date back to that period .
Later , the citadel became a prison and the harbour a staging post for prison ships taking communards and common criminals away to French penal colonies , while the Revolution also cost the island its royal privileges .
Nevertheless , it grew fat on wine , salt , oysters , fishing and agriculture , all of which thrived on the island 's unique geography and healthy micro - climate ; they say the place gets as much sun as Nice .
Now places like St - Martin and La Flotte thrive on tourism , the harbours surrounded by restaurants and elegant stores .
But they do it very well .
There are few big chain shops , everything is well looked after , prices are high but nothing exorbitant .
Every village has a good park , which became invaluable on our slow days of cycling , exploration and beach combing .
Every market tour or bric a brac stop had to be traded for a park visit or another go on the children 's fair at Le - Bois - Plage - en - Ré , where Florence displayed a worrying lack of understanding of the Highway Code on the dodgems .
There were also rides on the famous ' donkeys in pants ' of St - Martin , elegantly clad in gingham pantaloons - a tradition dating back to when the animals in the fields were given Cath Kidston - esque protection from the mosquitoes that favoured their succulent limbs .
Occasionally , I admit , we cheated . '
Oh , not that smelly car again , Daddy ! '
We put the bikes into the car and set off for the far end of the island to the Phare des Baleines , an Edward Hopper - esque lighthouse .
Many ships - and whales - used to come ashore at the easternmost point of the island .
The beaches here are quieter ; seductive for the more reclusive soul .
On our way home we stopped at Thalacap , one of a small number of thalassotherapy centres on the island .
While I floated in the saltwater swimming pool with the children , Faith was treated to hydro - massage and seaweed wraps .
The French have a particular love of such sea - water treatments , used for combating stress , cellulite and all sorts of circulatory and respiratory problems .
Thalacap has a rather serious , medicinal aspect but reinvigorates allcomers .
It was with real reluctance that we packed up and loaded the car .
Île de Ré is a deeply therapeutic place to be .
The pace of life slows , the world is outdoors , never inside , and the tyranny of the car temporarily becomes something you can just reject .
As we drove back over the bridge , heading for the Loire in search of new cycle paths , we were already planning our return trip . '
The wheels on the bus go round and round , round and round ... '

2006-05-31,"Independent investigators have cleared Lance Armstrong of doping during the 1999 Tour de France , 10 months after French sports newspaper L'Equipe claimed to have seen "" indisputable "" evidence of his guilt .
Dutch law firm
Scholten , called in by the International Cycling Union ( UCI ) to investigate in October , accused the World Anti - Doping Agency ( Wada ) and the French national anti - doping laboratory ( LNDD ) of misconduct in a 132-page report on Wednesday .
The report , prepared by Emile Vrijman - a former director of the Netherlands national anti - doping agency - found Wada had "" behaved in ways that are completely inconsistent with the rules and regulations of international anti - doping control testing . ""
L'Equipe reported last August it had access to laboratory documents and six of Armstrong 's urine samples collected on the 1999 Tour , showed "" indisputable "" traces of the blood - boosting drug erythropoietin ( EPO ) .
American Armstrong , who first won the Tour that year and retired after his record seventh consecutive victory last July , has always denied taking banned substances .
In February the UCI revealed its chief medical officer Mario Zorzoli had provided the newspaper with the documents .
Zorzoli said he must have provided all the forms but only so the journalist could write an article proving Armstrong never asked to use drugs after successfully overcoming testicular cancer .
He was suspended for a month but reinstated in March .
Armstrong declared that the investigation 's findings proved that Wada had broken the law . ""
The report confirms my innocence , but also finds that [ Wada president ]
Mr [ Dick ] Pound along with the French lab and the French ministry have ignored the rules and broken the law , "" he said .
"" They have also refused to co - operate with the investigation in an effort to conceal the full scope of their wrongdoing .
"" I have now retired , but for the sake of all athletes still competing who deserve a level playing field and a fair system of drug testing , the time has come to take action against these kinds of attacks before they destroy the credibility of Wada and , in turn , the international anti - doping system . ""
The UCI was unhappy the findings had been released before it had had a chance to study them . ""
The UCI strongly deplores the behaviour of Mr Vrijman , who expressed himself in a premature manner , contravening the agreements that all parties implicated would be informed before any public comment was made on contents of the report , "" the union said in a statement ."
2006-06-01,"Lance Armstrong yesterday repeated his accusation that he was the victim of a "" witch - hunt "" after the appearance of a report into allegations made last August in the French newspaper L'Equipe that the blood - booster erythropoietin was found in urine samples provided by the seven - times Tour de France winner during his first win in the race in 1999 .
The report from the Dutch lawyer Emile Vrijman , who used to head his country 's anti - doping agency , is yet to be published by cycling 's governing body , the UCI , but was seen yesterday by the Guardian .
In it Vrijman and two other investigators were unable to confirm whether proper procedures had been followed when samples from the 1999 Tour were re - tested in France 's top anti - doping laboratory for erythropoietin , which was undetectable until 2000
The report is also highly critical of the World Anti - Doping Agency and its head Dick Pound for his reaction that the revelations in L'Equipe needed investigating .
Armstrong said : "" Although I am not surprised by the report 's findings , I am pleased they confirm what I have been saying since this witch - hunt began : Dick Pound , Wada , the French laboratory , the French Ministry of Sport , L'Equipe and the Tour de France organisers ( ASO ) have been out to discredit and target me without any basis .
The report confirms my innocence but also finds Mr Pound along with the French lab and the French ministry have ignored the rules and broken the law . ""
Pound said : "" I do n't know how a Dutch lawyer with no expertise came to a conclusion one of the leading laboratories in the world messed up the analysis .
To say Armstrong is exonerated seems strange . """
2006-06-03,"If the idea of cycling into the heart of Alps and losing yourself ( mentally not literally ) to sweeping alpine views across fragrant , flower - filled valleys untouched by roads or cars or houses , appeals then you only need two things - neither of which is Lance Armstrong 's legs .
One is a hearty breakfast , and the other is the number of a new mountain biking company straddling Switzerland and Italy that does all the hard work for you .
Italian Bike Safaris pick you up from your alpine lodgings , drop you off on carefully scouted trails and , after that , it 's up to you .
You can either dip in and out of pine forests , riding alongside glacially fed streams enjoying miles of elevated views .
Or if you have more grit and determination , you can say no to the Land Rover assistance and take your pick of monster hill climbs and roller coaster descents .
Andrew and Amelia Dunn , the British couple behind the company , will add on a whole load of extras , too , from lunchtime barbecues to alpine lake swimming or a wallow at Bormio 's Bagni Vecchi thermal hot springs - all in the space of a weekend .
Our base and starting point was the stylish Hotel Saratz in the smart village of Pontresina - a little known jewel in the Upper Engadine , one of the most scenic parts of Switzerland .
From here more than a thousand kilometres of trails are at your disposal .
Within minutes of weaving past the hikers in the high street , we were heading out towards the Morteratsch glacier which sidles down from the snow - peaked Piz Bernina .
Most tourists only make it as far as the restaurant Roseggletscher aboard horse - drawn carts .
But astride two wheels we could head off much further into the wilds .
Despite the altitude tugging at our lungs ( Pontresina lies at just over 1,800 m and our long but gentle climb hit 1,900 m ) , we were soon off the well worn path and on to a single track trail , boldly eating up pebbly turquoise streams , shingly hills and open grass land .
After stopping to take photos at the toe of the glacier , we turned back to fly down 10 km of pure descent .
At the bottom , we loaded our bikes on to the Land Rover to be whisked to the top of the Bernina pass , which coils up and out of Switzerland towards Italy and beyond .
The next day , we hopped over the border into Livigno , Italy , a tax - free haven where everything costs around 20 % less than at home ,
From there , we took the high alpine ride over the Buffalora pass , through picturesque fields with fantastic sweeping downhill runs .
With encouragement from Amelia shouting handy tips on gear changing and how to cope with death cookies ( big rocks marring the path ) , I focused on the awesome vertical drops ahead .
Taking it at my own speed , fingers firmly on the brakes , I conquered terrain I would never have had the nerve for
had I been by myself .
Our final leg took in "" the chocolate roller coaster "" - a sandy path undulating through a beautiful pine forest .
You pedal like crazy up the humps and whizz down the other side .
As it went on and on and on , I found myself laughing out loud and , at the end of the 31 km ride , my face hurt far more than my thighs .
Tired but elated we pedalled back to Livingo ready to enjoy a delicious , golden , fluffy topped beer .
After all , there 's no better beer than the one you 've worked hard for .

2006-06-05,"The publication of the independent inquiry into doping allegations involving the seven - times Tour de France winner Lance Armstrong looks set to put the World Anti - Doping Agency and cycling 's governing body , the Union Cycliste Internationale , on a collision course after Wada threatened legal action over the findings of the report by the Dutch lawyer Emile Vrijman .
A UCI statement issued on Saturday asked Wada to confirm or deny the four main allegations about the agency 's role in the claims reported in the newspaper l'Equipe last August that the blood booster erythropoietin had been found in samples provided by Armstrong in the 1999 Tour when these were retested for research purposes .
Vrijman 's report said the findings were unclear and did not amount to an anti - doping infraction .
The UCI asked Wada whether it had contact with the newspaper prior to the story 's publication as well as whether it had put pressure on the laboratory that tested the samples to enable them to be matched to the athletes who had given them in the first place .
Meanwhile , the drugs scandal centred on blood doping allegations that has rocked Spanish cycling in the last fortnight took a new twist over the weekend with two riders named in press leaks being withdrawn from competition .
José Enrique Gutiérrez and the former Tour de France King of the Mountains Santiago Botero will ride no races for their team , the Swiss squad Phonak , until their innocence is established .
Both are alleged to figure on police videos of riders entering and leaving the flat of the doctor at the centre of the inquiry , Eufemiano Fuentes .
"" They are neither suspended nor dismissed , "" said the team manager John Lelangue .
"" We have taken this measure in the interest of the team and to ensure the team can compete without pressure in upcoming races . ""
Elsewhere , the Olympic pursuit champion Bradley Wiggins recorded a disappointing 21st place in the prologue time trial of the Dauphiné Libéré stage race , an event he had been targeting as a rehearsal for his main goal of the season , the Tour de France 's first stage ."
2006-06-24,"The departure of a towering figure from any walk of life leaves a void , and on Saturday , when the Tour de France starts in Strasbourg , one name will figure in every prediction : Lance Armstrong .
The retirement last July of the Tour 's most dominant and controversial star , a man who deals only in certainties , leaves the world 's greatest cycle race in a state of shivering uncertainty .
Like Hamlet 's father , Armstrong will overshadow events by his very absence .
No cyclist has ever dominated the Tour for so long , or in such crushing style .
For five years , the Armstrong Tours had , more or less , a shape of their own ; he would turn up and ride well in the prologue time trial , his team would win the team time trial ; he would take the yellow jersey at the first summit finish .
The Texan cancer survivor 's team controlled the race ; every significant escape was monitored by their team manager Johan Bruyneel and permitted to go ahead only if it suited Armstrong 's tactical interests . '
The way he squashed the race was quite convenient for a lot of riders because the race was more controlled , ' says the British professional Charly Wegelius . '
This year a lot of people will be looking at each other waiting for someone else to take the lead . '
On paper at least , this year 's Tour comes down to a straight fight between two men : the Italian Ivan Basso and the German Jan Ullrich .
But it will be more than that .
It will be a matter of who is willing and able to take the initiative after years of basing their strategy on watching Armstrong and surviving .
The pair have adopted contrasting approaches .
Basso has , if anything , made life more difficult for himself by racing his home Tour , the Giro d'Italia , to win , and doing so alla grande , winning three mountain stages .
The double of Giro and Tour is a rare feat , the property of cycling 's greats such as Indurain , Hinault and Merckx .
Armstrong never attempted it because he did not wish to compromise his preparation for the French event .
Basso accepts he may have trouble keeping in peak form for three months , if the four weeks between the two events is included . '
Of course to ride the Giro full gas and to win is hard ...
this year is a little surprising because I use a lot of energy for the Giro for the win . '
His manager , Bjarne Riis , a Tour winner in 1996 , acknowledges ' everybody knows that it is not easy to peak in the Giro and peak again two months later . '
Ullrich , on the other hand , has built steadily to a peak after a poor early season .
He has done so every year since winning the Tour in 1997 and it was never sufficient to overcome Armstrong .
Like Basso , he scored an important win in the Giro , taking a time trial stage , but then he quit before the finish , returning to win the Tour of Switzerland last week .
Basso accepts that Ullrich 's brute strength will give him an advantage in the two long time trials in this year 's Tour . '
Jan will take time from me in the time trials and I do n't know how much .
I could lose two to four minutes .
There are too many time trials and not enough mountain - top finishes and it 's possible
I do n't have enough climbs . '
There is also a small group of outsiders , men who can not be discounted , but do not have the pure pedigree of the Italian and the German .
Alexandr Vinokourov has the killer instinct and all - round strength , but has yet to show the day - in , day - out consistency it takes to win the Tour .
Alejandro Valderde of Spain won a mountain stage last year , and is currently leading the ProTour standings after a strong early season , but has yet to finish a Tour ; Paco Mancebo , his fellow Spaniard , is a fine rider , but essentially a follower .
Armstrong will remain influential in another way .
One of the spin - offs of his years at the top was the presence of a group of strong American stage racers , past and present team - mates : the Memnonite and former mountain bike racer Floyd Landis , winner of three stage races this year including the Paris - Nice ; Levi Leipheimer , who recently won the toughest Tour warm - up , the Dauphine Libere and Armstrong 's oldest friend in cycling , George Hincapie .
Armstrong 's legacy notwithstanding , there remains another huge area of doubt in this year 's Tour .
The race takes place against the background of what is potentially a massive drugs scandal in Spain , where a six - month police investigation codenamed Operation Puerto led to the discovery of banned drugs and several hundred sachets of blood that had been removed from athletes apparently for transfusion to enhance performance at a later date .
Operation Puerto has already had ramifications for the Tour .
It has led to one team , the Spanish squad Comunidad Valenciana , being refused a place at the Tour , while two riders at Landis 's Phonak squad linked to the investigation in media reports - Santiago Botero of Colombia and Jose - Enrique Gutierrez , who finished second in the Giro d'Italia - have been provisionally suspended by the team pending further inquiries .
There have also been calls for the Tour organisers to reject another Spanish team , Astana , who are led by Vinokourov .
He has not been connected to the inquiry , but the former team manager , Manolo Saiz , was detained by police , although he was not placed under formal investigation .
After this , the team 's main backer , the American insurance company Liberty , pulled out , and Saiz resigned .
The team have a licence to race under a new sponsor , a consortium of Kazakh firms , but cycling 's governing body , the International Cycling Union , and the Tour organisers are still waiting for further information to emerge from the Spanish police and have said they will deal firmly with any riders linked to the inquiry .
The question of who is on the list of names drawn up by the investigation team will haunt the race until it reaches Paris .
Three vying for Armstrong 's crown Ivan Basso ( Italy )
CSC
The man in form .
Scored a crushing win four weeks ago in the Giro d'Italia , with the biggest winning margin since 1965 .
His CSC team is the strongest in the race on paper , but the only question is whether their 28-year - old can hold his form to improve on his second place in the Tour behind Armstrong last year .
Jan Ullrich
( Germany ) T - Mobile
The only previous winner still racing .
Has managed four second places since his win back in 1997 .
Now 32 , he is likely to be Basso 's biggest threat .
Struggled to gain form early in the year due to a knee injury , but recently came good with a stage win in the Giro d'Italia and the overall title on the Tour of Switzerland .
Alexandr Vinokourov ( Kazakhstan )
Astana Third in 2003 behind Armstrong and Ullrich .
Matchless racer , perhaps the only cyclist in the pack with the Texan 's killer instinct , and won two stages last year .
The big question is whether further revelations from a drug investigation in Spain may affect his team or even cause it to withdraw from the race .
Betting : 6 - 5 Basso , 9 - 4 Ullrich , 10 - 1 Valverde , 12 - 1 Vinokourov , 14 - 1 Landis , 25 - 1 Leipheimer , 28 - 1 Hincapie , Popovych , 33 - 1 Evans , Rasmussen , 40 - 1 Menchov , 50 - 1 Pereiro , Mancebo , Kloden , 66 - 1 Cunego , Karpets , 80 - 1 Kashechkin , Zubeldia"
2006-06-27,"Ivan Basso , on his last journey home before the Tour de France begins this Saturday , hunkers down in the back seat of a big black car speeding to Heathrow .
As the favourite to win this year 's intriguing race , which will finally feature a new champion after seven years of domination by Lance Armstrong , Basso allows himself a moment of respite as his mind wanders to Varese in Italy .
"" I will get home tonight at 10 , "" he says , "" and be very happy .
My wife , our daughter and new son will be sleeping but I go in quietly and relax .
It wo n't be long and then I have to leave my family again for the Tour .
I feel ready - but first it will be nice to take these easy moments .
There will be nothing easy again until July 23 , the day when we see for sure who has the yellow jersey . ""
Basso gazes at the hazy green shapes of suburban England flashing past his window .
For all his amiable charm he seems rightly preoccupied .
There would be something amiss if a cyclist as grindingly competitive as this did not brood occasionally as he closes in on such a massive opportunity .
Apart from yearning to be the rider who emerges from the shadow of Armstrong Basso also plans to defy the American 's insistence that all energy should be poured into an unremitting assault on the Tour .
Basso , instead , is trying the far trickier feat of winning both the Giro d'Italia and Tour de France in the same year - requiring him to maintain near - perfect form and fitness for 10 consecutive weeks .
Miguel Indurain , one of the greatest grinders of them all and a rider to whom Basso is compared when disparaging comments are made about lack of flair , won this exacting double in 1993 .
But he was more fortunate that the tours were then separated by less of a break , so he did not have to sustain peak condition for the same protracted period as Basso .
Nevertheless the Italian 's comprehensive Giro victory in May - his winning margin of 9min 18sec was the largest since 1965 - has strengthened his conviction .
"" When I told Bjarne Riis [ the formidable Dane who won the Tour in 1996 and now manages Basso 's CSC team ] that I wanted to ride the Giro , he go quiet for 20 seconds .
Last year I try for the Giro
and I was leading before I got sick .
Bjarne thinks I want to do it again because I 'm angry .
But it 's not for this reason .
I want to try for both because , for me , this is the best programme .
My head tells me I have the power to go for two goals .
Bjarne got convinced when he sees I believe that winning the Giro can help me in the Tour . ""
There is a clear logic to the ambitious scheme of a 28-year - old who finished second in the Tour last year and third in 2004 . ""
The Giro is my first big win .
This is psychologically important .
It 's not the Tour de France - but it is still the second most important victory and another step between the big steps of finishing second in the Tour and winning it .
In the Giro I get the yellow jersey and defend it for 15 days .
I was controlling the race a long time and that is good training for me and my team .
"" Basso is emphatic when asked if he was surprised to win so easily . ""
No .
At the last two Tours the difference between me and Lance on the podium is maybe five minutes .
But the difference between me and fifth is another 10 minutes .
It is normal to have a big margin between me and the others .
In the Tour , only I stay with Lance in the mountains ; he drop everyone else for seven years .
"" Basso 's credentials as a time - triallist are , however , less impressive .
This comparative weakness was underlined in Italy where one of his main rivals next month , Jan Ullrich , broke away from using the Giro as a training routine to dominate a time trial and beat Basso by half a minute .
"" I get better in the time - trials , "" Basso protests .
"" You should have seen me three years ago .
Ullrich might gain three minutes because , this year , the route of the Tour suits the time - triallists .
It is not so good for me because there are less hard mountain climbs .
But I can get back that time if I make a big statement in the mountains .
Lance do that every year .
"" If there is widespread relief that this will not be a Tour de Lance , as it has been every year since 1999 , Basso is diplomatic . ""
Me and Lance used to email each other once a month
but we do n't do so much now because he is travelling a lot .
We do n't have such a big relationship because , now he 's moving into management , he 's a rival again .
But Lance is a good person .
He 's a great rider - but for the personal problem I had , he was more special .
He talk good to me . ""
In 2003 and 2004 Basso raced with the burden of knowing that his mother was dying of cancer .
Such was the oppressive weight of this knowledge - which was not shared with anyone else in his family - that Basso confided in Armstrong , whose own battle against cancer had long been part of his legend .
"" It was tough because my sister was too young to be told and my father , well , he is difficult to talk to about these things .
It 's hard for a man to hear his wife will be dead in six months .
So it was only me who knew that she would soon die .
Lance try to help me and I never forget . ""
Armstrong encouraged his Discovery team to target Basso as his eventual successor .
A multi - million dollar contract was offered to Basso , on the understanding he would eventually replace Armstrong as team leader , and it says much for the Italian 's loyalty to Riis that he resisted .
"" I could have gone because they were very interested and it 's a pleasure when a big team likes me .
Bjarne was struggling to find a new sponsor .
So I tell Discovery that , if Bjarne did not make a team , then they are my first choice .
But , if Bjarne gets the backing to continue , then no question : I stay with him my whole career .
When someone gives you 100 % you show the same .
And then CSC came in and everything works perfect .
"" When Basso first joined the Riis regime he was startled to discover that pre - season training included hardcore exercises with the Danish Special Forces - who told him to jump off a cliff on Lanzarote .
The Italian 's main problem was that he could not swim .
"" I still do it , "" he grins .
"" Bjarne wanted me as leader and so this was a good test .
Anyway there was no big danger .
Lots of people in the sea make sure I do n't drown . ""
Basso shakes his head at Riis 's imposing reputation . ""
He is more than this .
Bjarne 's first quality is intelligence .
You see this in the way he change with me over the years .
In the start he is my teacher .
He say , ' Ivan , do this , do that . '
But it get more interesting in the second year .
He say , ' Ivan do this , but what you think about that ? '
And this year it 's only 20 % where he say ' do this or that ' .
He has a lot of belief in my feelings and thoughts and this helps a lot . ""
As Ullrich 's former team - mate Riis can also pinpoint any flaws in the German who won his sole Tour in 1997 - although where Armstrong always succeeded in needling Ullrich , Basso prefers a more subtle tack .
"" I do n't believe Jan is weak in his mind .
I start saying in November that he is the favourite .
He 's been good in this race for 10 years and he is the one to beat - with a few others like [ Floyd ] Landis , [ Alexandre ] Vinokourov and [ Alejandro ] Valverde .
I do n't know if there is more pressure on Jan because he is older .
But I know for sure that I will be a better rider in five years - so I have another seven or even eight opportunities after this to win . ""
And what of next year , I ask , with the Tour starting in London ?
Basso 's face darkens briefly .
"" I 'm sorry , but this is very strange .
London is a good city but it make no sense for the riders .
Maybe if I come back here as defending champion it might seem less crazy . . . ""
Gliding into Terminal One , I remember the contrasting figures that Basso and Riis had cut earlier in the afternoon when presenting a motivational address for 300 executives at the lavish headquarters of their backers , the computer giant CSC .
Riis prowled through the corporate ranks as if this was one last chore to brush aside before his team could focus on the coming battle in the furious time - trials and brutal mountain stages of the Alps and Pyrenees .
Basso , meanwhile , looked more like a matinée idol as he signed countless cycling shirts , grinning and shrugging his way down the awe - struck lines of middle - aged businessmen .
It was yet another small taste of the fame and adulation which will envelop him should he win the Tour this year . ""
Yes , "" he says , while reaching for his bag at Heathrow , "" but I go home first .
I see my little boy , Santiago , and that give me more confidence because it was very emotional at the Giro - he was born on the Friday
and I win the race on the Sunday .
What a weekend .
And now I am ready for an even bigger three weeks in France . """
2006-06-28,"The Sunday Times portrayed champion cyclist Lance Armstrong as a "" paradigm example "" of drug abuse in the sport , a court heard today .
Armstrong 's barrister , Richard Spearman QC , said the newspaper had implied the seven - times Tour de France winner was guilty of taking performance - enhancing drugs , a claim he has always denied .
"" Armstrong is presented as a paradigm example , he is right at the heart of it , "" Mr Spearman said .
"" [ The implication is ] how could he have won these races in the way he has without having been doped like everybody else ? . ""
Armstrong is suing the Sunday Times over an article from June 13 2004 , which discussed allegations of drug use made in a biography co - written by the paper 's then chief sports writer , David Walsh , and a French journalist , Pierre Ballester .
The cyclist , who retired from the sport last year after his seventh consecutive Tour triumph , has taken action against the paper , Walsh and the author of the article , Alan English .
Today 's hearing at the high court in London , held ahead of a potential trial , attempted to determine what the article would have meant to readers .
Representing Times Newspapers , Andrew Caldecott QC said that although the Sunday Times piece had discussed some of the claims from the biography , entitled LA Confidentiel : Les Secrets de Lance Armstrong , it had not necessarily endorsed them .
"" There 's no rule that you ca n't explore grounds of suspicion without straying into [ alleging ] guilt , "" he said .
"" The role of the press is to raise questions , not merely to convict the guilty . ""
Mr Caldecott said the article raised a series of questions , which extended to examining attitudes to the drugs issue within the world of cycling .
"" It sets out a number of concerns , it does not suggest any of them are as yet conclusive evidence of guilt . ""
The article 's headline , LA Confidential , was "" not on any view the language of outright accusation of guilt "" , Mr Caldecott said .
Mr Justice Gray , the judge hearing the case , reserved judgment until later in the week or early next week .

2006-06-30,"Lance Armstrong 's legal battle against the Sunday Times is set to go to trial after a judge ruled today that an article about drug abuse in cycling did suggest he was guilty of using performance - enhancing drugs .

2006-07-01,"The Sunday Times has settled with Lance Armstrong after he sued the paper for libel over a 2004 article which referred to a book , LA Confidential - The Secrets of Lance Armstrong .
In a high - court hearing , Mr Justice Gray ruled that the meaning of the article as a whole implied that Armstrong had taken drugs to enhance his performance .
He rejected arguments for the paper that the words conveyed no more than the existence of reasonable grounds to suspect .
"" The Sunday Times has confirmed to Mr Armstrong that it never intended to accuse him of being guilty of taking any performance - enhancing drugs and sincerely apologised for any such impression , "" the paper 's lawyers said ."
2006-07-01,"The Tour de France , showpiece sporting event of the Gallic summer and the world 's largest cycle race , was thrown into disarray last night when a doping inquiry decapitated the field of riders , removing four top contenders .
The Italian Ivan Basso , Jan Ullrich of Germany , and Francesco Mancebo of Spain , who respectively finished second , third and fourth in last year 's event , were withdrawn on the eve of the race by their teams after they were implicated in a large - scale inquiry by the Spanish police into an alleged system of blood doping based in Madrid .
All were considered contenders after the retirement of Lance Armstrong at the end of last year 's Tour .
Six other riders were also pulled after being implicated .
Another favourite , Alexandr Vinokourov of Kazakhstan , was withdrawn when his team was torn apart by the removal of five riders .
Riders will not be replaced and the Tour will start today with 176 competitors .
Shellshocked Tour officials were struggling to come to terms with the implosion of the event .
It was as if the World Cup had lost , in one fell swoop , Brazil , Argentina , France and Germany over allegations of match - rigging .
The 103-year - old event brings parts of France to a standstill and draws millions to the roadsides on the 2,000-mile route , covered in 22 days .
But the Tour has been here before .
The 1998 "" Tour de Farce "" was rocked by the exclusion of the Festina team and the withdrawal of all the Spanish teams in the race .
Public opinion has been divided ever since between those who still have their race heroes and those who see the riders as the "" convicts of the road "" .
Some fans come to the race and paint 20ft - long drawings of hypodermic syringes on the road or hold placards accusing its stars of doping .
In 1998 they greeted the race organisers and riders with bare buttock salutes - while others remain convinced that the use of performance - enhancing substances is inevitable in the world 's toughest endurance event in any sport and should thus be condoned .
The scandal will , however , be welcomed by many within the sport in France , which has taken a tough stance on doping in cycling since the Festina scandal , and which has seen a number of highprofile trials of drug users within the sport in recent years .
The mayor of Strasbourg , Fabienne Keller , yesterday called the Tour teams ' decision to withdraw riders involved in the inquiry "" incredibly courageous "" while the last Frenchman to win the Tour , Bernard Hinault , who won the event five times , said "" I am glad because these decisions are good for the sport .
The Festina affair did not have enough of an effect .
""
Even Armstrong - who won the Tour a record seven times - has had to refute repeatedly allegations of drug - taking .
Just as the new storm was breaking on Thursday , he won a libel action against the Sunday Times , which had accused him of taking performance - enhancing drugs .
The shockwaves extended across the Rhine , at least to those parts not celebrating Germany 's victory over Argentina in the World Cup .
Ullrich has become one of the country 's biggest sports stars since his Tour win in 1997 .
He has since been runner - up four times and was the Olympic road race champion in Sydney in 2000 .
His annual battle to lose weight for the Tour , his contorted love life and a minor issue with amphetamines - recreational - in 2002 have made him a darling of the tabloids .
"" I am in absolute shock , "" he said on German television yesterday .
"" It 's the worst thing that has ever happened to me in my career .
I can only say again that I have nothing to do with this thing . ""
The police inquiry dates back four months , to a deposition by former cyclist , Jesus Manzano , who accused his former team of blood doping , a process in which blood is withdrawn from an athlete and reinjected several months later .
By that time the body has naturally replaced the oxygen - carrying red cells that were removed ; the reinjection thus gives a massive boost in performance ."
2006-07-03,"Seven times Tour de France champion Lance Armstrong has settled his libel case with the Sunday Times .
The two sides announced the out of court settlement late on Friday , after Armstrong won an important pre - trial ruling earlier in the day on what defamatory meaning the June 2004 Sunday Times article , over which he was suing , bore .
Armstrong had brought a high court action against Times Newspapers , journalist David Walsh and the deputy Sunday Times sports editor , Alan English , over the article , which referred to a book , LA Confidential - The Secrets of Lance Armstrong , which was about to be published .
In a joint statement concluding the action , Armstrong and the newspaper said : "" The Sunday Times and Mr Armstrong are pleased to announce that they have settled their legal disputes . ""
The Sunday Times has confirmed to Mr Armstrong that it never intended to accuse him of being guilty of taking any performance enhancing drugs and sincerely apologised for any such impression . ""
Mr Armstrong has always vigorously opposed drugs in sport and appreciates the Sunday Times 's efforts to also address the problem . ""

2006-07-07,"The absence of Lance Armstrong has been felt this week , if in more subtle ways than the withdrawal of Jan Ullrich and Ivan Basso .
There have been no crowds , no barriers and no burly security men around the Discovery Channel team bus and the team 's directeur sportif Sean Yates says the team is far more relaxed without the constant focus on the seven - times winner .
The first week , too , has been more relaxed , although Tom Boonen might not agree .
The world champion again slipped up at the stage finish here , with Robbie McEwen taking his third sprint win .
However , without Armstrong gobbling up four or five stage wins - and with Ullrich and Basso absent and two fewer teams in the race - there is less pressure on the squads to get results from the off .
"" There 's not that inevitability about it all .
I think what 's happening is that everyone 's more relaxed about the racing .
Even the teams know they 're not running out of time .
Anything can happen .
It takes the pressure off everyone , "" said David Millar , the Scot who is making his Tour comeback after a two - year doping ban .
Armstrong 's absence will be felt even more acutely today , when the field tackles the first great set - piece of this year 's race : a 30-mile time - trial from St - Grégoire to Rennes , For the past six years the time- trial stages have been seen in reference to the Texan 's quest for his next victory .
This time , however , without Armstrong or Ullrich , the real significance of today 's stage will only be known in two weeks ' time when the race nears Paris .
The old build - up line that "" the Tour starts today "" is doubly true : only after this will there be any sign of who will be in the final mix .
The stage is now wide open .
Of the contenders for victory in Paris the American Floyd Landis has the best time - trial record and produced the best prologue .
His compatriot George Hincapie produced a searing prologue and should be in the frame today but his credentials as a challenger for the overall standings are mixed .
With none of the overall contenders such as Levi Leipheimer or Yaroslav Popovych being time - triallists of note - although a close eye will be kept on the unkempt but rapid Russian Vladimir Karpets - the specialists should have their chance .
On paper the favourite will be David Zabriskie from Salt Lake City , who took last year 's opener ahead of Armstrong and is the winner of two time - trials a few weeks ago in the Dauphiné Libéré stage race .
As one of the few to win a Tour time - trial in the Armstrong era
Millar 's presence at the front in the finale of every stage so far is no coincidence either .
He has held on to a place in the top 20 overall and knows that a good time today could put him in the yellow jersey , sealing his return after his ban .
"" I 'm aiming for the stage win , "" he said yesterday .
"" I want to finish top five . ""
Millar was once known for his casual attitude to his racing but that is in the past .
He visited today 's course a month ago and rode it five times .
He is convinced that the flat profile is misleading .
"" It 's deceptively hard .
It 's a bastard time - trial . ""
Boonen probably had something similar to say about yesterday 's finish .
His lead - out men did not look organised and he was on his own in the finish straight .
McEwen , in contrast , is receiving excellent service from his team - mate Gert Steegmans , who gave him a clear run to the line .
Boonen punched his bars in frustration after the finish because he will have only two more chances for a win before the Tour hits the mountains on Wednesday .
After a week of phony war the Tour is about to get serious ."
2006-07-08,"Since the Tour left Strasbourg a week ago without Jan Ullrich or Ivan Basso , reading the runes has been impossible .
The picture , however , was barely clarified during the first real test of strength , the 32-mile time trial through the Breton countryside , with none of the remaining favourites striking a decisive blow as the stage win and the race lead went to the Ukrainian Serhiy Honchar .
Of the riders regarded as possible successors to Lance Armstrong , only the Texan 's former team - mate Floyd Landis , the mountain - biking Mennonite , managed to open a gap of any kind , but he gained well under a minute on a tightly grouped little cluster of riders with whom he will probably contest the overall standings when the race reaches the Pyrenees .
They include the Australian Cadel Evans , the Russian Denis Menchov - who inherited victory in last year 's Tour of Spain after the winner Roberto Heras tested positive for drugs - the Frenchman Christophe Moreau and Ullrich 's team - mate Andreas Kloden .
lifted the world time trial title as long ago as 2000 , a little to the west in the town of Plouay .
He is unlikely to hang on to the lead when the race reaches the Pyrenees on Wednesday , but his win yesterday was some compensation for the T - Mobile team after the loss of Ullrich .
Only one issue was definitely settled .
The Tour is unlikely to be won by Levi Leipheimer , the American who finished sixth in last year 's Tour and was the logical favourite after the departure of the five men who finished above him .
The 32-year - old was way off the pace and lost five minutes on Landis .
David Millar , meanwhile , may find that his lack of racing during his two - year drugs ban is catching up with him , and his hope that he could perform in the Tour on training alone may prove hard to realise .
The Scot was off the pace at the first time check and finished thirty - seventh , slower than Britain 's other participant , the Olympic track pursuit champion Bradley Wiggins , who had every right to be pleased with twenty - eighth in his first Tour with a time good enough for him to top the leaderboard briefly in the morning .
France has had only part of its collective mind on the Tour this week as attention has turned partly to Amelie Mauresmo 's fortunes at Wimbledon , but primarily over the German border to one of the few sports events worldwide that dwarfs the great bike race .
The upsurge of support for Les Bleus that began last weekend has been obvious since the race returned to France on Wednesday .
Yesterday , among the cob - walled barns , apple orchards and fields of gently swaying golden corn , there was a proliferation of tricolours on the verges along with the black - and - white Breton flag .
The wish is clear - France 's cyclists need to put the clock back in the style of their soccer team and their tennis player .
On yesterday 's showing , however , only the ageing Moreau has even a remote chance of doing that ."
2006-07-10,"As the Lance Armstrong years progressed , and attention focused on the Texan 's celebrity , with speculation on whether or not he had used banned drugs and the question of how many Tours de France he was going to win , the fact that he had defied medical logic by merely being at the Tour tended to be overlooked .
Turning medical logic on its head in the Tour is becoming an American tradition .
After Armstrong the cancer survivor came Tyler Hamilton , who finished fourth and won a mountain stage in 2003 while riding with a cracked collarbone - although the findings of the Operation Puerto doping scandal in Spain appear to have put that performance in a new light - and yesterday it was revealed that the man who is now in pole position , Floyd Landis , is due to have a hip replacement .
Landis broke the hip end of his femur at the end of 2002 in a training crash and since then has raced in pain ; the fracture is held together by three four - inch titanium pins and a degenerative condition called avascular necrosis or osteo necrosis has set in , which occurs when scar tissue obstructs blood vessels in the hip and the ball joint is damaged .
"" If I had n't had a bicycle racing career I would have had the hip replaced two years ago , because I do n't really want to deal with the pain , "" Landis said in the International Herald Tribune yesterday .
"" It 's bad , it 's grinding , it 's bone rubbing on bone .
When I pedal and walk it comes and goes , but mostly it 's an ache like an arthritis pain . ""
Landis had an operation two years ago to ease the pain and the surgery left his right leg an inch shorter than his left .
He has special dispensation to have cortisone injected into the hip during this Tour to ease the pain .
He is expecting to have the operation at the end of the year .
Even so he will enter the Pyrenees tomorrow as most followers ' favourite for the overall title along with the German Andreas Klöden .
His injury and the effect it will have on him in the next 10 days are merely more variables in a race that is more open than has been seen since 1983 .
As the field rested in Bordeaux yesterday , there were perhaps a dozen riders who had the potential to win - on paper at least or with a little stretch of the imagination - grouped over two and a half minutes . ""
Going on past form , Klöden and Landis are the favourites , "" says Cyrille Guimard , the French team manager who directed Bernard Hinault to his first four Tour wins .
"" But you could take a decent punt on a guy who is five , six or 10 minutes back . ""
Landis will go into the Pyrenees as favourite partly because of the way he limited his losses to the race leader Serhiy Gontchar on Saturday in the Rennes time- trial , but also because , as the hip episode shows , he is a man who is famously indifferent to pain .
He is also utterly determined , having fought against the constraints of his Mennonite upbringing to race his bike .
More interestingly , this year he has shown a new side , winning three important stage races including the Paris - Nice .
Klöden , on the other hand , has nothing apart from a second place on one stage in last year 's race to indicate that he has built on his second place overall in the 2004 race .
The Australian Cadel Evans - like Landis a former professional mountain biker - at least has managed to win a major stage race this year while the least that can be said for Gontchar is that he has shown remarkable consistency in the Giro d'Italia for almost 10 years .
The race will thus pedal south towards the Pyrenees today in almost as uncertain a state as when it first started out , with the only certainty being that Landis has shown a little better than the rest , Gontchar is the strongest time - triallist and T - Mobile have strength in depth .
All bets are off , according to Guimard . ""
As it stands today , an average rider who climbs and time - trials OK and who is less than eight minutes behind could win the Tour .
It 's a crazy race , sheer anarchy . ""
Five who can win the Tour de France Serhiy Gonchar Ukr Age 36 Position 1st Team T - Mobile Reason for With a flat time - trial on the final Saturday he has only to limit his losses in the mountains Reason against He is simply too old and has limited experience of the race Floyd Landis US Age 30 Position 2nd ( + 1min ) Team Phonak Hearing Reason for He is the best all - rounder here , he has ample Tour experience

2006-07-13,"Two weeks ago the French sports daily paper l'Equipe ran the banner headline "" La Grande Lessive "" - the great clean - out - following the expulsion of the four riders expected to dominate the Tour .
Yesterday saw an equally impressive "" big washday "" as over the final two Pyrenean passes in this massive stage the number of potential winners was slashed from a baker 's dozen to a handful , with Floyd Landis taking over the yellow jersey
he so ably helped Lance Armstrong win in 2004 .
The Mennonite mountain biker from Farmersville , Pennsylvania has the speed to have finished second to Serhiy Gontchar in Saturday 's time - trial in Rennes but while yesterday 's stage relegated the Ukrainian to 55th overall the American proved he can climb as well , finishing in the same time as the stage winner Denis Menchov .
The Russian winner is one of four men who remain in a position to challenge Landis : the others within 2min 30sec are the Australian Cadel Evans , like Landis a former mountain bike racer , the Spaniard Carlos Sastre of the CSC team and , admittedly a little further down the standings , Germany 's Andreas Klöden .
Armstrong is now part of Tour history but his influence remains .
Landis was one of his domestiques at US Postal from 2002 to 2004 and here again , as so often in the Armstrong Tours , the first summit finish of the race may well prove decisive .
The gnomic , ginger - goateed Landis may next year return to the Discovery team - part - owned by Armstrong - although that will presumably depend on his relationship with Armstrong , which has often been rocky , and also on the outcome of his forthcoming hip operation .
The knowledge that his cycling days may be numbered has , he says , given him extra determination "" to force as hard as possible "" this year . ""
You see things differently
and I am honoured to be here , "" he said , with a grace that recalled America 's first Tour great , Greg LeMond .
More sombrely , Landis added that "" I hope the new [ hip ] will work "" .
If it does not , of course , his career may well end this winter .
There is , too , the chance that the condition afflicting the joint , avascular necrosis or osteo necrosis , may affect him in the coming days .
"" It is a possibility , but ordinarily with this condition it 's a slow process , not a catastrophic failure in one day , "" he explained .
Talking of catastrophic failure , yesterday was , rather intriguingly , a rout for the Discovery Channel men who backed Armstrong to his seventh win last year in such dominant style .
Yaroslav Popovych , tipped as a future Tour winner , lost six minutes , while only the Portuguese Jose Azevedo remained in the top 20 overall .
The much fancied George Hincapie , nicknamed Grimpeur ( Climber ) George after his stage win in the Pyrenees last year , finished 21 minutes behind Landis and Menchov , not that far ahead of the two Britons , Bradley Wiggins and David Millar .
The T - Mobile challenge faded as well , after the lower slopes of the day 's penultimate climb , the Col du Portillon , where the German team suddenly broke the stalemate that has gripped the race since Strasbourg .
It was the Valkenberg stage winner Matthias Kessler who did the damage , virtually sprinting up the lower slopes of the mountain that divides France and Spain , whittling down the lead group .
It proved a miscalculation by the Germans : their leader Klöden was unable to hold the pace when Menchov made his move four miles from the top of the climb to the finish .
His Rabobank team tackled the ascent in the style of Armstrong 's men , first Michael Rasmussen lifting the pace , then Michael Boogerd , before the Russian delivered the coup de grace .
Only Sastre , Landis , Evans and Klöden could hold the Russian , along with another American , Levi Leipheimer , the biggest loser last Saturday .
He did his damnedest to secure the stage win but Menchov had the legs and the wit to take the lead going into the final corner .
Winner of the best young rider award in the 2003 Tour , Menchov raced for Miguel Indurain 's old team Banesto before moving to the Dutch squad .
He is what the French would call un client being , in a theoretical kind of way , the defending champion of the Tour of Spain after finishing second last year to Roberto Heras .
The Spaniard was subsequently banned for using EPO , but Menchov has not quite been named the winner - a reception where he was to have been anointed was cancelled after fears of legal action from Heras .
It would be hard to find a better illustration of the confusion to which drugs have reduced cycling in the 21st century , unless of course it is this Tour itself .
The man who started the day in yellow , France 's Cyril Dessel , looked as if he might retain the jersey until T - Mobile lifted the pace on the Portillon and thereafter strove as manfully as would be expected of anyone defending the maillot jaune in the kind of cliff - hanging finish that so delights French television commentators .
In the end , cruelly , he finished in a time which actually would have placed him at parity with Landis , but the American 's third place on the stage entitled him to an 8sec time bonus which made the difference .
The boot , or rather the carbon - fibre soled cycling shoe , may be on the other foot today , however .
The stage is flat enough and there are enough time bonuses at the intermediate sprints for Dessel to regain the lead , something that would suit Landis as it would let his team - mates save their strength for the Alps .
It would certainly be a storming result for France : today is Bastille Day ."
2006-07-14,"The Pyrenees were such a disaster for Lance Armstrong 's old team Discovery Channel that yesterday they started the day with their ambitions revised sharply downwards .
Two of the team 's complement then abandoned early on , but they rediscovered their winning touch at last when they took the stage through the Ukrainian Yaroslav Popovych .
Popovych would not reveal what had been said to the team after Thursday 's poor showing but , given the way Armstrong used to boss the squad on the road , no doubt minds were focused by the news that the seven - times Tour winner , still the team 's part - owner , will visit next week .
"" We have n't heard from Lance recently and it 's probably just as well , "" said Popovych , who has been tipped as a future Tour winner since taking the world under-23 title in 2001 .
There was certainly promise in the incisive way he attacked repeatedly to elude his three breakaway companions , including the double stage winner Oscar Freire .
The Ukraininan 's presence in the day 's escape and his rise up the standings to 10th overall hinted that it may not be straightforward for the yellow jersey Floyd Landis to control the race .
Popovych flopped badly on Thursday like the rest of his team but Landis could not afford to allow him to pull back too much of his nine - minute deficit .
Knowing this , and being aware that they may need their strength on today 's and tomorrow 's stages , the sprinters ' teams refused to cooperate in the chase and forced Landis 's Phonak squad to keep up the pursuit to the bitter end and limit Popovych 's gains to 4½ minutes .
It was the kind of bluff that Armstrong would never have tolerated and underlined the fact that the Tour currently has no patron stamping his authority on it .
France 's cyclists have upheld national pride on the fête nationale for the past two years but yesterday there was only one home rider in the four - man escape that fought out the stage , Christophe Le Mevel , and he was unable hold either Popovych , the Italian Alessandro Ballan or Freire .
Yesterday in Carcassonne people were frying slices of duck and boiling lumps of lamb near the finish line next to the medieval citadel .
The cooks need hardly have bothered with a stove ; they could simply have laid the meat on the Tarmac as temperatures approached 35C.
The south of France is on alerte canicule , the public warning issued to avoid a repetition of the high death rate in the hot summer of 2003 .
The advice includes staying indoors when temperatures are at their highest , but naturally that does not apply to the Tour cyclists , who yesterday sped through the shimmering heat haze at almost 29 mph .
The race went underground at one point , through the 400 m natural tunnel of the Mas d'Azil , but that was the only respite from the heat in 130 miles as the scenery changed gradually from green Pyrenean foothills and deep valleys to rolling sunflower fields and long , straight lime - tree avenues , with the Languedoc vineyards appearing near the end .
David Millar had promised before the start that he would "" nuke it "" up the last Pyrenean pass , the second - category Col des Ares , in an attempt to win the stage , and at the top he formed part of a strong 15-rider lead group which contained a smattering of Frenchmen out to do or die for the honour of their country .
Unfortunately for Millar the group also included two contenders for the green points jersey of best sprinter , the prologue winner Thor Hushovd and the Italian Daniele Bennati , which meant the Davitamon team of the points leader Robbie McEwen were forced to chase them down .
Although Millar and his fellow Briton Bradley Wiggins survived the two Pyrenean stages with a little energy to spare , the Scot feels that many other riders in the field are currently struggling .
Yesterday five abandoned , including the Discovery men Paolo Savoldelli and Benjamin Noval , and there were little groups of stragglers spread over 12 minutes yesterday .
The hot weather is forecast to continue this weekend as the Tour heads towards the Ardèche and the Vaucluse , and the effect may be felt next week in the Alps ."
2006-07-15,"Lance Armstrong may be in for an interesting reception next week when he returns to the Tour de France , having apparently insulted France 's soccer team by saying : ' All their players tested positive ... for being assholes . '
Armstrong 's relationship with the French has become strained , with his persistent contention that they did not like him winning their flagship event seven times and the allegations in the French press last August that the banned blood booster erythropoietin had been found in his urine samples from the 1999 Tour .
French sports fans have voted him well up the standings in polls to find the country 's least popular sportsman .
Insulting the heroes of the World Cup , even in jest , is hardly likely to improve matters .
Armstrong apparently made the quip in his prerecorded speech for tonight 's ESPY awards , the annual gong - fest of cable TV channel ESPN .
He then confirmed what he had said to the Los Angeles Daily Times , stating : ' If they 'd lived with me and heard me at home , they 'd know it was a step down . '"
2006-07-15,"There was every reason to expect the unexpected in the first Tour de France of the era after Lance Armstrong , and the overall standings were turned upside down by a long - distance escape that propelled the Spaniard Oscar Pereiro to the yellow jersey in the biggest shock the race has seen in 30 years .
Together with Pereiro in the escape across the baking roads of the Herault and the Ardeche were the German Jens Voigt , an habitue of this kind of long - range move , France 's starlet Sylvain Chavanel , whose results have never quite matched up to his reputation , let alone his salary , the Italian Manuel Quinziato and Andriy Grivko of the Ukraine .
With the Phonak team of the race leader Floyd Landis unwilling or unable to lead the chase , the quintet finished half an hour ahead of the peloton and had ample time to fight out the stage win , which went to Voigt , who took the leg to Sarran five years ago in a similar move .
Pereiro , having started the day forty - sixth overall , was second , but what mattered was that the peloton were still 14 miles away as he crossed the line .
Pereiro would not have been among any list of favourites at the start of the race , but yesterday he and the rest of the day 's escapees were given half an hour 's lead as the peloton suffered in blinding heat , close to 45 degrees .
Quite where he will end up when the race finishes in a week 's time remains to be seen , but he is far from a complete tyro , having won last year 's mountain stage to Pau and having twice finished tenth overall .
Pereiro 's sudden rise underlined what many suspected when the four strongest contenders to succeed Armstrong - Jan Ullrich , Ivan Basso , Francisco Mancebo and Alexandr Vinokourov - were thrown off the race before it had even started due to the Spanish blood - doping inquiry Operation Puerto : this was to be a Tour with no ' patron ' to control the racing .
Yesterday underlined that even if Landis 's legs had been up to the task of taking the lead last week in the Pyrenees , he had not exuded anything like the same authority as his erstwhile team leader .
There had already been a hint that his team might not be up to defending his lead on Friday , when they allowed the Ukrainian Yaroslav Popovych to gain the best part of five minutes , which put the 26-year - old into the top 10 overall .
The stage is thus set for a massive showdown this week in the Alps .
To start with , Pereiro has six riders breathing down his neck within two and a half minutes : Landis , who is now 1min 29sec behind Pereiro , Cadel Evans of Australia , Denis Menchov of Russia , the Frenchman Cyril Dessel , Spain 's Carlos Sastre and the German Andreas Kloden .
While Dessel can be discounted as he is there due to last Wednesday 's break in the Pyrenees - almost a replica of Pereiro and company 's move yesterday - the other five are all possible winners .
In addition , there are rumours of a possible alliance between the Dutch team Rabobank , who have Menchov in third overall , and Lance Armstrong 's old team Discovery .
Underlining how difficult this Tour is to control , yesterday Landis 's Phonak team appeared to be waiting for other squads to help them bring the lead of Pereiro and company within reasonable proportions .
Help was not forthcoming , and Phonak had to do the job on their own until they faded .
Their two strongest team riders , Santiago Botero and Jose Enrique Gutierrez , did not make it to the Tour after the team suspended them for their alleged involvement in the Spanish blood - doping scandal , and their absence showed yesterday .
Equally the team management must now regret having let Pereiro leave at the end of last season .

2006-07-17,"The tabloid France - Soir yesterday made it clear yesterday that Lance Armstrong 's much - discussed return to La Grande Boucle this week may be lively . ""
Welcome in France , Trouduc ! ""
proclaimed its front page ,
Trouduc being a street - slang reference to Armstrong 's joke about France 's football team having "" all tested positive for being assholes "" .
With France still under the spell of Zinédine Zidane and company his jest , made as he accepted an award from cable TV channel ESPN on Sunday , was definitely ill - timed .
But it was unclear whether Armstrong had in fact returned to the race yesterday .
His Discovery Channel team spokesman said he had not arrived but he was said to be at L'Alpe d'Huez prior to today 's stage , which he is expected to follow in the Discovery Channel team car .
That his possible arrival provoked such speculation and , for the French press , controversy , merely underlined Armstrong 's ability to dominate the agenda one year after his valedictory speech on the Champs Elysées , in which he lambasted those who harbour sceptical thoughts about the sport 's freedom from banned drugs .
It has indeed been a busy 11½ months for Armstrong , what with speaking engagements , training for the New York marathon , his advisory work on George W Bush 's cancer commission , his three children by the marriage that ended in 2003 , and involvement with Discovery that has taken him to the Tour of California and the Giro d'Italia .
Additionally , his high - profile romance with the singer Sheryl Crowe ended in February , and as yet she does not seem to have been replaced .
He has also been active on the legal front , resolving the various cases left over from his cycling career .
Most recently , the fallout continued from allegations in the newspaper L'Equipe last August that the blood - doping agent erythropoietin had been found in some of his urine samples from the 1999 Tour during research in France 's main anti - doping laboratory .
Never one to aim his sights low , in June Armstrong wrote to the International Olympic Committee requesting that Dick Pound be removed from his post as head of the World Anti - Doping Agency , for his alleged role in the affair .
Pound has rejected an official report 's claim that he instructed the lab to target Armstrong and it is unclear what will happen next .
Ironically , in view of that controversy , it is as a proponent of his sport 's image that he announced he would turn up at the Tour , as well as in his official role as part - owner of Discovery . ""
With all that happened before the start [ of the 2006 Tour ] , I feel as if the sport and even the event needs fans and supporters right now , "" Armstrong said shortly after the expulsion of his old rivals Jan Ullrich and Ivan Basso amid blood - doping allegations .
"" It 's not the time for me to run and hide .
I need to stand up and say how great cycling and the racing is . ""
Armstrong 's return to the Tour will only add to the intrigue as the race enters its decisive phase .
Since Friday 's stage win by his former Discovery Channel teammate Yaroslav Popovych in front of Rabobank 's Oscar Freire , there has been speculation that Discovery reached an informal agreement , in return for the stage win , that they might help Rabobank as they try to put Denis Menchov in the yellow jersey .
That merely reflects how tightly balanced the race is going into the triptych of Alpine stages that should sort out the finishing order , beginning with today 's finish at the Alpe .
It is at least 30 years since the Tour has been so open at this point ; five candidates for overall victory separated by two and a half minutes , with only five days ' racing before the finishing promenade to Paris .
On paper the race is Floyd Landis 's to lose .
As the field took a pause from hostilities in this appropriately - named town , he was 1min 29sec behind Oscar Pereiro , to whom he willingly gave up the lead on Saturday to preserve his team - mates ' strength .
His assumption is that Pereiro will perform no better in the Alps than he did in the Pyrenees .
If the Spaniard falters as expected , Landis has a 1min 1sec lead on Menchov , with Cadel Evans , Carlos Sastre and Andreas Klöden between 1min 17sec and 2min 29sec further adrift .
But events so far suggest that Landis and the other "" heads "" are vulnerable to a long - distance attack from a contender further down the standings but not too far adrift , such as Christophe Moreau or Popovych .
Until tomorrow evening at La Toussuire all bets are off .
And Armstrong 's presence will be a reminder how different life was for the race under the iron grip of "" le boss "" ."
2006-07-22,"SUNDAY GAP
On a rather barren hillside outside this grim little town , there is a little plaque on ' Lance Armstrong 's corner ' , the hairpin where the seven - time winner made an impromptu exit from the course in 2003 to avoid a crash victim , Joseba Beloki of Spain , and cut down to rejoin the road through a steep , rutted field of sweetcorn .
Three years on , the episode still fascinates cycle tourists , who organise a ride down the slope each summer .
MONDAY GAP
A day when the local wannabe cycling fans take early - morning spins with a difference - they buzz up and down the roads outside Gap hoping to meet up with the Tour men as they take the obligatory leg - spinner on their rest day and hitch lifts on the back of the group , which in sporting terms is like bringing out the half - time waterbottles at Twickenham .
The Observer catches up with Bradley Wiggins and his team - mate Stephane Auge .
The chat is pleasant until we tackle a small hill without changing pace .
They do n't seem to be breathing , so before cardiac arrest sets in I make my excuses and do a U - turn .
Floyd Landis , meanwhile , is pottering through the mountains with a biggish bloke in a black jersey - sideboards , late fifties , bit of a tummy on him , reasonably stylish in spite of all that .
Eddy Merckx ( left ) has come to visit his son Axel , who is about to prove Landis 's most handy team - mate in the mountains .
TUESDAY L'ALPE
D'HUEZ One cycle tourist among thousands spins up the Tour 's toughest mountain - top finish in an anonymous black - and - red jersey this morning .
The piercing blue eyes and square jaw are somehow familiar .
Lance Armstrong is back on the race after just under a year 's absence .
There is no grandstand welcome , for he and the Tour organisers declared a cold war after last August 's allegations in the newspaper L'Equipe that erythropoietin had been found in his urine samples from the 1999 race .
He is also en froid with the French press over his derogatory joke about Les Bleus at the ESPY awards and his interview with French television that morning is tense .
With Armstrong is the actor Jake Gyllenhaal , tipped to play the Texan when the inevitable biopic is made .
At 4 am on Wednesday the pair are seen sitting discreetly , plus security detail , in the Igloo nightspot .
All in the interest of research , no doubt .
WEDNESDAY
LA TOUSSUIRRE Floyd Landis falls apart .
The Tour has seen nothing like this in a yellow jersey - wearer of this stature in years .
The following day , however , his comeback earns him more popularity in seven hours than Armstrong achieved in seven years .
THURSDAY
MORZINE
To a chalet high above the village for a party being thrown in honour of the Tour 's director , Jean - Marie Leblanc , who retires at the end of the year after a 17-year tenure , in which he has managed the race 's growth into one of the world 's great sports events .
The obligatory gifts from the locale are presented - Leblanc is awarded a share in two local cows but still manages to sound delighted .
Later , the director joins up with some Parisian mates and plies a fine clarinet as they belt out trad jazz standards .
It 's hard to imagine turning up in a bar and finding Bernie Ecclestone or Sepp Blatter impersonating Acker Bilk .
With pleasing symmetry , Leblanc 's last Tour is ending like his first in 1989 , where Greg LeMond and Laurent Fignon 's race - long duel closed with LeMond winning by eight seconds ; Landis 's epic ride today means the race will come down to three men , Landis , Oscar Pereiro and the Spaniard Carlos Sastre , separated by just 30sec .
FRIDAY MACON Hot .
Damned hot .
Matteo Tosatto 's ( left ) stage win is almost lost in the heat haze .
It is the first this Tour for an Italian , the first for Tom Boonen 's Quickstep .
But it barely rates as an amuse bouche compared with Saturday 's main course .
SATURDAY LE CREUSOT / MONTCEAU LES MINES
We have been here before , literally and metaphorically .
The start and finish are reversed , but this is almost a carbon copy of the time trial where Marco Pantani clinched the 1998 Tour following what was , until this year , cycling 's biggest ever drugs scandal .
Back then I was one of the optimists who believed those events might herald a cleaner sport , clinging fondly to the belief that Pantani might have won the Tour ' clean ' .
Eight years after that , all those who follow cycling are a sadder , wiser and more cynical collective .
Eight years from today , how will this Tour and Floyd Landis fit into that bigger picture ?"
2006-07-23,"Floyd Landis of the Phonak Hearing Systems team was confirmed as the Tour de France champion after the final stage finished on the Champs Elysees today .
The American beat Caisse D'Epargne 's Oscar Pereiro by 59 seconds to succeed compatriot Lance Armstrong , who won the event for the previous seven years before retiring from the sport as champion .
Thor Hushovd took the honours for Credit Agricole in the prestigious final stage , edging out Davitamon 's green jersey winner Robbie McEwen in a sprint finish , meaning the Norwegian won both the first and the last stage of the Tour ."
2006-07-23,"In 11 months ' time the Tour de France circus will arrive in London for the great race 's first ever grand départ from these shores .
It is unlikely to arrive in any more certain a state than when it rolled into Paris yesterday for the sprint on the Champs - Elysées , won by Thor Hushovd .
To start with , it is unclear whether the first winner of the era after Lance Armstrong will actually make it to The Mall and Buckingham Palace next July .
Floyd Landis completed his victory as expected over the weekend but he will have a hip replacement in the next few weeks and he will then enter territory where no cyclist of his level has been before .
The former Mennonite mountain biker may recover in time for London or he may not .
By some quirk of fate races in the sixth year of a decade tend to be anachronistic , tucked between the reigns of two great champions , often with an unexpected result .
The Dane Bjarne Riis , for example , won in 1996 , which saw the end of Miguel Indurain ; 10 years earlier was Bernard Hinault 's last Tour , with his absorbing duel with Greg LeMond .
The pattern of this Tour was different from the controlled , largely predictable , years of Armstrong , with Landis 's team unwilling to take a grip of events .
Seven riders wore the yellow jersey , close to the record , while the outcome was in doubt until halfway through the final time - trial .
As late as Saturday morning , Landis , Oscar Pereiro and Carlos Sastre were all potential winners , with 30 seconds between them , and Landis 's winning margin at the end , 57 seconds , was the closest since his fellow American LeMond 's eight - second victory in 1989 .
There were some intriguing patterns .
The men at the top of the standings were familiar faces : Andreas Kloden finished second in 2004 , Oscar Pereiro has twice finished 10th , Cadel Evans and Carlos Sastres are hardly spring chickens .
A little further below them , however , there is a new generation , represented by the Italian Damiano Cunego , who took the best young rider 's award ; the Luxembourgeois Franck Schleck , who won at L'Alpe d'Huez , and the German Marcus Fothen .
At least two home cyclists should be at the start in London , assuming Bradley Wiggins decides he wants to return to the race after finishing his first Tour yesterday .
Wiggins will grow in confidence and his fellow Briton David Millar finished in style , taking 11th place in Saturday 's time - trial and then escaping twice yesterday on the Champs - Elysées .
At one point Wiggins was active in the chase behind him .
The 2006 Tour began with the biggest doping scandal in cycling history , which is saying something given the abundance of disgrace that preceded the ejection of Jan Ullrich , Ivan Basso and Francisco Mancebo , plus four of Alexandr Vinokourov 's Astana team .
The race reached its climax , however , with one of the most surprising mountain stages in the race 's history last Thursday .
It was a reminder , if it were needed , that while cycling can plumb the depths , it can also scale colossal heights of suspense and fortitude .
It would have been reasonable , perhaps , to expect a strong message from the Tour winner about the incident that shook the race before it had started and which is likely to shape cycling in the next few months , if not years , as the legal ramifications rumble on .
But Landis did not seem willing to connect with the issue on Saturday and hid behind platitudes .
After being pressed on the subject he came up with this : "" In this sport it 's clear we do more than other sports to prevent doping and solve the problem .
We have a reputation that seems not to want to go away .
It 's up to every child 's parents to explain to them when they are watching the race what the best decisions are about . ""
This was a Tour where the favourites disappeared amid murky allegations and , as one revelation from the Spanish police followed another , no one seemed to have any idea just how much drug - taking was or was not going on , if Wiggins ' view is typical .
"" I thought the sport was cleaner [ before the scandal ] but I 've given up predicting anything , "" he said .
"" You just do n't know .
I do n't know any more . ""
If that is the view of someone at the sharp end , who could forgive the fans for being confused if not sceptical ?
Perhaps this year 's doping scandal was one too many , perhaps the viewing public were merely saturated with sport after the World Cup , but there was a distinct drop in television viewing figures for this year 's race , with German audiences down 43 % , those in America dropping 52 % and French viewers down 23 % for the first 16 days of the race , before Landis 's epic on the stage to Morzine redressed the balance .
There were also disconcerting gaps among the spectators , notably at Pla - de- Beret in Spain but also in the Alps , where L'Alpe d'Huez was less populous than usual , and at La Toussuire where relatively few spectators watched Floyd Landis struggle .
Even on Saturday 's final time - trial there were long stretches of road where the riders were racing entirely alone .
This is a new trend for the Tour and it will be intriguing to see if it is merely a one - off , particularly as the French had their best Tour in at least 10 years , with Cyril Dessel and Christophe Moreau in the top 10 and six stages going to riders from French teams .
Hushovd 's finish sprint ahead of the points winner Robbie McEwen - taking the prize for the third time - provided a curiously symmetrical ending for the most surprising race in many years , as the Norwegian had also won the opening prologue in Strasbourg .
The Norwegian sandwich that enclosed the race was orderly enough ; the three - week filling , however , was a smorgasbord of surprises ."
2006-07-27,"Precisely a week ago , Floyd Landis produced a miraculous ride on the last stage in the Alps of the Tour de France .
He took the stage to Morzine with an epic lone escape , hauling himself back from 11th to third place -- within striking distance of the overall lead , which he duly took on Saturday and held into Paris to become the first winner of the Tour in the post - Lance Armstrong era .
His performance that day immediately acquired the mythic quality of great Tour exploits .
And that extraordinary comeback turned around the story of the Tour -- until then dominated by the ghastly debacle of favourites Ivan Basso and Jan Ullrich being forced to withdraw on the eve of the race because of their implication in a doping scandal .
Now , one week on , it is Landis who teeters on the brink of joining the ranks of disgraced and discredited riders .
His team , Phonak , has confirmed that it has been notified by the international governing body , the UCI , that Landis 's test after Stage 17 showed "" an unusual level of testosterone / epitestosterone "" -- an anabolic steroid which can be used to aid recovery .
If the fail - safe B sample shows the same result , then Landis faces disqualification from the Tour and suspension from racing .
It might well end his career , but that 's collateral damage compared to the ruin of the prestige of professional cycle sport and the Tour itself .
Already this year , viewing figures for the Tour were well down .
People voted with their fingers on their TV remotes and went elsewhere .
Frankly , sponsoring a professional cycling team seems such a liability these days , it 's amazing any company will part with the necessary millions of Euros it takes to keep a squad on the road .
After the removal of those implicated in the Operation Puerto investigation , some of us naively thought that this might now be a somewhat cleaner Tour .
One team manager was quoted as saying that he believed only 7 - 8 % of the peloton might now be doping .
More fools
we , it seems , for even countenancing such vain hopes .
Landis 's performance on the road to Morzine will now be remembered not as heroic , gutsy and inspirational , but as phoney and boosted .
That cleverly - timed release during the Tour of the news about his hip problem ( requiring a hip replacement op ) now seems such a cynical ploy to win publicity and sympathy .
We 're all entitled to feel horribly cheated .
And it 's hard to see any way out of the jam we find ourselves in .
There have been calls to get the doctors out of the sport , but all that would achieve would be a return to the bad old days when riders doped themselves , ruining their long - term health by overdosing .
Then there are those who say we need to reinforce the anti - doping regime .
In fact , it has been improved in recent years ; it has become harder to cheat .
But the testers are always in a race with the dopers and usually playing catch - up .
In practice , doping is endemic in the sport , even down into the amateur ranks in Europe .
It is difficult to see how it will ever be totally eliminated .
Is there any chink of light in this dark picture ?
Two , I think .
First , it is better that the cheats get caught and exposed .
In the long run , that short - term pain is worth enduring : fear of getting caught is the only effective disincentive .
Second , one striking thing about Operation Puerto and now Landisgate is that the team managements have been united and tough in dealing with dopers .
The offenders might be their star performers , but if they 're caught , they 're out .
There is some value in that unity and consistency .
Many will feel , though , that the teams face both ways -- demanding the top results , but then freezing out the riders who feel they have no option but to dope in order to deliver them .
The riders ' attitude is that they are always the poor bloody infantry -- used , abused and ultimately expendable .
There is some truth in this , but it 's time they got past that ancient sense of grievance .
We 've seen the riders exercise their power in the past with sit - down protests and the like when there 's something they do n't like -- such as dangerous racing conditions .
Tackling doping is , if nothing else , about their livelihood and their health .
The one thing that might change the present dismal vista of pro cycle sport would be for the riders themselves to organise and take a collective stand against doping .
Declare an amnesty now , by all means , but then exercise zero tolerance ; create a culture of whistle - blowing ; and end the code of silence , the omerta , that protects the dope - cheats ."
2006-10-31,"Palmer High School in Colorado Springs is a fairly nondescript but typical American school building which would be almost invisible to weekend visitors were it not for the fact that the locals are happy to reveal its small role in the life of a legend .
It is claimed Lance Armstrong spent a difficult year of his academic career at this establishment , although they will also tell you that he has always been reticent about his attendance there and the school are encouraged not to overplay his patronage .
I mention this because the seven - times Tour de France winner and I are seemingly set on a collision course that thankfully will not take place on bikes .
We are both intending to line up in this weekend 's New York City Marathon and I have come to my old altitude training venue in Colorado to see if I can remind the body what it was like to be fit and raring to go rather than crocked and fearful of completing the distance .
Armstrong , too , is trying to rekindle something from the past .
The former triathlete apparently has always harboured plans to one day take up running marathons with real ambition and New York on Sunday is his first foray on the roads with nothing to sit on but his own reputation .
That reputation , coupled with an almost religious reverence among many of his fans , has led to some wild speculation about his possible performance on race day .
Paul Tergat and Stefano Baldini , the world record holder and the Olympic champion , are considered by one or two enthusiasts to be vulnerable to a kick finish from Lance as long as he can hang on for the first 26 miles or so .
Others with a stronger grip on reality have predicted a still potentially impressive 2hr 45mins based on his legendary cardiovascular abilities .
However it appears as though Armstrong has lately come to realise that this running lark may not be as easy as it looks .
He recently remarked how he has found the training more difficult than expected and has revised his predicted finishing time to something a little outside the three - hour mark , and that is why we could be destined to match strides in Central Park .
Having made the seemingly sensible decision to run my first marathon since London in 1998 based on a premise that sub - three hours was still a distinct possibility despite the advancing years , subsequent injuries have cast serious doubt on the wisdom of that decision .
When I watched James Cracknell agonisingly miss the three - hour mark by seconds at this year 's London event
I felt a twinge of shame that a rower , albeit of Olympic proportions , was able to run so fast and I had lapsed to a life of passive spectating or commentating .
Of course , despite enthusiasm and a lifetime of running , there is nothing more elusive or futile than the pursuit of fitness levels long since lost .
As many a sportsman or woman will testify you either keep up the age - old routines into old age or you kiss goodbye forever to any revival of former glories .
Perhaps golf may be a noble exception , otherwise witness the level playing field that age and calories can create in the numerous pro celebrity football matches on offer .
To see a pre - pubescent soap starlet skinning a one time footballing hero is undoubtedly more painful than some 1970s pop star still pulling on the Spandex and the platform shoes .
So it is that I beg forgiveness from the running fraternity if by some cruel twist of fate , or more likely hamstring , the cycling legend from Texas manages to crank through the gears a little more smoothly than yours truly in the latter stages .
The last three weeks have been a race against time to at least get to the start line and these last few days in my former training venue have been a frustrating and worrying experience .
The 2,000 m ( 6,500 ft ) altitude and the stunning Rocky Mountain scenery has always been an irresistible draw for the world 's best distance runners , cyclists and triathletes .
Now the trails also seem full of casual runners who go faster than seems reasonable and the thin air appears to be positively anorexic .
None the less I am still looking forward to heading up to New York and lining up with 40,000 others and , of course , Lance .
The two of us and others of so - called celebrity status become like everyone else once the race starts and will be engrossed in our battle to get to the end in whatever time it takes .
That said , if I spot one of those cycle outriders wearing a yellow jersey I would be just a little suspicious ."
2006-11-09,"The seven - times Tour de France winner Lance Armstrong yesterday confirmed that this year 's Tour of Italy victor Ivan Basso will ride for his Discovery Channel team next year .
"" It 's done .
We have found an agreement , "" said Armstrong .
The deal involves a two - year contract for the Italian .
Discovery will require him to give a DNA sample in an attempt to clear him of any involvement in the Operation Puerto doping inquiry .
He has refused to do so to date but may be bound by an agreement signed recently by the elite ProTour teams .
The 29-year - old Italian 's implication in the affair led to him being refused entry to this year 's Tour de France .
It also led to a breakdown in relations with his team , CSC , and their manager , Bjarne Riis , who hinted yesterday that Discovery had ignored an agreement among the ProTour teams not to field riders named in Puerto . ""
The ProTour teams displayed their intention a little while ago to keep from racing riders who were implicated in Puerto , "" said Riis .
"" In the end , in reality , individual interests have prevailed . ""
Basso was cleared to race by the Italian Olympic Committee 's disciplinary commission on October 12 as the case against him could not be proven .
The Italian Cycling Federation dropped its inquiry into the allegations on October 28 , although the International Cycling Union may take the case to the Tribunal for Arbitration in Sport .
Meanwhile at the trial of 10 former members of the Cofidis team in Nanterre on drugs charges , the team 's former doctor , Jean - François Menuet , denied knowing that the riders in his care were using doping substances .
"" I did what I could within the limits set down for me , "" he said , stating that he had used injections "" as placebos "" ."
2006-11-16,"It 's always the same : you go away for a couple of weeks and when you return the sporting world has been turned on its head .
It was bad enough in New York at the marathon , with Gary Lough getting the accolades instead of his baby - bound wife and the most reported runner on the day turned out to be a cyclist .
By the way , congratulations to Lance Armstrong -
you whipped my saddle well and good , even allowing for the biggest support team since you last raced on two wheels .
The sight of Hicham El Guerrouj opening your gel pack , Joan Benoit Samuelson acting as water carrier and Alberto Salazar as the running companion giving encouragement can command nothing but respect .
For my next epic cycle ride I am hoping Chris Boardman will carry the spares , with Miguel Indurain as pacemaker .
On returning home last weekend it seems there have been more strange goings on .
It 's impossible to avoid the Premiership in the US , but I had assumed that the huge cheers as we were crossing over the Queensboro Bridge from Queens to Manhattan were in support of our sterling efforts and not due to Tottenham 's turnover -
it turned out that Chelsea 's defeat at Tottenham happened at roughly the same time .
Confusion set in a couple of days later when an all - American United XI appeared to have been knocked out of the World Carling Series Cup by a team in the minor leagues .
Reports were also coming in of a diplomatic incident involving the French in the East End of London but , although out of character , Wenger 's exaggerated Gallic shrug would hardly warrant as an incident in the more volatile world of US sport .
Given the trend for the exchange of verbals , dirty looks and more in the technical areas , maybe it 's time to follow our friends across the pond and allocate one touchline to each team .
It might mean an extra official or two but then Mike Newell could be placed in charge of the expansion programme ensuring equality and representation .
Why is it that sensible and reasonable individuals can become so disconnected by the trauma of a poor football result that they make statements that could only be written in media training class as an example of what not to say ?
He 's not the first and wo n't be the last but his invitation to the Women 's Sports Foundation Christmas party has been revoked
but I 'm reliably informed he may be asked to attend next year 's Guy Fawkes Night party instead .
While we 're on the subject of sexual togetherness here 's another to support the silly season theory .
England won another badminton major mixed doubles title at the Danish Open recently but it was n't Gail Emms and Nathan Robertson .
They were beaten in the semis , but Anthony Clark and Donna Kellogg prevailed in the final .
Clark and Kellogg were beaten by Emms and Robertson in September 's world championship final but a changing of the guard could be in the air .
Rugby fans appear to be demanding the same after the latest inept display by Andy Robinson 's boys at Twickenham .
In a week of surprises the defeat by Argentina may well rank as the biggest of them all .
Bizarre as it may seem one or two of my friends were applauding the result as they are of the opinion that it will hasten Robinson 's departure .
They are both off to buy Springboks jerseys for the next instalment .
Of course you would never catch an Aussie turning against his team just to oust the coach , whatever his inadequacies .
Having castigated their supposedly ailing team less than 18 months ago they are now in support of the best team the world has seen .
This is where the world order thing needs some clarification after all of the above mentioned turmoil .
Are we supposed to win the Ashes or Australia ?
We look to be in for a pasting if current form is anything to go by .
It 's important to know those things as the reaction to an unexpected win is felt with an intensity that can induce Alan Pardew - like celebrations .
On the other hand defeat to those we consider inferior could lead one down the Mike Newell path of ignominious comment although in the case of the Aussies this may well be justified .
England 's cricketers therefore have a responsibility to come down on one side of the fence or the other .
Favourite or underdog ?
I favour the latter , as the current trend for sporting surprises is one I 'd like to see continue and turning the odds inside out down under might just put everything right again until next time
I go away ."
2006-12-11,"Discovery Channel , the team run by the seven - times Tour de France winner Lance Armstrong , faces conflict with the body governing professional cycling teams after it voted to exclude Discovery for contravening its voluntary ethical code .
Members of the International Professional Cycling Teams ' body claim that by hiring the Giro d'Italia winner , Ivan Basso , Discovery went counter to an agreement reached in October that teams contesting the ProTour circuit would not sign riders who were implicated in police investigations into possible drug use .
Basso was excluded from the Tour de France in June over his possible involvement in the Spanish blood - boosting inquiry , Operation Puerto , but was cleared to race when the Italian Olympic Committee said in mid - October that he had no case to answer .
"" The line is clear , "" said one manager .
"" There is no question of hiring a cyclist involved in Puerto . ""
The only other ICPT member to sign a rider implicated in Puerto , the Italian squad Lampre , have since parted company with Giampaolo Caruso .
However Johan Bruyneel , the team 's manager and the man who masterminded Armstrong 's Tour wins , has not excluded the option of taking legal action against the ICPT .
After signing Basso , Armstrong said that his team were acting within the code .
"" I saw no basis in stopping me from hiring the best cyclist in the world .
When the accusations fell against Basso we had four specialist lawyers , who looked at all the rules and ethical codes , come to the conclusion that there was nothing legally prohibiting us to reach an agreement . ""
Meanwhile Floyd Landis , this year 's Tour de France winner , said that he may not race again if his defence against a positive test for testosterone fails .
"" If I lost , I 'm not sure I could carry on .
I was n't the highest - paid cyclist and it 's looking like this might cost me $ 500,000 , "" Landis said in an interview yesterday .
His case is due to be heard next month ."
2006-12-21,"In the most unequivocal message from any British official regarding next year 's Tour de France start in London , Brian Cookson , the president of the national governing body , British Cycling , said yesterday that riders involved in current doping inquiries should not be at the start of the 2007 showcase .
"" This will be a historic event , in the heart of one of the world 's great cities , a fantastic opportunity for our sport , "" Cookson said , adding : "" We really do not want to see this tarnished by a repeat of the doping scandals of 2006 , so , frankly , we urge all those with involvement in the various investigations to stay away . ""
Cookson 's statement comes against a background of controversy following the decision of Lance Armstrong 's team , Discovery , to hire the Italian Ivan Basso , one of the group of cyclists expelled from the 2006 Tour shortly before the race began over their possible implication in the Operation Puerto blood - doping inquiry .
The Italian Olympic Committee has ruled that Basso has no case to answer but other team managers feel that Discovery has broken an agreement that no squad would hire any rider alleged to be implicated in Puerto .
Cookson yesterday urged all teams to implement their ethical charter in full .
The German Jan Ullrich , along with Basso the most high - profile victim of the pre - Tour purge , has reiterated his desire to return to the sport in spite of the fact he is currently without a racing licence or team .
Ullrich said he would race for a team outside the elite ProTour circuit if they could guarantee him one last tilt at either the Giro d'Italia or the Tour of Spain .
To date , no sporting sanctions have been taken against any cyclist implicated in Operation Puerto , and there is no immediate prospect of action as the judge leading the inquiry has forbidden the International Cycling Union from using evidence collated by the Spanish police .
There are , however , further allegations of the large sums involved in the alleged drugs ring .
According to leaked documents published in the Spanish magazine Interviu , riders paid up to € 70,000 ( £ 47,000 ) for the services of the doctor at the centre of the network , Eufemiano Fuentes .
The magazine published hand - written accounts which appear to reveal that one member of the ring , code - named Asterix , may have been paid € 150,000 ."
2006-12-28,"In a year that saw no shortage of scandal , sensation and celebrity litigation , there have been some landmark decisions that have shaped the law and provided for a more coherent approach to censuring the media 's excesses while safeguarding its underlying rights to publish them .
A string of libel actions featuring film stars ( Kate Hudson , Sharon Stone ) , musicians ( Elton John ) , magicians ( Paul McKenna ) , politicians ( Tommy Sheridan ) , soccer stars ( Wayne Rooney , Ashley Cole ) , a cyclist ( Lance Armstrong ) and the Da Vinci Code copyright case kept the high court busy .
Meanwhile , the House of Lords has revived the Reynolds defence of qualified privilege and the court of appeal has made it clear that we now have an established privacy tort .
There have also been some welcome concessions to greater openness in family proceedings .
The select committee on constitutional affairs published its long - awaited report on conditional fee agreements in defamation actions but offered little comfort to the media .
It considered that : "" Given the power of the press , it is right that people should have a remedy when have been defamed . ""
A move towards some cost - capping wo n't remove the media 's main cause of complaint - celebrity litigants abusing the process .
In relation to intellectual property , Andrew Gowers published his review of recommendations for stronger enforcement measures and penalties for online infringement .
A backlog of freedom of information requests prompted the information commissioner to call for more cash , while providing Lord Falconer , secretary of state for constitutional affairs , with an excuse to look at tightening up rules about the use of civil servants ' time that may make it even more difficult for the media to obtain information .
Lord Justice Sedley called for privacy and libel reforms that would provide for proactive protection of reputational and privacy rights through statutory regulation .
And the PCC Chairman , Sir Christopher Meyer , warned us that press freedom was under fire from a political process keen to erode it .
What is interesting when reviewing the various judgments is the subtle and overdue shift when it comes to the application of human rights law .
Its principles have become entrenched in legal argument and decision - as seen in the court of appeal 's judgment in McKennitt v Ash - rather than being incidentally included or ignored , as had happened in the Wainwright case .
Back in 2003 , some six months before deciding Naomi Campbell was entitled to privacy protection , the House of Lords had decided not to recognise invasion of privacy as a cause of action in a case concerning an unwarranted strip search .
Delivering its judgment in September 2006 , the European court of human rights found that the Wainwrights ' privacy had been invaded and that failure to recognise this also constituted a breach of Article 13 of the convention .
This provides for a right to effective remedy and this had been violated "" in particular because there was no general tort of invasion of privacy "" in the UK .
The McKennitt case demonstrates the seismic shift seen in recent privacy actions .
The courts have gone from being in denial of privacy per se as a cause of action to fully embracing it and acknowledging the European court ruling in Hannover v Germany that an interest in someone or their celebrity status does not of itself justify invasion of their privacy .
Delivering a potential killer blow to the kiss'n'tell , the court of appeal upheld Loreena McKennitt 's right to privacy over the freedom of expression Ms Ash and her publisher had sought to rely on .
So where someone 's privacy has been invaded the courts will protect it unless some significant level of public interest is engaged that justifies the invasion .
This approach was n't available to Elton John earlier in the year when he failed to secure an injunction to prevent publication of pictures of him outside his house .
While we do n't know if he was ' popping out for a pint of milk ' ( which the court considered to be fair game for photographers in Campbell v Mirror ) , the McKennitt rationale should allow for such injunctions to succeed in future .
However , all was not lost for Elton who did secure a £ 100,000 libel payout in May over a Daily Mail article making unfounded allegations about his instructions on etiquette for those attending the White Tie and Tiara ball he had hosted last year .
Meanwhile a ' well known ' adulterer was granted an injunction against being named and shamed by the irate husband of the woman he 'd been bedding .
Mr Justice Eady decided it was appropriate to protect his privacy .
This is in stark contrast to the far from private mudslinging match in the Mucca v Macca divorce battle .
While Heather Mills got mauled by the tabloids in the summer , the autumn saw more of the rule book go out of the window as pages of divorce petition were leaked .
July saw hypnotherapist Paul McKenna win damages from the Mirror after it failed to justify its story about bogus qualifications and ' colourful ' Scottish politician Tommy Sheridan won a whopping £ 200,000 libel award from the News of the World .
From one colourful Scottish politician to another and George Galloway provided both precedent and entertainment this year .
The year got off to a good start for Galloway after the Telegraph failed in its appeal against his libel award .
And he will certainly be for outing the ' Fake Sheikh ' Mazher Mahmood .
Having outwitted Sven last year , Mahmood did n't con George who turned the tables and threatened to publish a picture of the Fake Sheikh .
When not paying out large libel awards or defending the actions of its Fake Sheikh , the News of the World was disgraced by the subterfuge scandal surrounding its Royal reporter Clive Goodman .
Having pleaded guilty to plotting to intercept mobile phone messages - notably those relating to the Royal family - he faces a jail term .

2007-02-13,"The latest round in the feud between the seven - times Tour de France winner Lance Armstrong and Dick Pound has gone the Texan 's way after the head of the World Anti - Doping Agency was rebuked by the IOC for loose talk about doping matters , a decision hailed by the cyclist in a New York Times interview as "" a victory "" .
Armstrong had called for the Wada to strip Pound of his post after he speculated that the cyclist might have used the banned blood - booster erythropoietin during the 1999 Tour .
Pound 's comment followed the allegation that a French laboratory had found the substance in six urine samples delivered by Armstrong during the race when they were tested retroactively in 2005 .
An inquiry by cycling 's governing body , the UCI , subsequently ruled that he had no case to answer .
The IOC 's ethics commission stated on February 2 that Pound had "" the obligation to exercise greater prudence consistent with the Olympic spirit when making public pronouncements that may affect the reputation of others "" .
That fell short of Armstrong 's request for his dismissal but the American said : "" I hope this establishes a certain precedent that the head of Wada has to act a certain way in public . ""
Pound v Armstrong is a peripheral issue , however , given the turf war between race organisers and the UCI which threatens to split the sport in two .
That took a serious turn yesterday when the organiser of Italy 's major races followed France and Spain in rejecting the UCI ProTour 's criteria for entry to its events .
RCS , which runs the Giro , Milan - San Remo and the Tour of Lombardy , refused to admit the Belgian Unibet.com team , the latest addition to the UCI 's ProTour series which is supposed to guarantee entry to major events worldwide .
RCS has also issued only provisional invitations to four other ProTour teams .
The governing body last week threatened to take steps against the Tour organiser ASO when it did not let Unibet into the opening ProTour event , Paris - Nice , and it believes its authority is being challenged ."
2007-02-27,"Jan Ullrich announced yesterday in Hamburg he is retiring from competition at the age of 33 , drawing the curtain on a career that promised world domination but ended with a whimper and a whiff of scandal .
Ullrich read out a lengthy statement in front of a large portrait of himself which said it all : the picture was taken in 1997 , when he won the Tour de France at the tender age of 23 .
He was tipped by the Tour legend , Bernard Hinault , to dominate the event for the next seven years , but that 1997 win - the first by a German - was not to be repeated , partly due to the rise of Lance Armstrong and also because Ullrich squandered his talent .
He would finish second in five further Tours .
The German 's future had been on hold since June 30 last year when he was excluded from the Tour de France over his alleged implication in a Spanish police inquiry into possible blood doping .
He was subsequently sacked by his sponsor , T - Mobile , who had backed him for all bar one of his 11 seasons as a professional cyclist , but said yesterday he had received seven firm offers to race this season .
While the outcome of the Spanish inquiry , Operation Puerto , remains unclear , Ullrich is also being investigated by the Swiss Cycling Federation and a Bonn prosecutor over the affair .
Yesterday Ullrich maintained his innocence .
"" I have never cheated in my career .
I still do n't understand [ the exclusion ] .
My career as a sportsman fell apart that day .
I have been condemned without being judged ...
I feel like a criminal even though I have done nothing wrong . ""
Ullrich won the world amateur road race title in Oslo in 1993 .
At 22 , he took the first of his five runner - up slots in the Tour and his 1997 title was greeted with massive adulation in Germany .
But after the 1997 race , his career began to follow a pattern : he would put on weight in the winter and struggle to lose it in the build - up to the following year 's Tour .
Ullrich managed three further titles : the 1999 and 2001 world time - trial championships , and the 2000 Olympic road race in Sydney .
But he became best known as the fall - guy in Armstrong 's run of seven Tour wins .
A notable exception was 2002 , which summed up Ullrich 's potential and his ability to mismanage it .
He damaged a knee while weight - training and had to miss the Tour .
While in rehab he popped out to a nightclub and was , he later said , provided with some pills by a stranger .
T - Mobile tested him and he was found to be positive for amphetamine .
Ullrich will now do public relations for the Austrian second division team , Volksbank , but the fact that he will work with their young riders is already raising hackles .
"" What happened to him last summer was pitiful , but this is a descent into hell , "" said the former head of the German cycling federation , Sylvia Schenk .
Not quite , it is merely the latest in 10 years of anti - climaxes .
Britain in clover Britain 's track selectors face some difficult decisions before next month 's world championships in Mallorca after the team won eight gold medals at the weekend 's World Cup round in Manchester .
That also bodes well for the build - up to the Beijing and London Olympics , said the performance director Dave Brailsford .
"" At one time everyone was pointing at the fact that we only had one generation of riders , which came through at Sydney and Athens .
The weekend showed that that generation is going faster than ever
but now we have a younger generation which is faster than everyone else .
We have strength in depth and breadth now .
"" Brailsford was referring to the emergence of young talents such as the sprinters Anna Blyth - a silver medallist in Saturday 's women 's 500 m time - trial - and Jason Kenny .
He also said that Britain now had two world - class women 's pursuiters in Rebecca Romero and Wendy Houvenhagel , who on Saturday beat the national record set by the Sydney Olympics bronze medallist Yvonne McGregor ."
2007-04-14,"Elizabeth Edwards is moving along the line at the Iowa headquarters for her husband John Edwards 's presidential campaign .
As outstretched hands reach towards her a burly man in a leather jacket gives her a Lance Armstrong Live Strong bracelet .
Mrs Edwards stares at the yellow rubber ring .
"" I have one of these , "" she says .
Since March 22 when Mr and Mrs Edwards called a press conference to announce the recurrence of the cancer first detected in 2004 , she has been one of the most visible people in America with the disease .
And the manner in which she has chosen to live with it - by carrying on her husband 's campaign for the Democratic leadership - has been the subject of endless discussion .
Columnists told Mr Edwards to put away his ambitions and tend to his wife .
Women with breast cancer told Mrs Edwards to focus on building a store of memories for her children .
Radio talk - show host Rush Limbaugh said she should use her last days to get closer to God .
Twenty years ago , when Ronald Reagan was president , his wife , Nancy , had a breast removed because of cancer .
The White House did not hold a briefing for reporters , and Mrs Reagan 's doctors would not discuss her prognosis , or plans for the future .
That is not Mrs Edwards 's way .
"" Times have changed , "" she told the Guardian .
"" We have come to a different place , and the extent to which you can talk openly about it says a lot of things .
One is that we need to be open about the problems that face us . ""
Mrs Edwards , 56 , has been remarkably open since that day last month .
The news was not good .
The cancer that was detected in her breast in November 2004 - the day after John Kerry and Mr Edwards lost the presidential election - had returned .
It had spread to her bones , and was incurable .
But , confounding expectations , Mr Edwards said his campaign for the White House would go on .
His wife would also be on the trail - this week she was in Iowa .
She looks healthy , tanned and fit .
The hair which she lost during the earlier treatment has regrown , and there is no outward sign of flagging energy .
Iowa is a demanding state .
As the first state on the primary calendar , the 125,000 or so activists who take part in the caucuses wield extraordinary power , and they take their responsibility seriously .
Since January , barely a day has gone by without at least one Democratic presidential candidate visiting the state .
Some of the more dedicated activists say they have managed to meet two or three would - be presidents a week .
Minutes after arriving at the headquarters , Mrs Edwards was holding forth on her husband 's healthcare policy , and on veterans ' benefits , and smiling gamely at the woman who pushed forward for a hug saying : "" Do n't you remember ?
We met last Wednesday .
"" Mrs Edwards sees her transparency about her cancer and her options for treatment as key parts of the campaign .
This is illness as metaphor .
"" Voters are going to know everything they need to know - or think they might need to know - about us , about what is important to us , about what happens to us , because they have a right to know .
So it was never a question for us whether we would stonewall or mislead about this . ""
But at the same time she fears her illness may cloud the message of her husband 's campaign .
"" It is part of the cult of personality that I think muddles the political process .
It may be fine for Hollywood but when we talk about politics and the important issues coming up we need not to be focused on personality . ""
Days after Mrs Edwards discovered the return of her disease , Tony Snow , the White House press secretary , announced he had a spot on his liver .
Two of the frontrunners in the race for the Republican leadership , Rudy Giuliani and John McCain , are cancer survivors .
Mr Giuliani had prostate cancer , and Mr McCain has had skin cancers .
Another contender , Fred Thompson , announced this week that he had lymphoma but was in remission .
But Mrs Edwards 's illness is active , the uncontrollable element in a political process that is usually run according to a rigid script .
On the ground , the emotion is palpable .
As Mrs Edwards works the room , people call out that they are praying for her , they are proud of her .
One woman comes up to tell Mrs Edwards that her pastor 's wife recently had a recurrence of cancer , 12 years after it was first diagnosed .
Mrs Edwards 's refusal to give up on the campaign was an inspiration ; she was doing a lot of good work with her illness .
Mrs Edwards 's smile tightens .
"" I do n't always see it as a plus .
I 've got to tell you that , "" she says .
Even before her 2004 diagnosis , Mrs Edwards represented a kind of emotional endurance .
A navy brat , who grew up on military bases all across the US as well as in Japan , she met Mr Edwards in law school - a detour for her from doctoral studies in English .
Until 1996 , the couple had an idealised life .
Then their eldest child , their son , Wade , was killed in a car crash at the age of 16 .
Mrs Edwards 's description of her grief in a memoir published last year is painful reading .
The couple went on to have two more children : Emma Claire , eight , and Jack , six .
Their daughter , Cate , is 25 .
A Democratic consultant who accompanied Mrs Edwards on her book tour says there were women who had lost children at every signing , and women who were recovering for cancer .
For them , the return of Mrs Edwards 's disease was personally devastating .
"" It was probably my worst day - just facing the reality , just thinking : ' OK .
This could happen to me too , ' "" says Linda Sibley , a teacher who came to hear Mrs Edwards speak at an educational conference in Ames , Iowa .
Ms Sibley was at home recovering from a double mastectomy when Mrs Edwards announced her cancer had returned .
Ms Sibley , a single mother whose children range in age from 22 to two - year - old twins , was torn .
"" I obviously felt a lot of compassion for her but also it was a personal thing too because I had just undergone a mastectomy , "" she says .
Messages of support have been pouring in to Mrs Edwards .
"" It is enormously supportive .
People say nice things to me .
It always feels good , "" she says .
But as she carries on campaigning with a disease she acknowledges will kill her much sooner than she had anticipated , it seems she is trying to deflect some of that sympathy . ""
In truth there are men and women across the country who get pretty dire diagnoses , and still go forward with their lives .
Some of them go to tough jobs the next day .
I go and get applause .
I 'm easy street , and the real applause ought to be for those people who are continuing to work without a cheering section . ""
But do n't mistake that for surrender .
Mrs Edwards admits she has turned her thoughts to preparing her children for the time when she is too weak to campaign and for her eventual death .
"" I have every expectation that I will continue the campaign and see out the election .
I am going to be around for a while . """
2007-05-04,"My former fiance , Lance Armstrong , taught me that if you live purely and try really , really hard , you can beat any odds and surprise everyone .
Except the cynics .
Those idiots are always going to have some suspicion about how you ca n't actually be a superhero .
But the message of my ongoing Save The Planet publicity tour is , you can !
Sure , I was joking about using just one square of tissue each time you go to the bathroom .
Unfortunately , I 've been forced to admit that I was n't joking about the backstage rider the press unearthed , in which I demand , among countless other necessities , four crew buses , three tractor trailers and six cars .
All I Wanna
Do is a big production number , you know ?
And , like my publicist claimed , it was from "" about 10 years ago "" .
Of its time , it would actually have been very restrained .
You should see what Shania asks for - she 's booking her place in the most globally warmed circle of hell , let me tell ya .
The other big announcement was that I 've designed a range of clothing with a special detachable "" dining sleeve "" that you can wipe your mouth on instead of a paper napkin .
Please do n't mention cloth napkins .
I like to think my invention echoes the apocryphal story about how America spent millions developing a pen that could write in space , while the Russians just used a pencil . ·

2007-05-11,"Amid the latest doping scandal to hit cycling , a quietly spoken Merseysider has been offered the opportunity of a lifetime .

2007-06-08,"The Col des Aravis is a phenomenal stretch of tarmac .
Before the road cleaves between two jagged , Alpine peaks , it winds itself upwards for 1,498 m , leaving an awesome vista in its wake .
Lance Armstrong used to train here .
It was the setting for Floyd Landis 's epic Stage 17 win in the 2006 Tour De France .
Every June sees 3,000 cyclists burn around the switchbacks in the Time - Megeve cyclosportive race .
This is hallowed ground in cycling .
"" You look like you 're hanging off that bike , "" says Mark as he pulls alongside in his car , handing me an ice - cold bottle of water out of the window .
"" Nicky 's picked the pace up so try and catch her on this last stretch . ""
Nicky Hughes , GPM10 's female team leader for this women 's training weekend , races bikes for a living .
I could catch her if I first removed both her wheels .
But Mark 's policy of using her as bait means I get up that ascent quicker than I thought possible .
As I arrive panting at the top of the Col she is nonchalantly perusing postcards . ""
Good riding , "" she says with a grin .
Praise indeed .
From their base in Chamonix , in the French Alps , GPM10 have been running performance training programmes for cyclists wishing to pit themselves against some of the toughest and most legendary of Europe 's climbs for the past three years .
It is an opportunity to ride like a pro .
Support car , spare wheels
, energy bars thrown at you whenever required and a bike mechanic on hand to deal with any niggling rattle or major crash .
All you have to do is focus on cycling better .
But until now , any women wishing to up the ante in their riding had to do it as a minority in a group of men .
The sight of 10 pairs of toned thighs shooting up a mountainside may be spectacular but it does little for your morale .
Which is not to say I find myself in half - hearted female company .
These girls mean business .
On the first night , as I stock up on calories in a Chamonix pizzeria I find myself sat at a table with two ironman competitors , an amateur racer and a doctor who has just got back from a sportive week in Italy .
But all seem convinced that a single - sex event was required .
Chamonix local Dawn Wood said : "" I would n't have come out on this weekend if it had n't been for women only .
I feel so much more confident and comfortable .
It 's mainly blokes who ride around here –
I just do n't seem to find any women to train with .
"" If there 's anywhere for the battle of the sexes to materialise it 's on a 14 km climb – no matter what anyone says , overtaking a bloke on one of those is a sweet victory .
Even if he is 80 .
This trip was always going to be interesting .
Forget bike geek , GPM10 is more bike chic .
The weekend starts with a stay in the gloriously modern Hotel Eden in Flegere , possibly the only hotel in the valley which does n't succumb to the temptation to hang a wooden pair of skis on the wall .
Upon arrival , GPM10 owner Mark Kneep sizes me up for one of his fleet of Serotta bikes which clients are able to test ride for the duration of their training .
I eventually find myself straddling a titanium / carbon Ottrott , which at about £ 5,000 , is not something I want to ride over a pothole on .
Taking it for a little spin I ride straight over a pothole .
"" How 's the bike feel ? "" asks Mark as I return . ""
Yep , yep , great , "" I gulp .
The plan for the weekend was to ride 100 km to Lake Annecy via Megève and Thônes and then 120 km back to Chamonix via the Col du Marais on day two .
It involves around 2,000 m of climbing per day - ride as hard or as easy as you like but if Mark decides there 's not enough time for ice - cream then there 's not enough time for ice - cream .
Riding in an alpine environment is inspiration in itself but knowing those roads have been ridden by every great name in cycling is even better .
Finish lines are sprayed across the top of summits , "" allez , allez ! "" is scrawled on walls , and descents you have only ever seen before on Tour de France coverage unravel before you .
Couple that with Mark yelling at you to sprint finish as he drives up behind and is it any wonder you ride the best you 've ever ridden ?
But then cycling in France is such a tradition it would be rude not to .
For anyone not used to racing , the trip is a great introduction .
For example , proper racers do not stop to take photos of alpine waterfalls .
When riding as part of a pack , make a hand signal before swerving to avoid a hole in the road or someone will get hurt .
And if tired , tuck yourself in behind someone else and get dragged along in their airflow .
There is a superb section of the trip from the top of the Aravis down and then up again to Megève where your legs can find a rhythm of their own .
And Lake Annecy is a great place to warm up tired thighs on day two as the route follows a shoreline cyclepath for around 20 km before a gentle slog up the Col du Marais .
Taking into account the odd burst lung , at no point during the 48 hours were the views less than breathtaking .
Two weeks of constant rainfall had left Chamonix and its surrounds lush and verdant .
"" I like having women on the trips , "" says Mark .
"" They respond really well to training .
Women want to test themselves in the same way as the men and we just prepare them for that in the best way .
These weekends are a chance for women to see there are others out there who want to ride as they do .

2007-07-06,"Of the two British favourites for today 's prologue time - trial , David Millar has the pedigree but said yesterday that he is "" riddled with self - doubt "" while the other , Bradley Wiggins , fell below his own standards last year but is adamant that he is in the form of his life .
Millar , who will next year move to the American - sponsored Slipstream team , won a longer than usual prologue time- trial at the Futuroscope theme park on his debut in the Tour in 2000 , beating Lance Armstrong among others , then crashed while in contention in 2001 and was narrowly beaten in 2003 .
This year , he has predicted that two men should fight it out :
Wiggins and the Swiss Fabian Cancellara , winner recently of both time - trial stages in the Tour of Switzerland .
The other favourites for this afternoon 's brief , intense test of strength include last year 's winner , Thor Hushovd , the Australian Michael Rogers and the 2001 winner , Christophe Moreau of France .
"" Brad has raised his game , which is good - hats off to him , "" said Millar . ""
But Cancellara is going to be the man to beat , he 's on fire .
If I come good I can go really well . ""
There , however , is the rub : Millar does not feel his form has come to hand as it should have following his victory in the prologue to the Paris - Nice "" Race to the Sun "" in early March .
Yesterday Millar was deeply pessimistic about his form .
"" I have never spent so long feeling so horrible .
I 'm a little nervous , a lot nervous .
What feels different is my confidence .
I 'm riddled with self - doubt .
I 've no doubt about the abyss I 'm going into .
""
Earlier Millar said he had over - trained in spring in the build - up to the race . ""
On a psychological level the last couple of months could have been a lot easier , "" he said .
If either Briton should win , as well as earning the right to wear the yellow jersey on tomorrow 's stage through Kent he will be following in something of a recent national tradition .
Chris Boardman 's victories in the prologue in 1994 , 1997 and 1998 and Millar 's win in 2000 mean that this is the one area of the Tour in which this country can be said to specialise ."

2008-07-12,"The dark clouds over the eighth stage of the Tour de France were metaphorical as well as literal after the reappearance of a subject that has been lurking in the shadows since the race began in Brest , eight days ago .
Manuel Beltran 's positive test for EPO , confirmed on Friday evening , remained the main topic of conversation .
At 37 , Beltran , a trusted lieutenant of Lance Armstrong during the final three of the American 's seven Tour wins , is unlikely to re - emerge ; it is he who now lurks in the shadows .
The veteran was reportedly targeted by testers at the start in Brest and subjected to blood and urine tests .
It was a urine sample , given after the first stage , that contained traces of EPO .
Beltran rides for Italian team Liquigas , whose general manager , Roberto Amadio , described the Spaniard 's offence as an isolated case .
He said that if the Spaniard 's B - sample is also positive , Beltran will be fired and could be sued for damages .
David Millar , the Scot who served a two - year doping ban in 2004 and now acts as the peloton 's unofficial anti - doping spokesman , appeared as angry as anyone as he emerged from his team bus in the morning . '
It makes me pissed off that anyone 's surprised we 've had a positive test , ' Millar said . '
If anybody 's naive enough to think we 're never going to have a positive control again , you may as well go home and not cover this race .
This is no way going to be the last positive test we 're going to have ; as long as there are doping controls , there will be positives .
At least this shows the controls are working . '
Patrice Clerc , president of Tour organisers ASO , also sought to put the case in perspective . '
We have to stay calm , ' he said . '
It is ordinary that , with 180 riders at the start , there is a positive test .
I 'm always surprised when , in big sporting events , no one gets caught . '
Beltran exited the Tour - and , in all probability , the sport - via Toulouse Airport in the afternoon , destined for the family olive farm in Jaén in southern Spain .
His parting words were , to say the least , ambiguous . '
I wish to express my desire that neither my team nor my colleagues are harmed by these events , ' he said .
' I will request a test of the B sample and ask that the presumption of innocence be respected until we have the results . '"
2008-07-12,"ST BRIEUC , SUNDAY
Confirming the feeling that the Tour is trying to move on from the Lance Armstrong era , the triple victor Greg LeMond turns up for a couple of days .
Much is made of him , partly because he is not the Texan .
More to the point , he has not been to the Tour in officio since 1994 , and he responds by turning up the heat in the spitting , bubbling conflict between the Tour organiser ASO and the International Cycling Union .
The ICU , says Greg , should restrict itself to issuing licences rather than getting involved in the commercial aspects of the sport .
Music to ASO 's ears , while the ICU president Pat McQuaid responds that LeMond does not know what he is talking about .
NANTES , MONDAY Bernard Hinault , five times winner of the Tour , has lost none of his old fire .
A demonstrator leaps on to the winner 's podium at the finish and is duly decked by ' the Badger ' , a man who , so legend has it , only liked school because there was the chance of a scrap along the way there .
Hinault , who is in charge of the podium protocol , shoves the protester off the podium into the air and as the man is escorted away , his jutting jaw displays all the aggression that once led him to ride his bike straight into a group of striking dockers in the Paris - Nice race in 1984 .
The French are showing fighting spirit as well : two riders in the stage - long escape , a stage win for Samuel Dumoulin and the yellow jersey for Romain Feillu .
CHOLETE , TUESDAY French television has taken to placing reporters with mini cameras inside the team cars , Big Brother style , to capture the yells of encouragement and garner inside views from the team managers as they drive along .
It 's always easy to spot the reporter as he is the sissy wearing a seatbelt , a total no - no in the Clarksonesque world of macho driving that is the race convoy .
Today , FR2 has exclusive access to Emmanuel Hubert of Agritubel as he follows the yellow jersey , Feillu .
Which would be fine viewing were it not for the fact that Feillu is having a bad , bad day .
Hubert knows his boy has lost the jersey from kilometre one , the reporter knows it , the viewers know it .
It 's hard to avoid the feeling that what the directeur sportif would say if the eyes of the world were turned elsewhere would be something like ' OK Romi old boy , just rumble along and save it for another day . '
Instead of which , clearly he feels obliged to scream encouragement , even if his cries of ' allez allez allez ' owe more to Noel Coward than Sir Alex Ferguson .
CHATEAUROUX , WEDNESDAY
A first stage win for Mark Cavendish and the Isle of Man and there should be much more to come , both from Cav and the island .
At 23 , the Team Columbia sprinter has several years ahead of him to match Barry Hoban 's British record of eight stages , while the island will boast a second cycling Olympian this year , the road racer Jonny Bellis , bronze medal in last year 's under-23 Worlds and destined for a professional contract with the CSC team this autumn .
In the road endurance academy is another prospect , Peter Kennaugh , all of 19 and a gold medallist in the under-23 track world championships .
Bubbling under in the Olympic Development Programme are Mark Christian and Chris Whorrall .
With so much burgeoning talent from such a tiny talent pool , the Manx team will be a good outside bet for a gold in the team pursuit at the Commonwealth Games in Delhi in 2010 .
You read it here first .
SUPER - BESSE , THURSDAY
The yellow jersey , Stefan Schumacher , takes a dive in the final metres , with his team - mate Bernhard Kohl landing on top of him .
He is bruised , but more importantly , he loses his lead .
He is predictably livid afterwards and accuses his successor in the maillot jaune , Kim Kirchen , of moving off his line , unintentionally , and causing the crash .
The verdict of the double winner Laurent Fignon , the ' professor ' is as trenchant as might be expected : ' Schumacher was knackered and had no idea what he is doing . '
He is probably right : it is well known that as a cyclist tires , he takes just a fraction of a second longer to react .
After being done for drink driving last autumn , and testing positive for amphetamines in January , now Schumi ' is ' asleep at the wheel ' .
AURILLAC , FRIDAY Greenery and appellation controlé Saint Nectaire cheese dominate our two days in the Parc National des Volcans d'Auvergne .
The extinct volcanoes known as puys have a surreal profile , a mix of table tops , cones and sawtooth points along the skyline .
And the roadside viewing is equally outlandish : in the village of Laqueille - Gare a whole array of gaudily decorated cows made of giant straw bales , six apiece , painted with vast smiles , hearts , flowers and polka dots ; near La Bourboule a field full of vintage Citroen Deux - Chevaux .
A lake bears the message ' maintenant ' - ' now ' - in vast white plastic letters .
That is hard to fathom ( a message to the favourites that they are in the mountains for the first time ? ) .
But there is only one message to be read in cows , cheese and 2CVs : we have truly reached La France Profonde .
To underline that this is a part of the world where time stands still , Liberation relates the tale of a village on the route , Crocq , where the clock on the mairie broke down three years ago and has yet to be repaired .

The Tour heads south , but I 'm going north , abandoning it early for the first time in 19 Tours .

2008-07-21,"Opening night , and it 's not long before I remember the disadvantages of being a season ticket holder .
A season ticket is amazing , of course - it 's the only way to avoid having to queue half the day to see Gustavo Dudamel , for a start - but the other holders are , well , somewhat eccentric .
There 's the guy who looks like a cross between Gandalf the Grey ( beard , hair ) and Lance Armstrong ( full - on cycling garb ) .
There 's the middle - aged guy in the rock concert T - shirt that reads "" Muss es sein ?
Es muss sein . ""
( It 's a Beethoven joke , ho ho ) .
And there are the inevitable music bores who do n't seem to have a life beyond the Royal Albert Hall .
If you do end up in the season ticket queue , my one bit of advice is this : avoid making eye contact at all costs .
I rather enjoyed the opening programme - a very peculiar mix of the sublime ( Strauss 's Four Last Songs , radiantly sung by late substitute Christine Brewer ) and the ridiculous ( pretty much everything else , but particularly the same composer 's absurdly overcooked Festive Prelude , which opened ) .
I do , however , have two polite requests to the audience .
First , please try not to applaud in between movements - certain listeners , myself included , like to enjoy that magical , tingling moment of anticipation before the music starts again in silence .
But second , and more importantly , if your fellow audience members do decide to show their appreciation by clapping , for God 's sake do n't shush them : it 's fantastically rude and far more distracting than a little light applause .
Shh yourselves !
Sadly , engineering works on the Jubilee line curtailed my efforts to see Nigel Kennedy , returning to the Proms for the first time in 21 years .
I did , however , manage to catch his performance on the radio , and he gave a stamping , full - blooded account of Elgar 's Violin Concerto , a piece that usually makes me break out in a nasty rash that , like the piece itself , takes forever to go away .
He almost made me enjoy it .
Alas , I also caught his jazz noodling at the late night
Prom , which was pretty dire .
Let 's hope he 's back again in a couple of years , trailing a decent concerto and leaving the jazz affectations at home along with his gor - blimey Cockerney accent ."
2008-07-23,"This just in from the McCain press shop : ARLINGTON , VA -- U.S. Senator John McCain 's presidential campaign today announced that John McCain will participate in a town hall meeting on cancer alongside Lance Armstrong at the LIVESTRONG Summit in Columbus , Ohio on Thursday , July 24th .

McCain has suffered skin cancer , so perhaps he can find an affinity with the roughly 1 m Americans a year diagnosed with some form of the illness ."

2008-09-09,"Lance Armstrong 's life reads more like a Hollywood script for a new underdog movie than anything else .
A young man with the world at his feet destined to become one of the greatest cyclists his sport has ever seen , only to be diagnosed with one of the world 's most deadly diseases .
Being given only a 40 % chance of survival , and after being dropped by his cycling team , this astonishing American defeated cancer to return from the edge of existence , battling through chemotherapy sessions and several life - saving operations , to become the most successful cyclist the world has ever seen .
Coincide all of this with allegations of drug taking and a troubled personal life , and we only begin to scratch the surface of this extraordinary mans life .
With added speculation that he is about to rejoin the Astana team to relaunch a comeback at the 2009 Tour de France , speculation rejected by the team , we look at Lance Armstrong 's extraordinary career history to dateâ€ ¦ 1971
Lance Edward Gunderson is born on September 18 .
1987 Becomes a professional tri - athlete .
1989
Focuses his attentions on cycling and is crowned the National Sprint Course Champion .
1990 Retains his title as Nation Sprint Course Champion and finishes 11th in the World Championship Road Race .
Later on in the year he would also add US National Amateur Champion to his honours .
1991 â€ “ Competes in his first Tour DuPont , finishing in the middle of the pack .
However his performance marked the arrival of a promising newcomer to the sport .
1992
After finishing second at the US Olympic trials , Armstrong was one of the favourites for gold in the Road Race at the Barcelona Olympics but only managed 14th place .
Immediately after the Olympics Armstrong made the transition from amateur to professional , joining the Motorola team .
1993
A very successful year , in which he won cycling 's "" Triple Crown "" .
He also won the World Road Race Championship , to become the youngest person and only the second American to win the event .
Armstrong also finished second in the Tour Dupont , and claimed 62nd place in his first Tour De France .
1994
A relatively unsuccessful year as he finished second at Tour DuPont and also won the Thrift Drug Classic .
1995
Eventually wins Tour DuPont , finishing a staggering two minutes ahead of his closest rival , Viatcheslav Ekimov of Russia .
1996
His most turbulent year in the sport , and his life .
He began brightly by retaining his Tour DuPont title .
However he failed to impress at the Atlanta Olympics , finishing sixth in the Time Trials event and 12th in the Road Race .
He was also unable to complete the Tour de France due to illness with Bronchitis .
The cyclist 's luck was only to get worse as he was diagnosed with testicular cancer , which had spread to his abdomen , lungs and lymph nodes .
After finding tumours on his brain , doctors predicted that the cyclist had only a 40 % chance of survival .
Consequently , he was dropped by Team Codifis , to which he had only recently signed .
1997
After many sessions of chemotherapy and subsequent surgery to remove his brain tumours , Armstrong 's battle with the disease was over , and he was declared free of cancer in February .
1998
Armstrong 's comeback to the sport was better than expected with him winning many events including the Tour of Luxembourg , the Spring 56 K and the Cascade Classic .
He also finished in fourth place at the World Race Championship .
1999
This was the year that Armstrong was to start his record - breaking run of Tour de France victories .
However his victory was met with scepticism from many , who believed his miraculous recovery and subsequent success had been a result of the American using performance - enhancing drugs â€ “ none of the allegations have ever been proven .
2000
Silenced many of his critics by retaining the Tour de France title , defeating second - placed Jan Ulrich by over six minutes .
In doing so , Armstrong became only the second American in history to win the event in successive years .
2001
Completed a hat - trick of Tour de France victories .
2002
Wins the title again in impressive fashion , beating second - placed Joseba Beloki by a margin of over seven minutes .
2003 Defeats Jan Ulrich again to win the Tour de France for the fifth year in a row , equalling Miguel Indurain 's record of consecutive Tour de France victories .
2004 Enters the record books after yet another Tour de France win as the most successful Tour rider of all time , and in the process sets a personal best of winning five tour stages and also winning the team time trial .
Armstrong also became the first man since Gino Bartali in 1948 to win three consecutive mountain stages .
2005 Retires after his seventh successive Tour de France victory .
2008 Confirms he intends to return to the sport and ride in the 2009 Tour de France ."
2008-09-09,"On hearing the rumour that Lance Armstrong was contemplating a comeback , a former professional said simply : "" They ca n't ever stay away , can they ? ""
And there is no reason for the seven - times winner of the Tour to dream up this one other than pure wishful thinking .
A cynic would link the rumours to a major interview to be given by the American to a magazine .
I 'm happy to be among the cynics .
The practicalities simply do not stand up .
Armstrong is still fit , and he is still a driven man .
He is also registered on the USADA 's out - of - competition drug testing system , meaning he could in theory take out a racing licence from February 1 .
But none of those things equates to a comeback taking in the Tour de France and other major stage races .
A comeback has been suggested before , and it did not happen .
The central issue is that Armstrong is persona non grata at the Tour de France and any team that included him would be unlikely to get a start in the event .
The Astana team were refused entry this year partly because of the squad 's rash of positive tests during , before and after the 2007 Tour , but also because when Astana was relaunched to move on from its disastrous 2007 , the sponsors looked to Armstrong 's old mentor Johan Bruyneel .
The feeling at the Tour was that a clean break with the Armstrong era was necessary if the race was to be relaunched , because of the persistent allegations of drug taking around the American , even though these had all been hotly denied in the absence of any sanctionable positive tests .
Hence Astana and Bruyneel 's exclusion this year .
Those factors make a mockery of the notion that an Armstrong comeback could include the Tour and Paris - Nice .
Not surprisingly , Astana are playing the idea down .
There is no sporting reason for Armstrong to make a comeback , unless it is to compete in lesser events for a team which has no aspiration to get into the Tour , but even that defies any logic : he might as well accept reality and compete with the amateurs .
There is a world of difference between getting fit for the occasional marathon or a long - distance mountain bike race .
These are one - offs rather than a sustained campaign of professional bike racing , let alone a major Tour .
The notion that Armstrong could in any way change opinions about whether or not he achieved his Tour wins in a legitimate manner merely by posting his blood - testing results on the internet is laughable .
Those who have strong feelings over the question are either for the American or against him , and positions are so entrenched that no one is likely to change their minds .
The mere fact that he might be able to claim he was competing "" clean "" at 37 in 2009 and offer evidence to back it up would not relate in any way to what he achieved between 1999 and 2005 and how he allegedly may or may not have achieved it .
So a comeback could happen on paper , for a non - Tour team , in lesser races , but what might it achieve other than making a few headlines for a sponsor and enabling Armstrong to avoid moving on from life as a professional cyclist ?
A seven - times Tour winner trying to win smaller races and quite possibly getting whipped by younger riders would be like watching an aging boxer unable to walk away from the ring , and paying the price , and doing so in public .
That is not to say that Armstrong might not try it but he need not do it
and he should not ."
2008-09-09,"Lance Armstrong , the seven - times Tour de France winner , yesterday said that he intends to make a second comeback to professional cycling and that he hopes to win an eighth Tour de France next year at the age of 37 .
If he were to manage the feat - and currently he has no confirmed team , no confirmed entry to the race and nothing more concrete than an interview in the magazine Vanity Fair - he would be the oldest cyclist to win the sport 's major event .
His spokesman confirmed that the Tour is "" the intention "" , although the organisers were not available for any comment .
"" I am happy to announce that after talking with my children , my family and my closest friends , I have decided to return to professional cycling in order to raise awareness of the global cancer burden , "" said the Texan , who survived testicular cancer to return to the sport and win the Tour seven times in a row amid what seemed like continual controversy .
He added : "" I 'm going to try and win an eighth Tour de France . ""
There are reports that Armstrong will plan to race five events in 2009 : the Amgen Tour of California , the Tour of Georgia , Paris - Nice , the DauphinÃ © LibÃ
© rÃ
© stage race and the Tour de France .
He said that he did not consider age an obstacle .
Since his retirement in 2005 , Armstrong has devoted himself to his cancer charity as well as running marathons .
Most recently , racing in a 100-mile mountain bike event in the Rocky Mountains is said to have sparked his desire to return to the sport full time .
He has yet to announce a team for this next venture .
The squad that took him to his Tour successes was disbanded in 2007 , although his manager , Johan Bruyneel , has moved to the Kazakh - financed Astana squad , relaunched this year after a spate of doping scandals .
The Kazakh team were this year refused entry to the Tour .
They said yesterday that they had no immediate plans to sign Armstrong .
Full details of the American 's comeback to the sport are to be announced on September 24 .
Yesterday , Armstrong said that if his team were refused a place in the 2009 race , he would appeal directly to the French president Nicolas Sarkozy .
"" I 've already put a call in to him , "" he said .
Armstrong was never sanctioned over a positive drugs test during his career but was dogged by controversy , primarily over his close working relationship with an Italian doctor , Michele Ferrari , who was convicted of malpractice , although the charges did not involve Armstrong .
Ferrari was later acquitted on appeal .
In 1999 during the Texan 's first Tour win , traces of a cortisone - based substance were found in his urine but he was cleared on the grounds that the drug was used to treat a skin complaint .
In 2005 , after Armstrong took his seventh Tour win , an investigation by the French newspaper l'Equipe revealed that the banned blood booster erythropoietin had been found in urine samples provided by the American during his first Tour win in 1999 .
No sanctions were taken because an inquiry commissioned by the International Cycling Union ruled that the testing had been carried out on an unofficial basis , for research purposes .
He said he wanted to put to bed suggestions that he had cheated in winning the Tour . ""
Many of the guys that got second through 10th , a lot of them are gone .
Out .
Caught .
Positive tests .
Suspended .
Whatever .
And so I can understand why people look at that and go , ' Well , [ they ] were caught - and you were n't ? '
So there is a nice element here where I can come with really a completely comprehensive program and there will be no way to cheat . """
2008-09-09,"The team linked with a possible comeback by Lance Armstrong with the Tour de France as a potential goal were today playing down the idea as speculation mounted that the American seven - times Tour de France winner may have plans to race again in 2009 .
"" There are no contacts or plans of Team Astana to take Lance Armstrong , "" the team press officer Philippe Maertens said .
"" As far as I know , Lance Armstrong does n't have plans to do road cycling .
We have no plans . ""
Astana , the team run by Armstrong 's former manager Johan Bruyneel , was named in a story this week as the team most likely to hire him if he returned to racing .
Speculation ranges from the Texan returning to ride mountain bike events to the notion that he may race a five - event calendar taking in the Tour of California , the Tour of Georgia , Paris - Nice , the Dauphine Libere , and the Tour de France .
Astana were not admitted to the Tour de France this year because of drug scandals involving the team in 2007 , before Bruyneel took over the helm .
They won the Giro d'Italia with the Spaniard Alberto Contador , the rider who took first place in last year 's Tour de France riding for Amstrong 's former sponsor Discovery Channel .
The International Cycling Union president Pat MacQuaid said today that he would welcome an Armstrong comeback .
"" If he wants to come back , he has every right to .
Good luck to him , "" MacQuaid said .
The ICU has in the past received donations from the American to its anti - doping programme .
"" It may be he has a chip on his shoulder because of the accusations and rumours surrounding him , none of which were proven , "" said MacQuaid .
"" Now there is a new system in place that can show any manipulation of the blood , he wants to show he was the athlete he claims he was . ""
Since retiring from racing in 2005 , Armstrong has turned his attention to marathon running and recently finished second in a 100-mile mountain bike race in the Rockies .
The US Anti - Doping Agency confirmed Armstrong is part of its out - of - competition testing pool and would potentially be eligible for elite competition on February 1 2009 ."

2008-09-10,"The organisers of the Tour de France have welcomed Lance Armstrong 's plans to return to the event next season , but have warned the seven - time champion that he will need to adhere to stricter drug - testing regulations in 2009 .
Armstrong , who retired from professional cycling after winning seven consecutive Tour de France titles between 1999 and 2005 , has decided to attempt to become the oldest winner of the event at the age of 37 in order to "" raise awareness of the global cancer burden "" .
However , the Tour de France director Christian Prudhomme underlined on Tuesday that should Armstrong return to the event he would have to undergo the same stringent drug - testing procedures as any other cyclist . ""
He must follow all the rules today , that are much more strict than they were before , "" said Prudhomme .
""
If Lance Armstrong is at the start of the Tour de France , it will be the same thing for him and for his team , of course .
I ca n't say anything else .
There wo n't be any exceptions . ""
After recovering from testicular cancer , Armstrong became an inspiration for cancer sufferers the world over , as he became a dominant force in cycling at the end of the 1990s and the first half of the current decade .
However , his career was never far from controversy .
Armstrong enjoyed a close working relationship with Michele Ferrari , the Italian doctor who was convicted , and subsequently acquitted on appeal , of malpractice , although the charges did not involve Armstrong , while in 1999 traces of a cortisone - based substance were found in a urine sample provided by the American but he was cleared on the grounds that the drug had been used to treat a skin complaint .
In 2005 an investigation by the French newspaper l'Equipe revealed that the banned blood booster erythropoietin had been found in urine samples provided by the American during his first Tour win in 1999 but no sanctions were taken because an inquiry commissioned by the International Cycling Union ruled that the testing had been carried out on an unofficial basis , for research purposes .
"" Suspicion has followed Lance Armstrong since 1999 , everyone knows that , "" said Prudhomme .
This year , blood tests were carried out on all riders just days before the start in Brest .
"" All the Tour riders , and Lance Armstrong if that is the case , will have to submit to rules that were harder than they were before , because it is necessary . ""
The sport has been dogged by doping scandals over recent times .
Floyd Landis - a former team - mate of Armstrong 's - was stripped of his 2006 Tour title after testing positive for testosterone .
The following year Alexandre Vinokourov was caught using a banned blood transfusion and race leader Michael Rasmussen was expelled before the finish for allegedly lying about his whereabouts when he missed pre - Tour anti - doping checks .
This year , Riccardo Ricco of Italy was kicked out for using EPO after winning two stages .
Armstrong 's return could see him join the Astana team , which is run by his friend and former sporting director Johan Bruyneel , who helped the American win all his seven Tours .
Bruyneel suggested on Wednesday that he would find it almost impossible not to include a fit - again Armstrong in his team . ""
My relationship with him goes beyond the professional rider - director relationship , "" said Bruyneel .
"" I do n't see myself running a team and having to race against him .
I do n't want to run too fast , but I can say that I can not imagine him being on another team .
We are obviously going to have to speak a lot in the next few days . ""
However , Astana are not untainted by controversy themselves , having been barred from this year 's Tour after a series of doping scandals at the 2006 and 2007 Tours .
With Astana 's inclusion in next year 's competition contingent upon the Tour 's organisers approving their return Armstrong may have to look elsewhere for new employers .
For his part Armstrong claims that returning to the Tour will go a long way to ending suspicions that have shrouded his multiple Tour wins .
"" Many of the guys that got second through 10th , a lot of them are gone , "" he said .
"" Out .
Caught .
Positive tests .
Suspended .
Whatever .
And so I can understand why people look at that and go , ' Well , [ they ] were caught - and you were n't ? '
So there is a nice element here where I can come with really a completely comprehensive program and there will be no way to cheat . """
2008-09-10,"While reactions in the professional cycling world varied from delight to disbelief at Lance Armstrong 's announcement that he plans to make a comeback to racing next year , the Tour de France organisers yesterday gave a cool response .
Christian Prudhomme of Amaury Sport did not rule out inviting the 37-year - old Armstrong to ride in his race - and attempt to win it for the eighth time - but said that much can happen between now and then : "" You have to remember we are in mid - September and that a lot of water will run under the bridge before the Tour de France départ in Monaco . ""
Armstrong 's announcement led to speculation that he would return to his former team manager Johan Bruyneel , who is now managing the Astana team of the Giro and Tour winner Alberto Contador .
Initially Astana had sounded sceptical , but the Belgian said yesterday that he was ready to work with his old leader once again if the chance arose . ""
He wo n't have a problem finding a team .
But it 's clear that the relationship we have means that I ca n't allow him to go to another team .
For me it would be nice to be a part of this , "" Bruyneel told reporters at the Tour of Spain .
"" We are obviously going to have to speak a lot in the next few days . ""
"" He knows that coming back is incredible news and that a lot of people wo n't give him credit for it , and that 's what motivates him , "" Bruyneel said , although like Prudhomme , he said that it was necessary to wait and see how the comeback developed .
"" When he took the decision to announce it to the world , it was clear .
With a little more tranquillity and time , we 'll see what happens .
"" Contador 's view was that if Armstrong returned to racing , the pair might well end up competing for leadership in Astana at the Tour in what could be a battle of the old and new generations in cycling .
"" Sure , the two of us would like to win the Tour and some kind of complication could develop , but to arrive at that point different factors would come into play .
For now , let 's not think about those , "" Contador said .
Contador 's Astana team - mate José Luis Rubiera said it was "" great news "" and added : "" Armstrong has got the character to do it and he would draw in millions of supporters again .
At a sponsorship level , I ca n't see it doing anything but good . """
2008-09-24,"Lance Armstrong yesterday confirmed that he will begin his comeback to racing in January in the opening event of the professional calendar , the Tour
Down
Under in Australia , and suggested that he might extend his return beyond 2009 .
"" I do n't want to box myself in here , "" said Armstrong , who turned 37 last week .
"" It 's open - ended .
I see one season
but I would n't want to rule out a second season .
I will take it season by season . ""
Speaking in New York , the seven - time Tour de France winner said he is to join the Astana team , run by his former manager Johan Bruyneel who helped him to his record run of Tour victories . ""
While we looked at other teams and we talked with other teams , as a friend and as a partner , I can really trust Johan on every little decis ion , I could not imagine racing against him or without him . ""
Armstrong said he hoped the 2007 Tour winner , Alberto Contador , who this year became the first rider in 25 years to complete the golden treble of all three major stage races , would remain with Astana , despite reports that the Spaniard was not sure there was room in the team for both him and Armstrong . ""
Alberto is the best rider on the planet right now
and I 'm not sure I can ride that fast , "" Armstrong said .
"" If he has other offers ... that 's his decision .
I would encourage him to give this a chance . ""
Armstrong confirmed he will race the Tour de France and the Leadville 100 , a mountain bike race he rode in this summer in Colorado , finishing second .
He said preparing for that event had made him aware that he "" truly loves to ride bikes for long hours every day "" .
"" It 's not very often someone gets a chance to spend three or fours years away from something , step back and then say to themselves , ' I sort of miss that , I 'd like to go back and do that again ' , "" he said .
As yet , Astana have no confirmed place in the Tour - they were refused entry this year due to a spate of positive tests under different management in 2007 - but if Armstrong starts the French race he will be almost 38 years old , at an age that few have managed to win the event .
Armstrong acknowledged yesterday that an eighth victory in the Tour may prove beyond him , but said that his mission in returning to racing was to publicise the fight against cancer through his charitable foundation , launched after his successful battle against testicular cancer .
The Texan said that his foundation was committing $ 8 m ( Â£4 m ) over five years to expand its fight against cancer from the US to other parts of the world such as Africa and South America . ""
For us as Americans , for us as an international community , if we are not supplying the medicine we have to the people who need it the most , we are failing morally and ethically . ""
Armstrong has been dogged by claims that he used performance - enhancing drugs during his career .
The allegations were never proven and always hotly denied .
Yesterday , he announced that the anti - doping expert Don Catlin would run an independent programme to test him next year . ""
Beyond today I 'm not going to tell you how clean I am , "" Armstrong said .
"" I will ride by bike around the world and Don Catlin will tell you how clean I am . ""
The organisers of the Tour of Britain said yesterday they had extended an invitation to Armstrong and Astana to start the 2009 race ."

2008-09-24,"Lance Armstrong has confirmed that he will return to professional cycling in Australia next year and attempt to win an eighth Tour de France next summer , four years on from his last victory .
"" I have decided to race my bicycle again , "" confirmed testicular cancer survivor Armstrong as he launched the ' Live Strong Global Awareness Campaign ' in New York . ""
With this campaign we feel that by racing the bicycle all over the world , beginning in Australia , ending in France at the global summit , it is the best way to promote this initiative , it 's the best way to get the word out . ""
Armstrong 's thunder had been stolen by a politician earlier in the day when South Australia state premier Mike Rann revealed that Armstrong would be coming out of retirement at the Tour
Down
Under in January .
And speaking at former US president Bill Clinton 's philanthropic summit , the Clinton Global Initiative , Armstrong confirmed his plans to return to the saddle next year .
"" I look forward to 2009 , I look forward to racing again , "" said Armstrong , who plans to raise cancer awareness in Paris after the 2009 Tour de France .
"" I can not guarantee an eighth Tour victory , but I can guarantee you the ' Live Strong ' message will touch all aspects of our society .
It 's not very often someone gets a chance to spend three or fours years away from something , step back , and then say to themselves , ' I sort of miss that , I 'd like to go back and do that again , ' "" he added .
According to the Kazakh Cycling Federation , Armstrong , whose sole involvement in competitive cycling of late has been two long - distance mountain - bike races this year , is expected to join Team Astana , who were thrown out of last year 's Tour de France after Alexander Vinokourov tested positive for a blood transfusion .
Armstrong is close friends with Team Astana 's team leader , John Bruyneel , who was his team director for all of his Tour de France victories with the US Postal and Discovery Teams . ""
He is coming to Team Astana , he 's doing it only so he can continue to win , "" the federation 's deputy chief , Nikolai Proskurin told the Associated Press earlier today .
Despite his lengthy absence from the sport Armstrong , 37 , has been strongly backed to claim an eighth Tour win by figures from within the sport . ""
He genuinely could win the Tour de France , "" said Pat McQuaid , the International Cycling Union president .
"" But I do n't think his primary motivation is to win the Tour de France .
I think he has done as much as he can with his cancer foundation in terms of knowledge of it in the US and now he wants to globalise the foundation using the sport of cycling .
Winning the Tour is secondary
but I think he has every intention of trying to do it . ""
Armstrong has also admitted that at least part of his motivation to compete in the Tour again is in order dispel the doping allegations that surrounded his first victory in 1999 .
In 2006 , an independent investigator appointed by the ICU cleared Armstrong of any wrongdoing in his first Tour win and McQuaid believes the doubters are misguided .
"" To all sceptics I would say ' give him a chance ' .
I do n't believe he 's a cheat , "" said McQuaid .
"" He will be outlining his testing plans , all of which will be run by independent groups and totally transparent .
He will be racing under the same conditions as everyone else .
He must already be in the system for several months and he has already been tested out of competition for the last couple of months and that will continue throughout the season . """
2008-09-26,"The winner of last year 's Tour de France , Alberto Contador , said he has been assured he will remain the leader of the Astana cycling team despite the arrival of seven - times Tour de France champion Lance Armstrong .
Contador has threatened to quit Astana if his position is not secure , adding that he has received offers to join other ProTour teams . ""
The team has given me guarantees that I will be the leader
but I want the fullest guarantees possible , "" the 25-year - old Spaniard said .
"" They told me that they want to back me
but I have to see how all this develops .
If I 'm not happy , I will leave , "" he told Spanish newspaper Marca .
Armstrong announced on Wednesday that he is joining Astana , reuniting the cyclist with his former team leader and close friend Johan Bruyneel .

2008-10-01,"France 's anti - doping chief has proposed that Lance Armstrong agree to the testing of urine samples from his first Tour de France win to determine whether they show traces of the blood booster erythropoietin .
The samples , which date from 1999 , are frozen in France 's drug - testing laboratory in the suburbs of Paris .
Armstrong , now making a return to cycling after retiring in 2005 , has always insisted that he never doped .
"" I want this comeback to take place in the best circumstances , "" Pierre Bordry , head of the French anti - doping agency , said .
"" With this in mind , I propose - if he agrees - a new complete analysis of these six samples taken at the 1999 Tour . """
2008-10-02,"Lance Armstrong may have to play second fiddle to his Astana team - mate Alberto Contador when he returns to the Tour de France next year . ""
At the end of the day , the strongest rider will be supported , regardless of that person 's name or what they 've accomplished in the past , "" said Astana team director Johan Bruyneel .
"" Alberto has had a magnificent year and is currently the best professional cyclist in the world .
"" Contador , winner of the 2007 Tour , said he would leave Astana if he was given a supporting role to Armstrong and Bruyneel went on to confirm that the Spaniard would be with the team for some time . ""
Alberto signed a contract with Team Astana through 2010 , "" Bruyneel said .
"" I have invested a lot of my time into Alberto 's development and he will remain with this team for the next two years .
Actually it 's pretty simple , there 's a contract and there are no options to leave . ""
Meanwhile , Armstrong will refuse a request to test urine samples from his first Tour de France victory for traces of EPO .
Pierre Bordry , president of the French anti - doping agency ( AFLD ) , said a retest of samples from the 1999 Tour would be "" a chance to confirm that [ Armstrong ] never cheated in his brilliant career "" .
However , Armstrong 's spokesman , Mark Higgins , said the matter was in the past . ""
He is not interested in discussing again results from samples taken in 1999 , "" said Higgins .
"" I will refer the AFLD or whoever will ask the questions on this subject to the Vrijman report [ which cleared Armstrong of doping in the 1999 Tour ] . """
2008-10-02,"Barely a week after the official announcement of Lance Armstrong 's comeback , it seems that full - blown hostilities have resumed between him and the French anti - doping agency ( AFLD ) .
Yesterday the head of the agency , Pierre Bordry , responding to Armstrong 's rejection of the chance to have urine samples taken during the 1999 Tour de France retested , made comments which contrasted sharply with the praise he had heaped on the seven - times Tour winner only 24 hours earlier .
Armstrong has always denied doping and when he announced his comeback last week he promised "" total transparency "" , but in response to Bordry 's invitation he said yesterday : "" There is simply nothing that I can agree to that would provide any relevant evidence about 1999 . ""
He said the samples taken during his first Tour victory "" have not been maintained properly , have been compromised in many ways , and even three years ago could not be tested to provide any meaningful results "" .
In 2005 , within weeks of Armstrong 's seventh Tour win , L'Equipe reported that retesting had indicated the presence of synthetic EPO in urine samples given by him during the 1999 race .
A Dutch lawyer appointed by cycling 's governing body later cleared Armstrong .
Yesterday Bordry , who earlier described Armstrong as "" a great champion "" , told the BBC that the Texan 's refusal amounted to a missed opportunity .
"" It was a good opportunity for him to answer positively to my proposition , "" said Bordry , "" because if he is clean I am ready to follow him . ""
Armstrong maintains that any "" evidence "" obtained by the ChÃ¢tenay - Malabry laboratory in its original retesting of the 1999 samples was flawed .
"" Two years ago I agreed to have all of these issues aired and decided by tribunal [ the Court of Arbitration for Sport ] , "" he said .
"" But Wada [ the World Anti - Doping Agency ] and the French ministry refused . """
2008-10-03,"Pedal faster The perfect cadence ( pedalling frequency ) is 100 revolutions a minute ( rpm ) , says Chris Boardman , triple world champion and Olympic gold medallist .
"" This feels uncomfortable at first , but persevere because it means less muscle damage and greater powers of acceleration .
Lance Armstrong was the man who bought cadence up to that number - in fact , his was about 120 . ""
Restrain yourself "" The best way to attack a climb is not to attack it , "" Boardman says .
"" If you overcook it on the flat , you can freewheel to recover , but there 's no stopping on a hill , so take it steady . ""
Go aero
Never underestimate the impact of riding in an aerodynamic position .
"" Cutting through air resistance is 90 % of the effort , "" Boardman says , "" so an aero position makes a huge difference to speed .
The only way to master it is to ride in it , back flat and silhouette as small as possible .
Your leg muscles work hard at a severe angle , so it will feel difficult to start with . ""
Find some friends Cycling in a pack reduces energy expenditure by up to 39 % , so you can go farther and faster if you ride with friends .
Keep your upper body still Top cyclists barely move theirs . ""
This takes commitment because you 'll lose power at first , "" Boardman says .
"" Strengthen your body with intervals of going as fast as possible for five seconds in a big gear and low cadence ( 40rpm ) , then 25 seconds ' recovery .
Aim for two blocks of 10 minutes . ""
Buy sensibly "" Many bikes are marketed on frame weight , but do n't get taken in -100
g here or there makes zero difference , "" Boardman says .
"" It 's the frame stiffness that counts . """
2008-10-08,"Lance Armstrong 's comeback moved a little closer last night when he was cleared by the International Cycling Union ( UCI ) to ride in the Tour
Down
Under in January .
Having declared his intention to race in the Australian season - opener when he announced his return last month , Armstrong was then informed by Pat McQuaid , the union 's president , that a retired rider must inform the authorities six months in advance , so as to be available for out - of - competition drug testing .
Although Armstrong registered for out - of - competition testing with the US Anti - Doping Agency on August 1 - seven weeks before he announced his comeback - he missed the six - month deadline for the Tour Down
Under by 10 days .
But last night the union said it would waive the rule to allow the seven - time Tour de France winner to race in Australia .
The sport 's governing body said it had "" decided to approve "" Armstrong 's participation after taking into account "" the progress made in its anti - doping programme since 2004 [ when the six - month rule was introduced ] .
As a result of the improvements implemented riders are now subject to a much reinforced system of monitoring ...
the UCI can confirm that Lance Armstrong has and will be the subject of very strict monitoring throughout the period running up to his return to the peloton . ""

"" I 've only been on the track two or three times , "" said Hoy , whose three gold medals in Beijing established him as Britain 's most prolific Olympian in a century .
"" I 've been in the gym and out on the road when I can fit it in but I wo n't start track training until the end of November .
By December I 'll be 100 % and training for the world championships [ in Poland in March ] .
"" Wiggins , who will miss the world track championships to focus on road racing in 2009 , will be competing in Germany at the time of the World Cup meeting after he accepted lucrative deals to partner Erik Zabel in the Dortmund and Munich six - day events .
Tickets for the Manchester event went on sale during the cyclists ' gold rush in Beijing and sold out immediately .
A post - Olympics sale of standing tickets also disappeared within hours , ensuring a capacity crowd of 3,500 for a meeting anticipated as a triumphant home - coming for the team .
Apart from Wiggins and Hoy , the women 's pursuit gold medallist Rebecca Romero is likely to be the only other high - profile absentee .
The team sprint gold medallists Jamie Staff and Jason Kenny , along with the keirin silver medallist , Ross Edgar , will ride the sprint events while the Olympic champion Victoria Pendleton will contest the women 's event .
The team pursuit gold medallists Ed Clancy and Geraint Thomas are both riding , as is the individual pursuit bronze Steven Burke and the points race bronze Chris Newton .
Wendy Houvenaghel , who claimed silver behind Romero in Beijing , is likely to enter the women 's pursuit .
"" I take my hat off to the riders , "" said the endurance coach Matt Parker .
"" They 've all had a tough season but they stuck their hands up and said they want to ride in Manchester in front of the home crowd . """
2008-10-13,"Lance Armstrong will compete in the Giro D'Italia for the first time next year as part of his return to competitive cycling .
Organisers of the three - week stage race say the 37 year - old , who retired in 2005 , has agreed to take part in the Italian event as it celebrates its centenary year .
Scheduled for May 9 - 31 , it is two months before the Tour de France , where Armstrong will seek to claim his eighth victory .
"" I will give my utmost , and not only to prepare for the Tour , "" Armstrong said in a statement from race organiser RCS Sport . ""
Not having taken part in the Giro was one of my biggest regrets as a rider .
Finally I will be able to do it .
It will be the Centenary Giro
and I know how much that means for Italians .
Everyone says it will be only to prepare for the Tour [ de France ] but , instead , it could be a case that I go to Italy to win and that the Giro will be my true three - week stage race . ""
Angelo Zomegnan , the cycling director of Giro organisers RCS Sport , said : "" Lance knows very well the affection Italians have for him after the years he spent living on the banks of Lake Como .
It is an affection that is not equalled in any other European country .
"" It was announced last week that Armstrong had been cleared by the International Cycling Union to ride in the Tour
Down
Under in January , which is set to mark the end of his retirement , despite riders being required to give six months ' notice in line with its anti - doping programme ."

A sentence has been removed .
Furthermore , we apologise to Betsy Andreu for comments made about her in this interview .
She has asked us to clarify that , while evidence that she gave in proceedings about an insurance claim brought by Lance Armstrong is disputed , she honestly recounted what she believed she had heard .
The sweat is still drying on Lance Armstrong 's gaunt face when , with sunken eyes as blue as the cloudless sky , he sweeps through the front door of his home in the secluded hills of Austin , Texas .
Armstrong offers a hand while balancing a pile of training gear on his arms . ""
Sorry , I 'm late , "" he says .
"" It 's been a busy day . ""
He disappears as quickly as he arrived and I slide back on to the plush sofa of the vast room where I 've been waiting .
Huge paintings of minimalist pop art hang on the walls .
Ed Ruscha 's Speed Racer and Safe and Effective Medication echo the backdrop of cycling , cancer and doping allegations which have made Armstrong one of the world 's most famous but controversial sportsmen .
An elegant woman drifts past to check whether I need another sparkling water .
The temptation is to mumble that a definitive dollop of truth would suffice for no other athlete divides the planet like Armstrong .
He could be the greatest sportsman of all time , an epic and courageous figure who overcame cancer to win seven straight Tour de France titles from 1999 to 2005 .
In the alternate view , however , he simply cheated his way to victory with performance - enhancing drugs .
The ferocious split between believers and critics was illustrated when I canvassed the experts before arriving in Austin .
I barely had to mention Armstrong 's name to be assailed by a furious response from European journalists who had covered his exploits for years . ""
Horror - show "" and "" disgrace "" were two of the milder terms of denigration .
And yet , interviewing Bradley Wiggins in September , I was taken aback by the Olympic champion 's delight just a few days after Armstrong announced his comeback .
Wiggins , whose vehement stance against doping has long been enshrined , appeared an unlikely ally of Armstrong .
So who do you believe ?
A maverick racer like Wiggins or a coterie of specialist reporters ?
"" I do n't care who you believe , "" Armstrong drawls .
We sit at a big round table , in touching distance of his seven blue Tour titles on the bookshelf , while Armstrong hunches over a bowl of soup and a cup of green tea .
"" I understand people in France and in cycling might have that perception but the reality is that there 's nothing there .
The level of scrutiny I 've had throughout my career from the press and the anti - doping authorities is unmatched .
I 'm not afraid of anything .
I 've got nothing to hide .
There are seven cups in this room because of my hard work .
This next year wo n't be any different - even if people hate to hear that .
I 'm going to be focusing on every aspect of the bike , the team , the strategy , the training , the hard work , the sacrifice .
There are no secrets .
To the critics I would say , believe it or not , there are exceptional athletes out there .
Michael Phelps ...
Paula Radcliffe ... ""
But neither Phelps nor Radcliffe has been engulfed by swaths of circumstantial evidence , or links to proven drug cheats .
"" There has been a fair amount of suspicion around me , and a hell of a lot of suspicion around cycling .
If the guys who finished second , third and fourth behind Phelps were all busted then people would say , ' Hey , wait a minute .
He beat 'em all - how the hell is that possible ? '
"" Armstrong nods meaningfully , conceding why there are such doubts about him .
The last time he stood on the podium in Paris , in 2005 , he said he felt "" sorry "" for all the poor saps who doubted him and the integrity of the Tour .
And yet the two men who shared his podium were both exposed as dopers .
What did he think when Ivan Basso and Jan Ullrich were busted ? ""
Egg on my face , "" Armstrong says softly . ""
But look at the Brits on the track this year - absolutely outstanding .
And still the head of French cycling said their performance ' is not possible ' .
Give me a break .
Bradley Wiggins is the best fucking pursuiter of all time .
I do n't think he cheated .
So if I could talk to your cycling buddies I would say , ' Just fucking relax .
We 're not talking about God .
We 're not talking about war .
We 're not talking about you losing every dime you had .
We 're talking about bike - racing ' .
"" Yet we are talking about doping .
Three years ago L'Equipe published their claim that a sample of Armstrong 's urine from the 1999 Tour had been retested and found to contain traces of EPO .
They published their apparent exposé under a banner headline of "" The Armstrong Lie "" .
"" I remember the call .
This house was still under construction and I was in the backyard with the contractor .
At the time I thought , ' OK , whatever ' - even if it was a big ' whatever ' .
There was hysteria and they got this big independent commission to investigate . ""
Cycling , like the world , is very divided .
One side finally said , ' OK , the independent commission cleared him so we 're moving on ' .
The other side said , ' I do n't believe the independent commission ' .
But the report was very clear and we were ready to go to the international tribunal with the lab , with Wada [ the World Anti - Doping Agency ] and the French government - and they declined .
Now they come back and say ' OK , we 'll now let you test those samples to prove your innocence ' . ""
Armstrong pushes his cup towards me . ""
Here 's your sample , "" he says , "" and the lid is now off it .
Something might have been put in it and your life , your credibility depends on it , but now I put the lid back on .
Now we come and test it .
Nobody in their right mind would take that test .
The commission cleared me and L'Equipe itself said , ' The athlete in question has no way to defend himself ' .
I 'm all for drug controls but if the athlete can not defend himself , what kind of kangaroo court is that ? ""
Setting aside the possibility of tampered evidence Armstrong 's first sample contained a residue of EPO - a fact he explains away by arguing that he used a cream for saddle sores during his first Tour win without any knowledge that it included a banned substance .
Various other people also claim that he admitted to past doping .
Is Emma O'Reilly , his former physiotherapist on the US Postal team , simply a liar
- she claimed that Armstrong had asked her in 1998 to dispose of a bag of syringes containing EPO ?
"" We all know the names .
Emma O'Reilly , Steven Swart [ his former team - mate who admitted using EPO ] , David Walsh [ the respected Sunday Times journalist and author of LA Confidential :
The Secrets of Lance Armstrong ] and Prentice Steffen [ an ex - professional cyclist who told L'Equipe that "" the bad guys , like Armstrong , dope "" ] .
We sued David Walsh in the high court and won .
The prosecutor in Paris opened a federal investigation and we were completely cleared .
We had another arbitration case in Texas and were vindicated again . ""
Betsy Andreu , whose husband Frankie raced with Armstrong , claims she heard the cyclist tell doctors treating him for cancer that he had taken performance - enhancing drugs .
"" Her husband lived , trained and raced with me and he said , under oath , ' I have never seen Lance take performance - enhancing drugs ' . ""
Armstrong 's past links with Dr Michele Ferrari , the Italian physician charged with various doping offences , are more damaging . ""
Yeah - but more was made of that relationship than existed .
And I 'm not going to kick a family friend out of my life .
There are those relationships but look at the real data .
Nobody had more scrutiny than me . ""
As part of his mission to prove himself clean on his return Armstrong will be tested daily by Don Catlin , an independent analyst , who will post his results online .
But trouble continues to brew .
"" I do n't want to enter an unsafe situation but you see this stuff coming out of France .
There 're some aggressive , angry emotions .
If you believe what you read my personal safety could be in jeopardy .
Cycling is a sport of the open road and spectators are lining that road .
I try to believe that people , even if they do n't like me , will let the race unfold .
"" Does he fear being violently attacked on next year 's Tour ? ""
Yeah .
There 're directors of French teams that have encouraged people to take to the streets ... elbow to elbow .
It 's very emotional and tense .
"" There is also something compulsive about Armstrong 's comeback , which can be seen both in his craving to succeed and the fascination surrounding his tilt against the odds .
Comparing his fitness at this stage of the season with past years he insists : "" I 'm much better physically now .
And mentally there is no comparison .
I 'm far stronger and more motivated .
The motivation of 2008 feels like the motivation of 1999 .
I was back from cancer then .
I had the motivation of vengeance because nobody wanted me or believed in me . ""
Nine years later Armstrong sounds more vulnerable than vengeful .
"" I have anxiety and insecurity about being 37 .
Let 's not forget I 'm the oldest tour winner in modern cycling history and that was four years ago .
But that nervousness makes me work even harder .
We 're doing a training camp in December in Tenerife and another in California with big climbs .
Normally I would n't smell a mountain until February
so I 'm starting early . ""
Armstrong will begin the new year in Australia before he returns for the Tour of California and more racing in France and Switzerland , followed by his debut in the Giro d'Italia .
"" I regret not riding the Giro before .
But their 100th anniversary and starting in Venice and finishing in Rome made it irresistible .
That 's the beauty of this comeback .
You lay out different scenarios in your head .
What if you won the Tour again ?
Or the Giro ?
Or if you won them both ?
Or you lost them both ?
You lay it all out
and I 'm still up for it . ""
Armstrong suggests that running marathons led to him agreeing to get back on his bike in the 100-mile Leadville Trail in August , the day his comeback began . ""
Leadville climbs 12,500 feet and I felt good the first six hours .
It was only in the last hour I ran out of fuel because I had n't done enough miles .
But I finished just behind Dave Wiens , a former world champion whose whole season revolves around that race . ""
For a man who has often said losing is akin to dying , Armstrong looks briefly satisfied with that second place .
But , deadly serious on the bike again , and beyond the claim that he is aiming mainly to raise money for his cancer foundation , Armstrong is plainly chasing an eighth Tour victory .
"" When people have cancer it 's black and white - they live and they win .
They lose and they die .
I take that same mentality into sport - to win .
My friends on the team were always quite surprised that I was n't that excited to win .
They 'd say : ' Are n't you excited ?
You just won the Tour de France for the seventh time ? '
I was '
Yeah , it 's pretty cool ' .
It would have been very different if I had lost .
But now if I 'm able to win again , any race , it might be different this time round .
We 'll see . ""

Armstrong said that he had discussed his concerns , with the great Belgian cyclist Eddie Merckx . ""
Eddie Merckx would have won six Tours if he had n't been punched .
It happens to the best of us .
Eddie broke a rib , fell over and was out of the race .
I try not to think about that stuff .

Ivan Basso and Jan Ullrich , who finished second and third behind Armstrong on his last victorious Tour in 2005 , have since been exposed as drug cheats .

The judging process for the 2008 William Hill sports book of the year was the most difficult of recent years .
And in Marcus Trescothick 's pain - streaked memoir , Coming Back to Me , it produced a most unusual winner .
It 's only the second time the prize has gone to an autobiography ; Lance Armstrong 's It 's Not About
the Bike won in 2000 .
It 's also just the second occasion on which a ghostwritten effort has prevailed ; Sally Jenkins told Armstrong 's story , while Trescothick has downloaded his agony ( world - class cricketer succumbs to mental illness ) via the keyboard of Peter Hayter .
And this year 's winner is unique in that the sporting content of the book is its least compelling component .
The judging proved troublesome in two ways .
In recent times there have been some quite obvious winners .
2005 's My Father and Other Working - Class Football Heroes by Gary Imlach was one , as was last year 's victor ,
Duncan Hamilton 's Provided You Do n't Kiss Me .
In these years , the panel - composed for some while now of John Inverdale , Alyson Rudd , the award 's inventor John Gaustad , Hugh McIlvanny and myself - just acknowledge the obvious , then tuck into an excellent supper .
This year was n't like that .
Strong briefs were held for several books on the shortlist .
The argument raged through the main course , the desserts and the coffees ; bottles remained unopened .
In the end , though , after several Twelve Angry Men - style secret ballots , it was thought that Trescothick 's book was the most deserving .
Other sportsmen - Tony Adams , Frank Bruno , Stan Collymore - have recounted their descents into turmoil , alcoholism and depression , but none had fallen as steeply as Trescothick or gone so daringly far on the page .
Even the sometimes thorny issue of ghostwriting was this time brushed aside .
Indeed , it was felt that having a confidante and a conduit may well have helped Trescothick lay bare the gruelling experiences behind his book .
Danny Kelly • Victory for a gifted self - publicist in the Bad Sex award was flagged up as likely in this column last week , and it was indeed Rachel Johnson who collected the trophy from Dominic West , the Old Etonian star of The Wire and The Devil 's Whore , for a passage in Shire Hell .
Penguin , her publisher , turned out to be double winners , as John Updike was given a lifetime award ( "" he 's been shortlisted four times ,
he 's tried so hard , "" said Alexander Waugh , son of Auberon Waugh , the award 's founder ) .
Winning this prize , though , is not necessarily good for one 's future career : Salman Rushdie had gone "" bonkers "" since his triumph ,
Waugh contended , while Sebastian Faulks had been so alarmed by being mocked that his latest effort was "" a James Bond novel without a sex scene "" .
Each shortlisted scene is traditionally read by actresses to a champagne - sozzled audience , and the winners in fact elicited less laughter than overblown passages by the rebranded Simon Montefiore , Kathy Lette and Paulo Coelho .
With every purple line , implausible utterance and dodgy metaphor cheered , this prizegiving is , in its eccentric , inverted way , a celebration of language .

A list of bands that derived their names from books - compiled by Tim d'Arch Smith and run on the literary blog Bookride ( bookride.com ) - is so lengthy as to make you wonder if there are any bands with decent names ( excluding the Beatles and Rolling Stones ) that did n't .
Among those included are Bronski Beat ( Grass ) , the Doors ( Huxley ) , the Fall ( Camus ) , Heaven 17 , Moloko ( Burgess ) , My Chemical Romance ( Welsh ) , Level 42 ( Adams ) , Soft Machine , the Soft Boys , Steely Dan ( Burroughs ) and the Thompson Twins ( Hergé ) , with others such as the Grateful Dead , the Velvet Underground and Tears for Fears mentioned as borrowing their brands from non - fiction or obscure books rather than novelists .
Welcome , too , is the information that there are , or were , bookish combos called Benny Profane , Augie March , The Bell Jar , Dorian Gray , Love and Squalor , Look Back in Anger and S / Z , that the Dead Milkmen owe their name to a Mr Macon "" Milkman "" Dead III in Toni Morrison 's Song of Solomon , and that a band called Modest Mouse drew inspiration from an all too characteristic reference to "" modest mouse - coloured people "" in a Virginia Woolf story .

I met Barack Obama a month ago , and handed him a copy of a book I 've spent the last two years working on : State by State : A Panoramic Portrait of America .
It was enormously satisfying to do this because the book , like this moment in American history , is all about reclaiming patriotism .
My co - editor Matt Weiland and I modeled State by State , which contains 50 of our greatest novelists , reporters , and memoirists writing essays on the 50 states ( plus Pulitzer Prize winner Edward P. Jones providing the sad facts on Washington DC — a capitol built , quite literally , by slavery ) , on the guide books of the Federal Writers ' project , a Depression - era literary program designed to get the economically devastated United States to take pride in itself by employing the best writers of that time to describe our history and landscape , state by state , in 48 volumes ( this was before Alaska and Hawaii were part of the union ) .
A very Obama enterprise .
More Obama than Roosevelt , really — when questioned about handing out federal money to unemployed writers like Ralph Ellison , Saul Bellow , and Richard Wright , FDR could only say , "" They are human beings .
They have to live .
"" Obama is more alive to writers ' potential to inspire .
And this was what I found when I met him .
Some convoluted patriotic background led to both meeting and project .
Before working on State by State Matt and I collaborated on an anthology about the 32 countries in the World Cup .
The premise was that national characters could be understood through the lens of soccer .
For two Americans a book about soccer trafficked in the opposite of knee - jerk patriotism — a fascination with other countries and ways of life , a very Obama endeavor .
( Having read Dreams From My Father I am sure he will be at the 2010 tournament in Africa , and that the US will win — but , of course , when it comes to soccer I am an insane person . )
The piece I wrote for the soccer book 's intro goes on a hyperbolic tangent about history and jingoism .
I wrote about the only - in - America experience of watching the 1970 World Cup in 2002 with no idea who 'd win .
As a result of this experience I found that , when viewing past events from the safety of the present , national identity peels away , patriotism dissolves , and , with nothing at stake , countries are pure underdogs and overdogs , and you can support them accordingly , free from the burden of imperatives , moral or otherwise .
Taking this freedom as far as I could take it , watching the 1970 World Cup in 2002 - 3 , I avoided rooting for Brazil , despite the beauty of their play , because rooting for Brazil in soccer seemed like rooting for my own country in the many wars ( just and unjust ) it has fought .
Too easy .
A reviewer on Amazon wrote : "" Sean Wilsey confesses that he ' roots ' for countries at war ( and , apparently , against the United States because he favors the ' underdog ' ) .
It might be best to skip page 6 if you would like to bypass this revolting notion . ""
This gave me some small insight into what it must be like to be a politician .
Meanwhile , in 2006 , I was rooting madly for the US team .
Because in soccer , much more real than real life , or some fantasy revival of the past ( we did n't qualify in ' 70 anyway ) , I damn well love America .
What 's not to love about a country that effortlessly fields a team of black , white and Asian players while the Spanish team is coached by an outright racist and the Italians all look the same ?
And as an American I sometimes believe our most cherished freedom is the freedom to speak ill of America , or even hate it .
We only hate the things we care deeply about .
So the climate of institutionalized patriotism so rampant in America over the last eight years , one of the most troubling signs of the corrosion of our country 's soul , and my tiny brush with it , made me want to do something that was truly patriotic .
A book about the 50 states !
When we decided to do this Barack Obama , like a lot of the states in the middle of the country , was obscure to me .
He 'd written a memoir and delivered a great speech , and that 's about all I know .
But as I came to know the country through the writers we 'd assigned to describe it , Dagoberto Gilb on Iowa , Randall Kenan on North Carolina , Susan Orlean on Ohio , and more coming in every week , I also got to know Barack Obama through his astounding series of victories and upsets , and the reviving effect of hearing truthful , beautiful and courageous words spoken by a politician for the first time in my life .
I began to feel that I was getting to know the country as he was getting to know the country , and the country was getting to know him , and that I was working on this book for him .
And as we both kept piling up the states he inspired me to keep giving everything I had to a project that seemed quite likely to be thankless ( what could be more unlikely to succeed than an anthology on the 50 states ? ) , much as his presidential aspirations seemed sure to end in failure ( what could be more impossible than a black president?)—but
this is the way people without patriotism think .
Eventually , wanting him to win , and wanting to experience the country I was falling in love with through all these writers describing it in such generous detail —
Charles Bock on Nevada , Andrea Lee on Pennsylvania , Carrie Brownstein on Washington
—
I went to Indiana ( Susan Choi ) with my wife and small children ( Owen , age 4 , and Mira , age 1 ) and we all worked as volunteers in the Obama campaign 's Muncie office .
Then we registered voters in Norristown , Pennsylvania , where an elderly white woman pointed to me as I pushed my daughter in her stroller , and shouted , "" You 're a nigger lover !
"" I could only laugh —
I was an America lover .
I canvassed in Mequon , Wisconsin ( intimately described by my wife , Daphne Beal , who makes her state feel like an extension of herself ) and wound up in Appalachian Ohio on election day , with people shouting "" Obama 's a nigger ! "" at us while their friends and relatives , people who had never met a person of color , went out and voted for one .
Matt
and I got a six figure advance for State by State and spent most of it paying the writers for their pieces and sending a dozen of them to their states .
And while we certainly made a lot less than minimum wage for all the time we put into the book , I wanted to do something with the money I got for editing and writing the introduction , which I sold to the London Review of Books .
My take from Harper Collins and the intro serial was supposed to be $ 27,300 .
A few days before leaving to register voters in Pennsylvania , I received a personal email from Kevin Jennings , a memoirist , amazingly enough , working for Obama , saying that according to campaign records , "" you are legally allowed to donate $ 28,500 to the Obama Victory Fund "" described as "" a committee of the DNC which exists solely to raise and spend funds for the Presidential campaign .
"" I had already given $ 2,300 , which I 'd understood to be the maximum allowed by law .
But , wanting to do everything I could , and this sum being so close to the money I was making from State by State , I gave them the full amount .
Then I received an email with details about the "" last event with Senator Obama .
"" I arrived early , with State by State in hand , and was given a seating assignment at what seemed to be the kids ' table — way in the back , as far away as possible from a stand and microphone .
Everyone else was either a lawyer or in finance .
This , I discovered , made me fascinating .
I tried to get some useful financial advice from Mark Gallogly , a youthful looking man , eyes alight with business acumen and curiosity , he asked me who 'd written about Rhode Island , and when I told him Jhumpa Lahiri , he got animated about her writing .
The book was passed around .
Gallogloy told me , "" You 've got to meet Reggie and make sure he keeps this for him . ""
Reggie was Reggie Love , a former basketball star from Duke , who 's Obama 's "" body man , "" the person in charge of the details .
He came by , and it turned out that we had a mutual friend , with whom I 'd consumed unadvisable amounts of tequila .
Reggie knew the feeling .
"" I 've seen the bottom of a lot of margaritas with that guy , "" he said .
Barack Obama arrived through a small door right next to our table , talked to Mark Gallogly , addressed the crowd , and then made his way back to us .
When he turned to shake my hand , for some reason I chose to address him by his first name , saying , "" Barack , I brought you this book . ""
To present a book reader with a book is to not have a conversation .
He took it and immediately started reading .
I went into the history of the Federal Writers Project , and he looked up to say , "" Yes , I know about it . ""
Engrossed , he kept reading .
I said , "" OK , so this is an homage and an updated version of the WPA Guides .
Some of our greatest writers have written original essays for it .
And you figure into the Illinois piece , by Dave Eggers . ""
He kept reading .
This photo of him and the book is one of six .
As I handed it to him
I was thinking "" We , all of us , did this for you .
"" I think you can see that in the picture .
Then the photographer stood there and took picture after picture .
There 's a gallery of the event on her website , and in it he stops and talks to every other person for two or three shots .
But writing slowed him down .
Finally I said , "" I donated my part of the book 's advance in order to be here , and I ca n't think of a better use for the money . ""
This broke his concentration .
He is a writer .
And he said , "" Woah .
Thank you . ""

2008-12-02,"Lance Armstrong confirmed last night that he intends to ride next year 's Tour de France .
The seven - time winner , whose comeback gets under way next month at Australia 's Tour
Down
Under , had already said he would ride the Giro d'Italia in May
but he had been ambiguous about the French race .
Speaking from Tenerife , where he is on a training camp with his Astana team , the 37-year old said last night that he would be at the Grand DÃ © part in Monaco , though not necessarily to win . ""
The Tour is the biggest bike race in the world , "" he said .
"" We need to tell this [ cancer ] story on the biggest stage .
There 's a mutual respect there , "" he continued , referring to his relationship with the Tour organisers and French public .
"" It has n't always been mutual love .
[ But ] we need them , they need us . ""
Armstrong may ride in support of a team - mate , however , with Alberto Contador , last year 's winner , a likely contender .
"" I 'm committed to riding for the best guy .
If you 've been away for three or four years it would be silly for anybody to think I could pick up where I left off . ""
As he arrived in Tenerife it transpired that the independent anti - doping programme to be overseen by the scientist Don Catlin is yet to start .
It will be in operation by his debut in Adelaide on January 18 .
The American also revealed that he has been random tested seven times since announcing his comeback in September ."
2008-12-14,"Lance Armstrong believes the Giro d'Italia â€ “ which he will ride for the first time in May â€
“ will place unprecedented demands on him as a cyclist .
The seven - times Tour de France winner , who has spent the past three years in retirement , is relishing the new and unique challenges posed by the Giro in its centenary year after its organisers announced the race format for 2009 .
"" It 's totally different for me .
I 'm used to the Tour , where you have at least 10 flat stages that do n't have an impact on the overall standings .
Whereas in the early stages of the Giro there 's going to be a lot to lose and little to gain , "" said Armstrong .
During his run of Tour victories , the American usually stayed with the pack during the opening flat stages in the first week , then blew away the competition on the opening mountain stage .
The Giro , however , will begin with a team time - trial , while the fourth and fifth legs each end with climbs .
"" We 're going to face the Dolomites right away in the first week , and they 're not just minor stages .

I 'm going to have to be ready right away . ""
Accustomed to midsummer conditions during the Tour , which is raced in July , Armstrong is also worried about bad weather in the Italian Alps . ""
At the beginning of May , on certain mountains the climate could be terrible , "" he said .
Armstrong is also relishing the prospect of the 38-mile individual time - trial on stage 12 .
"" It 's long , maybe the longest of my career , with climbs , "" he said .
"" It 's going to last about an hour and 20 minutes and there could be several - minute differences between the first , fifth , and 10th - place finishers .
"" The other key stage Armstrong has circled is the 17th leg from Chieti to Blockhaus , about half of which is an uphill finish .
"" It 's only 79 km ( 49 miles ) but short stages are always very dangerous , "" he said .
"" Some riders excel and others do n't .
And it comes after a rest day .
It 's always tougher to race after resting .

Pereiro will compete in the Tour
Down
Under as the final stage in his recovery from a crash in which he fell 10 m to a road below during this year 's Tour de France , the organisers of the Australian race said on Tuesday .
The Spaniard , who won the Tour in 2006 after Floyd Landis tested positive for testosterone , will join Armstrong in the peloton for the first time in five years at the event in South Australia .
Armstrong , the seven - time Tour de France winner , is returning to cycling after three years in retirement , and the Adelaide event , which begins on January 18 , will be his first competitive road race .
Pereiro 's Caisse d'Epargne team said his preparation had been truncated by his slow rehabilitation from injuries sustained on the 15th stage of the 2008 Tour de France .
On July 20 , Pereiro crashed over a guard rail on the side of the road during a sharp turn around the 80 km mark of the 183 km route from Embrun to Prato Nevoso .
His injuries included a fractured left shoulder .
"" If we can get Oscar to do the kilometres in the peloton and use the ideal conditions in Adelaide as preparation for the 2009 racing season , we will be extremely satisfied , "" said Caisse d'Epargne 's director , Neil Stephens .
""
After the crash in last year 's Tour de France , just having Oscar back on the bike in such a short time is fantastic . """

Armstrong , who retired after winning the Tour de France in 2005 , is making a comeback with the Astana team at the Australian race from 20 January before riding the Giro d'Italia and the Tour later in the year to promote cancer awareness .
However , O'Grady , who won the Australian race in 1999 and 2001 , said that while Armstrong would attract a lot of interest , he did not think the American would be a likely winner . ""
He 's definitely someone special and when you 're riding around with someone like that it 's hard not to get taken in , "" O'Grady told the Australian media . ""
But I wo n't be concentrating on him .
He 's not going to be the big hot favourite for the race .

Giro organisers announced today that Menchov , the Russian leader of the Rabobank team , has entered this year 's race .
Menchov finished fifth in the 2008 Giro , 3 minutes and 37 seconds behind Spanish winner Alberto Contador .
"" I 'm hoping to present myself at the start of the 2009 Giro in better form than 2008 and I will definitely be aiming for the podium , "" Menchov said .
"" The route for this year 's race is much more suited to my strengths . ""
The Giro begins with a team trial in Venice on 9 May and concludes with an individual race against the clock in Rome on 31 May. ""
After participating in the Giro last year I 've changed my mind completely about this race , "" Menchov said .
"" The results of 2008 taught me that you can enter two major races and it seems my colleagues feel the same way . ""
Armstrong , the seven times Tour de France champion who is making a comeback after three years of retirement , has entered the Giro for the first time .
With the addition of Menchov , there are now eight winners of cycling 's major races â€ “ the Giro , Tour de France and Spanish Vuelta â€ “ lined up for the Giro , accounting for a total of 16 victories in those events .
Besides Menchov , who won the Vuelta in 2005 and 2007 , and Armstrong , other top riders committed to the Giro include : Carlos Sastre with one Tour de France win , Gilberto Simoni with two Giro wins and the one - time Giro winners Ivan Basso , Damiano Cunego , Danilo Di Luca and Stefano Garzelli ."

2009-01-11,"Lance Armstrong arrived in Australia today in preparation for his return to competitive cycling a few hours after his Astana team and a few days ahead of when Tour Down
Under officials indicated he would .
The Astana squad flew in to Adelaide from Europe via Singapore for the UCI ProTour race , which starts on 18 January and marks the return of the seven - time Tour de France winner to professional competition three years after he retired .
Armstrong was said by race officials earlier today to still be training at his base in Hawaii , and that he might not arrive in Australia until midweek .
But Armstrong was then shown in television footage later in the day arriving at Sydney airport , about a 75-minute flight from Adelaide .
The Astana team manager , Sean Yates , said that the team would train without its star for the first part of the week
but he did not believe that would be a problem heading into the first race of the season .
"" Lance has been training very hard .
He 's had three years out and wants to make up some lost ground .
He 's more than ready , "" Yates said at Adelaide airport .
Cancer survivor Armstrong is using his return to cycling to further the fight against the disease worldwide .
While in Adelaide he will appear at two major functions , including one run by the Cancer Council of South Australia .
As well as the Tour
Down
Under , his race schedule for 2009 will include the Giro d'Italia and an attempt to win an unprecedented eighth Tour de France .
Writing on his blog recently , Armstrong said preparations for the new season were very different from what he had been involved with in the past , having started his training in the summer of 2008 in the United States .
"" I 've spent months and months in the gym trying to build back a certain level of strength that I think I 'll need , not just strength but core stability , "" he said .
As well as Astana , the Spanish Euskaltel Euskadi team and the French Bouygues team arrived today while AG2R

2009-01-12,"Lance Armstrong has told observers not to expect too much from him in his return to competitive cycling after three years in retirement .
The seven - times Tour de France champion will make his professional comeback in the Tour Down Under Classic criterium next Sunday , then compete in the six - stage Tour

Under from January 20 - 25 .
"" I think it would be unrealistic to expect a victory , "" said the American .
"" The race has gotten harder and harder over the years .
I hope to be in the mix , I could be completely wrong . ""
Surrounded by security guards and police officers , the 37-year - old arrived in Australia yesterday before appearing at a media conference in Adelaide on Monday .
"" I 've prepared much harder this series of months than I ever would have in the past , "" he said .
"" The tests that we do on the bike , or on the road , or in the lab indicate that my January fitness is much better than it ever was the years when I was winning the Tour .
But that does n't mean anything until you get into the race . ""
Armstrong said his decision to return to competitive cycling was influenced by his efforts in campaigning for cancer awareness .
He himself survived testicular cancer .
"" There have been times where I 've thought ' what the hell have I done ' , but they 're brief , "" he added .
"" For me it 's not so much a sporting challenge , and it 's not a financial challenge , it 's not any of those things .

After a four - hour training ride around Adelaide today in preparation for his competitive return with the Astana team for the six - stage Tour
Down
Under , which begins on 20 January , The seven - time Tour de France winner assessed the local conditions in an update on his social messaging web page .
"" Got up to 105 ( Fahrenheit , 40.6 Celsius ) here today .
Insanely hot , "" Armstrong wrote .
His motivation for a comeback to professional cycling at the age of 37 , and another shot at the Tour de France , was to campaign for cancer awareness after surviving testicular cancer in 1996 .
Armstrong visited the Adelaide Women 's and Children 's Hospital to meet cancer survivors and staff , saying "" they all inspire me so much "" .
In a television interview , Armstrong said he was coming to grips with a return to competition .
"" I 'm doing all right for an old man , "" he said .
"" I feel like I 've trained hard .
The difference will be going from training pace to actually racing .
No matter how much you train , the body has to adjust to that tempo .
"" Police and support vehicles followed the Astana team during Armstrong 's second training session since arriving in Australia on Sunday night .

As well as the Tour
Down
Under , his race schedule for 2009 will include the Giro d'Italia and an attempt to win an unprecedented eighth Tour de France ."
2009-01-16,"For many his name is synonymous with seven yellow jerseys , but to others â€ “ many , many others â€ “ Lance Armstrong 's greatest achievement is encapsulated in some yellow wristbands , more than 60 m yellow wristbands to be precise .
It is 13 years since Armstrong was diagnosed with advanced testicular cancer which spread to his abdomen , lungs and brain ; in 13 years he has won those seven Tour de France titles , established the Lance Armstrong Foundation and retired from cycling .
Today he is back in the saddle , in Australia , and today his foundation goes global .
In September the chairman of the Lance Armstrong Foundation announced the creation of the Livestrong Global Cancer Awareness Campaign and his return to competitive cycling .
Unsurprisingly , the back pages of all the newspapers focused on the second part of that announcement , rather than the 37-year - old 's plan to dispel the misconceptions surrounding cancer and convince world leaders to prioritise a disease that currently affects 25 m people worldwide .
But Armstrong says that the latter begets the former .
He told the Guardian last year that this comeback is for himself and for the foundation , and specifically the global awareness campaign : "" I do n't have to do this .
I 've got ta a lot of money
and I 've got a lot of comfortable things in my life .
I want to do this .
I want to do it for me .
I want to do it for my foundation .
I want to do it for eight million people who are going to die around the world this year of cancer .
I just want to do it .
This is not a F - U to anyone else .
I just want to do this for me . ""
To date the foundation 's work has taken place primarily in the United States .
Over $ 260 m ( Â£175 m ) has been raised in the pursuit of improvements in the prevention of cancer , quality of life for survivors , the provision of screening and care and investment in research .
But now the foundation wants to have an impact worldwide on the stigmas , misconceptions and lack of awareness on the subject of cancer that exists .
Andy Miller , vice - president for programmes and policy of the foundation , said the three elements of the campaign 's attack are raising awareness , reducing the stigma attached to the disease in certain countries ( specifically Mexico , Italy and South Africa at first ) and garnering "" substantial commitments "" from world leaders , be they governments , NGOs or corporations : "" We have done a great deal of research with NGOs who work outside of the US as well as cancer leaders globally as to what role the foundation could play and based on the results of that research we have crafted our campaign to include those three activities .
"" I think for us the enemy is not necessarily cancer , the enemy is apathy and ignorance of the impact this disease has , "" continued Miller .
"" So it 's less about a tangible outcome for cancer , but we want everyone who has the ability to prioritise cancer in the scope of their world , in the scope of their powers and responsibilities , to do that .
We want them to recognise that this disease affects millions of people across the globe , kills millions of people and it deserves to be put on the highest priority of every government and every world leader because until we do that we are never going to see a cure . ""
For the 2,000 men diagnosed annually with testicular cancer in Great Britain , Armstrong has already had an effect .
Besides the $ 2 m ( Â£1.35 m ) the foundation makes available for research every year , Krista Eleftheriou of Everyman ( a campaign run by the Institute of Cancer Research to eradicate male cancers ) , says Armstrong 's story , coupled with his high profile , has changed male perceptions of testicular cancer .
"" There is certainly evidence that more men are being diagnosed in the early stages of testicular cancer and that is when the survival rates are highest .
There have been publications and scientific journals that have attributed that to awareness campaigns such as Everyman , "" said Eleftheriou .
"" I guess men do try to be quite tough and I do n't think any man comes any tougher than Lance Armstrong , so it shows that even the toughest of men do get testicular cancer and it is just so crucial that men pay attention to their health .
"" There is no doubt that as Armstrong battles the searing heat and climbs of his first serious race since 2005 his mind will be focused on victory â€
“
no one achieves what he has without a healthy dose of bloody - mindedness â€ “ but Miller believes he will judge success differently in his second coming : "" His primary reason for returning to cycling is the impact he sees that he can have , whereas previously it was his career , it was what he was doing .
Certainly , he carried the message of being a cancer survivor with him , but I think in terms of the decision to go back it is central to the reason .
He sees it as a much more complementary activity to the goals that the foundation have .
He used to be wearing two hats , now he is integrating both of those roles . ""
For how long will Armstrong pedal his bike and peddle his message of cancer awareness ? "" As long as he feels he is having a positive impact and as long as our message is helping to support people who are affected by the disease across the globe , "" said Miller .
"" I think as long as he has passion for it , as long as he thinks he is having a positive impact , I think he 'll probably want to continue , but I do not know how long that will be . """
2009-01-17,"The 2009 season officially gets Â­underway today in Adelaide , and it will do so stalked by the past , given reports yesterday that the 2006 Spanish doping investigation , Operacion Puerto , is to re - open , and with the man who dominated the sport between 1999 and 2005 , Lance Armstrong , set to return .
Armstrong addressed the media 24 hours before his comeback race in Adelaide .
Tonight 's Cancer Council Classic is a prelude to Tuesday 's first stage of the Tour
Down
Under , for which Armstrong says he has "" modest expectations "" , but also a commitment to attack . ""
Every opportunity to be at the front , to animate the race , I will take it , "" he said .
"" If the race dictates that , and I feel good , I promise you , I will attack , "" added the 37-year old , who once more insisted that his motivation for returning is chiefly to raise global awareness of cancer .
Prominent on his new bike are two numbers , 1274 and 27.5 , the first being the number of days since his last professional race , the second being the millions of cancer deaths in the three - and - a - half years since Armstrong stepped down from the top of the podium at the conclusion to the 2005 Tour de France .
He said that he believed , back then , that his victory speech , in which he attacked the "" cynics and sceptics "" who accused him of doping to win a record seven consecutive Tours de France , would be his final act as a professional cyclist . ""
When I stepped off those steps I was done , "" he said .
"" I was not going back , no way . ""
Armstrong was flanked on that day in Paris by Ivan Basso and Jan Ullrich , both of whom were implicated , the following year , in Operacion Puerto .
Yesterday brought news that the investigation , which centred on a blood - doping ring in Madrid , is to re - open , meaning that the names of 200 athletes â€ “ including 58 cyclists â€ “ could finally be made public .
On this , Armstrong said only : "" I think [ the media has ] a responsibility to keep in mind that Puerto is not a cycling Â­controversy , it 's a sports controversy .
So if we 're going to open up Puerto , let 's talk about tennis , let 's talk about soccer , and everybody else involved .
It 's unfair to just focus on cyclists . ""
The D - word was never far away , Â­particularly with regard to the anti - doping programme that Armstrong announced in September , when confirming his comeback .
It was to be run by Don Catlin , the respected US anti - Â­doping Â­scientist , and was to be fully transparent , with data posted online .
Yet on the eve of Armstrong 's comeback there is no website â€ “ and apparently no sign of Catlin .
Armstrong said that he was visited in Adelaide this week by Catlin 's team and tested â€ “ one of 13 out - of - competition tests since he decided to return .
The Catlin programme "" is Â­formalised [ and ] under way "" , confirmed Â­Armstrong .
"" It 's the most comprehensive anti - Â­doping plan in the history of sport , and I 'm proud of it . ""
On the website , he added : "" Once we get through the first batch of testing , then Don will decide how to publicise the results . """
2009-01-18,""" If you did n't see Don Bradman bat , if you did n't see Muhammad Ali fight , if you did n't see Pele score a goal , then make sure you see this . ""
Thus finished the introduction delivered by the South Australia premier , Mike Rann , and began the comeback of Lance Armstrong to cycle racing .
Last night 's 50 km Cancer Council Â­Classic , held on a compact circuit in the centre of Adelaide and run off at a rapid 47kmph , was always unlikely to provide a podium return for the seven - time Tour de France winner , with 1,274 days having elapsed since his last professional race .
The 37-year - old floated around the middle to back of the 133-man peloton , apparently lacking the ability to sting like a bee â€ “ that was left to the sprinter Robbie McEwen , who provided the 138,000 spectators with the next best thing to an Armstrong victory : a home win .
Still , it was all about Armstrong , who , before crossing the line in 64th place â€ “ 23 seconds behind the winner , admitted to having "" a lot of anxiety "" about his first race back but "" zero doubt in my mind that I have done the right thing "" in returning to the sport .
"" That was fast , "" said Armstrong Â­afterwards .
"" The last time I did that fast in a race was back in the States in about 1990 .
But it 's fun to get back in there .
I found it a little safer and easier at the back than in the first 50 or 60 , where there was a lot of [ fighting for ] positioning happening .
"" I was a little nervous on the corners , and the hardest thing was the sun in my eyes .
It was n't my style [ of racing ] , but I enjoyed it .
It lets me relax a bit .
I had a lot of anxiety before today .
I 'm glad the first day is over and now we can get into the racing . ""
Watching from the pits , Johan Â­Bruyneel , the director of Armstrong 's Astana team , said : "" It 's a special day , an important moment .
After a lot of talk about his comeback , now it is a fact .
He has a number on his back ; he 's a racer again .
"" How effective a racer he will be remains to be seen , though after today 's warm - up event the six - day Tour Down Under , which starts , should offer more of a clue .
Already there are ominous noises with George Hincapie , who rode alongside Armstrong for each of his seven Tour wins and is now on the rival Columbia team , observing : "" I 've known him for 20 years , and I have n't seen him this fired up since we were juniors . ""
Yet Armstrong seems eager to manage expectations ; the talk of him winning an eighth Tour de France which accompanied the announcement of his comeback in September has receded , a sense of realism taking over .
"" I do n't know , "" he said when asked whether he could reclaim the title .
"" I can answer that question honestly in April or May. "" By then he will have the Tour of California , Milan - San Remo and the Tour of Flanders in his legs . ""
But I did n't call Johan [ Bruyneel ] and say that I wanted him to guarantee me leadership of the team .
That 's not the way cycling works â€ “ that would look silly .
"" There 's a very good chance I could roll up at the Tour as the fourth - strongest guy on this team , "" he added , referring to the 2007 Tour de France winner Alberto Contador and the former podium finishers Levi Leipheimer and Andreas KlÃ¶den .
"" We have to abide by the laws of cycling .
It 's the strongest guy who wins .
Always . ""
Armstrong said that he is "" sick of being asked "" about doping , but his comeback to competitive racing has coincided with the return of OperaciÃ³n Puerto , the investigation on blood doping in sport conducted by Spanish police in 2006 but shelved last year .
It was reported yesterday that Puerto was to be re - opened , which could mean that the names of the 58 cyclists â€ “ and 150 other athletes â€ “ alleged to be involved will finally be made public .
Armstrong released more details last night about the Â­independent drug - testing programme that he has implemented , which will be overseen by the respected anti - doping scientist Don Catlin .
It will involve "" testing about once every three days "" , he said , with samples to be frozen "" for two to eight years to perform new or additional tests "" .
Â­ Catlin added that the programme would be transparent "" to the public and international anti - doping authorities "" ."
2009-01-18,"Lance Armstrong finished in the middle of the field as he made his comeback to professional cycling today .
The American opted for a conservative ride in the Tour
Down
Under 's criterium .
The seven - times Tour de France winner , who retired after his final Tour victory in 2005 , made no attempt to win the 51-kilometre race around the streets of Adelaide , sticking to the middle of the peloton and finishing 64th out of 133 starters .
"" It 's fun to get back in there , it felt good , "" he said .
"" I have trained a lot for this comeback and this race .
I am glad the first day is over and we can now get into the races . ""
Armstrong said his only goal had been to make it the finish line without crashing , in a hectic race which was better suited to the Â­sprinters in the field .
"" I think the last time I did that fast a race was back in probably 1990 , "" he said .
"" I found it a little bit safer and easier in the back .
"" I was a little nervous in the corners but the hardest thing was the sun ; in one corner you had the sun in your eyes .
Now I can relax a little bit more .
There was a lot of anxiety before today . ""
An estimated crowd of 138,000 lined the track to watch the race , which was run at breakneck speed in temperatures which reached 33C. Australia 's Robbie McEwen , a three - time winner of the Tour de France 's green jersey for sprinters , won in just over an hour after riding close to Armstrong Â­during the early stages .
"" I went and said ' G'day ' to him
[ Armstrong ] in the first 10 laps of the race .
He was just happy to be there , "" McEwen said .
"" He was cruising along , no worries , just trying to stay out of trouble . ""
The Astana team head , Johan Bruyneel , said the American had done everything expected of him on his first day back in the job .
"" This is a special day .
There 's been a lot of talk since August about his comeback and finally it 's a fact , "" Bruyneel said .
Armstrong has repeatedly said the main reason for his comeback is to promote cancer awareness .
But he has not ruled out the possibility of attempting an eighth Tour de France victory .
Bruyneel has warned against expectations of a win in the Tour
Down
Under , a six - day , 800 km race that officially starts on Tuesday ,
and he said Armstrong would get much better as the season progressed .
"" It 's definitely not our ambition or intention to win here but if Lance feels good at a certain stage he will want to test himself , "" Bruyneel said .
"" We think he 's good enough to be in the front group but really to go for the win , it 's way too early and it would n't be realistic .
He needs some more time . ""
But he 's a competitor and if he was n't confident about being competitive again he would n't have done this . """
2009-01-20,"Lance Armstrong says that his comeback to professional cycling is motivated by his desire to raise awareness of cancer , and yesterday he began to put his words into action by visiting the Royal Adelaide Hospital to launch the Livestrong Global Campaign .
The goal he has set for the campaign would put his seven consecutive Tour de France victories firmly in the shade â€ “ being , as he told a 300-strong audience , "" to conquer cancer "" .
He declared : "" And we 're going to win . ""
It was a day off for the 133 riders of the Tour
Down
Under , who took part in a city - centre circuit race on Sunday evening , before today 's first stage of the race proper .
But while the majority spent it riding their bikes in the morning and lounging by the hotel pool in the afternoon , Armstrong donned a suit and tie â€ “ yellow , obviously â€ “ to visit cancer patients at Adelaide zoo in the morning , and then the hospital .
There , he addressed government officials and non - government organisations , then listened to the testimonies of cancer patients and survivors , some of them broadcast by video from Melbourne and Sydney .
Armstrong is among their number , of course , having been diagnosed with advanced testicular cancer , and given less than a 2 % chance of living , in October 1996 .
Since then , through his Livestrong Foundation , he has raised $ 250 m , most of it dedicated to "" inspiring and empowering "" cancer sufferers .
But the global campaign is more ambitious : it is to act as a catalyst for action , including greater financial support from governments and education in parts of the world where myths survive and stigma persists .
"" A single organisation can not tackle this epidemic alone , "" he said .
"" It will truly take a global effort to conquer cancer .
Starting today , we 're building a global movement and we 're going to win .
Cancer worldwide has become a massive problem , but it has also become a complacent problem and we 're not doing enough for my taste . ""
He noted that a number greater than the population of Australia , about 27.5 m people , have died in the 3Â½ years , or 1,274 days , since he last raced .
To hammer the point home , the bike he will race this year is adorned with the two numbers in bright yellow : 1,274 on one tube , 27.5 on another .
"" We do n't cry out loud , we do n't scream out loud about [ cancer ] , "" he added .
"" On September 11 , 2001 over 3,000 people from the United States and around the world died , and the world came to a halt .
This disease is a lot greater than that ; this disease , to me , is true terror . ""
After Australia his next stop is America and the Tour of California .
Asked if he expects to enjoy as close a relationship with President Obama as he appeared to have with Bush , with whom he went mountain biking , Armstrong sought to set the record straight : "" I 've spent time with [ Bush ] on and off the bike , and that 's perceived as partisan ; people say ' they 're obviously best friends . '
But listen , as a cancer survivor who 's asked to ride mountain bikes with the president , I 'm thinking one thing : once this bike ride is over with , I 'm going to ask him for something .
"" I asked him for a billion dollars [ to fight cancer ] .
Did n't get it .
But when you get the opportunity to go and ask that question , you have to go . ""
Might a similar invitation be extended by President Obama ?
"" He 's a basketball player , "" said Armstrong .
"" I ca n't jump . """
2009-01-20,"Lance Armstrong had promised to attack in his comeback race , the Tour
Down Under ,
but he showed little inclination to do so during today 's first stage .
In stifling heat and on roads not quite challenging enough to split the race , that was n't surprising .
But Johan Bruyneel , his long - time director , voiced doubts at the finish as to whether the seven - time Tour de France winner will be capable , at 37 , of recapturing his best form .
The 140 km stage , from the Adelaide suburbs into the undulating roads of the Barossa Valley , was "" tough "" admitted Armstrong . ""
That was the easy day ?
"" he asked at the finish . ""
The course , combined with a temperature in the forties , meant it was tough .
On the steep little hills I felt pretty strong , but now I 'll have to see how the recovery is . ""
Armstrong finished 120th , close to the back of the 133-man peloton , as the German sprinter Andre Greipel claimed the stage and the race leader 's jersey , as he did last year , on his way to winning four stages and the overall victory . ""
In the bunch sprints I get out of the way and let those big guys do their thing , "" said Armstrong , who was introduced to the Australian Prime Minister , Kevin Rudd , at the finish .
Sean Yates , the British assistant director of Armstrong 's Astana team , said that Armstrong had "" taken up where he left off â€ “ every time we looked up
we saw Lance near the front , surrounded by five team - mates "" .
But Bruyneel 's assessment was not quite so upbeat . ""
He 's the same rider , the same person , "" the Team Astana director said , "" but after today I think he 'll realise that he needs races .
"" You can train as hard as you like , but you ca n't simulate race conditions .
There 's a fast rhythm here .
I think his base condition is very good ; but he 's three years older and we 'll have to see if the motor is the same as before .
In terms of his endurance , I have no doubts .
Whether he has the power and speed , we 'll find out . ""
Armstrong maintained that the heat would be his enemy . ""
That dry heat affects performance a lot , "" he said .
"" There 's no way you can perform at a high level .
I went through 15 to 20 bottles . ""
The bunch sprint that decided the stage was notable not only for Greipel 's victory , after a well - drilled lead - out from his Columbia team , but for a clash between Robbie McEwen 's arm and a spectator 's camera .
The Australian rider , who won Sunday 's Cancer Council Classic in Adelaide , was just unleashing his sprint , and leading Greipel , when he collided with the camera .
Remarkably he managed to stay upright and finish fourth , his arm already swelling as he crossed the line . ""
Some genius in the crowd decided they wanted to get an action photo and reached right out over the barriers with a really big camera , "" an angry McEwen said .
"" I saw it but could n't do anything .
It hit me straight on the forearm .
It 's broken the skin
and I have a wound the shape of the camera lens .
"" McEwen , who was optimistic of continuing in the race , offered a memorable , if idiosyncratic , description of the moment of impact : "" When you hit something at 70 kph it 's like a golf swing at sixty per cent power hitting you in the arm like a baseball bat . """
2009-01-21,"Lance Armstrong faced two difficult tests on the second day of the Tour
Down
Under , the first on the stage itself , a gruelling 140 km slog from Hahndorf to Stirling , and the second in a post - race press conference , where he was asked about his plans to publicise , as he had previously promised , the results of his self - imposed doping tests .
Armstrong called the press conference ostensibly to share his thoughts on the inauguration of President Obama , describing him , based on "" three or four meetings""â€š as "" delightful , smart and present "" , but later he was asked about the transparency of the new independent drugs testing programme , being overseen by the US sports scientist Don Catlin .
The French newspaper L'Equipe reported yesterday that Armstrong had decided against the online publication of his test data .
Armstrong denied that but admitted that specific plans remain vague .
"" I think we will still publish data , but what do you publish ?
"" he asked . ""
Blood values ? ""
Armstrong suggested that his haematocrit level â€ “ which refers to the concentration of red blood cells , with the International Cycling Union setting a "" safe "" limit of 50 %
â€ “ could naturally vary . ""
Say , for example , it 's 43 , 42 , 41 , and you go to altitude for a month and it goes to 46 , "" he said .
"" Not everyone is going to say , ' You cheated ' , but someone is going to say , ' That 's not normal ' .
"" I will go with what Don Catlin wants to publish , "" added Armstrong , "" but we will definitely be publishing information . ""
Armstrong also confirmed the statement issued by his team , Astana , on Sunday evening , which claimed he would be tested by Catlin 's team every three days . ""
On average , yes , "" said Armstrong .
"" I 've been tested since I got here â€ “ blood and urine . ""
Earlier , the second stage saw Armstrong show glimpses of his old form .
At one point the 37-year - old escaped with the promising young Australian Jack Bobridge â€ “ 18 years his junior â€ “ but their break was short - lived .
"" I was following Michael Rogers and a few other guys , "" Armstrong said later . ""
[ The attack ] probably was n't the smartest thing we could have done tactically , or strategically , but I gave it a crack . ""
And he promised he would give it another crack , possibly on Saturday 's tough penultimate stage to Willunga .
Yesterday 's stage was the second - hilliest of the race , but it was won by a rider known more as a sprinter .
The Australian Allan Davis returned from two seasons in the wilderness to sprint clear of a ragged peloton in the tough uphill finale , claiming the stage and the leader 's ochre jersey from Andre Greipel , who finished 10th to slip to second overall .
Armstrong was 45th on the stage and sits 68th overall ."
2009-01-21,"Lance Armstronghad promised to attack in his comeback race , the Tour
Down Under ,
but he showed little inclination to do so in stifling heat during yesterday 's first stage .
Johan Bruyneel , director of his Team Astana , voiced doubts at the finish as to whether the seven - time Tour de France winner will be capable , at 37 , of Â­recapturing his best form .
Armstrong finished 120th , close to the back of the 133-man peloton , while the German sprinter AndrÃ © Greipel won the 140 km stage , from the Adelaide suburbs into the Barossa Valley , and the race leader 's jersey .
Bruyneel said of Armstrong : "" He 's the same rider , the same person , but after today I think he 'll realise that he needs races .

2009-01-22,"Lance Armstrong went on the attack in yesterday 's third stage of the Tour
Down
Under , the event that typically opens the cycling season in relatively gentle fashion , but which , yesterday , witnessed a day of carnage .
Strong wind contributed to two major crashes , which saw numerous casualties and retirements , but Armstrong was one of 14 riders who escaped , prompting a furious chase across the wind - battered coastal roads of South Australia .
In the end , Armstrong 's group was caught , and the American , who complained during the stage about the proximity of a television helicopter to the riders , claimed at the finish in Victor Harbour that it had been an opportunity squandered , with some riders unable â€ “ or unwilling â€ “ to pull their weight . ""
In the break some guys were playing it a little possum , "" he said .
"" Some guys did n't work for obvious [ team ] reasons , "" added Armstrong .
"" But that was a perfect group .
I told them , just pull consistently and they 'll never catch us .
But some guys were n't showing their cards . ""
As for the helicopter , Armstrong said : "" When it 's that windy the last thing you need is a big wind machine on top of you .
It 's not safe .
And it 's a little nauseating listening to that thing all day . ""
Otherwise , Armstrong added that he was happy with his form on the third day of his comeback : "" The high - end intensity , I do n't have that yet .
[ But ] you had to be strong to be in that group ; there was horsepower there . ""
Graeme Brown of Australia won the stage from the race leader , Allan Davis , with one of Armstrong 's breakaway companions , Stuart O'Grady , third .
Andre Greipel , the defending champion and winner of stage one , came off worst in the crashes , colliding with a parked motorcycle and retiring with a dislocated shoulder and cuts and abrasions .
Davis was involved in the same crash , but was unhurt .
In total , four riders retired and 12 riders were treated for crash injuries ."
2009-01-22,"A couple of major crashes overshadowed Graeme Brown 's victory in an eventful stage three of the Tour
Down
Under , as defending champion Andre Greipel was forced to retire from the race and Lance Armstrong finished in the middle of the pack .
Greipel , who collided with a parked motorbike and was taken to a local medical centre with what is believed to be a dislocated shoulder , was one of eight cyclists that came off their bikes and were forced to bring their campaign to an end .
Seven - time Tour de France winner Armstrong was in a group of 14 riders that made an early break from the peloton but eventually finished in 32nd position .
After three of six stages , Armstrong lies 39th overall , 29 seconds behind Allan Davis , who retained the leader 's ochre jersey .
Brown managed to avoid the collisions but stage two winner Davis was involved .
However , the Australian managed to dust himself off , join the peloton and finish in second place .
Davis said Greipel was an ' unlucky ' rider in the wrong place at the wrong time .
"" I knew he was going to hit it
so I moved over to the right .
He hit it and his bike threw out in front of me , "" he said .
"" It was unfortunate because it was at a time when the race was really sweating up .
I came down
but I was able to continue .
I lost minutes
but I had a great team and without them I would n't have got back .
""
South Australian Stuart O'Grady came third in the 136-kilometre stage , which finished in the seaside town of Victor Harbor , near Adelaide ."
2009-01-23,"Lance Armstrong admitted his return to competitive cycling at the Tour
Down
Under had so far been "" disappointing ""
but he refused to rule out a late victory surge .
The American , competing for the first time in three years , is in 38th position overall , 39 seconds behind the ochre jersey holder Allan Davis , who claimed the fourth stage today in a sprint finish in Barossa Valley .
The stage three victor Graeme Brown ( Rabobank ) was runnerâ€“up while JosÃ © JoaquÃ­n Rojas Gil
( Caisse d'Ã‰pargne ) was third home .
The seven - time Tour de France winner Armstrong finished in the peloton and conceded he was still a little rusty following his long lay - off .
The 37-year - old said : "" "" It 's been harder than I expected but everyone will share that .
It 's disappointing but still it 's January not July .
"" It 's all about setting and re - setting expectations , it 's been 3Â½ years .
This is still the first race back after a long time and I 'd be kidding myself if I expected to show up and pound people . ""
The race finishes on Sunday on the streets of Adelaide with the Texan insisting he will be there or thereabouts come the finish : "" I think I can be there , I know I wo n't be riding away [ from the field ] .
"" Armstrong 's best chance of winning a stage is expected to come tomorrow when the remaining 124 competitors ride the 148 km from Snapper Point to Willunga .
"" Body was tired today , legs were tired as well , "" Armstrong said .
"" You 've got ta be strong and again it depends on the wind tomorrow on Willunga .
If it 's anything like it was in training it will be hard for anybody to ride , "" he said .
Davis , who rides for Quick Step , finished today 's 143 km stage in 3 hr 29 min35 sec .
He admitted he was surprised to win because he was feeling "" very ordinary "" when it began .
"" I had pretty bad feelings today .
I pulled up a little bit stiff from the crash yesterday , "" he said ."
2009-01-23,"Lance Armstrong is prepared to "" forgive and forget "" and welcome the shamed 2006 Tour de France winner Floyd Landis back to cycling when his former team - mate marks the end of a two - year doping ban in the Tour of California in February .
Landis was stripped of his Tour title , barred for using synthetic testosterone in the latter stages of cycling 's showcase race three years ago .
Armstrong â€ “ reputedly
the world 's most tested athlete â€ “ this week made his return from a three - year career hiatus on the Tour Down
Under in Australia , and has backed Landis rejoining him in professional cycling .
"" People serve their time just like everybody else and when their time is up they get to go back to work , "" said Armstrong .
"" There was a suspension , [ now ] get back on the bike and let 's race . ""
There 's no point in criticising [ banned cyclist Ivan ] Basso or criticising Landis .
You 've paid your penalty .
That 's normally the way society works .
Let 's forgive and forget and get on down the road . ""
Landis will ride for the Ouch cycling team and debut at the Tour of California next month , starting what he plans to be at least two years with the Oakland - based team .
He said he feels "" like a kid again "" knowing that his two - year ban from cycling will end next week . ""
In my mind , it 's already behind me , "" said Landis .
"" I 'm not dwelling on that at all .
This is n't some kind of statement to shut down the critics or any kind of changing - the - world project of mine . ""
This is me doing what I 've trained myself to do for the last 15 years , and I hope that the people that follow bike racing get a better show than what they 've had the last couple years . ""
Landis has , however , rejected comparisons between his return and Armstrong 's .
"" I do n't think our two returns to the sport are that similar , other than we have n't raced in a while .
I wish him the best .
I think it 's great for cycling , and the Tour of California will be a good show . """
2009-01-25,"Lance Armstrong ended his comeback race with a flourish , attacking towards the end of 's final stage of the Tour Down
Under in Adelaide city centre , and then confirming that the race had given him "" the reassurance that I can still race at the highest level "" .
The seven - times Tour de France winner also promised to return next year .
Maybe .
"" The comeback is at least a year , "" said Armstrong .
"" It 's not three or four , I do n't think , but it could be two years .
We 'll see how the campaign unfolds .
"" The campaign â€ “ which Armstrong insists is as much about spreading awareness of cancer as it is about racing â€ “ will now move to February 's Tour of California .
After that he contests one - day races in Italy and Belgium , before his first appearance at the Giro d'Italia and then the Tour de France .
Armstrong declared the six - day race in Australia "" a good re - entry to the sport "" .
He added : "" The most important thing it tells me is that I 've been training hard , that I 've put in the miles and hours .
It 's a good indication of what I 've done so far [ in training ] .
I 've still to fine - tune things , get lighter , get fitter , and work on certain aspects of conditioning , but I felt pretty good today .
""
The 37-year - old explained that his attack towards the end of today 's stage , on the small climb of Montefiore Hill about 7 km from the finish , was possible because he had finally managed to find his optimum position on the bike .
"" It 's amazing when you get the seat angle right , "" he said .
"" It opens up the legs , and I felt much better .
It 's the best I 've felt all week , so I thought I 'd give it a go . ""
Armstrong admitted to not having the "" firepower "" to sustain the effort , and in the finale he was swamped by the peloton , with the Italian Francesco Chicchi winning the bunch sprint to take the stage .
The Australian Allan Davis finished behind him to claim the overall win .
The final - day crowd of 143,000 â€ “ a huge increase on previous years â€ “ was described by Armstrong as "" Tour de France - esque "" ."
2009-02-09,"Donald McRae 's interview with Lance Armstrong
( I 'm not afraid of anything .
No one had more scrutiny , 18 November , Sport ) certainly was spot on for irony given that he chose not to scrutinise Mr Armstrong 's allegations .
The Guardian implied I had lied when it said "" Other people , apparently , also lied about Armstrong .
Betsy Andreu , whose husband Frankie raced with Armstrong , claims she heard the cyclist tell doctors treating him for cancer that he had taken performance - enhancing drugs "" .
Mr McRae never contacted me or my husband to check that statement ; if he had we would have given him our response .
The fact is that both Frankie and I testified under a court - ordered subpoena that in October 1996 , when Lance Armstrong was asked by a doctor whether he had ever used performance - enhancing drugs , he responded , "" Yeah , "" and named several .
Both Frankie and I would repeat that testimony on oath if called to do so .
This incident was first reported in a book by David Walsh and Pierre Ballester , LA Confidential : The Secrets of Lance Armstrong , to which neither myself or my husband contributed .
Lance Armstrong has , however , consistently denied under oath and in the media that he has ever taken performance - enhancing drugs and that this incident took place .
Mr Armstrong attacked me again in the interview by stating , "" But go online and , to this day , Betsy blogs 24 hours a day about me .
If that ai n't sick , what is ? ""
I suppose I should laugh given that , although I have contributed to online discussions , I 've never had a blog in my life .

2009-02-12,"The seven - times Tour de France champion Lance Armstrong has abandoned his proposal for an independent drug - testing programme because of logistical problems and high costs .
The American rider , who competed for the first time in three - and - a - half years at last month 's Tour
Down
Under in Australia , had initially intended to hire the anti - doping expert Don Catlin to supervise a transparent biological monitoring .
However , Armstrong said today through his lawyer he would instead use Ramsus Damsgaard , who runs the Astana team 's internal testing programme . ""
After a thorough review ... the decision has been made to transfer the comprehensive programme we had planned to do with Don Catlin to Ramsus Damsgaard , "" Bill Stapleton , Armstrong 's long - time agent and lawyer , said in a statement .
"" Lance is the most - tested athlete in sports history and he is certainly the most - tested cyclist in the world since his return to the sport last year , evidenced by no fewer than 16 unannounced out - of - competition tests since August all over the world .
"" We will continue to do everything we can do to ensure transparency and honesty in his testing results .
We have the utmost respect for Don and all he is doing in the fight against doping in sport but we faced a myriad of problems relating to administration , coordination and cost . ""
Armstrong , a survivor of testicular cancer who retired after winning the 2005 Tour de France , has set his sights on attempting to add to his record with an eighth Tour this year .
He announced he was making a comeback aged 37 in September , saying he would be joining Team Astana in an effort to promote a cancer awareness campaign .
He has since reunited with Johan Bruyneel , who was the Texan 's team director for all of his Tour de France victories with the US Postal and Discovery teams from 1999 - 2005 .
In September , Armstrong said the Astana team would hire Catlin to supervise a biological monitoring of him that would be made available online throughout his training and racing .
The American has been dogged by doping suspicions over the years , although he has vehemently denied ever using performance - enhancing drugs . ""
Beyond today I 'm not going to tell you how clean I am , "" he said while announcing his comeback plans .
"" I will ride by bike around the world and Don Catlin will tell you how clean I am . ""

nine - day Tour of California which starts in Sacramento on Saturday ."
2009-02-12,"David Millar , the British cyclist who served a two - year ban for doping , has criticised Lance Armstrong for his "" naivety "" and described the American seven - times Tour de France winner 's decision to withdraw from an independent anti - doping programme as "" disappointing "" .
Armstrong confirmed yesterday that the state - of - the - art programme , to be overseen by the respected anti - doping scientist Don Catlin , was to cease before it had started .
At his comeback race in Australia last month Armstrong claimed the programme was "" under way "" , with tests conducted every three days .
It seems now , though , that the programme was stillborn , with both parties â€ “ Catlin and Armstrong â€ “ citing financial and logistical difficulties .
Armstrong said he will instead submit to an independent programme run by the Danish anti - doping expert Rasmus Daamsgard , as well as the routine out - of - competition tests conducted by the International Cycling Union ( UCI ) and national anti - doping agencies ( Nadas ) .
The American says he has had 17 such tests since announcing his comeback six months ago and yesterday , on his ' Livestrong ' website , he published data from seven of them .
"" I 'm a bit disappointed , to be honest , "" said Millar , who now sits on the World Anti - Doping Agency 's athletes ' committee and whose Garmin team has an internal anti - doping programme overseen by Catlin .
"" I do n't think he knew how hardcore the [ Catlin ] testing programme would be ; I do n't think they can have given a lot of thought to the logistics of it .
They came in [ and announced the programme ] with all guns blazing and were a bit naive . ""
The fact that Bill Stapleton [ Armstrong 's manager ] says costs were a contributory factor is a pretty poor excuse , "" said Millar .
"" They have all the [ financial ] means in the world .
I do n't think they have realised how cycling has changed and they 've been a bit naive in their expectations .
If they had said that in their [ press ] release I would have more respect for the decision . ""
Millar endorsed the programme run by Damsgaard , though the Dane 's credibility has come under attack in recent weeks after the revelation that he had accepted a racing bike as a gift from Saxo Bank , one of the other teams whose internal programmes he oversees .
Saxo Bank and Damsgaard parted company last week , though the team claimed this had nothing to do with the controversy .
"" If the anti - doping programme is being done properly , with Damsgaard and the UCI 's biological passport programme , then in all truth the Catlin programme is not necessary , "" said Milar .
"" I do n't think it raises questions about Lance , not if you put together all the other tests he 'll be submitted to .
But it 's important that the data is available to the public . """

However , a few hours after the time trial someone removed four bikes from the Astana truck outside the team hotel in Sacramento .
Armstrong 's time - trial bike , which was closest to the door because he was delayed by a post - race trip to doping control , was taken along with race bikes belonging to Astana teammates Steve Morabito , Yaroslav Popovych and Janez Brajkovic .

2009-02-16,"Lance Armstrong finished among the leaders in the Tour of California 's opening stage yesterday despite having to tackle drenching rain , a flat tire and even the theft of his time - trial bike .
Armstrong persevered to finish fifth in the stage , although he was awarded a finish time identical to that of 17 other riders in a large peloton directly behind the surprise winner , Francisco Mancebo of Spain .
Armstrong led a chase group that never quite caught up to the soaked race leaders on the final miles of a gruelling 107-mile grind .
But the day began inauspiciously and got worse before a solid finish by Armstrong , who might have been rethinking his comeback during five hours in the rain.""Holy hell .
That was terrible , "" Armstrong said afterwards .
"" Maybe one of the toughest days I 've had on a bike , purely based on the conditions .

The rain fell in steady sheets from the opening miles of Stage 1 in Davis , a famously bike - friendly college town south - west of Sacramento .
Most riders needed about five hours to cross the rolling hills of the Napa Valley before ending up in Sonoma County , but Armstrong stayed in contention despite a flat tire along the way .
Race officials did not release the stage 's results until three hours after the leaders crossed the finish line , apparently debating how to handle the rulings made necessary by the rain .
Armstrong and Astana teammate Levi Leipheimer , whose hometown is Santa Rosa , were among the 18 riders all given identical finish times 67 seconds behind Mancebo .
Their individual finishesâ€š Armstrong in fifth and Leipheimer in 15th , will count in the overall points standings .
The intricacies of the officials ' decision did n't matter to Mancebo , an 11-year professional who joined Rock Racing this year .
He took an early lead and stayed in front of the chase group until the downtown finish , when Vincenzo Nibali of Liquigas caught him with just one lap to go on the three - lap circuit .
Mancebo somehow reclaimed the lead and barely held off Nibali and Quickstep 's Jurgen Van de Walle in a surprisingly entertaining finish under such awful weather conditions .

Oscar Freire of Spain was second in the stage and Mark Renshaw of Australia third , with the top 10 all getting the same official time .
Seven - time Tour de France winner Lance Armstrong ended the day fourth overall , finishing in the main group with Leipheimer .
Armstrong remained 30 seconds behind his Astana teammate .
After the stage the Astana team spokesman Phillipe Maertens said Armstrong had spent the day "" working for Levi .
There was nothing special today . ""
Race organizers shortened the stage for safety reasons by eliminating the second of two finishing circuits and reducing the length of the stage start .
For the third straight day , strong rain fell throughout the stage , and it took its toll .
American riders Ted King , Omer Kim and Ian Macgregor individually crashed during the stage and abandoned the race .
Leipheimer and numerous other riders crashed when Leipheimer and Armstrong bumped wheels , but Leipheimer received a new bike and quickly returned to the field .
"" It was my fault , "" Leipheimer said .
"" Usually , you can put your foot down , but not today .
I just did n't concentrate for a second .
I landed on my butt .
It hurts , but nothing 's broken , so it 's no big deal .
It 's racing etiquette not to attack when the race leader crashes
, so I just took my time .
"" Rogers , a three - time world time - trial titlist , also finished in the main field and has five stages of the nine - stage race remaining to reduce his deficit .
American David Zabriskie is third overall , trailing by 28 seconds .
Hushovd , a six - time stage winner on the Tour de France , jumped to the front of the large pack with about 150 metres left . ""
Hayden Roulston started it with a little more than one kilometer to go , then Dominique Rollin pulled into the last corner , "" the Cervelo rider said . ""
Then Brett Lancaster took over after the last corner , and I passed him with about 150 meters to go .
Our team did a great job today , and I am really thankful .
It 's the first time we 've worked together and it went well , so that was a good start . ""
The fourth annual event continues today with a 115.4-mile stage from Merced to Clovis ."
2009-02-19,"Lance Armstrong 's time - trial bike was found yesterday , four days after it disappeared from the Team Astana truck after he used it in the prologue for the Tour of California .
Officers said a local resident brought the custom bike , worth about $ 10,000 [ Â£7,000 ] , to police headquarters in Sacramento , California .
The Trek Livestrong 1274 was taken after Armstrong used it during Saturday 's time - trial .
Two other bikes belonging to Armstrong 's team - mates were also taken .
Sacramento police Sgt .
Norm Leong said they were still missing .
Officers would not discuss how the resident came into possession of Armstrong 's bicycle , citing an ongoing investigation .
More than 900 people had enlisted in a search for the bike through a Facebook group "" 1 Million Citizens Looking for Lance Armstrong 's Stolen Bike "" .
The search was set up by Rob Quigley , who works in the California governor Arnold Schwarzenegger 's communications office .
Schwarzenegger 's office was not involved .
Leong on Tuesday denied an internet report which said that the theft was caught on tape ."
2009-02-19,"Lance Armstrong has his critics but no one doubts the scale of the American 's celebrity or his abilities as a marketing man .
Thirty minutes before the 2009 Tour of California swept into Modesto , a small agricultural town 120 miles east of San Francisco , volunteers busily worked the crowds lining the finishing straight , handing out Nike - branded posters and fliers advertising Armstrong 's Livestrong foundation .
Thirty minutes after the stage finished , the race organisers hand over the media room microphone to Kenny Chew , a 49-year - old who , like Armstrong , is a cancer survivor .
"" I read his book when I was going through treatment and it was a huge inspiration to me , everything he went through and what he has done with his life ever since , "" Chew said .
"" Lance gave me hope .
"" It is the same story on the streets Â­outside where Jennifer Mullen , the chief executive of the Modesto visitors ' centre , could not believe her luck when the most famous cyclist in the world announced his comeback last autumn and that it would include the Tour of California .
"" We are among 50 other towns who bid to be a Â­finishing town and we were delighted to have won the honour .
But then we found out Lance would be coming and that just took Â­everything to another level , "" she gushed . ""
He is not just a great athlete , he is also in with the Hollywood crowd . ""
For those who ca n't get enough of Armstrong the Hollywood celebrity , there is also Armstrong the internet presence .
Like a number of other "" stars "" he has adopted the social network site Twitter , regularly updating his 130,000 "" followers "" on subjects such as the theft of his Â£10,000 bike and the sights he has seen on his way to the start line .
Armstrong has also become a YouTube star in recent days , albeit alongside one of his most ardent critics , the Sunday Times journalist and former professional cyclist Paul Kimmage .
"" What is it about these dopers that you admire so much ? ""
Kimmage asked him at a press conference before the tour began â€ “ a reference to sympathy expressed by Armstrong for his countryman Floyd Landis , who was banned from the sport for two years for doping but Â­continues to tout his innocence .
Armstrong 's response , already deemed to be a YouTube classic , was as barbed as it was elegantly scripted .
Noting that the journalist had alluded to him during a radio interview as a "" cancer "" in professional cycling , he went on : "" You said , ' Folks , cancer has been in remission for four years but our cancer has now returned , ' meaning me .
I am here to fight this disease .
I am here
so I do n't have to deal with it , you do n't have to deal with it , none of us have to deal with it , my children do n't have to deal with it .
Yet you said I am the cancer .
I 'm not sure I will ever forgive you for that statement
and I 'm not sure that anybody around the world who has been affected by this disease will forgive you .
"" Those inside the room scored this vicious exchange as a draw , but in the court of Â­American opinion , where knowledge of cycling 's depressing history of drug abuse is less than skin deep , there was only one winner .
Kimmage has taken a pounding in the US media in recent days , while Armstrong has been lauded for his "" dignity "" in the face of his critics .
There was also an unexpected bonus in all of this for the cyclist , whose decision to abandon his personal anti - doping regime â€ ” a central tenet of his comeback â€ ” has been somewhat overlooked as attention focused on the verbal sparring .
Amid the combat , the intrigue and celebrity Twittering , it is easy to forget that Armstrong 's comeback is not just about selling his anti - cancer message but also about bike racing . ""
This time I will gauge victory by how much progress we make against cancer [ but ] my intention is to train and compete as fiercely as I always have , "" he said last autumn .
No one who has followed the American 's career through the years would question his competitive spirit but as the Tour of California heads towards to conclusion this weekend , there are many who have been astounded by his performances in the saddle , including , it seems his Astana team - mate and 2007 Tour de France winner , Alberto Contador .
"" I think we will both be equal , "" the Spaniard said yesterday when asked about team 's pecking order for this year 's Tour .
As yesterday 's fourth stage , a 115-mile ride through the Californian heartland began , Armstrong was in fourth place , 30 seconds behind the leader , his Astana team - mate Levi Leipheimer , for whom he has worked diligently all week .
Yet there is growing suspicions that he will try to win tomorrow 's time - trial , both in effort to gauge his own competitiveness and to make a statement of intent for the summer ahead .
If he fails tomorrow , he has lost nothing .
If he wins , then the legend will grow .
"" I do n't mind at all , "" said the stage three winner Thor Hushovd when asked if he minded that his efforts , and those of his fellow competitors , had been subsumed in the clamour that accompanies Lance Armstrong everywhere .
It was a diplomatic answer , but it hardly dispelled the belief that even he if he did mind he does n't have any choice ."
2009-02-19,"Britain 's Mark Cavendish sprinted to victory in yesterday 's fourth stage of the Tour of California .
Cavendish , who won four stages on last year 's Tour de France , surged to the finish of the 185.7 km stage from Merced to Clovis in a time of four hours , 42 minutes , 38 seconds .
Levi Leipheimer , overall leader after the second stage , crossed the line in the chasing pack to retain his 24-second lead over Australian Michael Rogers while Lance Armstrong , reunited with his bicycle stolen four days ago , finished in the main pack to stay fourth overall , 30 seconds behind Leipheimer . ""
The first one and a half hours were blazing , "" Leipheimer said .
"" Even Lance took some monster pulls and brought back four or five guys on his own .
It 's great to have such a strong team . ""
Armstrong , competing on home soil for the first time since ending his three and a half - year retirement , was delighted to maintain his overall position after a gruelling stage .
"" It was a hard race and it was aggressive racing , "" said the 37-year - old American , who was informed midway through the day that his $ 10,000 custom bike stolen in Sacramento after the opening stage had been found .
"" It was n't that easy today .
All in all , it was a tough day .
"" For the second stage in a row , several crashes occurred , forcing the retirement of Luxembourg 's Kim Kirchen , the three - times world champion Oscar Freire of Spain and the American Scott Nydam .
Three riders , among them the 2004 Olympic time - trial gold medallist Tyler Hamilton , built a big lead for much of the day , before Cavendish out - sprinted Belgian Tom Boonen to the finish .
The nine - day event continues with today 's fifth stage , a flat 216.1 km run from Visalia to Paso Robles ."
2009-02-23,"Lance Armstrong has confirmed that he will compete in the Tour of Ireland in August .
The Texan , who has returned to racing four years after retiring , with the aim of winning an eighth Tour de France , will use his appearance in the lower - profile Irish event to promote his cancer charity .
The Lance Armstrong Foundation has organised the first Livestrong Global Cancer Summit , from 24 - 26 August in Dublin , starting the day after Armstrong completes the stage race .
"" Unless we act on a global level , cancer will be the leading cause of death by 2010 , "" said Armstrong , who recovered from testicular cancer earlier in his career .
"" Our goal is to be the catalyst that brings everyone together to fight cancer â€ “ from survivors , like me , to world leaders and policy - makers who must commit completely to the effort to avoid a public health catastrophe . ""
The summit provides an invaluable opportunity to stand up for the 28 million cancer survivors worldwide and to create a unified effort to control cancer through new commitments to action . ""
The 37-year - old , who has competed in the Tour of California and the Tour
Down
Under this year , last took part in the Irish race in 1992 .
The Tour of Ireland director Darach McQuaid said : "" The Tour of Ireland could not be more proud than to have Lance Armstrong riding once again on Irish roads in the lead - up to his global cancer summit in Dublin . ""
The massive , positive public reaction to his comeback to the sport in Australia in January and California in February indicate that , by the time Lance arrives in Ireland next August , the interest levels will be at fever pitch . """
2009-02-23,"Lance Armstrong is enjoying his new role as a domestique .
The seven - time Tour de France champion , who has returned to cycling three years after retiring , yesterday helped an Astana team - mate , Levi Leipheimer , complete a Tour of California hat - trick .
"" I did n't come in here with any expectations other than to ride for Levi , "" Armstrong said after finishing seventh in his first race on home soil since coming out of retirement .
"" I think it will be good for me , personally .
I spent 15 years sitting on the peloton 's wheel waiting for the final hill to attack .
"" It 's kind of cool to be pulling away at the front [ of the peloton ] today .
It might be good for my life . ""
During his career , Armstrong has had to live under a sometimes uncomfortable media spotlight .
In California , the 37-year - old American seemed to relish the anonymity of the peloton .
He was more than happy to let the attention fall on Leipheimer , who grabbed the overall lead after the second stage and never looked in danger of failing to add a third straight triumph in the Golden State .
Armstrong worked tirelessly for his team - mate , often riding at the front of the main field and controlling the pace .
During the Tour 's two individual stages , the prologue in Sacramento and stage six 's individual time trial , Armstrong showed he is still capable of battling with the best by posting 10th and 14th place finishes respectively .
Armstrong , who was 29th overall in his comeback debut in the five - day Tour Down
Under in Australia last month , is not scheduled to race again until 21 March , in the Milan - San Remo one - day Italian classic .
He will then throw himself into preparations for the Tour of Italy and the Tour de France .
This year will be the first time he has attempted to ride in two three - week events in one season . ""
Like I 've said many times , if I could get top 10 to top five or even top three that would be perfect , "" Armstrong said of his Tour of Italy expectations .
"" Having never done the Giro [ d'Italia ] and the Tour [ de France ] , I have to be aware that it 's a difficult thing to do .
"" It 's something I 've never experienced but we 'll come into the Giro as fit as we can possibly be .
You do n't want to kill yourself .
"" I have to admit there are other riders who are more motivated than some of us , guys like [ Ivan ] Basso or [ Damiano ] Cunego .
They 'll be hard to beat in their national Tour . ""
But do n't mistake it .
We 're not going to be rolling around for three weeks eating pasta and drinking chianti .
We 're coming to race .
I just do n't know how strong I will be . """
2009-03-03,"Lance Armstrong will continue his comeback by returning to Europe for two races , his Astana team have confirmed .
The 37-year - old Texan is set to race for the first time with his team - mate and rival Alberto Contador of Spain when he takes part in this month 's Tour of Castilla y Leon and will compete in the Milan - San Remo one - dayer .
Armstrong 's participation in the Spanish race means , however , that the American will miss the Criterium International on 28 - 29 March and the Tour of Flanders and so will not race in France before the Tour in July .
Contador , who won the 2007 Tour , and Armstrong were not supposed to race together before the Tour de France in July .
Reuters"
2009-03-08,"Alberto Contador beat Bradley Wiggins by seven seconds to win the opening stage of the Paris - Nice stage race today .
Wiggins had identified the 9 km time trial as his first major target of 2009 , but he had to settle for second behind the 2007 Tour de France winner , recently described by his Astana team - mate Lance Armstrong as "" the best cyclist in the world "" .
Torrential rain made the circuit in Amilly treacherous , but Wiggins managed an average speed of more than 30 mph to claim the lead .
The triple Olympic gold medallist remained at the top of the leaderboard for an hour , resisting the challenge of his Garmin team - mate and fellow Briton David Millar , who eventually placed fifth , and his time was looking good enough to win before Contador intervened .
Contador 's performance in a discipline in which he is not a specialist underlined his status as favourite for the eight - day race , which he won in 2007 but missed last year because his Astana team was excluded after doping scandals the previous season ."
2009-03-17,"Floyd Landis , back after a two - year doping ban , is trying to decide whether to follow his American compatriot
Lance Armstrong 's example and ride again in the Tour de France .
Landis , whose 2006 Tour title was taken from him after he failed a dope test , says he will decide soon whether to go for the 2010 Tour .
"" I will take a few weeks of peace and quiet to assess what I want to do with the next years of my life and see if it leads me to want to do the Tour de France again and all the chaos that surrounds a bicycle race , "" he said .
"" I would have to make a decision by the time this Tour de France comes around .
If I went back , the objective would be to win it again .
And the objective would be for the resulting win to give me some time to enjoy it rather than the way it played out last time . ""
Landis , the first rider to be stripped of a Tour victory , has continually denied any wrongdoing and spent much of the last two years trying to prove his innocence .
A 10-day hearing in California and a five - day hearing in New York by the Court of Arbitration for Sport ( CAS ) rejected his assertion that his positive test for synthetic testosterone was due to procedural mistakes by the laboratory .
"" I 'm disappointed with the result , about the way it went
but I do n't regret any decisions I made
, "" Landis said about the losing battle to clear his name ."
2009-03-20,"Lance Armstrong plans to hold clear - the - air talks with Alberto Contador after claiming last week that the Spanish rider "" still has a lot to learn .
"" The American made the comments after Contador lost three minutes and the yellow jersey on the penultimate day of the Paris - Nice race .
Contador said he had run out of energy after forgetting to eat in the excitement of the key stage .
Armstrong said he has "" a ton of respect for Alberto "" and that he will sit down with the Spaniard to smooth things over .
Armstrong , the seven - times winner of the Tour de France , is competing in the Milan - San Remo one - day classic on Saturday after returning from retirement this year .
Contador won the Tour in 2007 ."
2009-03-21,"Mark Cavendish scored the biggest victory of his career , winning Milan - San Remo , the opening classic of the season , with a ­devastating ­finishing sprint that gave him the win by a couple of centimetres from the German rider Heinrich Haussler .
The 23-year - old from the Isle of Man becomes only the second British rider to win one of the monuments of the sport , after Tom Simpson , in 1964 , and he said that it was "" the best day of my life "" .
In a race that also saw the return to European racing of Lance Armstrong , Cavendish confounded most people 's expectations , including his own , by still being in contention as the 100th edition of Italy 's most prestigious one - day race tackled the final two climbs , the Cipressa and the usually decisive Poggio .
By the riviera in San Remo , Cavendish appeared to be foiled by a late attack by Haussler , who jumped clear in the final 300 m .
The German launched his bid just as the British rider 's final Columbia team - mate , George Hincapie , swung from the front , having set up the sprint .
Cavendish hesitated a split second , allowing Haussler to gain several metres , then dived after him .
Cavendish homed in on Haussler 's back wheel , drawing level with him in the final few metres and edging just ahead on the line .
It took several minutes for the result to be confirmed , though Cavendish was already celebrating , his arms wrapped around Hincapie .
Behind Cavendish and Haussler there was clear daylight , with Thor Hushovd leading home the other top sprinters two ­seconds back .
Cavendish had insisted before the race that he was riding for experience , and that , at 23 and with this his debut in Milan - San Remo , it would be a learning experience , not least because of the mammoth distance .
Yet as the leading group of around 50 riders approached the Poggio – with Armstrong among those who had been left behind on the Cipressa – Cavendish appeared comfortable , sitting behind Hincapie towards the head of the bunch .
Cavendish slipped back as the climb wore on , but no one established a ­decisive gap by the summit and he was able to use his considerable bike - handling skills to move back towards the front and tee himself up for the finish .
Though he has long proclaimed himself "" the fastest man in the world "" , his final sprint was perhaps his most impressive yet ; more impressive , even , than in any of his four stage wins during last year 's Tour de France .
He admitted that he had been surprised by Haussler 's late attack .
"" I was quite surprised to see him go , and I was lucky to get him on the line , "" he said .
"" It 's incredible , "" continued Cavendish , who dissolved into tears at the ­finish .
"" I 'm so happy – it 's the best day of my life .
I did n't expect to win . ""
Cavendish now switches his attention to the track , travelling to Poland for the world track championships , which begin on Wednesday .
He will ride Thursday 's scratch race and Saturday 's madison with his fellow Manxman , Peter Kennaugh ."
2009-03-23,"Lance Armstrong 's participation in this year 's Tour de France is in doubt after his return to European racing ended abruptly when he crashed heavily towards the end of stage one of the Vuelta a Castilla y LeÃ³n .
The seven - time Tour de France winner was one of six riders to fall with 20 km remaining
but he was the worst injured .
He was taken to Valladolid University Hospital from where he confirmed , as he left , he had broken his collarbone .
Armstrong said he would fly to the United States and meet medical experts to decide whether he needs surgery , leaving in question his place in the Tour de France in July .
"" We 'll go from there , "" he said .
"" I think for the Tour
it 's a very big problem . ""
"" The crash has put my upcoming calendar in jeopardy but the most important thing for me right now is to get back home and rest up and begin my rehab , "" Armstrong said .
The accident also makes him highly doubtful for the Giro d'Italia , which gets under way in a little over six weeks , and the Giro warm - up race the Giro del Trentino .
Before he retired in 2005 , Armstrong appeared blessed either by exceptional luck or supreme bike - handling skills , such was his ability to remain upright throughout his seven - year winning run .
Today 's crash , in his first stage race in Europe since the 2005 Tour , is the type that happens in virtually every road race , coming as the peloton filed down a narrow road , in frantic pursuit of two escapees , with the cause an apparent touch of wheels . ""
In 17 years as a pro , I have been lucky to avoid one of the most common cycling injuries , "" Armstrong said on his team Astana 's website .
"" The crash has put my upcoming calendar in jeopardy , but the most important thing for me right now is to get back home and rest up and begin my rehab . ""
So far the Texan 's comeback season has seen him complete the Tour
Down
Under and the Tour of California .
A fourth - place finish in the latter suggested he might be on course for an eighth Tour win but his return to Europe has been less successful .
On Saturday he was dropped on the penultimate climb of the Milan - San Remo classic , finishing 125th , eight minutes behind the winner , Mark Cavendish , whose performance Armstrong described as â€šÃ„Ãº""spectacular "" .
Even if he recovers for the Giro , his chances of victory are certain to be compromised by his injury .
Along with Trentino , the Vuelta a Castilla y LeÃ³n was to form an important plank of his preparation , as well as his only pre - Tour de France chance to ride alongside his team - mate , the 2007 Tour winner Alberto Contador .
It is not clear who will lead the Astana team at this year 's Tour , especially in light of Armstrong 's criticisms of his Spanish team - mate after the recent Paris - Nice .
Armstrong said Contador "" has a lot to learn , "" though in an interview with Cycling News he claimed "" that is not a negative comment [ but ] you have to admit there were some tactical errors made . ""
He added that "" this is a discussion [ Contador ] and I need to have . ""
In the same interview , Armstrong confirmed that the Tour de France is his priority , and suggested that he might not finish the race that "" is a close second , "" the Giro , due to the possible arrival of his fourth child , to girlfriend Anna Hansen .
"" I need to start thinking about that , "" said the 37-year - old .
"" I guess a lot depends on how the race is shaping up . ""
He added , however , that he "" will be close "" to the ' maglia rosa ' â€ “ pink jersey â€ “ of race leader ."
2009-03-23,"Lance Armstrong has fractured his collarbone after crashing during the first stage of Spain 's Vuelta Castilla of Leon .
The cyclist was caught up in an incident involving a number of riders on the 168.3 km course between Paredes de Nava and Baltanas .
On a statement released via Twitter , Johan Bruyneel , the Astana general manager , said : "" Clean collarbone fracture without complications .
Should be fast recovery .
"" The five day race was the first time Armstrong and Alberto Contador had ridden together for the Astana team and the event was being scutinised to see whether the pair could force a partnership .
Before the start , both played down problems rumoured to exist between them .
Since Armstrong 's comeback , it has not been clear as to who was the team 's top rider .
"" I think right now it has to be him , naturally , "" Armstrong said before the race .
"" There 's no way I can come back after four years and reclaim leadership or reclaim some type of ownership .
I have to respect the current results
and he 's the best right now .
And until that changes , he 's the leader . ""
While Armstrong has won the Tour de France seven times , Contador , who won the 2007 Tour and the 2008 Spanish Vuelta and Giro d'Italia , is also aiming for victory in Paris .
However , Armstrong had hoped the Vuelta of Castilla and Leon would allow the team to settle before the Tour de France .
Armstrong was also asked about his relationship with Contador . ""
It does n't feel as if there is a problem , "" Armstrong said .
"" I think there is a perception that there should be a problem
but I do n't think we feel that .
"" Contador , too , hoped the race would help them .
"" It 's the first time we coincide , Lance and I , "" the Spaniard said .
"" It 's important for that reason because it will allow us to get more relaxed . ""
Armstrong showed in his first race in Europe since returning that he still has a long way to go to regain top form after finishing 125th in the Milan - San Remo classic on Saturday .
"" I was shooting for the top 125 , so I was happy
I just made it , "" he joked ."
2009-03-24,"Once again Lance Armstrong is playing out his troubled preparation for the Tour de France on Twitter .
First his bike got nicked and now he 's broken his collarbone in a crash in Spain .
In both cases his followers on Twitter ( 380,795 and rising fast ) were among the first to know .
"" I 'm alive !
Broken clavicle ( right ) .
Hurts like hell for now .
Surgery in a couple of days , "" he tweeted last night with his left hand .
He has already posted not one but two Twitpics of himself in a sling .
The comments section on his Twitpic provide fans with a forum to wish him a speedy recovery . ""
Hey Lance , it 's a shame you got caught in this fall however it makes your comeback more epic , "" writes s_levaillant .
Some have even offered advice on how his recovery might be hastened .
"" Lance , try using Hyperbaric Chamber after the surgery , it speeds up the healing process and boosts your immune system , "" advises jaysaperture .
His participation in the Tour is looking doubtful but at least he 'll have more time to tweet ."
2009-03-24,"The Astana team manager , Johan Bruyneel , is confident that Lance Armstrong 's broken collarbone will not prevent him from riding in either the Giro d'Italia or Tour de France , though he is not likely to be a contender for the title in the Italian classic .
"" I do n't think this changes anything for the Tour de France , "" Bruyneel said today .
""
A broken collarbone in the month of March does not at all compromise the start of the Tour de France or your performance in the Tour de France . ""
The Tour runs from 4 to 26 July , but the 37-year - old American had also planned to ride in the Giro for the first time from 9 to 31 May.
Bruyneel said the team was "" not ruling out the Giro at all "" .
"" Being at the start of the Giro is no problem , "" Bruyneel said .
"" But he has to have at least a decent level to be in the race and to compete at a certain level
â€
¦
Now it 's almost clear that he 's not going to be able to be a contender
but we just have to change our focus and try to do the Giro , if he can get to the start , with another mentality . ""
Armstrong fractured his collarbone yesterday after crashing in the first stage of the Vuelta a Castilla y LeÃ³n race in northern Spain .
The seven - times Tour champion stayed in Bruyneel 's house in Madrid last night before flying out today to Austin , Texas , for possible surgery .
"" Sitting in the airport getting ready to fly home .
Layover in NYC then ATX ! ""
Armstrong wrote on his Twitter feed .
Bruyneel said Armstrong would see a specialist in Austin as soon as possible . ""
Maybe tonight , maybe tomorrow morning , and then we 'll see what the verdict is
, "" Bruyneel said .
"" I would say at first it 's not a complicated fracture , which is good â€ ¦
there 's no displacement or anything complicated .
I think now the question is whether there 's going to be surgery or not .
That 's up to the specialists .
"" Armstrong was riding in only his second race in Europe since returning from retirement .
Last week , he finished 125th in the Milan - San Remo cycling classic , more than eight minutes behind the winner , Mark Cavendish . ""
He was very disappointed .
Spirits were not high yesterday , I have to say , but that 's logical , "" Bruyneel said .
"" He has to consider himself lucky that it 's not worse . ""
From all the bones you have in your body , if you have to break one , I would choose the collarbone because it 's the one that heals the fastest .
It 's not a leg or a knee or a foot or a hip , which would mean several weeks or months without any activity . ""
Armstrong crashed after a pile - up of riders about 20 kilometres ( 12.5 miles ) from the finish of the first stage of the Castilla y LeÃ³n race .
Bruyneel said Armstrong hit the ground hard with his head , breaking his helmet .
Armstrong was riding alongside his Astana team - mate Alberto Contador for the first time .
Contador won the Tour de France in 2007 , two years after Armstrong won the last of his seven straight titles .
"" It 's a shame to lose Lance in this way because he was eager to get some good preparation in this race , '' Contador said .
"" It was a good opportunity for us to work together in a race .
The only thing I can do is to give him my best and hope he recovers as soon as possible to race in the Giro . """
2009-03-24,"Alberto Contador has wished Astana team - mate Lance Armstrong a speedy recovery from the injury that is threatening to wreck his preparations for the Tour de France .
Armstrong sustained a broken right collarbone during the opening stage of the Vuelta a Castilla y Leon in Spain yesterday , and the American confirmed last night he is to return to the United States where he is set to undergo surgery later this week .
That has put into question his participation in the Giro D'Italia , which starts on 9 May , and could also seriously affect his build up to the Tour de France in July , where the 37-year - old was looking to claim his eighth title after coming out of retirement .
Spaniard Contador , who won the Tour de France in 2007 when Armstrong was retired , said : "" It 's a shame to lose Lance in this way because he was eager to get some good preparation in this race .

He was referring to Mark Cavendish , the 23-year - old rider from the Isle of Man whose victory in the event had come at his first attempt , emblazoning his name on an honours board also illuminated by those of Alfredo Binda , Fausto Coppi , Eddy Merckx and other immortals of the sport .
Cavendish may have taken the race by less than an inch from his nearest pursuer , but it would be very hard to exaggerate the scale of his achievement .
Milan - San Remo is one of the five events known as the "" monuments "" of cycle racing , and only once in a history going back to 1907 had it been won by a British rider .
Tom Simpson 's victory in 1964 is one of the undisputed pinnacles of British road cycling , up there with Robert Millar 's King of the Mountains triumph in the 1984 Tour de France and Nicole Cooke 's world championship in Varese last autumn .
Now Cavendish has joined them .
After spending almost seven hours in the saddle covering a 190-mile course including the climbs of the Poggio and the Cipressa at an average of over 27 mph , Cavendish demonstrated a combination of blazing speed and an instinct for the kill unequalled among contemporary cyclists .
Once again , as he has been doing for the past 12 months , he left the world 's best sprinters in his wake .
Two stage wins in last year 's Giro d'Italia turned out to be a mere hors d'oeuvre for his success in taking four stages of the Tour de France .
Only the absence of suspended Tom Boonen , the world 's No1 sprinter , placed the tiniest of question marks against those wins , but a fit and firing Boonen was left behind Cavendish on Sunday , as he had twice been in this year 's Tour of Qatar , and then twice more in the Tour of California .
Now Cavendish has the endorsement of Armstrong to go with that of Merckx , who recently compared him to Djamolidine Abdoujaparov , the Uzbek sprinter of the 1980s christened the Tashkent Terror by my colleague William Fotheringham .
Like Abdoujaparov , Cavendish takes no prisoners when a race reaches its explosive climax .
Nor is he inclined to show much reverence for his rivals off the bike , which has not always made for easy relationships .
Boonen , for example , pointedly questioned his ability to haul himself up the mountains in the way that will be necessary if he is to realise another of his great ambitions and win the points leader 's green jersey in the Tour .
But in the Tirreno - Adriatico race earlier this month Cavendish was required to make two ascents of the terrifyingly steep Montelupone , and on Saturday he had the satisfaction of watching Boonen fall behind him on the climbs .
Mario Cipollini , the Italian sprinter , was understandably offended last year when Cavendish went past him pedalling with one leg in the prologue to the Tour of California , a gesture of disrespect that Cavendish now recognises as juvenile .
On Saturday , Cipollini was there to congratulate him . ""
He 's a real nice guy , "" Cavendish said .
A ballroom dancer and a talented chess player in his teenage years , Cavendish is an interesting and unresolved mixture of eloquence and passion , of intellectual precision and blunt force .
Sprinters have to be major - league egotists , but no riders are more dependent on their team - mates and Cavendish never fails to express his gratitude to those prepared to give their all before peeling away to let him unleash his final dash to the line .
The last glimpse most British sports fans had of Cavendish was when he rode straight out of the Beijing velodrome in a storm of frustration last summer .
He and Bradley Wiggins , having started as favourites in the madison , could finish only eighth , making Cavendish the only member of the British cycling squad to go home without a medal .
But if he goes on at this rate , he will end up with the biggest trophy cabinet of the lot .
When Campbell met Fergie : an exercise in self - regard When he reflected on his part in the 2005 Lions tour to New Zealand , Alastair Campbell – hired by Sir Clive Woodward as chief PR man – expressed his regret that the media had not beaten a path to his door .
"" I was ready to give them ideas , "" he told David Walsh of the Sunday Times .
To judge by Campbell 's interview with Sir Alex Ferguson , which forms the cover story of the current edition of the New Statesman , he is the one who could do with a refresher course in journalistic techniques .
The cosy banality of the exchange between New Labour 's spin doctor and the Old Trafford godfather would have prompted any half - decent editor to send the copy back to its author with a note of polite rejection .
On this occasion , however , the editor – "" guest editor "" , in fact – was Campbell himself , a fact reflected in the dire , self - congratulatory nature of the rest of the magazine .
What other editor would put a picture of himself on the cover , or commission the publisher of the French edition of his novel to pen a little billet - doux for public consumption ?
But then this is same man who , when introducing his interview with a seven - times winner of the Tour de France , made a purring mention of the way his subject 's PR people had referred to their rendezvous as "" the Armstrong - Campbell summit "" .

Benítez 's ' blunder ' on Heskey ,
two months on When Rafael Benítez failed to buy Emile Heskey in January , he went against the advice of those of us convinced we could see exactly what Liverpool were missing – and who then congratulated Martin O'Neill on snapping up a player capable of adding the last piece to the Aston Villa jigsaw .
The consequences have been fascinating and salutary to observe .
Since the closure of the transfer window , faltering Liverpool have played 10 matches , winning seven , drawing one and losing two , while high - flying Villa have played nine , won two , drawn one and lost six .
Conclusions on a postcard , please .
Who will count the costs of keeping down F1 costs ?
Max Mosley , who is keen to cut expenditure in formula one , made the teams spend the winter developing an energy - recovery system , at a collective cost of many tens of millions of pounds .
Now , in pursuit of further budget cuts , he announces that teams which spend less than £ 30 m a season will be given the benefit of less restrictive technical regulations .
But how much will it cost the governing body to conduct detailed audits in order to determine which teams are inside the limit ?
And who will believe the figures anyway ?
Gerrard 's latest hat - trick may need an asterisk Steven Gerrard is the outstanding individual of the current domestic football season , and no one could begrudge him his first Premier League hat - trick on Sunday .

But two might call for an asterisk in the record books ."
2009-03-25,"Lance Armstrong believes he will be fit to race in May 's Giro d'Italia despite suffering a broken collarbone in a racing accident on Monday .
The seven - time Tour de France winner crashed on stage one of the Vuelta a Castilla y Leon and will undergo surgery in the United States to insert a metal plate to strengthen the affected area .
Armstrong revealed his latest scan showed the broken bone had fragmented into "" multiple pieces "" , but he nevertheless remains confident about his recovery prospects . ""
[ The scan ] showed the clavicle in quite a few more pieces than we originally thought , "" said the American .
"" There will definitely be a plate placed on the top of the clavicle so he [ Elenz , the US - based surgeon ] can anatomically put all this stuff back together . ""
Obviously the Giro is on people 's minds and that 's about five weeks away .
I think the Giro is still very doable .
This is definitely a setback , no doubt .
It 's the biggest setback I 've ever had in my cycling career , so it 's a new experience for me . ""
The 37-year - old insists the injury should not present him with an insurmountable obstacle in his bid to return to competing on the Tour after coming out of retirement .
"" It 's a very common cycling injury , "" he said .
"" You hear of guys who race two weeks later , you hear of guys who race two months later . ""
Standard recovery time for the type of injury suffered by Armstrong is four to six weeks , leaving the American with no room for setbacks in his rehabilitation with the Giro due to begin on 9 May."
2009-03-26,"The surgeon who operated on Lance Armstrong 's broken collarbone does not expect the injury to heal completely for at least eight weeks .
The seven - time Tour de France champion has had successful surgery on the injury he suffered in a racing accident on Monday , crashing on stage one of the Vuelta a Castilla y Leon .
Armstrong , 37 , had a five - inch stainless steel plate and 12 screws inserted in a effort to repair the collarbone , which was broken in four places . ""
Normally we see eight to 12 weeks for something like this to heal completely , "" said Dr Doug Elenz , an Austin orthopaedic surgeon who frequently operates on athletes .
That time - frame would appear to put Armstrong 's appearance in the Giro D'Italia in real jeopardy - the start of the race is less than seven weeks away on 9 May.
Dr Elenz stressed , though , that the estimation was for a complete mend , so the Astana rider is expected to be back on his bike sooner .
But the doctor revealed Armstrong 's injury was more complex than first thought , the surgery taking almost three hours .
"" If you had to pin me down , I 'd say it was an eight , "" he added on Astana 's official website when asked how difficult the surgery was on a scale of one to 10 .
A message on the Astana rider 's twitter feed yesterday confirmed the surgery had gone according to plan : "" All went well .
Lance is in recovery .
Same guy just 12 screws in his collarbone . """
2009-04-07,"Lance Armstrong has denied having "" misbehaved "" during a random drugs test conducted by the French anti - doping authority last month .
The seven - times Tour de France champion was requested , while training in France , to provide urine , blood and hair samples to a tester from the French Anti - Doping Agency ( AFLD ) .
The AFLD said yesterday that the 37-year - old American behaved strangely when the tester asked him to provide the samples and it sent a report to the International Cycling Union ( UCI ) .
The UCI said it could not rule on the matter since the test , which proved to be negative , was commissioned by the AFLD .
Armstrong , who described reports in France that he had "" misbehaved "" as outrageous , said he just wanted to have the tester 's ID checked before complying with the request .
"" I had never heard of labs or governments [ the AFLD reports to the French government ] doing drug testing and I had no idea who this guy was or whether he was telling the truth , "" the Astana rider said in a statement .
"" We asked the tester for evidence of his authority .
We looked at his papers but they were far from clear or impressive and we still had significant questions about who he was or for whom he worked .
I was there with [ the Astana team manager ] Johan Bruyneel and two other people .
We told the tester we wanted to check with the UCI to confirm who he was and to make sure he was n't just some French guy with a backpack and some equipment to take my blood and urine . ""
Armstrong added everything happened within 20 minutes and that there were no further problems .
"" Johan had confirmed with the UCI that the tester had authority from the French government to take samples .
I immediately provided blood , urine and hair samples
â€ “ all the samples that he requested , as he requested , "" Armstrong said .
"" In addition , the form asked the tester to state if there were any irregularities or further observations from the testing process and to that he wrote ' no ' . ""
It was Armstrong 's 24th test since he resumed his career after three - and - a - half years in retirement . ""
This is just another example of the improper behaviour by the French laboratory and the French anti - doping organisations , "" added Armstrong .
"" I am sorry that they are disappointed that all the tests were negative but I do not use any prohibited drugs or substances . """
2009-04-09,"The seven - times Tour de France champion Lance Armstrong could be punished by the French anti - doping agency AFLD for what it claims is a violation of its rules .
French doctors say they tested Armstrong 's hair , urine and blood in a test on 17 March .
They say they found no traces of drugs during these tests .
However , the agency said in a statement this morning that a doctor charged with testing Armstrong last month claimed the 37-year - old "" did not respect the obligation to remain under the direct and permanent observation "" of the tester .
An AFLD statement read : "" The AFLD is competent to impose disciplinary sanctions to people who do not hold a French licence but train on the national territory . ""
Any sanctions imposed would only be upheld in France , and could scupper Armstrong 's attempt to win the Tour de France for the eighth time .
Earlier this week Armstrong described any suggestion that he had misbehaved during the AFLD testing as "" outrageous "" , saying asked the tester to provide some identification before agreeing to the test .
"" I did not try to evade or delay the testing process that day , "" he said .
"" We told the tester we wanted to check with the UCI to confirm who he was and to make sure he was n't just some French guy with a backpack and some equipment to take my blood and urine . ""
Johan [ Bruyneel , Astana team manager ] stayed with him and in his presence called the UCI to find out what was going on .
We asked if it was OK for me to run inside and shower while they made their calls and the tester said that was fine . ""
The AFLD has not yet indicated whether it was Armstrong or the tester who is responsible for the break in protocol , and their president , Pierre Bordry , declined to comment , "" because we are entering into a contentious phase , or likely to be contentious . ""
Bordry suggested , however , that the agency has not yet decided whether to seek sanctions against Armstrong .
Asked if the agency is launching disciplinary proceedings , he said : "" Not yet .
We 'll see . """
2009-04-09,"Lance Armstrong 's hopes of competing in this summer 's Tour de France could be foiled by the French Anti - Doping Agency , which is considering taking action against the seven - times winner for failing to "" respect "" its rules during a recent out - of - competition test .
The AFLD said yesterday that when the Texan was visited at his rented house in southern France on 17 March , Armstrong "" did not respect the obligation to remain under the direct and permanent observation "" of the tester .
Doctors did not find any traces of drugs when they tested Armstrong 's hair , urine and blood in a test .
Pierre Bordry , president of the AFLD , said that the matter will be discussed at the next meeting of the agency 's nine - member ruling committee , when a decision will be taken on whether to sanction Armstrong .
Any anti - doping violation carries a punishment of up to a two - year suspension , which would only apply in France .
When contacted yesterday , the AFLD refused to discuss the case , or the range of punishments that could apply if it is decided that Armstrong has committed an offence .
Armstrong 's Astana team spokesman , Philippe Maertens , reacted angrily to the AFLD statement , saying that Armstrong has received no official notification from the French agency . ""
The only thing they are saying is that they might investigate , "" Maertens told the Guardian .
"" Lance has not been informed of anything , but as long as they do n't know themselves [ whether they will investigate ] it is difficult for us to react .
It 's a ridiculous story .
"" The case hinges on what precisely happened on 17 March .
According to Armstrong , he received permission to have a shower while his manager , Johan Bruyneel , checked whether the AFLD had jurisdiction to test him . ""
We told the tester we wanted to check with the UCI [ International Cycling Union ] to confirm who he was and to make sure he was n't just some French guy with a backpack and some equipment to take my blood and urine , "" said Armstrong earlier this week .
"" Johan stayed with him and in his presence called the UCI to find out what was going on .
We asked if it was OK for me to run inside and shower while they made their calls and the tester said it was fine . ""
Yesterday 's statement rebutted Armstrong 's version of events . ""
Mr Armstrong , despite being repeatedly warned by the examiner , did not meet the obligation to remain under direct and permanent observation . ""
According to World Anti - Doping Agency rules , it is the athlete 's responsibility to "" remain within direct observation of the DCO [ doping control officer ] at all times from the point of notification by the DCO until the completion of the sample collection procedure .
"" The rule exists to prevent an athlete substituting his own urine with somebody else 's .
Armstrong , recovering from a broken collarbone , is training in Colorado for the Giro d'Italia on 9 May.
Even if the AFLD does ban him from racing in France , his Giro bid will be unaffected , with the organisers of the Italian tour announcing heavy snow in the Alps had ruled out a planned excursion into France on 19 May.
Meanwhile , a long sprint earned Michael Albasini of Switzerland victory on stage four of the Tour of the Basque Country , ahead of Columbia - Highroad rider , the Belgian Jurgen van den Broeck ."
2009-04-10,"The head of world cycling has accused France 's anti - doping agency of unprofessional and "" disturbing "" behaviour after it released a report saying Lance Armstrong had not fully co - operated with a drug tester .
The French agency , AFLD , said it could punish the seven - time Tour de France champion for not remaining in sight of a doctor conducting a test on his hair , urine and blood on 17 March this year .
No banned substances were found and Armstrong has denied misbehaving , claiming that he was allowed to take a shower during a 20-minute delay .
While the tests fell outside the International Cycling Union 's jurisdiction , Armstrong has received the organisation 's backing .
"" The fact [ is ] the test was done and was a matter of fact reported by Lance Armstrong himself on Twitter , "" the UCI president , Pat McQuaid , told the BBC . ""
Then the French authorities decide to make up a report on the testing procedure [ and ] forward it to the UCI , knowing that the UCI have no jurisdiction this case and at the same time that report has leaked to the press . ""
So I would have to question why is that the case ?
I would have to say that the French are not acting very professionally in this case . ""
Armstrong has had tense relations with France 's anti - doping authorities for years , but is hoping to win an eighth Tour de France title in July , after coming out of retirement .
He responded to the AFLD statement by writing on his Twitter feed "" Was winning the Tour seven times that offensive ? ! ? "" and "" Just took a shower .
Got it down under 10 mins .
Whew . ""
McQuaid said proceedings between anti - doping agencies and the UCI are supposed to be kept confidential until "" a decision to open up the case has been taken "" . ""
Normal proceedings between institutions such as national anti - doping agencies , the international federation and Wada are normally done in a professional and confidential way until a decision or sanction has been taken , "" said McQuaid .
"" In this case it was leaked to the press and I do find that disturbing . ""
Armstrong was training in Beaulieu - sur - Mer in southern France when the test was conducted .
Armstrong said he had returned from a ride to find the tester at his house , identifying himself as a representative of a French lab ."
2009-04-11,"The seven - times Tour de France champion , Lance Armstrong , fears the French anti - doping agency AFLD could prevent him from riding in this year 's race .
"" There is a very high likelihood they will prohibit me from riding on the Tour , "" he said .
The AFLD said on Thursday Armstrong could face disciplinary action because he "" did not respect the obligation to stay under [ the ] direct and permanent observation "" of a drug tester who came to his residence in southern France last month .
Armstrong said he went to shower while the manager of his Astana team , Johan Bruyneel , checked the tester 's credentials with the International Cycling Union UCI . ""
He [ the tester ] was odd , he was alone .
He seemed suspicious , "" said Armstrong , who returned negative results after being asked to provide samples following a ride around Beaulieu - sur - Mer last month .
Any sanction imposed on Armstrong would be valid on French territory only but Armstrong would be disappointed to be barred from the principal event of the road cycling year .
"" It 's too bad .
The Tour is something I love dearly , something I wanted to ride , to race in , to be competitive in , either go for a victory or help Albert [ Contador ] or Levi [ Leipheimer ]
get a victory , "" he said .
"" We shall see .
The comeback has been important to me for two main reasons .
Obviously I have a passion for cycling still but more importantly
I have a passion for the global fight against cancer .
"" I wanted to tell that story in France but , if we ca n't do that , we ca n't do that .
It 's their call , it 's their country , their event , their rules , so we have to play by those . ""
Armstrong has had a difficult relationship with the Tour organisers ASO , who said last year the 37-year - old 's return would be "" embarrassing "" .
In 2005 L'Equipe , owned by ASO 's parent company , EPA , claimed samples of Armstrong 's urine from the 1999 race showed traces of the banned substance erythropoietin .
However , Armstrong was cleared by a Dutch investigator appointed by UCI ."
2009-04-15,"Thank heavens for a thrilling
Masters and the comedy goalkeeping of Petr Cech , otherwise we would have spent more time this week pondering the futility of life or , even more depressingly , the latest punch - up between Lance Armstrong and France .
Some people may have been fortunate enough to miss the news that the seven - time Tour de France winner may face expulsion from this year 's race over claims he breached anti - doping rules when he nipped off for a shower shortly after the man from the Agence FranÃ§aise de Lutte contre le Dopage ( AFLD ) arrived at his door with his sample cup .
As for those who follow this stuff with a trainspotter 's devotion and strong convictions â€ ” tread carefully .
Armstrong , we should point out at this early stage in the proceedings , has never failed a drug test and in this instance has denied the allegations .
He has also had a measure of support from Pat McQuaid , the head of world cycling , who accused the AFLD of leaking details of the cyclist 's alleged misbehaviour to L'Equipe . ""
The French are not acting very professionally in this case
, "" he said , apparently unaware that the French anti - doping agency and the French sporting press are like an old married couple ; they have no secrets from each other .
McQuaid has a point , although he might make a similar accusation about Armstrong whose reaction to the AFLD 's claims has at times been infantile , most notably when he joked on his Twitter feed about getting his shower times down and published a link to a blog â€ ”
"" Going With the Flow :
How to Evade the Drug Testers
"" â€ ” featuring something called the Whizzinator , a prosthetic penis filled with untainted pee .
Funny ha , ha .
Except this is a serious business â€
” serious for the cyclist and serious for cycling , so serious in fact that it begs the question ; why did Armstrong embark on this ill - starred comeback in the first place ?
The answer , apparently , is he wanted to promote his Livestrong foundation and its anti - cancer campaign .
Fair enough , but as it was pointed out when he announced his return last year , he was doing that extremely well while dressed in a suit .
"" It is undeniable an athlete in his prime or near his prime can have more of an impact than a retired athlete , "" replied Armstrong â€ ” a response to which it is impossible to find fault with other than to say it is either disingenuous or naive .
Since his return to racing in January , Armstrong has met with the Australian Prime Minister , Kevin Rudd , after which Rudd announced an additional Â£1.8 m in cancer research funding ( on top of the Â£95 m a year Australia already spends ) .
In August , he will cycle in the Tour of Ireland then appear at a "" cancer summit "" in Dublin .
At all points in between , his foundation will distribute millions of Livestrong fliers and sell even more of those ubiquitous yellow bracelets .
It is not to belittle these efforts to point out that admirable though they are , they are at the margins of battles being fought against cancer , both by governments in general and the Livestrong foundation in particular .
Frankly , it is hard to believe that Armstrong could n't have squeezed a few more quid out of the Australian government had he pitched up in Canberra wearing a suit .
Likewise in Ireland , Italy and anywhere else he intends to cycle this summer .
To argue otherwise would be naive .
Armstrong is not naive , in which case we are left with ego , as we usually are when champions retire , knock around the house a bit and then get bored with not being the centre of attention .
That 's how comebacks happen .
There is nothing inherently wrong with this except when a comeback threatens something more tangible than an athlete 's "" legacy "" .
Given his past relationship with the French authorities , Armstrong is probably relishing this latest fight â€
”
it certainly seems that way judging by his light - hearted postings online .
But what if the jocularity was misplaced ?
What if this latest episode was to end badly for him and he found himself barred from this summer 's Tour ?
What then for his reputation and , more to the point , what then for his chances of success when he eventually retires for good , puts on his suit and knocks on government doors looking for more cash to fight cancer ?
Golden boy a great for golden deeds out the ring
The retirement of the boxer Oscar De La Hoya , who held a world title in six different weight divisions , did not stop the traffic in Stirling or Stockwell or even in Los Angeles , where he made his announcement on Tuesday .
Boxing does n't matter as much as it used to , even when the great ones are involved and in the case of De la Hoya , there is an argument over whether he was even that great .
I think he was , although not because of anything he did in the ring .
He fought anyone who was anyone , and lost to most of them , which is nobody 's definition of greatest .
Where the golden boy did make his mark , however , was with Golden Boy Promotions , the company he set up in 2001 with the aim of diverting a greater share of the box office take away from the pockets of the huckster boxing promoters who had ruled for decades .
He succeeded , and no doubt enriched himself greatly in the process as Golden Boy became the most powerful outfit in the game .
But at least he ensured that a bit more money went into the pockets of those who had actually earned it , the boxers .
Gruesome twosome 's way back leaves a sour taste The mood music suggests there could be a way back for Barry Ferguson and Allan McGregor , banned from Scotland duty for life , and for two weeks by their club Rangers , after their all - night drinking session and other assorted offences , each more juvenile than the other .
Walter Smith is facing a tough title race against Celtic and has a small squad .
He needs the bodies , although given Rangers won all three games played while Ferguson and McGregor served their ban , it 's not at all certain either will get beyond the substitutes bench .
But while Rangers ' desire to allow the children back is understandable in the circumstances , the same can not be said about the SFA chief executive Gordon Smith 's obfuscation when asked to confirm the gruesome twosome were indeed gone for good .
"" At the moment , they will not be chosen , "" said Smith , who gets less impressive every time he opens his mouth .
In other words , Ferguson and McGregor will be up for selection again just as soon George Burley is no longer the manager of Scotland â€
” as disheartening for Burley as it is for those Scotland fans who think Ferguson and McGregor were only ever international class when it came to downing pints Cascarino 's only as good as his last column
What is there left to say about the 4 - 4 draw between Chelsea and Liverpool other than it was fantastic , enthralling , nerve - jangling and , contrary to what Tony Cascarino argued afterwards , it should not silence forever the complaint that footballers at the highest level make obscene amounts of money .

2009-04-16,"Lance Armstrong has told organisers that he will race in the Giro d'Italia , despite the seven - time Tour de France champion having surgery to fix his broken right collarbone last month .
The Gazzetta dello Sport said the American contacted organisers yesterday from Colorado , where is currently training .
The Giro runs from 9 - 31 May. "" The recovery has been going well and the plan is to be there , "" Armstrong 's spokesman Mark Higgins said .
It will mark the first time Armstrong races in the Italian classic , considered cycling 's second most important race after the Tour .
Armstrong returned to racing at the start of 2009 after three - and - a - half years of retirement .
He fell during the Vuelta of Castilla and León in Spain on 23 March and had surgery two days later .
A stainless steel plate and 12 screws were inserted into his shoulder to stabilise the broken collarbone .
Armstrong is also planning to enter the Tour in July , although he is worried French doping officials may ban him for allegedly violating protocols during a recent drug test .
The Giro was originally scheduled to pass through France briefly during the 10th stage , but organisers changed the route last week , citing problems with the high mountain roads and bad radio reception .
Celebrating the race 's 100th anniversary , Giro organisers have prepared a special route this year passing through most of Italy 's major cities .
The three - week race begins with a team time - trial along Venice 's beach front and concludes with an individual race against the clock in Rome ."
2009-04-17,"Lance Armstrong has told the organisers of the Giro d'Italia he will have recovered from a broken collarbone in time for May 's race .
"" I will be in Venice [ for the first stage on 9 May ] .
Trust me , "" the seven - times Tour de France winner wrote in an email .
The organisers told a news conference on Thursday that the 37-year - old American had reassured them about his participation after he suffered the injury in a race in Spain last month .
Armstrong , who returned to the sport in January after 3½ years in retirement , also used his Twitter feed to say he is making good progress .

He is also due to race in July 's Tour de France ."
2009-04-24,"Lance Armstrong will participate in the Tour de France after France 's anti - doping agency said it will not seek sanctions over a dispute with a drug tester .
The AFLD agency said in a statement that it "" decided to take into consideration the athlete 's written explanations "" and will not open disciplinary procedures .
The anti - doping agency had said the American cyclist did not fully cooperate with a drug tester who showed up at Armstrong 's home in France to collect blood , urine and hair samples on 17 March .
Armstrong had said he feared the agency would ban him from taking part in this year 's Tour , his first after a three - year absence .
The seven - time Tour de France champion announced that he was relieved following the AFLD 's decision .
"" Just got the word from the French agency AFLD on the shower gate incident , "" Armstrong wrote on social networking site Twitter . ""
Case closed , no penalty , all samples clean .
Onward . ""
At issue was a 20-minute delay when Armstrong said the tester agreed to let him shower while the American rider 's assistants checked the tester 's credentials .
A doctor submitted a report to the AFLD saying Armstrong had violated anti - doping rules .
Armstrong then sent a letter to the AFLD on 16 April explaining his position , AFLD chief Pierre Bordry said .
"" It was good that he sent me a letter .
I appreciated it and we took it into account , "" Bordry told the Associated Press .
Bordry said the decision by the AFLD 's leadership was unanimous .
He would not give details about the contents of Armstrong 's letter .
The AFLD said in its statement that the blood and urine tests were clean , but that it did not test the hair samples ."
2009-04-28,"Lance Armstrong will miss this week 's 23rd Tour of the Gila race in New Mexico because the International Cycling Federation plans to impose a rarely enforced rule that prohibits top - level professional teams from competing in national - level events such as the Gila event , according to the race director , Jack Brennan .
The decision means Armstrong , who had planned to enter , wo n't participate in the 29 April-3 May race in Silver City .
It would have been Armstrong 's first competition since he broke his collarbone last month . ""
Bummed to not be doing the Tour of the Gila in New Mexico , "" Armstrong wrote on his Twitter feed . ""
A great American race .
Raincheck ?
Please support this great event . ""
Brennan said he was bitter about the situation . ""
From the UCI all the way down , we 're all trying together to promote the sport of cycling , "" he said .
"" This does n't do it .
This leaves you with a real sour taste . ""
The UCI , cycling 's international governing body , has not yet commented on the decision .
Brennan said Armstrong , the seven - times Tour de France winner , had planned to enter the Tour of the Gila as part of his preparations for the Giro d'Italia , which starts on 9 May.
Andy Lee , spokesman for USA Cycling , said the national federation was aware of the UCI 's decision , while emphasising that USA Cycling was not the source of the rule nor the decision to enforce it . ""
On the contrary , we would love to see Lance compete in the Tour of the Gila , "" Lee said .
"" It would be great for cycling in the United States .
Unfortunately , it is a UCI rule that they are deciding to enforce at this time . ""
The UCI rule is not consistently enforced .
Levi Leipheimer , a team - mate of Armstrong on the Astana squad , raced this month at the Sea Otter Classic in northern California .
He is expected to compete in New Mexico .
Brennan said the New Mexico race will still include Floyd Landis , who is returning following a two - year ban after testing positive for synthetic testosterone in his forfeited 2006 Tour de France victory .
Landis rides for the California - based Ouch cycling team ."
2009-04-28,"Lance Armstrong is to compete in the Tour of the Gila in New Mexico after USA Cycling reached an agreement with the International Cycling Union ( UCI ) , which on Monday had informed the race organisers of a rule that bars top professional teams such as Astana from sending organised squads to national - level races .
The compromise allows up to three members of a pro team to race in the tour , which starts on Sunday , individually without a team car or team director .
It will be the seven - times Tour de France champion 's first race since breaking his collarbone in a crash last month and the race director , Jack Brennan , said that Armstrong and his Astana team - mates Levi Leipheimer and Chris Horner planned to race wearing jerseys representing Mellow Johnny 's , Armstrong 's bike store in Austin , Texas .
The BMC team that had entered an eight - man squad will also be allowed three members and must wear neutral jerseys .
Armstrong broke his collarbone during the Vuelta of Castilla and LeÃ³n in Spain on 23 March and had surgery two days later .
A stainless steel plate and 12 screws were inserted to stabilise it , and the American has been working towards the Giro d'Italia , beginning on 9 May.
Andy Lee , USA Cycling 's spokesman , said the agreement allowing the Astana team - mates to race in New Mexico was forged by his organisation 's chief operating officer , Sean Petty , and the UCI president , Pat McQuaid , in Europe , where they were attending UCI road meetings .
"" Sean had significant discussions with the UCI , "" Lee said .
"" Ultimately , USA Cycling and the UCI worked together to find a resolution . ""
"" I thought it was a lost cause , but Sean Petty went to bat for us , "" Brennan said .
The deal was hailed on the American side , where the most visible rider in the sport will lend some significant star power to the Tour of the Gila . ""
Any opportunity Lance has to race in the United States is a good thing , "" Lee said .
"" And for him to compete in the Tour of the Gila along with Levi and Chris , that 's good for racing in America . ""
Brennan said it was important to work out an agreement because other races elsewhere in the United States have had similar issues .
"" They are trying to resolve this issue now or work toward a resolution so other promoters are not caught in the same situation , "" Brennan said .
"" It would be good for the sport to work this thing out . """
2009-04-30,"Lance Armstrong still has work to do in his build - up to next week 's Giro d'Italia but yesterday declared that his decision to race in the Tour of the Gila was a move in the right direction .
After several weeks of training in the Colorado mountains , the climate has been more favourable in New Mexico , he said .
"" Similar elevations , but warmer and sunnier , "" Armstrong said yesterday .
"" It 's a good continuation because we 'll have a whole month at elevation before the Tour of Italy .
It works well . ""
The Astana team 's general manager Johan Bruyneel , who oversaw Armstrong 's seven Tour de France titles , said Armstrong 's conditioning would not put him in contention next week in Italy , "" but he can improve .
"" That is because Armstrong 's fitness is sure to increase during the Giro .
Right now , Bruyneel said , Armstrong is at the level he showed before breaking his collarbone last month during a crash in Spain . ""
No more crashes and just time , "" Bruyneel said when asked what Armstrong needs . ""
This week will be very good training to get the intensity that he 's lacking .
He needs to get some speed in the legs for the start of the Giro . ""
Armstrong got plenty of speed during the finish of yesterday 's second stage of the five - day Tour of the Gila .
The 80-mile ( 129 km ) stage ended in a mass sprint , won by the Colavita team racer Lucas Sebastian Haedo of Argentina .
Armstrong crossed with the large pack , along with team - mates Levi Leipheimer and Chris Horner .
The Astana riders are entered independently this week , wearing the kits of Armstrong 's Mellow Johnny 's bike shop .
"" It was another hard day , "" Horner said .
"" Lance and I rode the front for 80 km ( 54 miles ) . "" Besides another tough workout , Armstrong was pulled into doping control .
"" Been a while .
Thought they forgot about me , "" he reported on his Twitter feed .
The course featured a dangerous descent at the 27-mile mark , followed by rolling hills and a climb over the 2,000 m summit of the Continental Divide , then a sharp rise back to the Silver City area .
There were a few breakaways over the final 12 miles including one with OUCH team cyclist and former Tour de France winner Floyd Landis , but the peloton had no trouble catching up .
"" Everybody was there at the end , "" Horner said .
Bruyneel said this kind of racing bodes well for Armstrong , provided he can get through the next three days without incident .
The Mellow Johnny 's team is not in New Mexico to win , just to get into race shape , and Leipheimer 's victory in the opening stage was a bonus .
As for Armstrong , Bruyneel said the focus was on his form .
"" It 's difficult to evaluate among a peloton which is n't up to the level of European races , but he did a lot of work yesterday , "" Bruyneel said .
Asked what he expects for himself in Italy , Armstrong hedged .
He said the main favourite will be the Italian Ivan Basso , then made an argument for Leipheimer , who remained the Gila 's overall race leader . ""
He 's had a great year , "" Armstrong said .
"" He 's riding well and he 's motivated .
He does n't race like the Italians do , but he 's close .
My responsibility will be to ride strong and to help him . """

2009-05-04,"The seven - times Tour de France champion Lance Armstrong has again hinted he is close to building his own team and extending his career into 2010 , revealing the chances of it happening are "" high "" .
The 37-year - old , who survived testicular cancer before his unprecedented run of victories in the world 's most famous race , returned to the sport this year after a self - imposed three - year exile to promote his Livestrong campaign and raise funds for research into the illness .
The Astana rider , who is set to ride in the Giro d'Italia which begins on Saturday , suggested in an interview with Gazzetta dello Sport that all will be revealed this summer .
"" I 'd like to have my own team , "" the American said .
"" I want to be the owner , directeur sportif and ... rider .
If I do own a team I want to ride as well .
Maybe not the Giro and the Tour but just when I want to . ""
Armstrong would not reveal the full details , such as the name of the leading sponsor , but added : "" The chances of it happening ?
High .
You 'll know more in July – even if it 's difficult to convince sponsors to give you money because of the economic crisis and the news about doping . """
2009-05-06,"Lance Armstrong 's Astana team is on the brink of collapse on the eve of the American 's comeback to a major tour .
With the Giro d'Italia due to start in Venice on Saturday , it has been reported that his team , backed by a consortium of Kazakh companies , has a week to find $ 2 m or the International Cycling Union could withdraw its licence to race .
That is unlikely to happen mid - Giro , though there is every chance that the team will cease to exist before July 's Tour de France .
As well as Armstrong , it affects the 2007 winner and this year 's favourite , Alberto Contador .
However , the seven - time Tour winner Armstrong may bring forward plans , which he revealed on Monday , to launch his own team which could incorporate Astana .
He would look to do that with Johan Bruyneel , the manager at Astana , whose riders and staff have been going without pay .
Armstrong is riding for no salary . ""
Maybe the situation gets resolved and the guys start getting their dough , otherwise I think the licence ought to be transferred to Johan and we try and start a team in the middle of the season , "" Armstrong said .
Asked whether he would be part - owner of any new team , Armstrong replied : "" I would think so . ""
Armstrong had said that he wanted to be "" owner , director and rider "" in his own team , which he planned to launch in 2010 .
But the prospect of his current team collapsing â€ “ and denying him a ride in the Tour â€
“ could prompt this stop - gap solution .
That could be with the help of one of Armstrong 's existing sponsors , possibly the American cycle manufacturer Trek .
Given Astana 's financial problems , it is ironic that Armstrong is riding for no salary , but it is also thought that the backers of the team , established to promote Kazakhstan on the world stage , have become frustrated by their diminishing influence .
Only one Kazakh rider , Andrey Zeits , is in Astana 's nine - man team for the Giro .
Another irony is that Astana came into existence in similar circumstances , when the previous sponsor , Liberty Seguros , withdrew on the eve of the 2006 Tour .
Astana was set up to be the vehicle for Kazakhstan 's Alexander Vinokourov to win the Tour de France , though this project ended ignominiously when Vinokourov tested positive for blood doping during the 2007 Tour .
In a twist to the story , it was reported yesterday that Vinokourov is planning to make a comeback in late August at the Tour of Spain .
He added that he understood that his former team may "" soon cease to exist [ and ] will be sold to foreign investors .
"" The smart money is on the principal investor being Armstrong ."
2009-05-06,"Lance Armstrong 's Astana team is in the midst of a financial crisis on the eve of the American 's first Giro d'Italia .
Astana spokesman Philippe Maertens confirmed reports from Kazakhstan that the team has failed to pay its riders .
"" There are some financial problems , "" Maertens said , but also stated the team will still start the Giro on Saturday in Venice . ""
Of course .
Why not ?
I do n't see any problem .
The team is not going to default .
There is only a delay of payment . ""
Astana receives most of its financial support from Kazakh state holding company Samruk - Kazyna , but the Central Asian nation 's economy has been badly hit by the ongoing global financial crisis .
The possibility of Astana folding would be a blow to the Kazakh government , which uses the team to raise the country 's sporting profile .
While Samruk - Kazyna has pledged to continue its support for Astana , which is named after the Kazakh capital city , state carrier Air Astana has stopped sponsoring the team .
One team member unaffected by the wage delays is seven - time Tour de France winner Armstrong , who agreed in September to ride for free for the first year of his comeback to professional cycling .
Armstrong is planning to support Astana team - mate Levi Leipheimer in his bid to win the Giro .
Pro Tour teams such as Astana must meet certain financial parameters to stay active , or risk losing their International Cycling Union ( UCI ) licence .
"" I 'm only going to say we 're aware of the situation and we are in contact with the team and the federation , "" UCI president Pat McQuaid said .
"" We 're going to wait to see how this develops . ""
McQuaid left open the possibility that the team could be expelled from the Giro if the problems worsen . ""
Obviously if the team folds in the middle of the year certain things need to happen . """
2009-05-08,"Lance Armstrong said that he has already been approached by sponsors keen to back his Astana team should the squad fold following the Giro d'Italia , which gets underway in Venice on Saturday .
On the eve of his first major tour in more than three years , the seven - time Tour de France winner also said that his fitness was "" better than I expected "" , following the broken collarbone he sustained in a crash in March , though he added that "" I do n't expect to win . ""
It emerged on Wednesday that Astana , which is backed by a consortium of Kazakhstan businesses , is up to $ 2 m ( Â£1.3 m ) in debt and facing further financial problems , which could prompt the International Cycling Union ( UCI ) to revoke its licence following the Giro .
Armstrong , who is racing for no salary , said that , if the team does collapse , he would attempt to take over as "" owner , director and rider "" , possibly before his return to the Tour de France in July .
Yesterday , he confirmed that there has already been "" high interest "" from potential backers . ""
Considering the economy and considering global sports sponsorships , it 's a tough climate , "" said the American .
"" You 're not going to find one in a week and say , ' By the way , we need 10 million bucks , please come on [ board ] .
They do n't jump that quick . ""
In Kazakhstan it has been reported that the team owners are in talks with the country 's prime minister to find a solution , though sources said that up to $ 5 m has already been committed to the team this year .
Armstrong , though , suggested that the team 's employees have gone without pay for up to two months ."
2009-05-08,"Nine months after their Olympic partnership ended in bitterness and recrimination , Mark Cavendish and his Columbia team will lock horns on Saturday with Bradley ­Wiggins and his Garmin team , nine months after their Olympic partnership ended in bitterness and recrimination , as the centenary Giro d'Italia begins in Venice .
Cavendish and Wiggins are among a record nine British riders starting the three - week Italian tour , but the ­opening stage , a 20.5 km team time trial , plays to the strengths of their teams , along with those of the Lance Armstrong - led Astana squad , and the Liquigas team of the overall favourite , Ivan Basso .
It is Cavendish and Wiggins who supply a fascinating sub - plot in their first serious head - to - head since the Olympics .
Their efforts to win the madison in Beijing were compromised , claimed Cavendish at the time , by Wiggins 's failure to prepare as seriously for the two - man event as he did for the pursuit and team pursuit , in which he won gold medals .
Despite having settled their differences and restored their friendship , apparently through text messages , Wiggins could not resist fanning the flames of his rivalry with Cavendish , and his old team Columbia , saying : "" As long as we beat Columbia we 'll be all right , "" before adding : "" I think we can win . ""
Cavendish seemed just as eager to stoke the coals , with the 23-year - old not ­mentioning Wiggins , but describing comments made by Garmin 's director , Jonathan Vaughters , as "" disrespectful "" .
"" They 've made no bones about it – [ Garmin have ] said their season starts here , "" Cavendish said .
"" It 's May.
Their sponsor 's paid money for the first five months of the year , and I think that 's highly disrespectful to [ the sponsor ] .
Their season starts tomorrow and I think it 's going to end tomorrow night .
They 've got the team time trial , and what else ?
"" The implication being that Cavendish has a lot more – starting , perhaps , with tomorrow 's 156 km stage from Jesolo to ­Trieste , a relatively flat road stage that should end with the kind of fast bunch sprint that Cavendish dominates .
­Cavendish insisted that his team , in ­contrast to Garmin , have done no special preparation for the team time trial , though he did admit that the discipline is "" a lot more technical than you imagine .
You need to learn how to ride it .
It 's not about getting nine riders from A to B , it 's about getting the team riding together – and that 's how you 'll get the best out of it . ""
Cavendish enters the Giro relatively fresh , having taken a break after his spring campaign – which peaked with his victory at the Milan - San Remo classic in March – before returning to racing last week at the Tour de Romandie , in which he did not appear to extend himself .
His plan in Italy is to ride two - thirds of the race before withdrawing to prepare for the Tour de France , ideally having added to the two stage wins claimed in last year 's Giro .
He arrived at the Tour tired last year and he would rather abandon the Giro before the end and arrive in Monaco in good physical shape to compete for the green jersey .
"" I feel pretty fresh just now , "" said Cavendish .
""
Last year I made the mistake of doing too much .
I did n't want to make that mistake this year . ""
Of the other British riders , Chris Froome – reportedly a target for the new Sky - sponsored British professional team – could climb into a high overall position , and Ben Swift could figure in the flat stages , as he has done already in his debut professional season .
Jeremy Hunt , Ian Stannard , Charly Wegelius and Daniel Lloyd – only called up this week by his Cervélo team for his first grand tour – also start the centenary Giro , with the ninth Briton , David Millar , making his comeback from a broken collarbone as a key member of Wiggins 's Garmin team .."
2009-05-11,"Lance Armstrong 's Astana team has been given a deadline of 31 May to straighten out its financial crisis or risk being suspended .
The Astana team manager Johan Bruyneel said that the International Cycling Union sent a warning letter to Kazakhstan 's cycling federation .
"" That 's the deadline to arrange the whole financial situation .
If it 's not taken care of by then , the letter says that the team will be suspended , "" Bruyneel said .
"" At least we 're going to be able to finish the Giro . ""
The Giro d'Italia , which Armstrong is racing for the first time , ends on 31 May.
Astana receives most of its financial support from the Kazakh state holding company Samruk - Kazyna , but the central Asian nation 's economy has been badly hit by the global financial crisis and the team 's employees have not been paid lately .
The UCI president Pat McQuaid was expected to visit Kazakhstan this week .
Armstrong indicated last week that he was talking to US - based sponsors about taking over the team himself .
That may be his only solution if he wants to go for an eighth Tour de France title in July .
"" I 've already said that all I know about Kazakhstan is Astana and Borat .
I do n't know anything more , "" Armstrong said when last asked about the issue .
"" It 's not my team , it 's not my sponsor .
I 've got nothing to say about it .
I would love to give you an answer
but I do n't have one .
I would be speculating .
"" It 's difficult to go to any major corporation and say in the middle of the calendar year â€ “ the fiscal year â€ “ and say ' How about we start in 20 or 30 days ? '
But we 'll see . """
2009-05-12,"The favourites for this year 's Giro d'Italia emerged at the head of the race on today 's first mountain stage , but Lance Armstrong was not among them .
At the hilltop finish in San Martino di Castrozza , the 2007 Giro winner Danilo Di Luca led in a 17-strong lead group while Armstrong lost contact in the final kilometre , finishing 32nd .
Thomas Lovkvist of Sweden took over the race leader 's pink jersey .
Armstrong , riding his first major stage race since the 2005 Tour de France and returning after a broken collarbone , admitted before this centenary Giro he was not in condition to win .
But since he has won every major tour he has ridden since the 1998 Tour of Spain – in which he placed fourth – there remained great interest in how he would perform in the Dolomites , the first real battleground of the Giro .
It was telling , as the climb steepened and favourites such as Di Luca , Ivan Basso and Armstrong 's team - mate Levi Leip­heimer moved up , that Armstrong , with the TV cameras lingering longer on him than on any other rider , slid back .
The 15sec the 37-year - old conceded were immaterial , it was his raggedness and obvious discomfort that provided the evidence he is not the rider that dominated for seven years .
Perhaps the best gauge of Armstrong 's form was that Britain 's Bradley Wiggins , hardly known for his climbing ability , crossed the line just three places behind him .
Mark Cavendish , who held the pink jersey until Monday , finished safely in the 75-man grupetto ( the last group ) almost 20 minutes down on Di Luca , with his fellow Britons Dan Lloyd , Ben Swift , David Millar and Jeremy Hunt .
Another British rider , Ian Stannard , was one of the early aggressors , featuring in a six - man break , the remnants of which were reeled in on the final climb .
Charly Wegelius and Chris Froome both finished just behind Wiggins .
Armstrong was quick to "" twitter "" that his performance was "" not bad "" considering .
"" Legs were n't bad , "" he wrote . ""
[ I ] came off a little at the top [ but ] not bad for first big climb in first grand tour back and for coming back after the crash .
Overall , I 'm pleased .
Tomorrow – tough ! ""
Tomorrow 's fifth stage finishes with a 25 km climb to Alpe di Siusi , which should provide a more serious sort - out .
Armstrong described his Astana team 's performance as "" amazing "" but he could be distracted by the Kazakhstan - backed squad 's mounting problems .
The International Cycling Union has given the team a 31 May deadline to resolve its financial difficulties .
Since that is the day the Giro finishes , there is no threat to Armstrong 's continued participation , but it seems increasingly likely he will need to find a new sponsor before the 4 July start of the Tour de France ."
2009-05-15,"Lance Armstrong and his team - mates in the Astana squad will ride the seventh stage of the Giro d'Italia today with sponsors names on their jerseys faded out in protest against the Kazakhstan team 's lack of salary payments .
Eight of the nine Astana riders committed to the protest , with only the Kazakh rider , Andrey Zeits , riding with a standard jersey .
Astana receives financial support from the Kazakh company Samruk - Kazyna , but the nation 's economy has been badly hit by the global financial crisis .
The team has not paid its employees lately and the UCI has threatened to withdraw the team 's ProTour licence if the situation is not rectified by the end of this month .
"" I explained the situation of the team to the federation of Kazkhstan before the Giro and I asked certain questions and asked for certain solutions .
And those solutions did n't come , "" the Astana team manager Johan Bruyneel said .
"" We 're an important factor in the race and we do n't want to pretend as if everything is OK .
It 's not OK .
"" I 've talked about it with the riders since the beginning of the Giro and they are not happy .
I 'm trying to keep them motivated in the race , but at the same time if you 're doing your job you want to be respected .
This
[ the protest ] is a decision we made together .
I did n't force anyone to wear this jersey . ""
Bruyneel refused to rule out the possibility of he and Armstrong taking over the team .
"" We 're definitely looking into all our options , "" he said ."
2009-05-18,"Yesterday brought a ceasefire to racing at the Giro d'Italia but the rest day witnessed a continuation of hostilities in the wake of Sunday 's disrupted stage , with the Italian press rounding on the rider they consider the villain of the piece : Lance Armstrong .
Following the go - slow that marred Â­Sunday 's showpiece stage in Milan , which at one point saw the entire peloton stop to explain to spectators that they were refusing to race because of the "" danger "" of the circuit , the Italian media , Giro organisers and ex - riders appeared united in condemnation of their actions , with most parties rounding on Armstrong in particular .
Armstrong , who is rumoured to be receiving Â£2 m to ride the Giro , seemed to be the focus of Angelo Zomegnan , the Giro director , who revealed that the American , making his comeback to a major tour , had "" sent me emails saying that the riders were having to take too many risks .
[ Armstrong ] was instrumental in this protest .
He came looking for me during [ Sunday 's ] race
â€ “
there 's a certain age at which your legs start to get shorter and your tongue longer .
"" It marks a dramatic souring of the relationship between Armstrong and Italy , which the seven - times Tour de France winner had seemed at pains to contrast with his difficult relationship with France .
Before the race , which he is contesting for the first time after three and a half years out of the sport , he described the Giro as "" mythical "" .
Since then , a series of critical posts on Armstrong 's Twitter site , mainly concerned with the danger of the stage finishes , have irritated his hosts , but what appears to have particularly offended Italian sensibilities is the fact that the protest was held on the most symbolic of stages , commemorating the 100-year anniversary of the Giro in the city in which it started .
Il Giornale described it as "" a slap in the face for Milan "" .
The riders , it continued , had been responsible for a "" villainous ambush "" and "" should go into hiding after the obscenity "" .
The newspaper then launched an extraordinary attack on Armstrong , describing as "" an old - age pensioner â€ “ the Texan slipper - seller , who 's clearly come to Italy for a holiday , has been sowing seeds for days .
He fires up younger colleagues , writes provocative messages on his website , sends threatening messages to race organiser Zomegnan .
He does n't like the finishes , he does n't like the descents , now he does n't even like the flat parts .
It 's now clear to everyone that the decision to invite him to the Giro has become a terrible boomerang . "" .
Armstrong sought to defuse the row in a video message posted yesterday .
"" It 's an unfortunate situation , an accumulation of days and days of frustration
and I think fear on a lot of people 's parts and then this war of words and this war of power afterwards that we have to avoid , "" he said .
"" Ithink the real point here , and I think the point that we as riders would like to get across is that we 're sorry about that .
It was n't an ideal outcome .
"" We did n't feel the conditions were safe . ""
The Texan listed a number of problems ranging from parked cars to tram tracks , traffic islands and even oncoming traffic .
Gazzetta dello Sport was less personal in its criticism , though no less scathing , claiming that fans of the sport had their "" rights violated "" by the riders ' actions .
"" The Milan circuit was n't a dangerous race , "" it stated .
"" The riders have rights too , and they 're sacrosanct , but you ca n't rip the soul out of cycling . ""
Armstrong 's spokesman added : "" He 's not too happy about the criticism in the Italian media because he did n't instigate [ the protest ] ; it was all the big riders of the peloton who took the decision . ""
The American also received support from his fellow riders .
Danilo Di Luca , the race leader , said : "" We saw the course and decided that it was n't suitable , "" while Michael Rogers of Australia , who is third overall , said : "" This was a group decision and a message to race organisers in general .
They need to guarantee our safety . ""
The Giro resumes today with arguably the toughest stage of this year 's race , a 262 km slog through the Alps from Cuneo to Pinerolo ."
2009-05-19,"Danilo Di Luca tightened his grip on the pink leader 's jersey in the Giro d'Italia by winning the race 's toughest stage , from Cuneo to Pinerolo , over 262 km and three Alpine passes .
A 10th stage rich in Giro history , with the course originally designed to mirror the "" queen stage "" dominated by Fausto Coppi exactly 60 years ago , saw epic racing in place of the protests that marred Sunday 's disrupted stage in Milan .
It also witnessed the first sign that the American rider Lance Armstrong might be returning to something approaching his old form .

â€ “ when the Â­peloton staged a go - slow in protest at the danger of the circuit following Pedro Horrillo Munoz 's horrific crash on stage eight â€ “ finished a solid 13th place .
On a stage that included the climb to Sestriere , where Armstrong won en route to his first Tour victory in 1999 , the Â­American 's performance represented a dramatic improvement on his form of last week , when he struggled through the Dolomites .
On yesterday 's rest day he claimed "" the real Giro "" would begin with today 's stage , and he proceeded to give an indication that he could still be a force in Italy and , even more likely , at the Tour de France in July . ""
The tifosi [ fans ] were great today , "" said Armstrong after the stage .
"" Thank you all for the support .
The peloton appreciates it .
"" Most likely he was relieved that the roadside reaction did not reflect the Â­opinions expressed in the Italian press , with Il Giornale describing him as "" an old - age pensioner who 's clearly come to Italy for a holiday "" .
The stage was dominated by an escape that included Stefano Garzelli , the 2000 Giro winner , who then went clear on his own before being captured in the closing miles .
Eventually it was another former winner , the 2007 champion Di Luca , who stamped his authority on this year 's race .
The LPR Brakes team rider attacked on the final climb , 3 km from the finish , to win alone and claim a few more seconds ' advantage on his rivals .
The race suffered a tragedy before the start , when Fabio Saccani , a motorcycle pilot working on his 32nd Giro , died in a collision with a lorry .
The 69-year - old was a survivor of testicular cancer whose helmet had been signed by Armstrong , a fellow survivor , when they met at the start in Venice .
There will be a minute 's silence before tomorrow 's stage ."
2009-06-22,"Lance Armstrong has recorded the first victory of his comeback , winning the Nevada City Classic in his final race before his return to the Tour de France .
The seven - times Tour winner won alone after attacking his two breakaway companions with six laps remaining of the 40-lap race , 1,870 days after his last professional victory .
Ben Jacques - Maynes was second , with Armstrong 's Astana team - mate Levi Leipheimer third .
Britain 's top female cyclists are also celebrating after recording major wins over the weekend .
The Olympic and world road - race champion , Nicole Cooke , claimed Italy 's Giro di Trentino , while the Olympic time - trial silver medallist , Emma Pooley , won the biggest stage race of her career , taking the Grande Boucle Féminine – effectively the women 's version of the Tour de France but run over just four days .
Pooley won two of the four stages to claim overall victory by 22 seconds ahead of Christiane Soeder of Austria ."

A fortnight into the three - week event , we are starting to realise that the only hill the 37-year - old is over is the Col du Tourmalet in the Pyrenees .
The fact that he is still in contention is mind - blowing enough and he has already proved that , despite the evidence of Michael Jordan , Bjorn Borg and Muhammad Ali , it is possible for a sporting colossus to make a dignified comeback .
He is even talking about competing in the Tour de France next year .
The sceptics might be less surprised to witness Armstrong 's renaissance if they had read John Wilcockson 's new biography .
The book 's breathless subtitle - "" The World 's Greatest Champion "" ( no question mark , no "" probably "" ) - reveals straight away that this is not going to be an excoriation of the most divisive man in sport .
But then , there already exist plenty of accounts that set out to discredit Armstrong as a drug - addled cheat , although these have rarely found publishers outside France , a country that has as relaxed an approach to defamation as it does to dog poo in the streets .
In the US , this book is titled Lance :
The Making of the World 's Greatest Champion , which is more accurate , as Wilcockson 's main intent is to put forward the non - pharmacological explanations for the American 's record - obliterating achievements .
Armstrong admirers might wonder what scraps of personal history are left after his own inspirational , bestselling autobiographies It 's Not About the Bike ( 2000 ) and Every Second Counts ( 2003 ) .
Wilcockson , an experienced journalist and editor on cycling magazines , who is currently following his 41st Tour de France , concentrates on the years leading up to Armstrong 's diagnosis with testicular cancer at the age of 25 , before he achieved his most formidable performances on the road .
The book is not authorised as such , but author and subject spoke several times during its creation and the cyclist bestowed "" the opportunity to talk with people who otherwise might have been hesitant to speak openly about him "" .
More than 60 friends and family have been interviewed , including some , notably his stepfather Terry , with whom Armstrong has not spoken since his teens .
This idea of permission is revealing - Armstrong is famed for his mental Rolodex of enemies , a record of anyone who has , to his mind , betrayed his trust .
The defining moment in his professional career came in 2001 when he gave his great stooge , Jan Ullrich , what is universally known as "" the Look "" , his cool blue eyes boring through the soul of the long - suffering German before he sprinted decisively up the side of an alp .
( For the record , Armstrong denies here that there is anything to the Look ; he was simply scanning the road for a team - mate .
And if you believe that ... )
Certainly , there is a danger that Wilcockson will not submit his subject to the harshest scrutiny .
The polarising effect of Armstrong 's desire to not just win but crush his rivals is alluded to but no more .
The book coyly describes a "" conversation "" that Armstrong had with a young French rider called Christophe Bassons in 1999 .
Bassons , nicknamed "" Monsieur Propre "" or "" Mr Clean "" , for his anti - doping stance , was competing in his first Tour and cast doubt on Armstrong 's performance in his daily column for Le Parisien ; the next day , they had their discussion and shortly afterwards Bassons pulled out of the race , never to be seen at the top level again .
There is no question of impropriety on Armstrong 's part , but it is a brave person who goes to war with him .
Wilcockson would contend , however , that it is this belligerence and indomitable force of will that are responsible for his enduring success .
In one of his earliest races , the 1989 world junior cycling championships , Armstrong was the strongest rider in the field but he lost because , in the words of the US team physician , "" he was n't mad at anybody "" .
This is a mistake that he has seldom repeated since .
Whether it is doctors saying that he will never fully recover from cancer or journalists decreeing that he is too old to win the Tour at 37 , he is fuelled and inspired by the desire to prove people wrong .
And that is why , if you were Alberto Contador , Armstrong 's main rival in this year 's race , and inconveniently his team - mate , you would be very , very scared .

2009-07-20,"These are the days where the sporting gods are cruel .
They dare to spin dreams and then crush them .
First Tom Watson at Turnberry , and Lance Armstrong in the Alps , and now Australia at the English citadel they have made impregnable for the past three - quarters of a century .
Australia , who even with innermost turmoils , never ever display anything but the utter conviction of their right to dominate , arrived here today believing they could overturn a century and more of Test history and with an unfeasible run chase to win a match that was unwinnable .
One hundred and five minutes later they were all out for 406 , England triumphant by 115 runs , and the dream lay in tatters , blown away by a raging bull called Flintoff , in his Lord 's Test match swansong , and an upstart Swann having the time of his life .
Andrew Flintoff rampaged in from the Pavilion end unchanged and unbowed since he took the new ball six overs before the close of play on Sunday .
The three wickets he took today , beginning with that of Brad Haddin with his fourth ball and without addition to the score , and ending when he uprooted the stumps of Peter Siddle , gave him morning figures of 10 - 1 - 43 - 3 and five for 92 in all , the third five - wicket haul of his Test career and his first since The Oval against this same opposition four years ago .
If he milked each wicket for all it was worth , hamming it up for the crowd , posturing and posing , then this was glorious teeth - jarring fast bowling , not a thing of beauty but driven by brute force and personality .
At one time , Andrew Strauss , sensing his steam running out , and wishing to protect him from himself , tried to suggest he might hand over to another .
The captain was forced to hold his hands up in reluctant acceptance of the inevitable : he might as well have tried to stop the tide .
Those who know Flintoff understand that the announcement of his retirement from Tests at the end of this series would impel him to greater things and , through him , perhaps the team .
It has proved thus .
He has earned a place on both bowling and batting honours boards , a double given to very few .
It was Graeme Swann , though , who cleared the passage to the win and then administered the coup de grâce .
For more than five hours Michael Clarke had batted sublimely , and now he had the chance to complete one of the finest match - winning innings in history .
Jimmy Anderson 's urgent opening burst had been repelled , and now Strauss turned not to another seamer but to Swann , whose Ashes debut jitters in Cardiff had held him back .
Clarke had played him beautifully , twinkling feet and deft angles .
This time he danced down to the second ball which drifted away from him at the last moment , eluded the outside edge before spinning back to hit off - stump .
The off - spinner kept his nerve at the end , too , when Mitchell Johnson , a bowler in tatters but dangerous batsman with a Test hundred in South Africa and now 63 good runs to his name , had licence to throw the bat in one last effort .
Swann fired one in flatter , through the arc of the swing and took out middle .
Four for 87 was his reward and proof that off - spin should not just be bowled dogmatically from the Pavilion end : if it spins it will turn up the slope sufficient enough while the same slope will help an armball .
If England leave here with some concerns , and will certainly consider a change for the third Test at Edgbaston in days time – probably in the form of Steve Harmison for Graham Onions
– then it is Australia who are in disarray .
Their batting is sound , although the manner in which Phillip Hughes has been hounded and harried makes the lack of a third opener in the touring party a concern , sound enough indeed to make 674 for five in Cardiff and 406 in the fourth innings here .
The bowling , though , is a disaster , with Johnson 's timing , an essential ingredient in an unorthodox method , totally out of kilter and his confidence in the basement , while Siddle has huffed and puffed but blown down only Swann 's Cardiff house .
They have few places to which to turn with Brett Lee unlikely to play in the game against Northamptonshire that starts on Friday and therefore too high a risk for Edgbaston , and the need to retain Johnson if the lower order is not to be weakened , but to have the option of a fourth seamer should his woes continue .
The performance of the all - rounder Shane Watson will be intriguing for he might be pencilled in to replace Marcus North at six and bring a further bowling option .
Hindsight for England says that Harmison would have been a decent pick for this match , his pace and bounce a better option than Onions , who could not quite find the consistency of line and length that can create pressure and bring wickets .
He can not be expected to blast out batsmen .
Edgbaston may not offer steepling bounce but no Australian batsman will relish the prospect of Harmison at the top of his game .
Meanwhile , there is the chance now to rest and recuperate :
Flintoff his knee , the toss up being whether it is his knee or his gin and tonic which receives the most ice ; Kevin Pietersen his achilles tendons that so restricted him in this match ; Onions his sore elbow that kept him from the field on the fourth evening .
And for Ravi Bopara to reflect that style is no substitute for substance .
He has much to learn if No3 is to be his position ."
2009-07-24,"With echoes of the Terminator , Lance Armstrong said after finishing a frustrated third atop Mont Ventoux in the 2002 Tour : "" We 'll come back , I 'm sure .
"" Seven years later , Armstrong , a man who thrives on personal battles , has a score to settle with the peak which will decide whether he stands on the podium tomorrow .
He has never won there , in any race .
The tale of frustration began in 2000 , when he and Marco Pantani approached the top to contest the stage win , back in the days when the American 's dominance of the Tour was only just beginning .
Pantani was clinging on , a pale , tormented shadow of the ( EPO - fuelled ) climber who had won the 1998 Tour .
Repeatedly he lost contact with Armstrong 's wheel , repeatedly he clawed his way back .
Finally , the Texan appeared to let him reach the summit first .
He later said he regretted the gesture , because he never managed to get to grips with the "" Bald Mountain "" .
He suffered there in the Dauphiné Libéré race – which goes up almost every year – and lost again in the Tour in 2002 , when he gave Richard Virenque a seven minute start at the foot of the mountain , in what seemed like a handicap race .
So it is personal today for Armstrong , but that is the way it has been with the Tourmen and the Ventoux since it appeared on the route in 1951 .
As Roland Barthes wrote , no other ascent seems to have a personality . ""
A god of evil , a despot of cyclists , "" he called it .
Barthes 's point was this : most of the Tour 's great ascents are passes , between two mountains .
The Ventoux is unique because the cyclists have to go up a whole mountain , 5,000 feet from its vineyards at its base at Bédoin to its wind - blasted summit with the famous observatory .
There is nothing else higher for many miles around .
Ventoux stands alone , visible from 65 miles away .
If the weather is clear , at some point today the Tourmen will come up a rise after leaving Montélimar , and they will see it , even if it is several hours of pedalling away .
That plays on the mind , as does the steepness of the road , particularly the early kilometres , which go straight up the side of the mountain through a rock cutting and between stunted oak trees , without a single hairpin to give even a few seconds ' respite .
It is also a relatively rare feature in the route : this is the 14th visit since 1951 .
The mountain has its own microclimate : stifling heat one day – on his first time up there , Tom Simpson said he sweated so much his shorts nearly fell down – freezing cold the next .
The conditions are intensified on the bare scree slopes at the top , where there is no shade on a sunny day and no shelter from the wind , only the vast view of Provence far far beneath the "" sloping desert , the Sahara of stones "" , as the late organiser Jacques Goddet called it .
Unlike any other climb on the Tour , the Ventoux has an evil reputation .
Before the road was built to the top , Ventoux was fabled for wolves , and flash floods that wiped out herds of sheep , and its caves were said to lead to hell .
Soon after the Tour 's first visit in 1951 , Antoine Blondin wrote of the extreme effort it demanded of the cyclists : "" We have seen riders descend into madness due to heat and stimulants , some going down the hairpins when they think they are going up .
There are few happy memories attached to this witches ' cauldron , climbed with a heavy heart .
"" It was this way even before the death of Simpson , in 1967 , due to a cocktail of intense heat , amphetamines , alcohol and his indomitable willpower .
Now , however , the two legends , mountain and man , are inextricably tied .
Simpson 's monument stands near the summit , the goal for the many amateur cyclists who take on the climb , but , as I wrote in Put Me Back on My Bike , he has appropriated the whole mountain as a memorial visible from 65 miles away : you look at the mountain and think of the man .
But the 1965 world champion is not the only life claimed by the Giant of Provence .
There was a host of crosses on the slopes to pilgrims who failed to make it to the chapel just below the summit .
More recently , a cycling fan was struck by lightning on the day the 1994 race went over , soldiers from the observatory were frozen to death in blizzards , at least one driver died in the motor races that use the mountain , while most surreal of all , a woman tourist was killed in the 1970s by stones picked up by a particularly vicious wind on the summit .
Other cycling careers , besides that of Simpson , have ended here : the great French hopeful Jean - François Bernard pushed himself to the limit to win a time - trial here in the 1987 Tour , and was never the same again .
In 1955 the Frenchman Jean Malléjac , a decent Tour rider from Brittany , keeled over and never raced again , and in the same year , the Swiss Ferdi Kübler , winner in 1950 , had what seemed to be a nervous breakdown in the searing heat . ""
Ventoux has killed Ferdi , "" he muttered , words echoed half a century later by Armstrong . ""
Mont Ventoux does n't like Lance Armstrong , "" said the seven - time winner .
Many of the field will share that feeling , tempered by the fact that this year , the day before the finish in Paris , they will see the Champs Elysées from the top ."
2009-07-25,"SUNDAY ( Verbier )
On the podium in Verbier , the stage winner and new yellow jersey , Alberto Contador , is presented with an unusual prize : an enormous St Bernard dog .
Though clearly well trained , he is breathing heavily and seems not entirely comfortable .
But this is perhaps inevitable after two weeks of Lance Armstrong 's mind games .
As for the dog , he seems fine .
MONDAY ( Verbier )
A day off in a Swiss hacienda : a small hotel surrounded by snow - capped Alpine peaks .
Can it get any better ?
Yes .
Parked outside are
Tour publicity caravan vehicles – a giant coffee cup on wheels , and two doughnut - shaped trucks .
Each summer , hundreds of attractive , exuberant young people give up three weeks to take part in the caravan .
If you have to spend hours in a Swiss hacienda , there are worse crowds to be with .
TUESDAY
( Martigny ) Dave Brailsford , the British Cycling performance director and man behind the new Team Sky , is spotted in the Village Départ , deep in conversation with Jonathan Vaughters , who runs the Garmin - Slipstream team of Tour revelation Bradley Wiggins .
Were they discussing Wiggins , and for whom he might ride next season ? ""
Actually , "" says Brailsford , looking serious .
"" We were talking about Swiss chocolate . ""
Wiggins excels again on the second day in the Alps , but he is apprehensive about day three .
"" It 's going to be more of a brothel , "" he says , which confuses the French journalists .
And the British ones , for that matter .
WEDNESDAY (
Le Grand Bornand )
It is the end of the road for one of the heroes of this Tour , Kenny van Hummel .
The "" lanterne rouge "" – last man overall , so named after the red lantern that used to hang from the last carriage of trains – has fought a daily battle to scrape inside the time limit , trailing Contador by three hours , 30 minutes in the overall standings , but becoming a cult hero in his native Holland .
For Van Hummel , today was the end of the line ; the 26-year - old is dropped after 4 km , then crashes on a descent and is taken to Sallanches hospital with a badly gashed knee .
He leaves the Tour battered but not beaten , his fame and reputation enhanced .
THURSDAY ( Annecy )
It has been the Twitter Tour , but in the last 24 hours there has been an escalation in the "" Twitter wars "" , with Levi Leipheimer – who abandoned last week with a broken wrist – stirring it up with critical tweets about Contador , his and Armstrong 's Astana team - mate .
Armstrong weighs in , but Contador keeps a dignified silence .
Tweets have replaced drugs as the Tour 's most compelling subplot .
Given the headaches the tweets have caused teams ' press officers , they could join drugs on the banned list next year .
FRIDAY ( Aubenas )
Still trying to find out what happened to Contador 's dog .
Has he set it on Armstrong ?
We ask Contador 's manager and brother , Francisco , who has no idea .
Be grateful that this "" cyclist with dog "" story differs from the Operación Puerto doping investigation , which revealed that several top riders used their dog 's name as code for the blood bags stored in a Madrid clinic .
SATURDAY ( Mont Ventoux )
During the 2007 Dauphiné Libéré , David Millar and Wiggins doffed their helmets as they passed the monument on Mont Ventoux , marking the spot where Tom Simpson died in 1967 .
But with Wiggins challenging for a podium place , it 's left to Millar to pay his respects .
As the Scot eloquently put it , the memorial is a poignant reminder of "" how close he got and how far he fell – Tommy Simpson , cycling 's very own Icarus . """
2009-07-28,"The primary reaction to Alberto Contador 's victory over Lance Armstrong in the Tour de France on Sunday has been a nod to athletic normalcy and a poignant appreciation for the American 's grace in defeat .
Indeed , the younger , fitter Spaniard was outstanding , and his a freakish combination of climbing power and sprinting speed makes him a worthy successor to Lance as cycling 's dominant force .
But let 's not bury the Texan just yet .
For I have a strong suspicion the 2009 Tour de France was mostly about the 2010 Tour de France .
Armstrong has already indicated he will most likely ride in next year 's race .
He will be almost 39 then , an impossibly advanced age for most cyclists to consider the 23 days of agony the Tour demands .
But , as has been proven so often , Armstrong is not "" most cyclists "" .
Consider :
He 's just shy of 38 .
He 's coming off a badly broken collarbone suffered in March .
He took two full years off from the sport and devoted the time to an exhausting whirlwind of cancer research lobbying and highly public romances .
And he spent a good deal of his "" rest "" period hanging out with Matthew McConaughey , which can not be good for anyone 's athletic ambitions .
For all of that , Lance was atop the final podium Sunday .
His third - place finish may have seemed disappointing to the majority accustomed to his victories in France , but in a cycling context , it was an extraordinary accomplishment .
Armstrong battled a much younger , fitter rider , one at the top of his powers , and one who , once he established that he was the strongest rider , could rely on the support of an exceptional teammate : Lance Armstrong .
Many , if not most , athletes would have crumbled at the strong slap of reality smacking them in the face .
Instead , Armstrong put his head down , helped Contador win the yellow jersey , said all the right things â€ “ and quietly started plotting next year 's comeback .
For even though Armstrong will be a year older in 2010 , much will be different .
For one thing , Contador is almost certain to leave Astana , his and Armstrong 's current powerhouse team .
"" We are totally incompatible , "" Contador said after his victory .
"" In the end , Armstrong will go his way and I 'll go mine .
"" Organisation is hugely important in the Tour de France , as critical if not more so than the rider 's fitness .
Astana set new standards for excellence in this area , even more so than the US Postal Service team that Armstrong carried to his seven straight wins .
The Blue Train had some powerful riders to support Armstrong but was n't bankrolled behind the scenes to the extent Astana is .
From masseurs to food to logistics to maintenance , Astana is absolutely top of the line .
So Contador is likely to discover a different world when he leaves .
Armstrong , meanwhile , will be challenging the title holder with the continued support of the team ( which will be renamed Team RadioShack for next season ) , and there is n't likely to be any confusion about who is top dog .
You have to think Armstrong spent much of his time on the bike the past three weeks studying Contador , sizing up his strengths and ( few ) weaknesses , and is already putting together a battle plan for upending the younger rider .
Armstrong 's career is a testament to coming back when least expected , and drawing tremendous motivation from setback .
These elements will be in place at the 2010 starting line .
It would be a mistake to think that there is n't one more Tour de Lance ahead ."
2009-08-13,"Migrating birds do it .
Lance Armstrong and his fellow professional cyclists do it .
Even Formula One drivers do it .
So why do n't commercial aircraft do it , too ?
Riding in someone else 's slipstream significantly reduces your fuel burn .
Engineers and sportsfolk have known this for decades .
But a simple proposal put forward at this year 's Airbus "" Fly Your Idea "" Challenge in Paris by five PhD students studying at Stanford University 's Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics is causing considerable turbulence online .
Why , the students asked , do n't aircraft come together when in transit over long distances and fly in formation to help save fuel ? ""
In principle , the idea of flying aircraft in formation is the same as for migrating birds , "" said Tristan Flanzer , one of the team members .
"" While in formation , birds experience lower drag and therefore can fly further .
Aircrafts can take advantage of the same principles to reduce their drag . ""
The team pointed out that "" formation flight "" is already practiced during military operations and their research suggests that fuel savings of up to 12 % could be achieved if commercial airlines followed a similar strategy . ""
Airlines really kill for a 1 % improvement in fuel burned , "" said team member Geoff Bower .
"" 12 % is actually very large . ""
To investigate their idea , the team studied one day 's worth of Virgin Atlantic flights from the US to the UK .
A Stanford University press release explains how the team 's theory could be applied : The team proposed that flights leaving from the same general area make slight adjustments to their departure times , rendezvous in midair at a point close to each plane 's origin and fly to their destination in formations of two or three aircraft .
There would be about two to five miles separating each plane in the formation .
To illustrate , [ Emily ] Schwartz [ one of the students ] imagined flights from San Francisco , Los Angeles and Las Vegas taking off , meeting around Utah and flying toward England in formation .
And , yes , they have thought about the safety implications .
The team acknowledge that their idea would require extensive testing –
they propose using some cargo planes , "" such as those flown by United Parcel Service and FedEx "" – due to the fact that the vortices produced by aircraft have been known to be a contributory factor in the downing of some flights ; the most notable recent example being American Airlines Flight 587 which crashed into a residential area of Queens in New York City in November 2001 killing a total of 265 people .
The team concluded that three planes flying two to five miles apart in a reverse "" V "" formation was possibly the safest method to adopt .
But beyond the obvious safety concerns , there are also some other questions that need answering .
For example , would flying through the turbulent slipstream lead to an excessively bumpy ride for the passengers buckled up inside ?
And would rival airlines be willing to buddy up with each other in this manner ?
The concept certainly deserves further investigation .
It joins a growing list of ideas suggesting how relatively simple operational changes to the way that commercial airlines are flown and taxied on the ground offer perhaps the most promising ways to cut aviation emissions , largely because they do n't involve drastic and cripplingly expensive redesigns of aircraft and their fuel .
For example , one big idea that has been floated for years , but still stubbornly refuses to take off , is vastly improving the coordination between national air traffic controllers .
Over Europe , say , the air space is currently governed by 39 rival air traffic control centres .
Why not , ask Europe 's leading air traffic controllers ( collectively known as Eurocontrol ) , just merge them all into one giant operation controlled by a super computer ?
This would help avoid much of the unnecessary fuel burn caused by stacking and other delays , and allow planes to fly in a straight line rather than the zig - zags many now adopt to avoid passing over certain territories charging overflight fees .
Thankfully , this now seems to be a step closer after the recent signing of a deal between the European Commission and various aviation players operating across Europe .
The aim is to create a "" Single European Sky "" by 2020 and thereby "" save emissions and billions of dollars as well as improve safety by a factor of 10 "" .
However , if the aviation industry if being honest with itself , it will need to adopt all of the measures mentioned above – as well as keep its fingers firmly crossed that the on - going efforts to redesign aircraft and fuels succeed – if it is ever to reduce its emissions .
As the world 's fastest - growing source of greenhouse gas emissions , it might even see these savings quickly cancelled out by the growth in the number of flights taking to the air over the coming decades .
It is for this reason that many still see blocking the aviation industry 's expansionist tendencies as the best strategy for keeping emissions in check ."
2009-08-20,"A shortened Tour of Ireland begins in Powerscourt tomorrow with Lance Armstrong and Mark Cavendish heading the field .
The three - day race has been reduced by two stages as a consequence of the "" very tough economic climate "" , said organiser Alan Rushton .
For both Armstrong and Cavendish it will mark their return to top - level competition after the Tour de France in July , in which the American placed third overall and the British sprinter won six stages .
While it is likely to signal the end of Armstrong 's comeback season – the seven - times Tour winner will host a three - day Global Cancer Summit in Dublin from Monday – for Cavendish , who won three stages of last year 's Tour of Ireland , the race is expected to act as a springboard to the final part of the season .
From Ireland he will go to the Tour of Missouri before targeting a place in the British team for the world championships in Switzerland next month , and an expected tilt at the end of season sprinters ' classic , Paris - Tours , in October ."
2009-08-23,"Torrential rain and a sore back forced Lance Armstrong 's withdrawal from today 's final stage of the Tour of Ireland .
The American was among 56 riders to abandon the stage as the three - day race finished with a circuit around Cork that included the notoriously steep St Patrick 's Hill .
Mark Cavendish , the winner of yesterday 's stage , was another non - finisher , but his fellow - Briton Russell Downing celebrated the biggest victory of his career on his 31st birthday .
Conditions got so treacherous the final lap was cancelled as only 47 riders finished the race .
Downing , the winner of stage one , escaped with Lars Petter Nordhaug of Norway in the closing stages to finish second to the Norwegian on today 's stage , but sealing his grip on the yellow jersey .
The 37-year - old Armstrong , who travelled from Cork to Dublin tonight to host a three - day Global Cancer Summit , which opens tomorrow , said on his Twitter site that he had had a "" rough day on the bike .
The ol' back was not in a good way and St [ Patrick 's ] Hill was n't looking too cozy "" .
The Tour of Ireland was the seven - times Tour de France winner 's final race of his comeback season and final outing for the Astana team .
Britain 's Emma Pooley scored her second World Cup win of the season today , embarking on a 45 km solo escape to take the Grand Prix de Plouay in western France .
The Olympic time - trial silver medallist is enjoying her best season and her defeated opponents today included the world and Olympic road race champion , Nicole Cooke , who launched a counterattack but could not catch her fellow Brit ."
2009-08-28,"Lance Armstrong has said for the first time that he can win an eighth Tour de France in 2010 .
After finishing third in his comeback Tour in July the American says he is confident he will be stronger and better equipped to beat this year 's winner , Alberto Contador .
The two rode together on the Astana team but will go their separate ways this winter .
"" My goal is to win the Tour , "" said Armstrong when asked about his aims for next year .
"" I will go in confident but also knowing realistically that [ Contador ] is very good . ""
But I think there are two things [ in my favour ] : one , I will be better next year than I was this year
[ having had ] this season under my belt , [ with ] the Giro , the Tour , all the training and other races .
And there are other things that I can improve on for next year , if we look at the training aspects of things , the technical aspects of the bike , the position ‚ all of those things can improve .
We will be better .
I do n't know if I will be good enough to beat Alberto , but I will try . ""
In an interview to be broadcast by Eurosport today , to kick off the satellite broadcaster 's daily coverage of the Vuelta a Espana , Armstrong admitted there was "" real tension "" between him and Contador during the Tour and that it engulfed the entire team .
He added that his new team , Radio - Shack , will comprise the "" core group "" of the current Astana team , including long - time manager Johan Bruyneel , but "" with a few notable exceptions "" – in other words , Contador , who is expected to leave Astana , probably for Spanish team Caisse d'Epargne .
"" It was not only tension between myself and [ Contador ] , "" said Armstrong .
"" Other people [ were ] involved and there were quiet dinner tables more than once .
It is not anything that I have ever experienced before , but we did our job , and it ended up being OK .
It will be a different situation again next year . ""
Armstrong also admitted that last week 's Tour of Ireland , which he failed to finish , was "" probably "" his final race of the season .
It was followed by a three - day Global Cancer Summit , organised by Armstrong 's charity , Livestrong , and hosted by the cyclist in Dublin .
During his stay he invited local cyclists to join him for a ride , with an estimated 1,200 responding , following a similar stunt in Paisley the previous week , when 300 answered the impromptu invitation , announced on his Twitter site .
The accessible , relaxed Armstrong of 2009 is a far cry from the aloof figure who dominated the sport between 1999‑2005 , when he was dogged by allegations of doping .
"" I was definitely more relaxed [ during the Tour ] , "" said Armstrong .
"" I wanted to do well , I wanted to win
but I did n't put that much pressure on myself .
"" I think in the past I looked around to the media , I looked around on certain people and there was a pursuit [ after ] me .
Even now , today , there are members of the media or public who still hunt , but I do n't care , because now I have everything I ever wanted .
"" I have my health , the health of my family , I 'm financially sound .
I do n't need to worry .
I sit back and say , ' Ah , forget it – just go out and have fun on your bike . '
I 'm 38 years old .
You ca n't go out [ to ] race in tough conditions with young guys if you 're not having fun .
If it was a job , it would be impossible at this point in my life . """
2009-09-13,"Bradley Wiggins stopped just short of saying he can win the Tour de France at the start of stage two of the Tour of Britain in Darlington yesterday , but the implication was clear .
"" I believe I can get on the podium and do better than the podium , "" said Wiggins â€ “ and as better than the podium means being the actual winner , it is clear that he is setting his sights high next year .
Having finished 37 seconds behind the third - placed Lance Armstrong in Paris , Wiggins recognises that avoidable errors might have cost him a place on the podium .
"" We made so many mistakes in the Tour and yet I was only seconds off third , "" he said , referring to the split on stage three that Armstrong infiltrated and Wiggins missed and also that he neglected to reconnoitre any of the stages .
"" I do n't think Lance is a better athlete than me any more , "" Wiggins said .
"" He probably used to be but not any more .
He played it well tactically and did n't miss a beat during the race , from the split on day three to winning the team time trial [ in which Wiggins 's Garmin team were second , having shed most of their riders ] .
I was stronger than him in the time trials and on certain mountain stages .
"" Rumours continue to circulate that he could be one of the 10 riders still to be signed by Team Sky for 2010 .
"" I think [ there 's more to ] come next year .
I 'll go into the race with more selfâ€‘belief , a bit more confidence , having looked at the course beforehand and checked out the mountain stages .
I never imagined I 'd finish fourth this year
so it 's a bit like finishing sixth in the individual pursuit about eight years ago .
That made me think I could actually beat [ Australia 's ] Brad McGee . ""
In the 2004 Olympic final in Athens Wiggins did precisely that , before becoming the first rider to defend the Olympic pursuit title in Beijing last year .
Wiggins rode the Tour of Britain last year , when the support was merely enthusiastic .
This year , at the stage start in Scunthorpe and at the finish in York , and again yesterday in Darlington and Gateshead , it was overwhelming .
The crowds seem to have turned out en masse for him , judging by the plethora of homemade banners urging "" Go Wiggo "" .
"" I did n't realise it would be like this , "" Wiggins said .
"" It shows how big cycling is getting in the UK . ""
The other difference is that this year , unlike last , Wiggins is race fit , with next week 's world time - trial championship in Switzerland the final goal of his season . ""
Last year I spent more time in the bar at the hotel rather than racing , "" he said .
"" I 've managed to carry decent form from the Tour
and I 'm enjoying it more . ""
Yesterday 's second stage was won by the Dutchman Kai Reus , who broke clear on in the final 15 km to score an emotional victory , his first in more than two years .
In July 2007 Reus crashed while training in the French Alps and fell into a coma , in which he remained for 11 days , his life hanging in the balance .
The 24-year old , a former junior world champion , welled up when asked about his crash , though he cheered up when asked whether he will defend the yellow jersey on today 's third stage from Peebles to Gretna .
"" I do n't know , "" said Reus .
"" I 'm totally knackered now . """
2009-09-25,"Bradley Wiggins says he may need to move teams if he is to further his cycling career .
The three - time Olympic track champion impressed during this year 's Tour de France when he finished in fourth place behind Lance Armstrong , but he believes it will be difficult to improve on that if he remains at the Garmin - Slipstream team .
"" The Tour de France changed everything , "" he told the BBC .
"" It 's like trying to win the Champions League â€ “ you need to be at Manchester United
but I 'm playing at Wigan at the moment
so I have to make that step up .
"" There has been speculation that he might move to Team Sky but Wiggins , who is tied to Garmin until 2010 , did not make any reference to joining the British - based squad .
His comments will have interested British Cycling 's performance director and Team Sky principal Dave Brailsford , who confirmed there are still places available on his roster .
"" There are two or three more spots to fill on our roster and we have our eyes on a few riders , "" he said .
"" But key British riders are maybe under contract and we 've got to respect that .
"" Wiggins 's performance in France this year was a surprise and the cyclist admitted it had helped him refocus his ambitions . ""
No one would have imagined I would finish fourth , "" he said .
"" Going into this year I hoped for success in time - trials .
I never really imagined I 'd be climbing with the best in the Tour .
It has changed everything about the future and what I 'm capable of achieving .
I believe I 'm capable of getting on the podium â€ “
I was inches away from it this time . ""
Next year I 'll be stronger .
I 'll have a bit more self - belief and confidence .
It will be very difficult to challenge [ the Tour 's winner ] Alberto Contador .
He is an amazing rider
but I 'll go in the best possible condition and see what happens .
I wo n't go in to finish third .
I set off to win the race . ""
Wiggins also added that he hopes to compete at the London Games in 2012 , where he will defend the 4,000 m pursuit gold medal he won in both Athens in 2004 and Beijing last year .
"" I want to defend my pursuit titles in London but it is quite far away to think about , "" he said .
"" This year still has n't sunk in but London is at the back of my mind and I 'd love to be going for number three in the individual .
It will be a nice way to end my career if I do end it there , which I probably will . """
2009-10-05,"Lance Armstrong 's Astana team has denied allegations that they received preferential treatment from drug testers during the Tour de France .
The race was won by Alberto Contador , also of Astana , with Armstrong third , but two French newspapers reported today that the French Anti - Doping Agency ( AFLD ) has made an official complaint , claiming the Kazakh - backed team was given an easy ride by the International Cycling Union ( UCI ) testers . ""
For some teams , the unexpected nature of anti - doping tests did not exist on the Tour , "" said Le Figaro , before going on to claim that Astana "" were always last to be tested in the morning [ and ] that there were delays in presenting themselves to the tester "" .
A 10-page report into the matter was , according to Le Figaro and Le Monde , submitted yesterday by the AFLD to the World Anti - Doping Agency , the UCI , the Tour organisers , ASO , as well as the French ministries of sport and health .
"" We only saw the article in the newspaper , "" Philippe Maertens , the Astana spokesman , said .
"" We have n't been informed , and we do n't have any information that we have done something wrong .
It has nothing to do with us . ""
When [ the drugs testers ] asked us to do something , we always co - operated , "" continued Maertens .
"" I think our team was the most controlled during the Tour de France â€ “ which is right â€ “ but this is bullshit .
During the Tour there were rumours [ about preferential treatment ] , but I do n't see what it has to do with us .
It 's more an accusation against the UCI . ""
The UCI strongly rejected claims of preferential treatment . ""
The UCI considers the accusations of the AFLD to be completely groundless and even very serious , "" it said .
"" Following doubts already expressed by the AFLD , the UCI had launched an investigation on the treatment granted to Astana and had concluded that this team had not been favoured . ""
The UCI 's head of anti - doping , Anne Gripper , responded by saying she was "" confident there was no preferential treatment given to any team "" .
"" It was an issue raised and dealt with while the Tour was happening , "" Gripper told Cyclingnews .
"" We 've had discussions with the AFLD on what they think happened and we 've told them what actually happened . ""
Among the AFLD 's complaints is that , on the morning of 11 July , testing of the Astana team was delayed by 45 minutes after UCI inspectors intervened .
The French agency also claims that its escorts were not permitted to attend tests , which , says the report , "" does not follow the faultless regularity of the procedure , particularly [ with regard to ] ensuring that no manipulation [ of blood and urine samples ] took place "" .
The AFLD , which had sole responsibility for testing at the 2008 Tour , has also confirmed it will announce the results of 40 retests on last year 's samples tomorrowon Wednesday morning .
They are understood to have targeted suspicious riders ."
2009-10-13,"A year ago , the interest for British cycling fans in the launch of the 2009 Tour de France came down to one question : how many sprint stage win opportunities is there for Mark Cavendish ?
Today , after the emergence this summer of Bradley Wiggins as a contender for the overall title , the balance of the entire 2,000-mile route suddenly matters .
Wiggins is racing in Australia and will be absent from the announcement , but the flying Cavendish , winner of six stages this year , will be in Paris 's Palais des CongrÃ¨s tomorrow , as will other probable key names in 2010 : Lance Armstrong and Alberto Contador .
After their cold war this July , the body language between the Texan and the Spaniard will be closely watched .
The 2010 route starts in Rotterdam with a time trial , and then heads south through Belgium , with the Alps apparently preceding the Pyrenees , where the race is expected to linger for several days to celebrate the centenary of the mountain range 's first inclusion in the race route .
Reports in local papers suggest the Tour will go up the most prestigious pass , the Col du Tourmalet , twice , from either direction .
This will happen once during a stage that will replicate the original 1910 course â€ “ last covered in 1983 â€ “ and once for a stage finish on top of the pass , which will be expected to provide a climax akin to this year 's dramatics on Mont Ventoux ."
2009-10-14,"Lance Armstrong and Alberto Contador were in the same room today but not , naturally , side by side as they watched the unveiling of the 2010 Tour de France route , where their bitter rivalry from this July can be expected to continue , assuming this year 's Tour de France winner has a team of any strength to back him up .
The bulk of Contador 's Astana team riders and staff have jumped ship to Armstrong 's new squad sponsored by Radioshack , and at present the Spaniard has no manager and one rider under contract alongside him which hardly bodes well for his title defence .
On the other hand , with a total of seven mountain stages and a summit finish on top of the Pyrenean Col du Tourmalet three days from the end , Contador will have plenty of opportunities to show his climbing skill .
As expected , the great pass is scaled twice , to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the Tour 's first passage through the Pyrenees .
Next year 's race is being marketed as "" The eternal quest for the summits "" , with a logo consisting of a map of France with a computer - generated mountain range .
There is only one major time - trial , on the final Saturday , and that should ensure the race remains as open as this year 's .
•
View the full route for the 2010 Tour de France here
Nor is there a team time - trial – which disappointed Armstrong – but the first three days after the prologue time - trial in Rotterdam are surprisingly tough .
Stage one to Brussels goes over the dams on Holland 's North Sea coast , where the wind could blow the race apart , stage two takes in four sections of narrow cobbled roads used in the Paris - Roubaix Classic , close to the end , while the third stage , in Belgium , includes small , steep climbs in the Ardennes .
"" You will need a strong team , strong guys to keep you at the front , "" was Armstrong 's conclusion .
Given his current worries , Contador will have taken note , and if he is interested in omens , the race also includes the location of one of his bitter rival 's greatest moments , the descent into the town of Gap , in the Alps , where the Texan took off across 100 m of rough hillside fields to avoid colliding with a fallen Spaniard , Joseba Beloki , en route to his 2003 win .
Sitting alongside Armstrong was Mark Cavendish , winner of 10 stages in the last two Tours .
Next year , he will aim to become the first Briton to carry the green jersey of points winner into Paris . ""
For sure I know I can win it , I 'll go with the theory that I 'm going to win as much as I can , and hopefully the green jersey will come as a result .
It should have come this year , so I 'll go for it again . ""
He estimates that only five of the 20 stages are certain to be sprint finishes , which is testimony to the toughness of the route .
"" It 's hard , really hard , harder than this year .
The mountain stages are savage . ""
The performance director of the Olympic cycling team , Dave Brailsford , echoed Cavendish 's sentiments , but here today his interest lay with the nascent Sky team , whom he is head of .
Sky have nine or 10 riders to name in their 25-rider squad but it remains unclear whether they will secure the services of Bradley Wiggins , fourth last year , but under contract to the Garmin squad for 2010 .
Sky 's participation in the race will be decided next April when "" wild - card "" slots are allotted , as Brailsford pointed out .
"" Our first job is to get into the race .
We 've got a big job to do .
We 've got to race well , show we deserve to be among the teams in the Tour .
That 's the strategy , but you do n't want to expend all your energy in the first part of the season
so when you get to the main event there 's nothing left .
At this stage of the game any Tour is going to be good if we can get in it . """
2009-11-20,"Sean Yates , one of only four British cyclists to wear the yellow jersey of the Tour de France leader , is to join Team Sky as a sports director .
The 49-year - old , a veteran of 12 Tours , will leave Lance Armstrong 's Astana team at the end of the year to become the only British director in the new squad , joining an Australian , Dutchman and Swede .
Yates 's defection is a surprise because all the other senior members of the Astana management team opted to join Armstrong at his new RadioShack squad .
The Englishman mentored Armstrong in the twilight of his cycling career when the two spent four years together at Motorola .
He then answered Armstrong 's invitation to join his Discovery Channel team as a director in 2005 .
But the opportunity to be involved in the first British team to compete at the highest level in over 20 years tempted Yates away .
"" I 'm extremely excited to join , "" said Yates .
"" For me to be part of a British team at the highest level is something really special .
I have a lot of experience in a winning team and I look forward to helping Team Sky fulfil its goals . ""
The scope and ambition of the project is unique and I think we have put together a great team .
I really believe we can be contenders on all levels in the future
and I 'm proud to become part of that .
"" It will not be Yates 's first experience of managing a British team , although he will hope it proves a happier one than when he was at the helm of the Linda McCartney Racing Team , which collapsed with debts of more than Â£500,000 in 2001 .
Astana received positive news today when the Tour winner , Alberto Contador , confirmed he is likely to stay with the Kazakh squad next year .
With the departure of Armstrong and others , the team have been severely depleted and there remains uncertainty over whether Astana will retain their ProTour licence .
A decision by the International Cycling Union ( UCI ) is expected in the coming days .
Contador retracted his previous pledge to leave , subject to the team retaining its place in the top tier of teams . ""
The [ ProTour ] licence is fundamental , "" said the Spaniard .
"" I would like to stay with Astana , but I will do it only if the team is ProTour . ""
Contador 's volte - face could have repercussions for Team Sky 's efforts to sign Bradley Wiggins .
Wiggins 's team , Garmin - Slipstream , had expressed an interest in signing the Tour winner , who would have replaced the Englishman as leader , thus freeing Wiggins to leave ."
2009-12-06,"Bradley Wiggins is targeting at least a second - place finish in next year 's Tour de France .
On a route he believes will favour him Wiggins , who came fourth this year , reckons he has the beating of at least two of the three riders who finished above him , tipping Andy Schleck to lose time in the first week , and considers himself now a "" better rider "" than Lance Armstrong .
Wiggins , who competed in his first track event in a year at the Manchester Velodrome on Saturday , said the opening week of the 2010 Tour gave him opportunities to gain time on rivals such as Alberto Contador , the Schleck brothers , Andy and Frank , and "" the guy from America "" – Armstrong , who finished third this year .
"" I 've looked at the route , "" said Wiggins .
"" A lot of people are thinking it wo n't be a great Tour for me but that first week is , if anything , advantageous to me . ""
The race starts in Rotterdam before entering Belgium , where crosswinds , cobbles and short , steep hills will present a tough challenge .
It will include more cobbled sections than any Tour since 1983 , when they caused carnage .
It is a prospect Wiggins , a strong rider over such terrain , relishes .
Although much has been made of the six mountain stages – which on paper suit Contador and the Schlecks –
the Englishman believes the cobbles could be decisive .
"" There could be big time gaps , "" he said .
"" Andy , Frank and maybe Contador wo n't like the cobbles .
"" I had one bad day on the Tour this year and that day happened to be the one with the most mountains in it , "" he continued .
"" I think everyone thought that must be a weakness of mine but on the other stages I was really comfortable on the climbs .
So the fact there 's more climbing next year is something I 'm quite excited about .
It 'll make for an interesting race . ""
While Wiggins admitted that this year 's winner , Contador , "" is in a league of his own on the climbs "" , he added that "" I think I 'm a better rider than Lance and some of the other guys .
After Contador , and maybe Andy [ Schleck ] , there 's not much between the next four or five guys . ""
Schleck finished second in the summer .
Wiggins made a winning return to the velodrome in Saturday 's Revolution meeting , claiming the first event , a scratch race , with a late solo attack during which he indulged in some showboating to whip up the crowd .
He arrived on the back of his first week 's full training as he builds towards next season , with daily rides of between four and five hours .
"" I try not to showboat too much , because it bloody hurts , "" he said .
"" And I did five hours on Friday , so I do n't really have the legs .
"" Wiggins admitted that the speculation surrounding a possible move to Team Sky from his current team , Garmin - Slipstream – to which he is under contract for 2010 – has been a distraction . ""
At times , when I read stuff about it , it does affect me , because so much of it is untrue , "" he said .
According to sources close to both teams the transfer remains on .
But Wiggins – mindful , perhaps , that it could yet fall through and he could still be in Garmin colours next year – played down the possibility .
"" Once we get into January , and it 's apparent
I 'm still with Garmin
, everything will settle down , "" he said .
Ben Swift , meanwhile , has been named in Sky 's line - up for January 's Tour Down Under by event organisers , even though the Yorkshireman is still under the contract he signed with Katusha for the 2009 and 2010 seasons according to the Russian team .
Swift is one of three Britons named , the others being Chris Froome and Russell Downing .
The Australians Chris Sutton and Mathew Hayman , Italy 's Davide Vigano and New Zealand 's Greg Henderson complete the line - up .
The Revolution meeting also saw the competitive debut of the former skier Alain Baxter , who contested the 200 m flying - start time- trial , though he admitted he was "" a little disappointed "" with his time of 11.607 seconds .
Matt Crampton was quickest in 10.31 ."
2009-12-10,"The seven - times Tour de France winner Lance Armstrong has signalled his intent to retire from racing after the 2011 season .
The 38-year - old American , who returned to cycling in January after three and a half years in retirement , has set up his new RadioShack team and taken most of his former Astana team - mates with him , except his great rival and the Tour champion Alberto Contador . ""
After 2011 , I 'll retire , "" Armstrong told Gazzetta dello Sport . ""
This team has n't been constructed for me , I 'm 38 .
Our aims go further than Armstrong .
"" If you look at the Tour this year , we had the strongest team in the race .
Of the nine riders from last year 's Tour de France squad from Astana , eight are now on RadioShack .
We took the vast majority of the riders from the team that we wanted , so it remains a strong team .
"" We lack that super high - level favourite like Alberto , but I like the chances with the strong guys we have . ""
The rivalry between Contador and Armstrong was a feature of last year 's Tour .
The Spaniard has opted to stay with the Kakazh - funded Astana and will be joined by the 2006 Tour winner Oscar Pereiro ."

2010-01-04,"Team Sky are confident that Bradley Wiggins , their anointed leader for the Tour de France , has a good chance of improving on his fourth place in last year 's race .
Leading the chorus at the team 's presentation was the most experienced British name in the new set - up , Sean Yates , whose professional career began in 1982 and who has been one of Lance Armstrong 's right - hand men since 1993 .
Yates will be one of four directeurs sportifs at Team Sky , and has been hired partly because he is one of the few men on the circuit with in - depth knowledge of the way that the seven - times Tour winner works .
"" I can see a win in him , "" said Yates , when asked about Wiggins 's chances in the Tour in the next few years .
The Sussex former pro , who won a time trial in the Tour in 1988 , revealed that in the final days of last year 's Tour , Wiggins was the rider who most concerned Armstrong and his manager Johan Bruyneel .
"" They were most worried about him , because he can time trial , he was climbing superbly , he was n't showing any cracks and there was an element of uncertainty . ""
Asked whether he agreed with Yates , Wiggins concurred .
"" The difference this year will be that I know I can do it in the Tour .
This time last year I did n't know where I was in the sport .
If I 'd stood here a year ago and said I had a good chance of coming fourth everyone would have had a right old laugh .
This time last year I did n't expect to go top five in the Tour ; now I know what I have to do , what weight I have to be at , how long it all takes .
I did no training for stamina in the mountains .
I did n't look at any of the course .
I did n't even know what mountains we went up . ""
"" He can do better [ than last year ] ‚ "" said Yates .
"" He can deal with the pressure .
It 's all up for grabs . ""
Intriguingly , given how well he knows Armstrong , Yates added that the Texan and Bruyneel would be watching Sky closely this year .
"" Johan has ridden the track and knows what it takes .
Things will be turning in his head .
He will be asking questions and we 'll be on the radar for sure . ""
Yesterday other developments which had been rumours to date were confirmed as fact .
Team Sky presented the final name in their line - up in Ben Swift , the product of the British Cycling Academy who won a stage in last year 's Tour of Britain .
The car supplier will be Jaguar – who last appeared on a cycling team jersey just before the Linda McCartney team folded in 2001 – while clothing will come from Adidas ."
2010-01-16,"Lance Armstrong has predicted a "" very successful year "" for Team Sky , the new British professional cycling team that will make its debut in Adelaide today , and has restated his belief that he can challenge for an eighth Tour de France win in July .
"" I would n't be here if I did n't think I could do it , "" said the 38-year - old .
Team Sky , which Armstrong anticipates will "" push the envelope when it comes to technology and materials "" , is not the only new outfit to be debuting in Australia .
Armstrong 's RadioShack squad is the other , and it became apparent yesterday , with his renewed criticism of his former team - mate Alberto Contador and his insistence that he will be stronger than he was last year , that the old warrior 's hunger is arguably greater than 12 months ago when he launched a comeback that was motivated , he insisted , as much by his desire to raise awareness of cancer as by the goal of an eighth Tour .
This year , the campaigning will take a back seat .
"" It 'll still be an emphasis , but it will be less than in 2009 , "" said Armstrong .
"" The blending of the two was tough .
When you go to a Grand Tour and spend the days leading up to it standing around in a suit and tie , on your feet for hours , that 's hard . ""
Thus in 2010 he will "" lead the monk lifestyle that a professional cyclist requires "" .
"" It 's different because the team is different and the pressure is different , "" Armstrong added .
"" Being in a team sponsored by an American company will be different to racing for no salary for a Kazakh - backed team [ Astana ] . ""
Another difference this year is that Armstrong is no longer the only show in town , though his pulling power was illustrated yesterday morning , when an estimated 7,000 cyclists joined him for one of his now regular ' Twitter ' rides .
But as Armstrong was quick to acknowledge , there is great interest around Team Sky , the squad set up by Dave Brailsford with the same ambition as Britain 's all - conquering track team : namely , to be the best in the world .
"" I think Sky will be good , "" said Armstrong .
"" They bring a structure that has been in place for a while with the track programme there in [ Britain ] .
I suspect , and my prediction would be , that they 'll have a very successful year .
"" We know that they have the talent .
If you look at riders like [ Bradley ] Wiggins , [ Edvald ] Boasson Hagen , [ Thomas ]
Lofkvist and Simon Gerrans : on paper they have the horsepower .
They 'll also use , perhaps more than anyone else , technology .
They 'll use technology that we 're all going to look at and go , ' Woah , I never saw that before ! '
And I think that 's good .
I expect they 'll be good .
Very good . ""
The Team Sky sports director on duty in Adelaide is Sean Yates , who mentored the young Armstrong at the Motorola team , and who joined Brailsford 's squad from Astana , where he had a ringside seat as Contador and Armstrong fell out during last year 's Tour .
Yates suggested that the Spaniard , who prevailed in their battle last year and is most people 's favourite to do so again this year , has "" a lot of Lance - like traits "" .
It was an observation that might , during his seven - year reign as Tour champion , have riled him , but the new , more mellow Armstrong seemed unruffled , although his response was revealing in its own way . ""
Perhaps Sean was talking about the fact that he 's a strong character , "" said Armstrong .
""
Mentally , he 's almost unbreakable .
There were times in the Tour last summer where you thought he had to be fragile mentally because of things that were [ going on ] in the race ...
And people thought : this guy 's going to crack .
And he never did .
He was always tough the next day .
He 's a very strong young man .
"" It sounded suspiciously as though a strategy of Armstrong 's had been – as it was in his seven Tour wins – to "" break "" his biggest rival mentally , despite the fact they were on the same team .
With that no longer the case , the gloves can perhaps come off .
But of Contador 's new - look Astana team – which is significantly diminished , the strongest riders having fled to RadioShack –
Armstrong appeared almost conciliatory when he said that , "" on paper , he does n't have the horsepower we have , but I do n't think the remarks from people , during the big races , will be : ' He has a terrible team . '
I think they 'll say ' It 's not the strongest team , but it 's definitely strong enough to help him . ' """
2010-03-03,"Bradley Wiggins 's season moved into a new phase today , as the Tour of Murcia got under way with a first road stage won by the South African sprinter Robbie Hunter .
Wiggins enjoyed a trouble - free ride to finish in the bunch alongside Lance Armstrong , who is likely to be one of his main rivals at the Tour de France in July .
Armstrong is also in Murcia as part of his build - up and , within minutes of the stage finish , the seven - times Tour winner offered his take on Wiggins 's form via his Twitter feed : "" Brad Wiggins looks strong .
For my money he 's the favourite here .
"" The race , which finishes on Sunday , is expected to be decided by Saturday 's time trial , which is being billed as a significant gauge of early form for the two Tour contenders .
Over a flat 22 km course , it will offer Wiggins the opportunity of a stage win , and how he measures up to Armstrong , in the American 's first race since January 's Tour Down Under , should prove interesting .
It could also explain Armstrong 's apparent keenness to manage expectations by promoting Wiggins as favourite .
Wiggins 's "" new phase "" was identified by his coach , Rod Ellingworth , who is guiding the British rider as he seeks to better his fourth - place finish , just behind Armstrong , in last year 's Tour .
Ellingworth , the former British academy coach , who mentored Mark Cavendish throughout his meteoric rise , said Saturday 's test against the watch was "" definitely an objective "" . ""
He 's finished his conditioning phase , "" said Ellingworth , referring to Wiggins 's recent outings at the Tour of Qatar and Ruta del Sol . ""
Both Murcia and [ the Tour of ] Catalunya [ at the end of March ] are more about racing and making the most of each day .
It 's also about the big picture and thinking ahead to the summer .
"" Wiggins is not the only British rider in Murcia , with Russell Downing and Chris Froome also in the seven - man Team Sky squad .
Downing placed eighth in yesterday 's bunch sprint , with another British rider , Ian Wilkinson , of the Scottish - based Endura Racing Team , 10th .
It is unlikely that every stage will finish with a bunch sprint , with the Murcian climbs likely to offer an indication of Wiggins 's form relative to Armstrong 's .
"" It 's good for Brad to see where he is against Lance , "" said Ellingworth .
"" It 's easy to get distracted by what your rivals are doing
but it 's good to get a look at them as well .
They probably both saw that [ Alberto ] Contador was good at [ the Tour of ] Algarve , but Brad 's got nothing to worry about .
He 's in good shape . """
2010-03-05,"Bradley Wiggins showed at the front of the Tour of Murcia in today 's third stage , 24 hours before the time trial that will represent his first significant test of the season .
Wiggins finished ninth on the mountainous stage , having earlier escaped in a 10-man break that was deemed sufficiently dangerous for Lance Armstrong 's RadioShack team to mass at the front and chase it down .
At the finish it was the Australian Luke Roberts who won the stage .
Robbie Hunter , the winner of the first two stages , abandoned the tour on hearing that his wife had gone into labour .
Tomorrow 's penultimate stage , a time trial over 22 km , has been billed as a showdown between two of the favourites for this year 's Tour de France , Wiggins and Armstrong .
Meanwhile , Alberto Contador , the Tour 's outright favourite and defending champion , stars in the Paris - Nice , which gets under way on Sunday ."
2010-03-18,"Lance Armstrong has laid into an American radio host who claimed live on air that motorists should run cyclists down .
Armstrong branded ESPN 's Tony Kornheiser a "" complete f - ing idiot "" on his Twitter page , saying the comments were "" Disgusting , ignorant "" and "" foolish "" .
Kornheiser , who has recently returned after being suspended for criticising a female colleague for "" dressing too young "" , launched into a rant about cyclists while discussing a new cycle lane in Washington . ""
The last time I looked , the roads were made for automobiles , "" he said .
"" We 're going to be dominated as if this was Beijing by hundreds of thousands of bicyclists ... "" The broadcaster also attacked cycling clothes before urging motorists to run over those on bicycles .

Armstrong , a seven - times Tour de France - winner , reacted furiously , posting : "" Disgusting , ignorant , foolish .

He then later suggested his Twitter followers should write to ESPN to complain , after adding : "" Tony Kornheiser on cyclists on the road , ' run 'em down ' .

2010-03-30,"The nine riders who will represent Team Sky when the British squad make their debut at the Tour de France in July could be named before the end of April .
The team principal , Dave Brailsford , revealed that the final arbiters will be the riders themselves , with the 26 members of Team Sky charged with drawing up their own selection criteria for the world 's biggest race .
Twenty - two teams were announced today by Tour organisers ASO , with Sky one of six wildcards , alongside Lance Armstrong 's Team RadioShack and David Millar 's Garmin - Transitions squad .
The Sky team could be announced following the Ardennes Classics at the end of April .
Brailsford said : "" We asked the riders back in November how they thought the Tour team should be selected , and they came up with a plan .
We know from previous experience with the Olympics that the biggest source of unrest and friction is team selection .
The riders want to know two things : what it takes to be selected , and who makes the decision .
From our point of view , we want the team picked early .
We want them at their best at the Tour , not to gain selection . ""
Brailsford highlighted his new team 's "" clean credentials "" as a key factor in their selection for the Tour de France .
"" It was certainly one of the factors , "" Brailsford said .
"" I think that , on the sporting front , we earned our place on merit .
I also like to think that it 's recognised that we 're doing it the right way , and that we 're committed to clean cycling . ""
Brailsford revealed that Christian Prudhomme , the Tour director , visited Manchester last autumn , with the subject of the then - nascent team 's inclusion in the race one of the topics discussed .
"" We have tried to stay in regular contact since then though our discussions have n't centred just on how we get there , "" Brailsford said .
"" We 've also discussed how we contribute to the sport , how we do it clean and make the sport more exciting . ""
The team is likely to be led by Bradley Wiggins , though the British rider suffered a setback last week when a stomach infection forced him out of the Tour of Catalonia .
Brailsford said Wiggins , who was fourth last year , is recovering fine and could returnto racing at the Tour of the Basque Country , which begins next Monday .
"" We 'll probably re - jig his programme slightly , "" Brailsford said .
"" It 's not ideal , but it 's not a threat to our overall strategy . ""
When the 26 riders were asked in November how many wanted to be considered for the Tour , 19 put their hands up .
Ten will be disappointed , but among the early frontrunners to join Wiggins are Edvald Boasson Hagen , Thomas Lofkvist and Geraint Thomas ."
2010-05-20,"As others have said in the past about this very topic : SSDD .
Same stuff , different day .
To say there is nothing new in Floyd Landis 's allegations about Lance Armstrong and some of those in his orbit would be incorrect .
However , the process is depressingly familiar to anyone who has followed cycling 's 12 troubled years since Willy Voet was arrested with a carload of drugs in 1998 , sparking off the drip - feed of confession , conviction , revelation and allegation that has so poisoned the last decade and more .
This latest twist to the Landis case follows the same template set by Voet and the other pentiti : deny until you are desperate , then confess .
What varies is the length of time they can keep up the pretence .
Landis contested every claim , sought every convoluted explanation science could offer , exhausted every last appeal opportunity , mobilised public support , spent a small fortune .
His fellow American Tyler Hamilton did the same following his positive test for blood doping in 2004 .
In Landis 's case the due process of his case dragged through until 1 July 2008 .
His two - year ban ended 25 days later .
Landis 's years of self - delusion might prompt incredulity among outsiders but it is nothing novel in cycling 's recent past .
In October 2000 , for instance , in a courtroom in Lille Richard Virenque confessed to doping after more than two years of convoluted denial .
That for the first time revealed the extent to which cyclists who take drugs can convince themselves they are clean in spite of overwhelming evidence to the contrary .
Landis states in his emails that he hopes his allegations may serve some purpose if properly investigated but the simple fact is this : had he come out with his allegations at the time of his positive test for testosterone in the Tour de France in 2006
, they would have carried infinitely greater weight .
To spend years in denial before turning round and contradicting everything you have clung to over that time –
whatever the details you can produce – means that any attempt to investigate the allegations can be countered with one simple argument : why should any credence be given to someone who has behaved in this way ?
Compare and contrast with David Millar .
He is not a saint but the Briton 's period in denial as the allegations mounted around him in 2004 was infinitely shorter – a matter of a few months – and was followed by a prompt confession , a willingness to accept the consequences of his actions , and positive action to redress the harm he had done to his sport .
It follows that Millar now has far more credibility than any other cyclist who has been through the mire of drug scandal .
A prompt confession from Landis would have spared his sport two years of SSDD .
During that time the minutiae of claim and counterclaim resembled a soap opera and , more damagingly , attempts were made to discredit the anti - doping process , providing ammunition for those who had wanted to spare his fellow American Greg LeMond a harrowing day in court in May 2007 , when LeMond revealed that a threat had been made by an associate of Landis to reveal that LeMond had told Landis of childhood sexual abuse .
Discussing the doping issue after Landis 's positive in the 2006 Tour , one high - level sports administrator suggested that cycling should go down a radical road in an attempt to combat doping .
There should , he said , be a two - wheeled equivalent of South Africa 's Truth and Reconciliation Commission .
With the incentive of an amnesty , cyclists should be able to present themselves in front of a tribunal in complete anonymity to confess what they had taken and when and how .
The results should be shown to the peloton to shock them into stopping by making them aware of the sheer blind stupidity of what they were doing .
The problem that this administrator highlighted and which the Landis episode underlines is this : there is no framework for cyclists who wish to tell what they know , to contribute to cleaning up their sport .
Anyone who wants to bring his misdeeds into the daylight will paya price – although Millar would contend that the price is well worth paying .
An amnesty , an open forum , is simply too radical a step .
When LeMond challenged Landis to confess all he knew , if he indeed had used drugs , LeMond told him he could change the sport .
Unless Landis 's allegations are fully investigated by an independent body , there is little chance of that ."
2010-05-20,"Lance Armstrong has been accused of using performance - boosting drugs in a series of detailed emails sent by his former team - mate , Floyd Landis .
Landis , the only man ever to be stripped of a Tour de France title , tested positive during the 2006 Tour and has now finally admitted using drugs throughout his career .
He has alleged that doping was sanctioned in the professional teams in which he rode and that other top American riders were involved .
According to the Wall Street Journal , Landis sent an email to Stephen Johnson , the president of USA Cycling , on 30 April , which alleged that Johan Bruyneel , Armstrong 's team director since 1999 , told him how to use steroid patches , blood doping and human growth hormone without fear of detection .
Despite repeated allegations , Armstrong has always denied doping and has never tested positive or been sanctioned by the cycling authorities .
Pat McQuaid , the head of cycling 's governing body UCI , questioned Landis 's credibility .
McQuaid said Landis is "" seeking revenge "" and holds a "" grudge "" against Armstrong and others .
In an interview with ESPN , Landis said : "" I want to clear my conscience .
I do n't want to be part of the problem any more . ""
He added : "" I do n't feel guilty at all about having doped .
I did what I did because that 's what we [ cyclists ] did . ""
The 34-year - old Landis rode for Armstrong 's US Postal Service team from 2002 until 2004 , before joining the Swiss Phonak team .
In emails sent to seven cycling officials , Landis is reported to have admitted using the banned blood booster Erythropoietin ( EPO ) , as well as steroids , human growth hormone , testosterone and blood transfusions , from 2002 onwards .
Landis said he wanted to speak out before the World Anti - Doping Agency 's eight - year statute of limitations for doping offences comes into force . ""
Now we 've come to the point where the statute of limitations on the things I know is going to run out or start to run out next month , "" Landis said .
"" If I do n't say something now then it 's pointless to ever say it . ""
Landis , who was brought up in a strict Mennonite community in Pennsylvania , won the 2006 Tour de France but tested positive for high levels of testosterone and was stripped of the title .
He protested his innocence and fought a lengthy and costly campaign before losing his case and serving a two - year suspension .
He returned to racing last year , riding for the US team OUCH .
In February , a French judge issued an arrest warrant against him on suspicion of hacking into an anti - doping laboratory computer .
The head of the French anti - doping agency , Pierre Bordry , said the judge believed Landis wanted to prove the lab where his samples were tested was wrong .
In his emails , he expressed frustration about the inability of anti - doping officials to clean up the sport , calling their efforts "" a charade "" ."
2010-05-21,"Lance Armstrong tonight launched an extraordinary counter - offensive against Floyd Landis , following the doping allegations made by his former team - mate this week .
The seven - times Tour de France winner published a series of emails on his RadioShack team 's website , purportedly between Landis , the Tour of California organiser Andrew Messick and Landis ' sponsor , Dr Brent Kay .
A statement published on the team 's website , from ' Counsel for Team RadioShack ' , explained : "" [ On ] Wednesday evening , after not getting what he demanded when no one in cycling capitulated to his numerous but persistent false threats , demands and rants , Floyd Landis publicly aired the false and incredible concoctions he has been privately making for years . ""
The statement went on to claim that Landis used the threat of making his accusations public in an attempt to land a spot on Team RadioShack for the ongoing Tour of California .
It then describes Landis , who tested positive for testosterone after winning the 2006 Tour , as "" a man who has apparently decided that since he can not be in professional racing then no one else should "" .
It continues : "" Landis accused at least 16 professional cycling individuals and organisations of activity that is baseless and quite simply untrue . ""
The statement alleges that Armstrong began to receive "" threatening text messages ... more than two years ago "" .
It goes on : "" Mr Armstrong , then , as he has now , told Landis he had nothing to hide and that he was not going to submit to Landis ' baseless threats to ' disclose ' falsehoods . ""
Earlier today it emerged that more than one investigation could result from Landis ' allegations , which included an admission that he used a cocktail of performance - enhancing drugs .
With the World Anti - Doping Agency ( Wada ) confirming that it intends to work in conjunction with the US Anti - Doping Agency in examining Landis 's claims , the case could also come under federal investigation .
In echoes of the Balco case , which led to the exposure of the drugs cheats Dwain Chambers , Tim Montgomery and Marion Jones , among others , the criminal investigations department of the US Food and Drug Administration ( USFDA ) is looking into the allegations made in a series of emails by Landis .
In the emails Landis implicated Armstrong and other former members of the US Postal Service team , which he rode for from 2002 - 04 .
Sir Craig Reedie , who sits on the International Olympic Committee 's executive board and Wada 's executive committee , confirmed , meanwhile , that Wada will deliver on its promise to investigate .
"" We can not ignore the allegations and we will try to get to the bottom of the facts by speaking to those authorities that have evidence in this case , including the USADA , "" said Reedie .
The IOC president , Jacques Rogge , called on Landis to provide evidence . ""
He has to bring proof that this is true , "" Rogge told Associated Press .
"" If he has evidence , he should make that evidence available to the USADA or UCI [ International Cycling Union ] . ""
Armstrong said today that he would not be diverted from his challenge for an eighth Tour title in July , either by the storm kicked up by Landis 's allegations or by the crash that saw him retire from the Tour of California yesterday .
Armstrong 's spokesman confirmed that he had been given the all - clear to return to training today , a mere 24 hours after the crash , in which he suffered facial and arm injuries ."
2010-05-21,"The global media expressed varying degrees of confidence in Lance Armstrong following Floyd Landis 's allegations against the seven - times Tour de France winner but shared in their response a world - weariness over the ongoing battle for cycling 's credibility .
Armstrong has fiercely denied Landis 's claims that he used performance - enhancing drugs , and the collective reaction has been to ask where the evidence is for Landis 's allegations and whether anything can ever be proven .
There is agreement that the development of new testing techniques , allied to the involvement of various global organisations such as the World Anti - Doping Agency and United States Anti - Doping Agency , could be crucial .
But Landis 's history of denial of his own drug use until now has led some to argue that his word must be treated with caution in the absence of substantiated evidence .
Bill Strickland , editor at large for the US - based Bicycling magazine , told ABC News : "" Things have n't been going well for [ Landis ] .
His racing career is suffering .
He 's admitted in public that his legal troubles [ in trying to clear his name ] have more or less ruined him financially .
This is not going to sway anyone 's opinion .
I really believe that people have their opinions of Lance , and they look for evidence to support that . ""
Commenting for Bicycling Magazine 's website , Joe Lindsey says : "" Armstrong has a long history of battling accusations of doping .
There have been many .
But in every one of these instances , Armstrong has successfully batted away the allegations .
And he may do so again .
Part of the issue is the timing .
The totality of all the circumstantial evidence is troubling .
But , spread out over a decade , it lacks weight .
Perhaps more important , Landis stubbornly proclaimed his innocence until these emails .
The logic goes that he was lying then so we ca n't trust him now . ""
"" But , "" says Lindsey , "" there are glimmers that United States Anti - Doping Agency ( Usada ) may not be the only agency looking at Landis 's claims .
Both the NY Times and the Times of London are reporting that Jeff Novitzky is involved in the investigation .
It 's not clear how Novitzky , an agent at the Office of Criminal Investigations division of the Food and Drug Administration , might be involved , but he 's best known for prosecuting Barry Bonds and others in the Balco drug scandal .
Novitzky 's purported involvement raises the stakes considerably . ""
George Vecsey writes in the New York Times that Armstrong will find it tough to escape the suspicion after his latest accuser went public . ""
This is one of those rare times that a prominent cyclist has openly incriminated an entire team and by consequence the culture of professional cycling .
[ Landis 's ] accusations sound as if he were there , "" writes Vecsey .
"" He 's loopy , but I do n't think he has the imagination to make up all this stuff .
He has now personally indicted an entire team of familiar names ...
The Usada will investigate , and federal investigators will make sure those questioned are telling the truth .
But I have no faith in organised cycling to take this on in any serious way .
No matter where it goes from here , I do n't think Lance Armstrong can break away from this one . ""
For CBS news in America , John Bentley commented : "" The question now is : can Landis prove anything he said ?
Yes , according to a doping expert .
The World Anti - Doping Agency said they would open an investigation into Landis 's allegations , and new doping detection methods will be a part of that . '
We 're getting better technology to detect prohibited substances that are abused , ' said Dr Gary Wadler of Wada .
' We 'll be able to look backwards as far back as eight years to see if at the time of a given event when the specimen was collected if there were doping agents in the urine .
Only Lance Armstrong knows if he has something to hide or not , ' he said – but he had two words of advice for those who think they may have gotten away with doping in the past . '
Athlete beware . '
""
Owen Slot in the Times hinted that Armstrong would endure . ""
Do yesterday 's allegations by Floyd Landis spell the end for Lance Armstrong ?
"" he asks . ""
Probably not .
Armstrong has had more claims of doping against him than he has won Tours de France .
This is just the latest , it is possibly the most public , arguably the most sensational and the fact that it comes from a former team - mate brings with it obvious tones of inside information . ""
However , previous cases linking Armstrong with the use of illegal drugs have contained more detail , yet been killed off in the technicalities of legal debate .
Yet they remain mere allegations , all of which Armstrong denies .
Landis admits that he has no proof bar his own testimony . ""
The International Cycling Union declared yesterday that it has no interest in pursuing the case , which is interesting given that the sport 's world governing body was implicated in Landis 's allegations .
Instead , the case has been passed on to the US Anti - Doping Agency , which has brought in Jeff Novitzky , the federal agent who was instrumental in busting the Balco doping ring .
If Landis 's claims are anything more than the vengeful ragings of a cheat , Novitzky may enjoy pursuing them . """
2010-05-22,"A tumultuous and at times surreal week for the sport of cycling began with reports in the Italian press of an investigation into "" motorised doping "" – following rumours that riders might be racing with tiny engines in their bikes – and continued today with the surprise announcement that Team Sky have parted company with their senior sports director , Scott Sunderland .
The Australian , a key figure in the Dave Brailsford - led , Sky - financed squad , cited family reasons .
He added , however , that his departure "" does not mean that I will take distance from cycling "" .
Whatever the reasons behind Sunderland 's exit , just five months into the team 's first season , it was a good day to bury bad news .
Because dominating the agenda – and overshadowing events at the Giro d'Italia and Tour of California as these two events reach their critical stages – is the continuing fallout from Floyd Landis 's allegations that the seven - times Tour de France winner , Lance Armstrong , and other top American riders had used performance - enhancing drugs .
Today the New York Times claimed that Landis , who was a team - mate of Armstrong 's for three years , but has struggled to resurrect his career after testing positive for testosterone after winning the 2006 Tour de France , had attempted to persuade other riders to confess to doping .
The Tour of California organiser , Andrew Messick , told the paper that Landis "" was trying to find other riders to come clean with him , but nobody would "" .
Messick also alleged that Landis had contacted him in early April . ""
He told me , ' I 've been living a lie .
I ca n't sleep at night .
I have to ease my burden , so I 've got to tell the truth about what I 've done . '
"" I told him two things , "" Messick continued . ""
One , none of this is new .
If you hang around cycling long enough , you hear things about riders and what they 've done .
And two , what makes you think anyone would believe you ? ""
With Landis
so far the only witness to his allegations , it is this question that seems likely to hamper any investigation .
The World Anti - Doping Agency ( Wada ) welcomed the 34-year - old 's admission , after four years of denials , that he used a cocktail of doping products and methods , including EPO , growth hormone , steroids and blood - doping , from 2002 , the year he joined Armstrong 's US Postal team .
Wada also pledged to look into his allegations concerning Armstrong and others , and a federal investigation remains a possibility , with reports that Jeff Novitzky , who helped expose Marion Jones and others in the Balco case , has interviewed Landis .
The reaction of Wada and the US Food and Drug Administration – for whom Novitzky is an agent – stood in stark contrast to that of the International Cycling Union ( UCI ) , with the world governing body 's president , Pat McQuaid , quick to dismiss Landis as "" a guy seeking revenge "" , and claiming that his allegations followed a failed attempt to "" blackmail "" the Tour of California organisers into inviting his new team .
Late last night , the affair took a surreal twist with Armstrong 's decision to publish private emails allegedly sent by Landis to Messick and others , which – claimed an accompanying statement – "" reveals a troubling , angry and misplaced effort at retribution by Landis for his perceived slights "" .
At the Giro d'Italia , meanwhile , stage 14 was won by Italy 's Vincenzo Nibali , with Bradley Wiggins an attacker on the slopes of Monte Grappa .
Wiggins moved up to seventh overall , with David Arroyo of Spain taking over the pink jersey of race leader from young Australian Richie Porte ."
2010-05-25,"Pat McQuaid , the president of the UCI , has admitted that it was a mistake in hindsight for cycling 's governing body to accept a $ 100,000 ( £ 69,000 ) donation from Lance Armstrong eight years ago .
The money was used to purchase a Sysmex machine in 2002 , a piece of equipment used to analyse blood samples , although the governing body denied any suggestion that the seven - times Tour de France winner used this in an attempt to bribe the UCI , as has been claimed by Floyd Landis . ""
To the best of my knowledge , the UCI has not accepted other donations and I 'd just like to clarify that there was only one donation from Lance Armstrong not two or three , "" McQuaid said .
"" You have to consider that at the time , in 2002 , no accusations against Lance Armstrong had been made .
They 've all came up since then .
We accepted the donation to help develop the sport .
We did n't think there 's a conflict of interest .
It 's easy to say in hindsight what could or would have been done .
You have to put yourself in the situation at the time .
"" I think based on experience , based on hindsight and 20/20 vision , and based on the claims of a conflict of interest , the UCI would be very careful before accepting a donation from a rider in the future .
Having said that the UCI is not a rich organisation and we have many demands from around the world for demands for support and material .
We will listen to anyone who can help us . ""
Last week emails from Landis were made public containing a series of allegations against Armstrong 's and other 's involvement in doping and the collusion of key figures in the sport , all of which were denied .
McQuaid added : "" The UCI take seriously the accusation that the UCI took a bribe to hide the positive test of Lance Armstrong in 2001 , "" McQuaid said yesterday .
"" We 've contacted in recent days the labs involved for testing for EPO at that time .
I have statement here from those labs that support what I am about to say … that there is no way that the UCI or its former president Hein Verbruggen could have accepted a bribe .
It 's just not possible . ""
McQuaid also revealed that he has asked the Canadian , Australian , Belgian and French national cycling federations to investigate the accusation made by Landis against the Team Sky rider Michael Barry , the Garmin - Transitions directeur sportif , Matt White , the RadioShack team manager , Johan Bruyneel , and BMC directeur sportif , John Lelangue .
McQuaid confirmed that Landis has also been placed under investigation by USA Cycling via the US anti - doping agency , Usada ."
2010-06-09,"Lance Armstrong 's RadioShack team finally found something to cheer about when Janez Brajkovic took the overall lead in the Criterium du DauphinÃ
© with an impressive stage win on Wednesday .
Slovenian Brajkovic clocked one hour , one minute and 51 seconds over 49 km from Monteux to beat Briton David Millar by 26 seconds , with twice Tour de France champion Alberto Contador finishing a disappointing sixth , 1:46 behind .
It was a day to remember for RadioShack , after Spain 's Haimar Zubeldia fractured his wrist in a massive crash in the DauphinÃ © on Monday and is almost certainly ruled out of next month 's Tour .
Last week , Sebastien Rosseler was hit by a car during training in Belgium and the Swiss is also unlikely to ride the Tour .
Brajkovic , who started the day five seconds behind Spaniard Contador , proved strong in the third - category climb to the Cote de la Roque sur Pernes , smart in the descent and steady in the final 20 kilometres .
Brajkovic , who is set to make the RadioShack squad aiming to help Armstrong win an unprecedented eighth title in the Tour , told reporters : "" I had to change bike after the climb and I lost some 30 seconds .
I was upset but
[ sports director ]
Alain Gallopin told me I was the fastest
so I continued to go full gear . ""
Contador , who is using the DauphinÃ © as part of his Tour de France preparations , was never in contention as he tried out his new time trial bike less than a month before the start of the world 's greatest cycling race .
He lags 1:41 behind Brajkovic in fourth place overall but should be able to make up some lost time in the mountains , with Saturday 's climb of the 21 hairpins to L'Alpe d'Huez .
Victory in the warm - up race to the Tour , however , is not a priority for Contador , who appeared to take no risks on Wednesday and is set to reach top form for the Tour .
Millar , who is targeting overall victory here , lies second overall , 36 seconds adrift of Brajkovic , and 14 ahead of the promising 21-year - old American Tejay van Garderen ."
2010-07-02,"When La Tour de France begins its first stage from Rotterdam to Brussels tomorrow , many of us will feel the urge to don lycra shorts , yellow jerseys and aerodynamic helmets .
But if you 're thinking of embarking on the odd road sprint in solidarity with the likes of Bradley Wiggins and Lance Armstrong , spare a thought as to whether you are insured should you have an accident .
Firstly , check your home contents insurance policy to see if you have public liability cover , which covers legal fees and court - awarded damages if a claim is brought against you in the event of an accident .
The Association of British Insurers says that even if you do have public liability cover , you should check with your insurance provider to see if your particular policy covers cycling accidents .
If you are a total amateur , you are likely to be protected ; but if you are someone who regularly enjoys time - trialing , road racing or circuit racing it 's likely that cover will be invalid unless you have added a racing extension .
Malcolm Tarling of the ABI says : "" If I was to pop out for a bike ride and crash into your car , causing damage to the vehicle , it 's highly likely that the public liability part of my home contents insurance will cover me against any claim for accidental damage â€ “
but only if I 'm a cycling enthusiast as opposed to a serious hobbyist .
"" You can also take out third party insurance to protect against collisions where you injure someone else or damage their property and some insurance companies offer third party insurance as part of their theft insurance policy .
If you are so inspired by La Tour de France that you decide to spend hundreds or even thousands of pounds on a new bike you will , of course , need to check the bike itself is covered against theft .
M&amp;S Money recently found that 27 % of cyclists have had at least one bicycle stolen in the last two years .
With the average bike valued at Â£240 , they are cash - on - wheels for thieves .
You can add a bike to your home contents policy or take out stand - alone cover .
It is often cheaper to take the first route , though you might want to check the excess and remember that some providers will not insure expensive bikes .
The London Cyclist blog last year asked its Twitter followers which company they recommended for bike insurance â€ “ M&amp;S Insurance was tipped , along with ETA Insurance .
You can also use any of the insurance comparison sites to help you choose the right insurance product for you , such as Compare the Market or Gocompare.com .
You 'll need to check if your policy covers you for theft of the bike outside your home â€ “ and if you 're really set on emulating La Tour de France riders , you might want to check if you are covered for travelling abroad with your bike .
Prevention is the best way to tackle theft or accidents .
The London Cycling Campaign has tips on how to ride safely , including advice for beginners , road positioning , and keeping your bike in a roadworthy state .
The LCC also recommends cycle training as an excellent way to improve your skills and confidence .
All London boroughs offer free or subsidised training , while the UK 's National Cyclists ' Organisation CTC offers access to the National Standards for cycle training and "" bikeability tests "" .
As for theft , the LCC offers good practical advice for what you should do : â€¢ Ideally , use two secure - rated locks for maximum security â€¢ Lock both wheels and the frame ( or wheel and frame with one lock )
â€¢ Always lock the frame to a solid object such as a bike stand â€¢
Two types of lock ( chain / cable and D - lock ) are harder to break â€¢ Remove all your bike accessories every time you leave it unattended .
And what you should n't : â€¢ Do n't leave your bike locked in a secluded location â€¢
Do n't lock it so it can be lifted over a post ( signs can be unscrewed )
â€¢ Do n't let your lock lie on or near the ground as it can be smashed â€¢ Do n't leave space inside a D - lock where tools can be inserted .
You should record the make , model and serial number of the bike in case these are needed for police records and , if your bike has quick release wheels , remember to chain up both the front and bike wheels to avoid them being stolen ."
2010-07-04,"Mark Cavendish was at the centre of controversy again today , as the first full stage of the Tour de France descended into chaos with two crashes in the last 2 km .
The stage was won by the Italian veteran Alessandro Petacchi but he was almost the last man riding as more than half the peloton was unable to contest the finish .
David Millar , the best - placed British rider in third overall , wheeled his bike over the line and
Lance Armstrong tweeted straight afterwards , "" That was Sâ€‘Tâ€‘Râ€‘Eâ€‘Sâ€‘Sâ€‘Fâ€‘Uâ€‘L ! ! ""
Overhead shots were not conclusive but Cavendish seemed responsible for the more dramatic spill , losing his balance on a tight right - hand corner and taking down Oscar Freire and Jeremy Hunt .
He climbed back on his bike , apparently not seriously injured , and pedalled to the finish with an expression that might be described as "" wistful "" .
Cavendish has had a difficult few months â€ “ both on and off the bike â€ “ and he has already attracted criticism for his uncompromising style of riding .
He was at the centre of an even more spectacular crash last month at the Tour of Switzerland , causing an avalanche of riders , one of whom fractured his elbow .
This led to a two - minute protest from the rest of the field to "" send a message to Cavendish to ask him for more respect "" â€ “ although the 25-year - old from the Isle of Man contests that this ever happened .
It is a frustrating start to the Tour for Cavendish , who appeared certain to add to his 10 stage victories , but Petacchi thinks he may have had the match of him anyway .
"" It was not unexpected for me , "" said the 36-year - old , who has won five stages of the Tour de France previously , but has not competed in the race for six years .
"" I hope I will have the chance to sprint against Cavendish again .
It was tough that he crashed but maybe I would have won anyway , as I did a great sprint . ""
And it had all been going so smoothly .
Stage one had been identified by many riders as one of the trickiest in the race .
The danger came not from the terrain , which flatlined for 139 miles , but from the wind that traditionally buffets the first section of the course , across the Zeeland polders that have been reclaimed from the North Sea .
Comparisons were made to the seemingly innocuous stage of last year 's race to La Grande Motte , where many of the main contenders were surprised by a sudden change in wind direction and lost time .
Armstrong , one of those who was not and did not , famously sniped : ""
You know what the wind is doing and you see a turn coming up , so it does n't take a rocket scientist to figure out that you have to go to the front .
"" We sat back and waited for an exciting and potentially decisive day .
In reality the stage was for the most part formulaic .
As soon as the race commissar 's flag dropped in Rotterdam , the local favourite Lars Boom made a break , quickly tailed by Maarten Wynants , a former mountain biker from Belgium , and a Spanish rider Alan PÃ

Boom , who has stage wins in the Vuelta a EspaÃ±a and Paris - Nice , is considered a promising rider but one suspects the rest of the field were happy to let them suffer out in front in temperatures that neared 30C before reeling them in for the sprint .
As the breakaway hit the polders it quickly became clear that the breeze was refreshing rather than Tour - wrecking .
By the time they reached the attractive town of Goes , where a brass band harrumphed and a church 's sign proclaimed "" Jesus loves all cyclists "" ( what , even the ones that run red lights ? ) , their lead had extended to more than six minutes .
In the pack the main drama was a ginger mutt bolting out of the crowd and unseating David Millar , Ivan Basso and Nicolas "" son of Stephen "" Roche â€ “ this happens every year , so hopefully the riders are fine , the dog is fine and we have got it out of the way for 2010 .
As the Tour moved from Holland towards Belgium , there was more animal cruelty with cows painted yellow , green and polka dot ( in honour of the race 's different jerseys ) , and the gap to the front riders started falling away in chunks .
They were finally overhauled with a little under 10 km to the line and the mind started to wander to what victory salute Cavendish would give this time .
For all the excitement of the final throes , precious little has changed in the overall standings .
Fabian Cancellara remains in yellow but Millar has had to pass on the natty green jersey to Petacchi .
Tomorrow 's stage , a 125-mile run through Belgium from Brussels to Spa , is likely to be sedate on the road and mayhem behind the barriers , as the Tour moves across arguably the world 's most obsessive cycling nation .
There are a couple of nasty climbs but most minds will be on Tuesday 's cobblestones , only the second time the Tour has braved the pavÃ © since the 1990s .
"" I think maybe another sprint tomorrow , "" said Cancellara .
"" But everybody will be thinking about the day after , which could have a big impact on the race . """
2010-07-11,"Good afternoon and welcome to theguardian.com's
coverage of stage eight of the Tour De France .
The big news today is that Lance Armstrong crashed seven kilometres into the 189 stage to Morzine - Avoriaz , along with 10 other riders including Cadel Evans , who is second overall behind Sylvain Chavanel .
It was not immediately clear whether Armstrong sustained any injuries , but he made it back to the peloton with the help of three RadioShack team mates .
2.45pm :
Armstrong has just crashed again , a little over 50 km from the finish .
His jersey is torn and he is now trying to get back to the peleton ... again .
But he is nearly 50 seconds behind them ...
2.52pm :
On Eurosport , Sean Kelly believes Lance Armstrong will be able to ease back towards the peleton before the climbers hit the 1,619 m Ramaz .
At the moment the peleton is 4m23 seconds behind a group of seven , which includes Mario Aerts ( Omega Pharma - Lotto )
Koos Moerenhout ( Rabobank ) , Benoit Vaugrenard ( Francaise des Jeux ) , Imanol Erviti ( Caisse d'Epargne ) , Amael Moinard and Sebastian Minard ( both Cofidis ) and Christophe Riblon ( AG2R - La Mondiale ) .
3 pm :
Armstong , his jersey torn and his Radio Shack grunts silently helping him on , continues to inch back to the peleton .
The gap is down to 3m35s to the leaders .
3.05pm :
This from Gary Naylor : "" Crashing is a part of cycling , but the best , in form , seem always to avoid them .
If nervous , tired or with one 's mind distracted , the falls will come .
Not the least remarkable feature of the Tour Greats ' careers is how seldom Merckx , Hinault , Lemond , Indurain and Armstrong fell off . ""
True , Gary true .
But I would n't say always : remember Armstrong crashing in 2003 when he caught his handlebar on the strap of a spectator 's bag ?
Jan Ulrich sped ahead , then slowed for Armstrong to recover , and then watched in horror as Armstrong surged past him to win the stage by 40 seconds .
3.08pm :
Lots of people are going backwards on the climb up the Ramaz , including Geraint Thomas and Jens Voight and , more surprisingly , Astana 's David de la Fuente .
3.12pm :
The gap from the three breakaway leaders - Aerts , Minard , Moerenhout - to the peleton is now down to 3m25 .
3.17pm :
Five kilometres from the summit of Ramaz , Chavanel looks to have cracked .
Wiggins is sitting comfortably behind his Team Sky team - mates .
3.20pm :
Chavanel is now over four minutes behind the leaders and a minute behind the peleton .
3.22pm :
Armstrong is losing ground too !
He 's trying to get back using the wheel of Chris Horner
but he 's blowing up !
3.25pm :
Meanwhile Gary Naylor is back .
"" The 2003 LA crash was great television ( I literally jumped out of my chair ) but LA had clearly intended to attack and so , once confident that the bike was okay , the anger he felt at his own carelessness ( for the fault was his ) drove his furious ascent .
It 's the popped collarbones that finish a Tour early , though Tyler Hamilton even beat that one - possibly with some illegal assistance . ""
Possibly , Gary ?
Possibly ?
3.27pm :
The Astana riders are pushing things on , eager to capitalise on Armstrong 's woes .
And the pace is such that Vinokourov and Kloden have dropped off too .
No one expected this ...
Wiggins is still alongside Contador in the peleton , but Armstrong is 40 seconds down .
3.28pm :
Top riders still in the peleton : Evans , Wiggins , Contador , Schleck , Leipheimer ... 3.32pm :
To the sound of ringing bells , the three breakaway leaders - Aerts , Minard , Moerenhout - go over the Ramaz , 1m55 ahead of the peleton .
There 's 34.2 km left of this stage .
3.35pm :
Lance Armstrong is now a minute behind the peleton .
3.37pm :
The peleton hit the descent .
As Sean Kelly on Eurosport points out , it will be interesting to see if Astana push on ahead of the final climb , or whether they ease off slightly which may allow Armstong to claw back some time .
3.41pm :
More from my co - commentator , Gary Naylor : "" Before the advent of EPO in the peloton , even great champions had to face at least one crisis in a Grand Tour .
The trick was to avoid losing the race on a bad day , which could be achieved through the support of the team or the strange ability to make other teams fail to attack .
LA is in a crisis now , but he has neither the team , nor passive opponents , to help him .
Expect Contador to go very hard from half way up the last climb and Evans to suck his wheel for all but the last 500 metres .
LA ?
Three minutes back and finished .
"" I 'm not sure Armstrong is quite finished ... he 's barking orders to his team - mate on the descent .
3.46pm :
As things stand , Cadel Evans will be in yellow tonight with Chavanel still going backwards .
3.51pm :
The Radio Shack team have deliberately slowed up .
They 've clearly given up the chase for the day ...
Armstrong is surely out of contention for this year 's Tour De France - the big question now is whether he 'll continue deep into this race .
3.54pm :
Armstrong is involved in his third crash of the day !
A rider in front of him wobbles over during a feed station and although he does n't crash , he tips his bike over and loses more time .
4 pm :
We 're coming up to the final climb of the day .
Astana are leading the way , and there 's 13 km to the summit .
4.03pm :
Incidentally , Aerts , Moinard , Moerenhout are still leading - with the peleton 1m36 behind and Armstrong 's group 4m02 back .
4.05pm :
Chavanel , meanwhile , is 5m05 down on the leading group ...
4.08pm : The main riders are now in the early stages of the climb to Morzin - Avoriaz .
Wiggins , who has no Team Sky members to help him out , is beginning to slip out the back .
Alberto Contador , meanwhile , is surrounded by three Astana riders and looks the picture of controlled calm .
4.11pm :
The peleton is closing the gap on the leaders ; it 's down to 54 seconds down .
Meanwhile Armstrong continues to grunt , to growl , to bite into his gums but all to no avail : he 's over five minutes behind now .
4.14pm :
More from Gary Naylor : "" Evans has to attack here .
He really lacks any instinct for Grand Tour cycling . ""
Really Gary ?
Really ?
Has Evans ever taken time out of Contador in a climb during a Grand Tour ?
And , remember , Contador has three team - mates with him .
Surely he 'd be better off trying to stick with Contador in the mountains - he has a 1m01 second lead , remember - and squeeze a little bit of time during the next time trial ?
4.17pm :
The peleton is just 31 seconds behind the lead group , with 6.8 km to go .
4.20pm :
Aerts and Moinard are about to be swallowed up with 6 km to go ...
Meanwhile the remainder of the Astana team - Contador and Navarro - are still at the front of a group of about 20 riders .
4.21pm :
Lance Armstrong is now 6m20 back .
And looking every one of his 38 years ...
4.23pm :
Schleck , Evans , Contador , Rogers , Castre are all still in the main group .
I backed Rogers to win the Tour three years ago at a huge price and was quite excited when he charged off in a mountain stage ...
and then he crashed .
4.25pm : Rogers is dropping off the back of the group , but Wiggins continues to sit midtable ...
4.26pm :
I wrote too soon ; Rogers recovers to stick with the peleton ...
but Wiggins has blown up completely with 3 km to go .
4.28pm :
Meanwhile Gary Naylor is back . ""
But that 's exactly the kind of thinking that has led Evans to fail time after time .
And not just fail - which is forgiveable - but not to give himself a chance - which is not .
If Evans went , Schleck would go too and Contador would be under pressure - and then we 'd see what he 's made of .
"" Sort of see where you 're coming from
but I do n't think Evans is good enough to attack Contador in the mountains .
Right now , he also has a 1m01 lead over him .
So why go for broke one week into a three - week tour ?
4.30pm :
Just 2.5 km to go now .
Armstrong is 7m37 behind the leaders .
4.31pm :
Kreuziger attacks !
Basso , Rogers , Rodriguez are all forced to dig in as Schleck , Contador and Hessink play cat - and - mouse at the front .
4.32pm :
Schleck attacks !
And Contador is unable to respond ...
4.34pm :
Sanchez leads with Schleck second ...
the Contador group is probably about 10 seconds back .
4.35pm :
Schleck punches his fists in the air after pipping Sanchez on the line to win in four hours 45 minutes and 11 seconds .
Contador finishes 10 seconds down , along with Cadel Evans , who will take the yellow jersey tonight .
4.37pm :
Bradley Wiggins finishes 1m45 behind ...
that 's a lot of time to lose in 3 km .
4.38pm :
Armstrong continues to rhythmically trudge towards the finish line ; face as emotive as the Terminator T-100 .
4.41pm :
Here are the overall standings after Stage 8 . 1 .

According to Schleck : "" The tactic was n't really to attack today , but this puts me in a great position .

2010-07-14,"Falling off at the foot of the Col de La Ramaz on Sunday can not have been pleasant for Lance Armstrong .
Hitting the deck at that speed never is .
And the crash effectively ended Armstrong 's chances of winning the Tour de France for an eighth time , or of managing one last visit to the podium .
But every cloud has a silver lining .
That crash and the 50 torrid kilometres that followed it could mark a turning point in Armstrong 's relationship with the French cycling public .
When Armstrong announced his comeback in 2008 , he had unfinished business .
His return to cycling was not merely about publicising his cancer work ; he did n't need to pin a number on his back to do that .
There was a sense across cycling that he wanted to ensure that when he retired a second time , he would leave people with sentiments that were rather different : "" how our sport misses him "" rather than "" what a relief he 's gone "" . ""
Return of cycling 's greatest comeback man "" has not gone to script .
Last year Armstrong earned few friends as the saga with Alberto Contador unfolded amid a welter of catty Twitter messages .
This year Floyd Landis 's email barrage and the ensuing federal inquiry have thickened the plot again .
But bizarrely , if Armstrong plays his cards right in the next few days , he could leave the sport as he would wish to .
The Texan has crashed more times this year than in all his seven victorious Tours put together .
He has lost oodles of time ( a technical term ) .
When he climbs , his legs now rotate at the speed of a windmill rather than an electric whisk .
Let 's not say it too loud but he looks old .
On Tuesday 's second Alpine stage he was well back from the leaders .
He looks human , vulnerable .
And that 's the point .
Human is what the French public has always liked .
For over 40 years , the French have had a tendency to prefer unlucky cyclists with a human side to efficient winners who sweep all before them .
That dates back to the days of Raymond Poulidor , still the most popular figure on the Tour de France , still the most sought - after autograph in the morning at the village départ .
Poulidor , famously , never wore the yellow jersey but in the race for the hearts of the public he outstripped the more clinical Jacques Anquetil , who won the Tour five times .
Anquetil was reduced to stunts such as taking on the motorpaced Bordeaux - Paris marathon a few hours after finishing the Dauphiné Libéré stage race in order to win hearts and minds , but was never loved in the way that "" Poupou "" still is .
It was the same with Eddy Merckx , the same with Miguel Indurain and it has been the same with Lance Armstrong since his first Tour win in 1999 .
There have been doubts about the Texan 's alleged use of banned drugs – always hotly denied by him and never proven – leading to shouts of "" dopé "" from the roadside but the claims against him were not at the root of the French public 's lack of love for Lance .
Nor was it due to the way he bullied Filippo Simeoni out of a possible stage win in 2004 .
It was n't even the fact that he jokingly called the French football team "" assholes "" in 2006 ( after recent events that might even strike a chord with the homme dans la rue ) .
By then the damage had been done and it boiled down to one thing : the Texan was simply too successful , too dominant .
Apart from the 2003 Tour , where he struggled due to the heat and a crash , all his victories were surgical strikes rather than guerrilla warfare .
It was powerfully , efficiently , meticulously done but once admiration for his return from life - threatening cancer had faded into the background , it all lacked romance .
And romance in cycling means one thing : having a horrible time on the bike but smiling as it happens .
So here is what Armstrong has to do in the next few days .
Work selflessly for Levi Leipheimer .
Ferry a few bottles up and down the bunch for the television cameras .
Attempt the odd coup de panache worthy of an ageing champion .
Smile for the photographers , if possible dandling his son on his knee , or if no child of his own is available , someone else 's .
Bring out the broken French he produced in 2004 .
If he sees a dog or a black cat running across the road , aim for it .
Lance
Armstrong the new Raymond Poulidor ?
You read it here first ."
2010-08-05,"Lance Armstrong faced further accusations today that he has used performance - enhancing drugs after it was reported that an unnamed cyclist had supported claims the American 's former team , US Postal Service , had been involved in "" systematic doping "" .
Detectives investigating claims that US Postal operated a doping programme have spoken to former team - mates and associates of Armstrong , and have been told the seven - times Tour de France winner knew about and encouraged doping within the team , the New York Times reported .
Armstrong has always denied using performance - enhancing drugs , saying during last month 's Tour that he would deny using drugs "" for as long as I live "" .
This year Floyd Landis , the former US Postal rider who was stripped of his 2006 Tour victory after failing a drug test , claimed Armstrong had been involved in the squad 's alleged doping and that such practices had been funded by the sales of bikes that had been used by the team .
Landis 's claims were dismissed by Armstrong , who said his former team - mate "" lacked credibility "" because of his history of first denying he had used drugs then admitting that he had .
However , the emergence of a new witness to corroborate Landis 's claims is an unwelcome development for Armstrong .
According to the New York Times , the unnamed cyclist had never tested positive for drug use but had spoken to investigators , detailing his own doping and that within the US Postal team , all of which went on with the "" knowledge and support "" of the team 's former leader .
Several other former leading cyclists , including Tyler Hamilton , serving an eight - year ban for doping , had been called before a grand jury in Los Angeles , which is considering whether there is enough evidence to charge anyone connected with US Postal with attempting to defraud sponsors by using drugs to improve performances , thereby increasing their potential marketability .
The investigation into Armstrong 's former team is being headed by Special Agent Jeff Novitzky , who was in charge of the Balco case , which led to the jailing of several athletes , including former Olympic sprint champion Marion Jones , who were found to have been using performance - enhancing drugs supplied by the San Francisco - based laboratory .
Bryan D Daly , a defence lawyer representing Armstrong , said anyone claiming his client had used drugs was not telling the truth .
"" They just want them to incriminate Armstrong and that 's my concern , "" Daly told the Times .
"" To the extent that there 's anyone besides Landis saying things , the bottom line is , if you take away the soap opera and look at the scientific evidence , there is nothing . """
2010-09-27,"Britain has sent a relatively small contingent to this week 's world road race championships in Geelong , Australia , but will start with strong medal hopes in three of the six events .
Mark Cavendish , fresh from a successful Tour of Spain , will be among the favourites for Sunday 's prestigious elite men 's road race , a title that has not had a British medallist since Tom Simpson 's triumph in 1965 .
On Wednesday morning , however , when the championships open with the men 's Under-23 time trial , the big British hope is Alex Dowsett from Essex , who has spent the year racing for Lance Armstrong 's Trek - Livestrong development squad alongside Taylor Phinney , the best young cyclist in the United States .
Dowsett won gold in the European championships time trial in July before taking , briefly , the race lead in the Tour de l'Avenir â€ “ a Tour de France for young riders
â€ “ in early September .
"" He 's won the Euro , so that 's a box ticked for him .
It 's a matter of backing it up here , "" said Rod Ellingworth , who will manage the British squad this week .
"" If he is n't in the top five something will be wrong or he will be having an off - day .
"" Not surprisingly , Dowsett is being tipped for a place at the British professional squad Team Sky next season .
The other two British medal chances will come in the road races , which start on Friday with the U-23 men 's event and continue on Saturday with the women 's race , where Emma Pooley will be among the favourites .
"" It 's a bloody hard course , "" says Ellingworth , who believes that the inclusion of a temporary bridge at the foot of the first climb "" changes the dynamic "" of the route .
"" Normally you would hit the climb at speed and use your momentum but you go round a corner , over a bridge , the riders come to a stop , then hit a wall at 15 % for 400 metres .
It is harder than people think .
"" The second climb on the circuit is longer , and partly at a gradient of 17 % .
Ellingworth feels the course will prove tough for the women 's field and that should suit Pooley , who has established herself this year as one of the major stars of women 's racing .
On the other hand , the Olympic champion Nicole Cooke has barely raced since losing her national title to Pooley in June .
Opinions are divided about how tough the course will prove for the men 's elite race on Sunday .
Ellingworth , Cavendish 's coach since 2004 , feels the inclusion for the first time of a place - to - place element in the route , with a 90 km run from Melbourne to Geelong before 11 laps of the circuit , will favour the Manxman .
"" Ninety of the 260 km is on flat roads , and that means only 11 times up the climb , rather than 16 as there might be in a normal world 's . '
Cav ' feels great , he has good form , but the second climb is quite long for him .
He will have to be at his best to finish in the front group . ""

2011-01-19,"The final international race of Lance Armstrong 's 19-year career was intended to be a relaxed swan song in the Australian sun in front of adoring crowds , but the seven - times Tour de France winner was today forced to swat away new allegations that he may have used performance - enhancing drugs .
A lengthy investigation published in the American magazine Sports Illustrated included claims that he had been found to have higher than usual testosterone ratios in 1993 , 1994 and 1996 , and suggested that his teams had maintained links with his controversial trainer Dr Michele Ferrari .
Armstrong has always denied using drugs and his spokesman Mark Fabiani called the allegations "" old news from the same , old discredited sources "" .
Asked about the Sports Illustrated story at the start of the day 's stage of the Tour Down
Under , Armstrong responded briefly with : "" I have nothing to say . ""
Armstrong said he had read the article :
"" I perused it –
there 's nothing there . ""
Pressed to give a response , the exchange became more heated as Armstrong said to the reporter who posed the question : "" What part of I 'm not commenting is not clear to you ? ""
Later , he added : "" I do n't have anything to worry about , on any level . ""
After the article appeared on Sports Illustrated 's website , the twitter feed juanpelota , which is used by Armstrong for his triathlon activities , ran a brief comment : "" that 's it ? ""
The exchanges in Australia and the Sports Illustrated report were an echo of the first time Armstrong retired from racing , after he took his seventh win in the Tour in 2005 .
A few weeks later the newspaper L'Equipe splashed the headline Le Mensonge Armstrong ( The Armstrong lie ) across its front page , breaking the story that urine samples from the 1999 Tour de France had been retrospectively tested for the blood booster erythropoietin and six samples allegedly belonging to Armstrong had tested positive .
Armstrong maintained he had never used performance - enhancing drugs and a report commissioned by the International Cycling Union ruled that no case should be brought against him .
The report said the analysis of the urine samples were conducted improperly and that they "" did not satisfy any standard for doping control testing "" .
Sports Illustrated made the Texan cancer survivor their sportsman of the year in 2002 after his fourth Tour de France win , but today the magazine ran a 10-page feature entitled The Case Against Lance Armstrong , which reviewed many of the most notable claims against Armstrong and added a little to the list .
The Sports Illustrated story was sparked off by an investigation into Armstrong by the US Food and Drug Agency , led by their agent Jeff Novitzky .
The inquiry centres on Armstrong 's US Postal Team between 1999 and 2004 , and has heard testimony from Armstrong 's former associates and some former team - mates , who have appeared in front of a grand jury in Los Angeles under subpoena .
Novitzky extended his investigation to Europe last year , linking up with French and Italian police who have looked into Armstrong and US Postal in the past , without bringing proceedings .
The most notable claim was that a letter from the drug - testing expert Don Catlin to USA Cycling in June 1999 detailing an unnamed cyclist 's testosterone testing results showed three aberrant results , one with a 9 - 1 ratio of testosterone to epitestosterone , one with a 7.6 - 1 ratio , one with 6.5 to 1 .
The cyclist was identified only by his drug - testing code numbers but , according to Sports Illustrated , "" a source with knowledge of the request says that the cyclist was Lance Armstrong .
The letter went on to detail the cyclist 's testosterone - epitestosterone results from 1991 to 1998 , with one missing season : 1997 , the only year Armstrong did not compete .
Between 1983 and 2005 , 6 - 1 was considered abnormally high but in 2005 the ratio was lowered to 4.0 - 1 .
The results were not reported as positive tests because follow - up tests did not confirm the initial result .
Armstrong has never tested positive for performance - enhancing drugs .
Sports Illustrated also claimed that when the Italian police and customs officials searched the house of Armstrong 's team - mate Yaroslav Popovych as part of the federal investigation , they found emails and texts that sources close to the inquiry believe show Armstrong 's team had contact with Ferrari as recently as 2009 .
However , Ferrari said in an interview at the end of 2009 that he was still in touch with Armstrong but "" not for technical advice .
We talk , we discuss things …
We 're friends .
"" Armstrong has said recently that he is not concerned about Novitzky , and it is not yet clear how long the FDA agent will take to complete his inquiry .

2011-02-16,"So , Lance Armstrong retires .
Again .
Befittingly , for the supreme athlete who had also made himself master of tough - love PR , it came over on Twitter @lancearmstrong before I saw it on the wires .
Because this time , "" retirement 2.0 "" as he calls it , is likely to be final as far as his career as a racing cyclist is concerned , this seems as good a moment as any for a first draft of history .
Armstrong inspires strong feelings .
To a few true believers , he is still "" Lance "" : the heroic cancer survivor , seven - time Tour de France winner , a necessary embodiment of that most American of myths – of becoming and overcoming .
To everyone else , he is a more complicated figure , and a darker one .
The world 's greatest cyclist ever , perhaps , but in an era when we know only too well that almost all performances at the apex of professional cycling were distorted by technological advances in illegal performance - enhancing drugs .
Yet , for all the allegations and ongoing investigations , Armstrong denied being a doper , and pointed to a record that showed no positive test .
And for a man not without some talent for antagonising people and making enemies , that is surprising and even impressive .
Cynics may suspect that something was about to break – or why would Armstrong retire just as a new season gets under way ?
It could be , but I doubt it .
We 've been around this block before , and Armstrong was always as stony - faced and efficient at fending off bad press as he was at dispatching his rivals on the slopes of the Alps or Pyrenees .
A good enough reason for retiring is that his results were not going to get any better , and life in the pro peloton is arduous enough without being old enough to be your rivals ' dad .
It may be as well for his brand , and the Livestrong cancer charity that rides with it , that he not diminish his reputation by over - extending his career and outstaying what welcome he has with fans .
Given his combative temperament and media control - freakery – before Lance , pro cyclists did not have or need an entourage of managers , PR flaks , bodyguards , minders and lawyers –
he was definitely more admired than loved .
But I find my own kneejerk response of "" good riddance "" distinctly tempered by memories of his extraordinary exploits on the bike , and even a sneaking regard for his comeback from the first retirement .
That was not something he needed to do ; it was something he wanted to do – and in the end , a cyclist who wants to ride his bike deserves some respect .
It worked out fine for Armstrong , in any case : he won some doubters round by riding with some dignity when he was no longer the best .
So , what now for Lance Armstrong ?
He has retired , let it be noted , with his claim to those seven Tour wins unchallenged – more than can be said for several more recent champions , disqualified after the fact .
Whatever revelations may yet follow , timing is all .
And Armstrong knows about timing his moves .
I doubt we 've heard the last of Lance : a quiet retirement sipping coffee in Mellow Johnny 's in Texas does n't seem his style .
A career in media or some sort of sports showbiz ?
Maybe not – he 's no networker :
small talk and charm hardly his strong suit .
So what do you suggest for a guy who likes to be out front and sees life as a contest ?
Given occasional outspoken sentiments ( he was against the Iraq war , even if he was chummy with George Bush ) ,
his potential to motivate himself and others , and considerable personal wealth
, I would n't rule out a run in politics .
Which party ?
It would have to be as an independent : he 's not a joiner .
He 's a winner ."
2011-05-20,"As another of Lance Armstrong 's former team - mates , Tyler Hamilton , broke cover on Friday to claim that the seven - times Tour de France winner had used banned drugs , Hamilton was supported by another whistle - blower , Floyd Landis , whose revelations a year ago sparked a United States federal inquiry into Armstrong and his former team US Postal Service that remains ongoing . ""
He 's a person that got caught in a bad situation and , although it can be hard for people to understand from the outside , I hope they try .
That 's all you can ask for really , "" Landis said .
"" For me it 's not about vindication or making a point or justifying what I did .
I feel the same sentiment in Tyler 's letter , or at least felt it a lot stronger a year ago . ""
Landis , a self - confessed doper , was referring to an open letter issued by Hamilton to cycling fans and friends , stating that he had testified for over six hours before the grand jury that is hearing witness statements in the Armstrong inquiry , and describing the relief he felt on confessing . ""
Until that moment I walked into the courtroom , I had n't told a soul .
My testimony went on for six hours .
For me it was like the Hoover dam breaking .
I opened up ; I told the whole truth and nothing but the truth .
And I felt a sense of relief I 'd never felt before – all the secrets , all the weight I 'd been carrying around for years suddenly lifted .
I saw that , for me personally , this was the way forward . ""
Armstrong has always denied any use of banned drugs .
His spokesman reiterated that the cyclist had passed almost 500 drug tests in 20 years and accusing Hamilton of changing his story to attract a publisher 's interest in a book .
Hamilton 's doping history is a murky one .
He was the 2004 Olympic time - trial champion , although that title was marred by a positive blood doping test , later overruled on a technicality .
The United States Anti - Doping Agency said on Friday that Hamilton had handed over his gold medal , after the International Olympic Committee said it could strip him of it .
The title will go to the Russian Viatcheslav Ekimov , as Armstrong pointed out in his reaction on Twitter : Congratulations to @eki_ekimov on his 3rd Olympic Gold Medal ! !
Hamilton tested positive twice for blood doping in 2004 , although only the second test – in the Vuelta a España – led to sanctions .
He was also named in the Operation Puerto blood doping inquiry inSpain in 2006 , amid allegations he had used a cocktail of substances including EPO , growth hormone , testosterone and cortisone .
He returned to racing after a two - year ban but tested positive in 2009 for the banned steroid DHEA .
Hamilton 's allegations against Armstrong came during an interview with the CBS news programme 60 Minutes , to be released on Sunday .
He is the first team- mate of Armstrong 's to allege that he actually saw the Tour winner inject a banned substance , although in his interview on CBS 's Evening News on Thursday he did not go into any more details .
It remains to be seen what effect Hamilton 's allegation will have on the inquiry into Armstrong , but another high - profile case is approaching resolution .
On Friday the Court of Arbitration for Sport confirmed that the appeal into Alberto Contador 's clenbuterol positive will take place from 6 - 8 June .
That reflects the desire of the Tour de France organisers that the case be decided before the start of this year 's race .
Contador was cleared of any offence by the Spanish Cycling Federation , which initially looked into the test result from last year 's Tour de France , but appeals were lodged by both the International Cycling Union and World Anti - Doping Agency .
If Contador loses the case , he will be stripped of his win in last year 's Tour ."
2011-05-21,"In the 11 years since journalists and judges began looking into doping allegations against Lance Armstrong , all the inquiries have fallen down on two grounds : there has been no "" smoking gun "" and no copper - bottomed witness in spite of the weight of circumstantial evidence that has built up over the years .
The allegations have always been emphatically denied and the denials have stuck .
Sparked by a federal inquiry into Armstrong 's former team US Postal Service that goes back to last August , the events of the last two days have taken the Armstrong saga – and by extension the cycling world in which Armstrong remains an influential figure – into uncharted territory .
They also provide possible insights into the direction of the inquiry , led by Geoff Novitzky , the man behind the Barry Bonds case .
On Thursday night , as part of the build - up to a showing of their investigative programme 60 Minutes , CBS released a segment of an interview with Armstrong 's former team - mate Tyler Hamilton , in which the cyclist claimed that he had seen his ex - leader use the banned blood booster erythropoietin ( EPO ) .
Hamilton did not go into details , but if he can back up the claims , this would be a new and potentially devastating piece of evidence .
On Friday , CBS reported that they had evidence that another of Armstrong 's former team - mates George Hincapie had told the federal inquiry that he and Armstrong had given each other EPO and that they had discussed the use of another banned drug , testosterone .
Unlike Hamilton and at least two other former team - mates of Armstrong , Hincapie was not interviewed by CBS – citing the ongoing FDA inquiry in which he is apparently a witness – and the television station did not name a source for their report .
Hincapie , who is currently racing in the Tour of California , said : "" I can confirm to you that I never spoke with 60 Minutes .
I have no idea where they got their information .
As I 've said in the past , I continue to be disappointed that people are talking about the past in cycling instead of the future .
As for the substance of anything in the 60 Minutes story , I can not comment on anything relating to the ongoing investigation . ""
On the face of it , Hamilton 's revelation appears the more damaging , but Hincapie could potentially be the game - changer if the CBS report is backed up .
Over the years , several witnesses have come forward to make a variety of claims about Armstrong and banned drugs : the triple Tour de France winner Greg LeMond , Armstrong 's former team - mates Floyd Landis and Stephen Swart ,
the former US Postal soigneur Emma O'Reilly , his former personal assistant Mike Anderson , and Betsy Andreu , the wife of his ex - team - mate and former friend Frankie Andreu .
The allegations have been wide - ranging , but never conclusive : needle marks on Armstrong 's arms , conversations in which Armstrong reportedly said the Tour de France could only be won using EPO , the claim that before his treatment for testicular cancer Armstrong told doctors he used banned substances .
But because they occurred largely in isolation , and did not corroborate each other , they could be rebutted ; Armstrong 's word against each witness , each claim .
Coupled with his denials of any use of banned substances and his assertion that he has never failed a drugs test , Armstrong could also make claims that undermined each witness 's evidence : personal animosity , a desire for financial gain , revenge , jealousy , or , in the case of Landis – and Hamilton – that both men lied for several years about their own drug - taking before performing dramatic U - turns .
No such assertions can be made against Hincapie , however , as Andreu pointed out to the magazine VeloNews on Friday night .
"" You ca n't find a nicer guy , a more trustworthy guy , a more respected person in the peloton .
Lance has ripped apart , attacked and shredded anybody that 's said anything against him .
I do n't know that that would work against George .
Lance has even called him ' a stand - up guy ' . ""
Hincapie is a bumbling , genial giant of a man , who has always seemed to want to keep out of the fray around Armstrong .
The pair have – had ?
– been friends for almost two decades since they began racing together at the Motorola team .
Hincapie is universally well - thought of and liked .
He has never tested positive for any banned substances , although Landis made allegations against him – which he denied – when Landis went public for the first time last May.
While Sunday 's broadcast of 60 Minutes should move the Armstrong story forward , what will happen in the longer term remains hard to predict , as it is unclear when the inquiry will close and – if the claims are well - founded
– what steps if any may be taken against Armstrong .
Hamilton 's open letter to friends and fans on Thursday , in which he explained his confession , gave an insight into the workings of the federal inquiry , on behalf of which a grand jury took testimony under subpoena from the former Tour de France stage winner .
Hamilton said he had been interviewed for six hours and that the confession he took drugs had come as a relief after years of deceit .
Novitzky 's team are giving away nothing -– and may well be annoyed that material from at least one important witness has been made public – but appear to be painstakingly building their case .
If they conclude with a joined - up series of witness statements from his former team - mates , which corroborate each other , they could undermine the defence Armstrong has built up over recent years , and it could radically alter the recent history of the Tour de France ."
2011-05-21,"William Fotheringham Lance Armstrong faced fresh allegations of doping last night when CBS News reported that one of the seven - times Tour de France winner 's closest former team - mates , George Hincapie , had told a federal inquiry into drug - taking at the US Postal Service squad that he and Armstrong provided each other with the banned blood booster erythropoietin .
A release from CBS stated that the station 's leading investigative programme "" 60 Minutes "" had learned that "" Hincapie testified that he and Armstrong supplied each other with the endurance - boosting substance EPO and discussed having used another banned substance , testosterone , to prepare for races "" .
Armstrong has consistently denied the use of banned drugs and has never failed a drug test .
Hincapie has also never failed a drug test .
"" 60 Minutes "" , which has been going since 1968 and is regarded as one of the US 's leading investigative programmes , is to broadcast an investigation into Armstrong and the use of drugs in cycling on Sunday evening .
The programme is set to include interviews with two other former team - mates of Armstrong , Frankie Andreu and Tyler Hamilton .
Hincapie will not be interviewed , his reason being the ongoing federal inquiry .
The release from CBS regarding Hincapie came 24 hours after an interview in which Hamilton admitted using drugs and alleged that he saw Armstrong use erythropoietin , the first time such an allegation has been made .
A third former team - mate , Floyd Landis , a self - confessed doper , claimed last year that Armstrong used banned drugs , with a series of detailed allegations which sparked the federal inquiry .
Hamilton said in an open letter on Friday he had been questioned for six hours under subpoena by the grand jury in the federal investigation and that it had come as a relief to him to confess .
Armstrong 's spokesman Mark Fabiani dismissed Hamilton 's allegations .
"" Hamilton is actively seeking to make money by writing a book , and now he has completely changed the story he has always told before so that he could get himself on ' 60 Minutes ' and increase his chances with publishers .
But greed and a hunger for publicity can not change the facts : Lance Armstrong is the most tested athlete in the history of sports : he has passed nearly 500 tests over 20 years of competition . ""
Regarding the Hincapie allegations , Fabiani said : "" We have no way of knowing what happened in the grand jury and so ca n't comment on these anonymously sourced reports .
"" A letter addressed to CBS was released last night on the website
Facts4Lance – launched by Armstrong this week – stating "" 60 Minutes has decided that these sensational charges are simply too good not to be true , and that it would prefer not to give Mr Armstrong a fair opportunity to confront his accusers .
That decision may make for great television but it is disgraceful journalism . ""
Hincapie said from the Tour of California in Solvang that said he did not want to talk about the "" 60 Minutes "" report .
"" It 's just unfortunate that that 's all people want to talk about now , "" he said .
"" I 'm not going to partake in any cycling - bashing .
I have done everything to be the best I can be ...
I want the focus on the future of the sport , what it 's done to clean itself up .
I believe in cycling and want to support it . ""
Hincapie later released a statement through his attorney : "" I can confirm to you that I never spoke with "" 60 Minutes "" .
I have no idea where they got their information .
As I 've said in the past , I continue to be disappointed that people are talking about the past in cycling instead of the future .
As for the substance of anything in the "" 60 Minutes "" story , I can not comment on anything relating to the ongoing investigation . ""
Landis and Hamilton made their allegations against Armstrong after several years denying that they had doped , in spite of the fact that they had both been banned for using forbidden methods of performance - enhancement , Landis for testosterone use and Hamilton for blood doping .
Hincapie is regarded as probably the cyclist within the professional peloton who is , or was , closest to Armstrong .
Their association goes back to 1994 , when Hincapie joined Armstrong 's Motorola team , and continued at the US Postal Service and Discovery Channel teams until Armstrong first retired in 2005 .
They were room - mates and Hincapie was the only team - mate to assist Armstrong in all his Tour victories .
Armstrong has described Hincapie as "" like a brother "" .
Yesterday , Hamilton returned the Olympic gold medal he won in 2004 in Athens for the time - trial .
He had tested positive for blood doping at the event , but was allowed to retain the title after the control sample to confirm the positive finding was damaged .
The title is now set to go to the Russian Viatcheslav Ekimov ."
2011-05-23,"The former US cycling professional Tyler Hamilton has made a fresh claim that the seven - time Tour de France winner Lance Armstrong not only used performance - enhancing drugs but had actually given a positive test , in 2001 .
It has always been a cornerstone of Armstrong 's defence against such charges that he had never tested positive during his career .
But this was flatly contradicted by his former US Postal team - mate Hamilton in an interview webcast by CBS 's 60 Minutes programme on Sunday .
"" I know he 's had a positive test before , "" Hamilton said .
"" For EPO [ at the ] Tour of Switzerland , 2001 . ""
Asked by the CBS reporter Scott Pelley how this alleged positive test had not been made public and no action taken , Hamilton explained : "" People took care of it .
I do n't know all the exact details
but I know that Lance 's people and the people from the other side , the governing body of the sport [ the UCI ] , figured out a way to make it go away . ""
The same allegation of a cover - up at the Tour de Suisse , shortly before Armstrong won his third Tour de France , was made last year by another former team - mate of Armstrong 's , Floyd Landis , among a series of claims about Armstrong and the US Postal team 's use of banned substances and blood - doping .
Armstrong , his team manager Johan Bruyneel and the UCI have all denied a conspiracy to suppress a positive test ; they have also denied any ulterior motive for the donations by Armstrong of $ 25,000 and a subsequent $ 100,000 , ostensibly to assist the UCI 's anti - doping work .
Earlier this month , the UCI and its former president , Hein Verbruggen , lodged a legal action against Landis in a Swiss court .
Armstrong 's lawyer , Mark Fabiani , released a statement on Sunday refuting the claims made against him on 60 Minutes . ""
Throughout this entire process , CBS has demonstrated a serious lack of journalistic fairness and has elevated sensationalism over responsibility , "" Fabiani said .
"" CBS chose to rely on dubious sources while completely ignoring Lance 's nearly 500 clean tests and the hundreds of former team mates and competitors who would have spoken about his work ethic and talent . ""
Hamilton 's testimony in the matter , however , may be more difficult for the UCI to dismiss .
Pelley reported that CBS had seen a sworn statement obtained by the FBI from the director of the Swiss laboratory that had conducted the testing for the 2001 Tour de Suisse .
In that statement , the lab director said that a UCI official had brokered a meeting between himself and Armstrong and Bruyneel – a highly irregular matter .
Asked by Pelley how he knew of the affair , Hamilton answered : "" He [ Armstrong ] told me . ""
He said that Armstrong seemed supremely confident there would be no consequences of the positive test : "" He was so relaxed about it and he kind of said it off the cuff and laughed it off . ""
The UCI under Verbruggen was frequently criticised for dragging its feet on effective anti - doping measures , despite the fact that the blood - doping agent EPO had been a known problem in the pro peloton throughout the 1990s .
But it would be a serious blow to the credibility of the sport 's international governing body if it were proved that it had connived with a rider and his manager to suppress a positive drug test .
It would also undermine the position of the UCI 's current president , Pat McQuaid , who has strongly backed his predecessor on the issue .
McQuaid addressed the issue last year at length . ""
The UCI takes seriously the accusation that [ it ] took a bribe to hide the positive test of Lance Armstrong in 2001 , "" McQuaid said .
"" We 've contacted the labs involved for testing for EPOat that time .
I have a statement here from those labs that support what I say .
"" In relation to Lausanne , there were 18 positive tests for EPO for the UCI , controlled by this lab between 2001 and 2003 : six in 2001 , four in 2002 and eight in 2003 .
All analysis was sent to IOC and the Swiss Olympic authority "" I also have a letter from Wada that states from January 2004 , every positive result for UCI also went to the Wada .
I also have a report from the Tour de Suisse from 2001 which states that there was no doping case in 2001 .
"" All this information supports what the UCI has always stated : That there is no way that the UCI or its former president Hein Verbruggen could have accepted a bribe .
It 's just not possible . ""
Responding to Thursday 's allegations of doping against Armstrong , his lawyer , Mark Fabiani , ran the same argument against Hamilton as was used last year against Landis – that both are motivated by "" greed and a hunger for publicity "" to maximise book deals .
However , Hamilton said on 60 Minutes that he had decided to come clean after being served a subpoena in June 2010 to come before the grand jury that is hearing evidence in the federal investigation led by Geoff Novitzky .
As the food and drug administration , the FBI and US department of justice investigate the case , witnesses are called to testify under oath before the grand jury , which will eventually decide if there are sufficient grounds for a prosecution for fraud of Armstrong and other associates of the US Postal team .
If Hamilton 's performance as a penitent sinner on 60 Minutes needed enhancing , that help already came .
On Friday , the Associated Press reported that another former team - mate of Lance Armstrong , George Hincapie , who , unlike Hamilton , has not tested positive for a banned substance and is still a professional rider with the BMC squad , had given evidence to the grand jury also implicating Armstrong in doping .
Hincapie denied , via Twitter , that he had spoken to 60 Minutes ; the CBS webcast on Sunday evening repeated the AP story , but shed no further light on its source .
Hamilton told 60 Minutes that having to confess to doping throughout his career to his family had been "" brutal "" , but that it had been irresistible at the time as "" part of the culture of the sport "" .
He said he had seen supplies of EPO in Armstrong 's refrigerator and had witnessed him injecting the substance "" a couple of times "" .
Hamilton also claimed that Armstrong had himself administered drops of Andriol , an oral form of the banned steroid testosterone , to Hamilton on one occasion after a race .
These practices , Hamilton alleged , were regulated by medical staff on the US Postal team , and encouraged by the management .
Favoured riders were even given special white lunch bags , Hamilton said , which contained doping products –
he said he actually felt privileged when he became one of the white lunch bag set .
Riders were carefully coached on how to dose themselves to avoid detection in tests , and used code words and "" secret phones "" – mobiles not registered in their names – when communicating about supply and transfer of doping products .
Team parlance for EPO , Hamilton said , was "" Poe "" or "" Edgar Allan Poe "" .
Armstrong has always denied ever taking performance enhancing drugs ."
2011-05-23,"Lance Armstrong faces new allegations of doping .
Have n't we heard this story before ?
Yes .
We 've been round this block many times .
And many times Armstrong and his people have denied the allegations , pointed to his record of never having tested positive , cast aspersions on the bona fides of those making the accusations , and taken legal action if necessary .
He is the seven - time winner of the Tour de France , not a dope cheat , and it would be unwise to suggest otherwise .
That is certainly the view of Lance Armstrong that pertains among the vast majority of the American public , and internationally , too .
To these millions , Lance Armstrong is the inspirational cancer survivor who came back virtually from the dead and claimed the cycling world 's most coveted title an astonishing seven consecutive times .
He is an all - American hero , who has used his fame to raise millions for fighting cancer .
He has become a brand that 's far bigger than professional bike racing .
How many people who 've worn a yellow Livestrong wristband do you suppose have even heard of Tyler Hamilton or Floyd Landis , who , unlike Lance , have been busted for doping and are now hawking to publishers their tawdry tales of pills and syringes in the peloton ?
But there is now a big difference , potentially .
Tyler Hamilton 's allegations on CBS over the weekend are , he would have us believe , the same testimony he has given under oath to the federal investigation 's grand jury , which will decide whether there is sufficient evidence to launch a prosecution of Armstrong and his associates on the US Postal team for fraud – that is , taking federal funding under false pretences ( by being sponsored to race and win clean , when , in fact , they were using performance - enhancing drugs ) .
More credible than Hamilton , George Hincapie , another long - time team - mate of Armstrong 's , is also reported to have testified before the grand jury that the team was doping .
Armstrong 's lawyer has issued denials of these new allegations .
The game - changer here is that the justice department and FBI have the powerful weapon of subpoenaing witnesses and compelling them to testify under oath .
Few former professional racing cyclists , recently retired , with young families , a little anxious about their investment portfolios and thinking about what to do next after 15 years in the saddle , are going to be willing to risk a charge of perjury out of loyalty to associates in a sport
they 're no longer in .
There is a larger question raised by this latest episode , which has involved an allegation – strongly denied by the parties accused – that cycling 's governing body , the UCI , was involved in a backroom deal in 2001 between Armstrong , his manager and a Swiss laboratory to suppress a positive test for the blood - doping agent EPO .
And that question is : given the persistence of cycling 's apparent issue with doping , is its governing body sufficiently independent and possessed of the political will to police the problem ?
All the really big systemic busts in cycling have been not by anti - doping authorities , but by old - fashioned police work : the Festina scandal in 1998 , the Operación Puerto investigation of 2006 - 2007 , and now – maybe – the feds in the US .
And this is an issue that goes beyond cycling : in the US , baseball 's name has just been dragged through the mud by evidence heard in the Barry Bonds trial .
Bonds , who holds the record for the most home runs ever hit , has been convicted of obstructing justice in a trial over illegal performance - enhancing drugs and faces a prison sentence .
It is Bonds ' nemesis , agent Jeff Novitzky , who is now investigating Lance Armstrong .
What Armstrong is to the American public in cycling , so was Bonds once for baseball ."
2011-05-26,"A few years ago , when I first started taking an interest in professional cycling , I remember being very surprised to learn that the Tour de France was a team competition .
I had no idea that Lance Armstrong could never have won the race without the help of his loyal domestiques , and that sprinters like Mark Cavendish usually need a lead - out man if they are to cross the line first .
In my innocent mind , bike riding was a solo pursuit .
That 's what Ned Boulting thought too .
It 's an easy mistake to make , and perfectly forgiveable - unless , of course , you 're about to become the new roving reporter for ITV4 's Tour de France coverage .
But that 's not the only faux pas Boulting made when he found himself catapulted from the familiar world of football to the alien cycling scene back in 2003 .
It got far worse .
On his debut appearance , he recorded a piece to camera about the British cyclist David Millar "" kissing goodbye to the yellow jumper "" after technical problems on the first stage time trial .
It 's this howler which gives the title to Boulting 's enormously enjoyable memoir .
How I Won The Yellow Jumper is a romp through Boulting 's eight years following le grande bouclé , which describes his transformation from a blundering know - nothing - described by one TV critic as "" the Monty Don of cycling ... determined to dumb everything down "" - into a Tour fixture alongside legends like Phil Liggett , Paul Sherwen , Chris Boardman and Gary Imlach .
The book starts like a two - wheeled take on Toby Young 's great
How To Lose Friends And Alienate People , albeit told by an infinitely more charming narrator , as Boulting details a catalogue of errors he made when starting the job .
As a relatively new Tour devotee , I always thought of him as a no - nonsense , effortless pro , so it 's rather sweet to read about the inferiority complex he developed working alongside some of cycling 's true giants .
I loved the passage when he describes his pride the first time a viewer writes into the show to ask his , rather than just Liggett 's , opinion on whether Armstrong could win the Tour on his comeback in 2009 ( no chance , said Boulting , and he was right : the Texan placed third . )
Anyone else who cancels all 7 pm appointments for three weeks in July in order to watch ITV4 's Tour highlights will enjoy the behind - the - scenes gossip - how Liggett even commentates his breakfast and can never remember Boulting 's name , how the ITV team come to refer to Lance Armstrong as "" Larry "" ( and his then girlfriend Sheryl Crow as "" Shirley "" ) and the story of the day Boardman phones up Boulting 's dad when his whole family forgets his birthday .
There is plenty of insight too into the tour 's bigwigs , with chapters on Armstrong , Cavendish , Millar , Bradley Wiggins and Team Sky , as well as an introduction to off - camera heroes , such as the man in charge of the Tour 's chemical toilets .
My favourite passages , however , are those when Boulting describes those little things that illustrate his transformation from a cycling ignoramus into a full - on Tour fanatic .
At one point Boulting describes how he becomes helplessly drawn to Caisse d'Epargne cash machines when looking for an ATM in France , simply because the bank sponsors a Tour team .
Just the other week I got a daft thrill when I arrived at a hotel in Munich to see that Saxo Bank were holding a conference in the ballroom - Saxo Bank being the old team of the Schleck brothers from Luxembourg , whose fraternal love has warmed the hearts of many who have watched them care for each other in the peloton .
The only real problem with the book is that it 's making me wish away the start of summer and fast - forward to 2 July and le grand départ .

The last one was won by Brazil , although the goal of the tournament was a delicious chip from Lionel Messi against Mexico .
Argentina are the hosts this year and will be desperate for victory having not won the competition since 1993 .
Maybe because they 've had players who can miss three penalties in one game .
Unsurprisingly Argentina and Brazil tend to win , although Uruguay stunned the latter in 1995 and Colombia caused a shock in 2001 .
It 's not really a contest when Brazil have players like Ronaldo and Ronaldinho though .
Oh , and how could we forget the splendidly chippy , nasty and downright brutal 1987 final between Uruguay and Chile ?

2011-08-23,"There are very many joys associated with bicycling , but getting wet is not one of them .
Only masochists enjoy cycling in the rain - Lance Armstrong once said that he liked riding in poor weather because he knew his rivals hated it .
Well , I 'm not a Tour de France cyclist
and I 'm not ashamed to say it gives me no pleasure at all to arrive at my destination as damp as a dishcloth .
Given my aversion to public transport , however , I do very often have to ride in the rain .
And when I do , I want to have a coat that will keep me dry and look nice .
The dreaded cagoule has its place , yes .
I always have one stuffed in the back pocket of my jersey if I 'm out on my road bike ( just in case ) .
But what I 've been after for ages is a grown up coat that transfers from the saddle to the street without people wondering if I 've got lost on an orienteering adventure .
I 'm therefore delighted to report that the Water Off A Duck 's Back lady 's mackintosh is very nearly The One .
It comes in two colours - cream and black .
I chose the black one because I figured it would need washing less often .
The coat has no buttons but has enough material in the full skirt that when you tie the belt , your lap and legs will stay dry ( though you 'll get a wet décolletage ) .
There 's a detachable hood which I did n't use much - it was a bit
Scottish Widows for my liking , plus it 's dangerous cycling in a hood because it obscures your view when you turn around .
It only really worked , aesthetically and practically , when I was riding my Dutch - style bike .
In the run - up to my summer holiday cycling in the Alps I was razzing around on my racer and looked pretty ridiculous hunched over my handlebars with this coat on - plus the long skirt was liable to get stuck in my spokes .
But on my secondhand city bike with skirt guard and step - through frame , it was just the ticket .
Water Off A Duck 's Back is a British brand which aims "" to create coats that look like chic regular coats but that have hidden qualities "" .
The really clever thing about this mac is its secret reflectivity .
If you unroll the cuffs , a wide reflective strip is revealed , and if you turn the belt inside out , that too will glow in the dark .
I thought it was very nifty , and much more palatable to me than a luminous yellow number .
It 's not cheap , of course - but £ 130 is not at all bad for a coat you can wear both on and off the bike , especially given that it is made in London ( Kentish Town ) , rather than the Far East .
It was n't perfect .
As a bit of a titch ( 5'4 ) , the coat was a little long on me .
But Antonia Maybury , the woman behind the brand , tells me she is in the process of bringing out a shorter length alternative .
I also found it too warm as soon as the temperatures reached 20c - but it would be perfect for autumn or spring cycling .
It 's quite bulky to stuff in a pannier too .
All in all , though , it 's a good looking , practical purchase .
Recommended .

2012-02-06,"The long struggle to connect Lance Armstrong with doping finally came to an effective halt on Friday afternoon with the announcement that the federal investigation into the seven - times Tour de France winner has been abandoned after the best part of two years .
It feels like the end of an era , if not the end of the connection between bike racing and illegal performance enhancers , as could be seen by yesterday 's conclusion to the long - running Alberto Contador affair , in which the Spaniard was stripped of his 2010 Tour win and given a two - year ban .
But Armstrong 's historic series of victories in the biggest of all bike races – the only one with a recognition factor among the general public – will stand for ever in the record books , alongside the five wins of the late Jacques Anquetil , the man who said : "" You do not win the Tour de France on mineral water alone , "" a brusque acknowledgement of behaviour that had been accepted since the earliest days of the sport .
Half a century ago , Anquetil rode in an era when riders took all sorts of stuff including amphetamines , cocaine and heroin , to make them go faster and increase their resistance to the terrible pain of hauling themselves up the mountains for day after day .
History accepts those circumstances , to the extent that no one would wish to see the record books retrospectively altered to expunge the records of men who are universally regarded as heroes of a more romantic age .
It could be that Armstrong , who competed at a time when the use of steroids and human growth hormone and the technique of blood doping were at their most widespread , may become the subject of a similar moral amnesty in the mind of future generations : whether he did it or not ( and he has always emphatically denied the accusations and never tested positive ) , pretty well everyone else was at it , those were the times he lived in , and his achievements were immense by any standards , never mind by those of a man who had recovered from a near - fatal brush with cancer .
But it is not quite as simple as that .
Doping was not outlawed in Anquetil 's time ; he was breaking no rules .
Since the death of Tom Simpson in 1967 , attitudes have changed and hardened , particularly since the introduction of sophisticated doping products whose long - term effects could only be guessed at .
The isolated death of a man fuddled with amphetamine and alcohol and over - exerting himself in furnace - like conditions on the exposed slopes of the Mont Ventoux was one thing .
A group of young riders dying in their sleep 20 years ago , their hearts no longer able to pump their artificially thickened blood through their veins , is quite another .
Tolerance of the old ways belongs to the old days ; it has no place in the present , and a serial offender such as Riccardo Riccò is held in general contempt .
Nor , despite the remarkable story of his recovery from surgery to brain , lungs and testicles , did Armstrong 's personal behaviour encourage the sort of sympathy so freely granted to Anquetil and the men with whom he raced .
The Texan 's persecution of those who campaigned against doping is a permanent stain on his reputation .
"" Do n't spit in the soup "" is a motto that has long outlived any conceivable justification .
The announcement of the dropping of the case against Armstrong came from the US Attorney 's office in Los Angeles , and reminded us that its primary purpose was not to prove that the rider had doped .
In the US , sports - related doping is not a federal crime .
The effect of doping is the issue , and in Armstrong 's case an attempt was being made to discover if sponsorship money provided by a US government body had been used to subsidise a doping programme by his US Postal team .
Fraudulent misuse of federal funds would have been the crime , rather than cheating in order to distort competition .
The appointment as lead investigator of Jeff Novitsky , who cracked the Balco case involving Marion Jones and investigated the baseball stars Barry Bonds and Roger Clemens , suggested that the truth , whatever it was , would finally be established .
No one expected 20 months of intense work to be abandoned so suddenly and – to many eyes – inconclusively , with Novitsky 's office apparently still in the process of setting up appointments for further interviews .
The decision seems to have been made on a cost - benefit basis .
Even with testimony from such former team - mates as Floyd Landis , himself stripped of a title for drug use , and Tyler Hamilton , both of whom told Novitsky they had seen Armstrong doping , a court hearing would have been lengthy and expensive for the government and its outcome uncertain .
Why spend all that money on an effort to bring down a national hero , particularly one whose own legal armoury is equally well stocked ?
It would have been nice to have established the truth , either way , and put it beyond further dispute .
A suggestion that the US Anti - Drug Agency will continue the pursuit seems unrealistic .
Novitsky had the resources but could not find the incontrovertible evidence that went beyond a matter of one man 's word against another 's ( or , in the case of Emma O'Reilly , the former US Postal masseuse who told her story to David Walsh and Pierre Ballester , the authors of LA Confidentiel , one woman 's word ) .
Case closed , then .
There will never be a smoking gun , or a dripping syringe .
We are left to examine our own conclusions , and to wonder how it really feels to be Lance Armstrong .

2012-03-16,"Forget Lance Armstrong and his tidy seven victories in the Tour de France .
Between 1961 and 1978 , Eddy "" the Cannibal "" Merckx won 525 races , including five Tours de France , four Giros d'Italia and three world championships .
He began his season in February and ended in October , a mess of saddle sores and cracked vertebrae .
Unlike Armstrong , Merckx never saved himself for a particular event .
If he went four days without winning a race , he would become depressed and say to his trainer : "" I have n't won anything for a while .
"" The son of a grocer in a Brussels suburb , Eddy was a shy and sensitive boy .
He cried when his younger brother and sister told him that Père Noël did not exist ; he cried when his teammates mocked him for liking rice pudding with flavoured syrup ; and he cried when he discovered that the world of professional bike racing was rotten to the core .
In the closed shop of Flemish riders ( to be precise , riders from West Flanders ) , he was an outsider : a Flemish boy who had grown up speaking French .
This is why he later became an icon of Belgian national unity and was often seen knocking back a few beers with his friend King Baudouin I.
Even ignoring the syringe - wielding soigneurs who stuffed their protégés with amphetamines – a subject almost totally absent from William Fotheringham 's admiring biography – the cycling establishment was as ruthless as a dogfighting cartel .
In 1964 , young Eddy was diagnosed with a heart defect and dropped from the Belgian team competing in the world road championships .
The problem , it turned out , was not his heart but corrupt selectors and dodgy doctors .
His solution was to win races so convincingly that no one would dare to leave him out .
Anyone who enjoys the three - week - long soap opera of the Tour de France , and the complex meshing of tactics and personalities , would do better to read Fotheringham 's fascinating biography of the British rider Tom Simpson , Put Me Back on My Bike .
Merckx 's style of racing could be summed up in two rules :
1 . accelerate ; 2 . keep going and do n't look back .
Expert analysis of the Merckxian philosophy provided by Fotheringham 's many interviewees amounts to this : "" Mostly , he relied on pure power , "" "" There were no tactics with Merckx "" .
He would escape from the peloton with 100 km to go , powering off into the sleet and the wind , elbows flailing with the effort , and not be seen again until the podium .
Sometimes , the gap was so huge that the rider who came in second thought he 'd won the race .
In the Marseille stage of the 1971 Tour de France , spectators and camera crews were eating lunch , looking forward to the afternoon 's entertainment , when "" the Cannibal "" shot across the deserted finish line , 90 minutes ahead of schedule .
This needless annihilation of his rivals , according to Fotheringham , was a result of Merckx 's insecurity .
He could never be absolutely certain that the gap was big enough .
A puncture , a stray dog , one of the thousands of spectators who hated him for winning everything – any microscopic event might prevent a victory .
To a fan who follows his favourite 's nail - biting defence of a 10-second lead , this might sound perfectly sensible , but it is highly unusual in professional cycling .
People who race down icy mountain roads at 70 mph with a broken collar - bone tend not to be worriers .
Merckx left nothing to chance .
He was one of the first riders to take a "" scientific "" approach to racing .
In those days , it did n't take much to be seen as a velocipedal Einstein .
Even today , there are professional cyclists who could n't change an inner tube or realign a brake block .
Merckx was widely admired for carrying his own Allen key to make small adjustments to the height of his saddle .
He obviously loved the machine on which he spent most of his life .
He was said to have dismantled a bicycle just to find out how many components it had ( 1,125 ) .
Fotheringham 's aim in writing this book is to answer two questions : ""
How ? ""
and "" Why ? "" .
He comes closest to answering the first in a stirring description of the 1971 Tour de France .
The Spanish rider Luis Ocaña had opened up an apparently unassailable lead of almost nine minutes .
For the next few days , Merckx continued to claw back the seconds as though he expected Ocaña to crack .
Every evening , he made mildly disparaging remarks about his rival to the press .
Then came the Pyrenees .
Descending the Col de Menté in a thunderstorm , both riders crashed .
Merckx leapt back on his bike with a bruised knee , crashed again and finished the stage .
Ocaña gave up .
There was nothing seriously wrong with him , but , as he later wrote : "" My fear became panic , and I felt I was dying . ""
Merckx went on to win his third Tour .
This devastating combination of muscle and manipulation is strongly reminiscent of Merckx 's friend Lance Armstrong .
A small number of cyclists seem to have such a will to win that they wear down the opposition simply by existing .
Which leaves the second question , "" Why ? "" .
Fotheringham quotes various opinions expressed by cycling sages in that Homeric , comic - book style once beloved of French journalists : "" He rides for the pleasure of glory …
He earns money but his soul has remained pure "" ; "" He is going to sleep in the purple cradle where living Gods are born "" .
The most convincing answer comes from Claudine Merckx , wife of the taciturn , grumpy champion : "" Eddy never looked for glory .
He just wanted to be at peace with himself . ""
Writing a biography of Merckx is something of a sporting feat in itself .
The endless string of victories leaves Fotheringham panting in the tyre tracks of his hero , and he has little more to offer at the end of his scrupulously researched book than exhausted clichés : "" The like of Merckx will not be seen again .
Cycling and sport may well be the poorer for it . ""
Merckx is evidently a courteous and generous man .
When Fotheringham interviewed him in 1997 , "" the greatest cyclist in the world "" went to meet him at the airport and waited "" for my delayed flight with no sign of impatience , let alone annoyance "" .
For anyone who had known "" the Cannibal "" in his hungry prime , it might have been a disappointment .
Few sights in sport are more horrible than a cyclist at the end of a hard race : "" When he got off his bike , his jerky gestures , livid skin , strangely focused look , his eyes sunk too far into his skull and the tic on one cheek twitching gave him the look of a madman .
He was frightening to see . ""

2012-06-13,"Another round of dramatic headlines over doping allegations against Lance Armstrong , this time occasioned by the US anti - doping agency , USADA , sending a 15-page letter to Armstrong , and others , charging extensive use of â€ “ indeed , a conspiracy over â€ “ performance - enhancing drugs .
The Washington Post appears to have obtained a copy of the letter , the rest of the media is following its lead .
USADA is a part federally funded agency overseeing anti - doping in the US Olympic movement , but it has the power to suspend athletes from competition ( as it has already now with Armstrong , 40 , who will be barred from his present schedule of triathlon appearances ) , to bring charges ( though not criminal charges ) in a hearing .
Depending on the outcome , it may strip an athlete of his or her titles .
So , what is at stake , potentially , is the full set of Armstrong 's seven consecutive Tour de France victories ( 1999 - 2005 ) .
The USADA letter accuses Armstrong of participating in an organised doping program , administered , it is alleged , with the aid or knowledge of Armstrong 's long - time team manager Johan Bruyneel and Italian trainer Dr Michele Ferrari .
The banned drugs listed by USADA includes practically everything in the dope cheat 's cabinet bar aspirin : ""
[ T]he blood booster EPO , blood transfusions , testosterone , human growth hormone , corticosteroids , and saline and plasma infusions to boost his performance or mask his use of banned substances .
"" I am not an expert in the long and tortured history of these allegations , but it looks to me as though most of this stuff relies on statements made by former teammates such as Floyd Landis and Tyler Hamilton , or may be based on testimony given to the grand jury investigation ( which finally closed without resulting in any prosecution of Armstrong ) .
In other words , we knew this already â€ “ and whom we chose to believe was a matter of conscience .
The new element appears to be that USADA has samples taken from Armstrong during his Tour de France comeback appearances in 2009 and 2010 , which it claims are "" fully consistent with blood maÂ­nipuÂ­laÂ­tion including EPO use and/or blood transfusions "" .
Not needless to say , Lance Armstrong denies all allegations and charges .
His statement makes the point about the justice department 's dropped case and characteristically flames USADA with a flourish : These are the very same charges and the same witnesses that the Justice Department chose not to pursue after a two - year investigation .
These charges are baseless , motivated by spite and advanced through testimony bought and paid for by promises of anonymity and immunity .
Although USADA alleges a wide - ranging conspiracy extended over more than 16 years , I am the only athlete it has chosen to charge .
USADA 's malice , its methods , its star - chamber practices , and its decision to punish first and adjudicate later all are at odds with our ideals of fairness and fair play .
But about those 2009 , 2010 samples , nothing specific â€ “ beyond his pro forma denial .
So , how significant is USADA 's move ?
Do the new charges mean Armstrong 's Tour titles really are at risk ?
My best guess right now : do n't bet on it .
First , the technology for detecting blood - doping is constantly evolving , but it seems strange that USADA has only now discovered that its samples suggest evidence of cheating .
Second , samples "" fully consistent with "" seem to leave a fair bit of wiggle - room for scientific argument ; it does n't immediately appear to offer the kind of stone - cold proof of doping one would assume would be required to rip down those seven framed yellow jerseys from Armstrong 's rec room wall .
And finally , when did we ever see Armstrong roll over and cop a plea ?
He has already given notice that he 'll fight this round of accusations , just as he 's seen off every one before .
The odd thing is that with each succeeding battle against assorted doping agencies , federal investigators , judicial authorities , and former teammates who 've "" turned "" and talked to the media , his stock retort of "" vendetta "" actually starts to sound less hollow .
There is almost the weird effect of his gaining credibility , the longer this all goes on .
Like many others , I felt I knew all I needed to about Lance Armstrong long ago .
Perhaps it 's time to let him keep his Tour titles , and move along .
I want clean , dope - free cycle sport now .
Scrubbing obsessively at supposed stains of the past is doing nothing for that ."
2012-06-14,"Lance Armstrong could be stripped of his record seven Tour de France victories after the US Anti - Doping Agency charged him and five associates over alleged doping violations .
Armstrong was banned from competition with immediate effect , including from the triathlons in which he has been competing since his second retirement from professional cycling early last year .
Armstrong has spent almost a dozen years fighting off allegations of doping , and as the 2012 Tour comes into view he is facing potentially his most significant battle yet .
This is the first time he has been formally charged by a national anti - doping body .
The USADA confirmed in a statement that it had brought charges against Armstrong and five other individuals â€ “ none of them riders â€ “ who had worked for the US Postal Service team , for which Armstrong raced between 1998 and his initial retirement from cycling in 2005 .
The USADA statement said : "" In response to numerous inquiries regarding the public statements made by Mr Lance Armstrong , we can confirm that written notice of allegations of anti - doping rule violations was sent yesterday to him and to five additional individuals all formerly associated with the United States Postal Service ( USPS ) professional cycling team .
These individuals include three team doctors and two team officials .
This formal notice letter is the first step in the multi - step legal process for alleged sport anti - doping rule violations . ""
The USADA charges are not criminal but the agency can ban athletes and revoke titles .
Armstrong had earlier issued a statement on his website which stated his innocence of doping , and attacked the agency 's action .
"" I have been notified that USADA , an organization largely funded by taxpayer dollars but governed only by self - written rules , intends to again dredge up discredited allegations dating back more than 16 years to prevent me from competing as a triathlete and try and strip me of the seven Tour de France victories I earned . ""
Armstrong 's first Tour victory dates back to 1999 , and his last to 2005 .
Although the World Anti - Doping Agency 's statute of limitations for amending results is eight years , USADA ruled this year that this can be overturned in specific cases .
That applied in the case of the runner Eddie Hellebuyck , who confessed to doping dating back to 2001 and , in February this year , was stripped of his results from that date following a ruling by the American Arbitration Association .
Armstrong has been the subject of several inquiries relating to alleged doping , most recently an US Federal government inquiry headed by the Food and Drug Agency investigator Jeff Novitsky .
That inquiry , centred on allegations of fraud , was abandoned in February after nearly two years , with no charges brought , after which the USADA stated that it would continue its own inquiry .
Armstrong 's statement highlighted the link between the two inquiries , reading : "" These are the very same charges and the same witnesses that the Justice Department chose not to pursue after a two - year investigation .
These charges are baseless , motivated by spite and advanced through testimony bought and paid for by promises of anonymity and immunity .
Although USADA alleges a wide - ranging conspiracy extended over more than 16 years , I am the only athlete it has chosen to charge .
USADA 's malice , its methods , its star - chamber practices , and its decision to punish first and adjudicate later all are at odds with our ideals of fairness and fair play . ""
Armstrong has maintained he achieved his seven victories in the Tour de France without the use of banned drugs , and all the inquiries into alleged doping over the years by him and his team have ended up being abandoned , beginning with a French prosecutor 's probe in 2000 and concluding with the FDA inquiry this year .
His statement closed with : "" I have never doped and , unlike many of my accusers , I have competed as an endurance athlete for 25 years with no spike in performance , passed more than 500 drug tests and never failed one .
That USADA ignores this fundamental distinction and charges me instead of the admitted dopers says far more about USADA , its lack of fairness and this vendetta than it does about my guilt or innocence . """
2012-07-02,"Questions had been asked of Mark Cavendish before this week but as so often he had an emphatic answer : in this case the 21st Tour de France stage win of his career in the grand manner .
Forced to function without the "" train "" of dedicated domestiques who helped him win most of the first 20 stages of his career , the Manxman won solo : he glued himself to the wheel of the German AndrÃ © Greipel in the final kilometre then clawed his way past his former team - mate to take the win by less than half a wheel .
If Cavendish has indeed sacrificed a little finishing speed in his quest to become Olympic road race champion in London , as he says he has , he clearly remains more than rapid enough .
This was a chaotic sprint , which got going only with 3 km remaining after a lengthy east - west run through Wallonia which took longer than scheduled into a moderate south - westerly breeze .
Greipel 's Lotto - Belisol team made the running , with the former Sky sprinter Greg Henderson setting the pace until the final metres .
Finally Cavendish emerged for the head - to - head with Greipel , the German on the left , the Manxman on the right , with the next man , Matt Goss , several lengths behind .
It was not as seamless as in the past , when Mark Renshaw set the pace for Cavendish , but in its way it was just as spectacular .
In a way , said Cavendish , the fact that he does not have a team devoted to him means he "" was probably under the least pressure I 've ever been .
In the past , with a full team working for me , I 'm expected to win most of the time .
Here I was like ' let 's give it a shot , see what happens .
If I do n't win , we 've got bigger things to try for . ""
Indeed at 5 km to go he told Bernhard Eisel , his "" watchdog "" , to let him ride his own race , because he felt that with only one rider working for him it would be harder than if he simply looked after himself : fewer decisions to make , only his own skin to worry about , and no risk that he might tire out one domestique by making him hold the pace of entire teams .
Surprisingly , given how hectic Tour sprints are , Cavendish has instant recall of what goes on , and afterwards he described coming from 20th place back at 600 m to go , first taking the wheel of the former world champion Oscar Freire "" because he always surges late "" .
Next he dodged between the South African Daryl Impey and his former team - mate Matt Goss as the pair made their move and finally moved behind Greipel as Henderson surged , leaving a gap between the German and the stage one winner Peter Sagan â€ “ all this at 40 to 45 mph in the space of perhaps 30 seconds .
This was the first Tour stage win of Cavendish 's career outside France and it takes him to one behind Lance Armstrong and AndrÃ © Darrigade in the all - time rankings , led , of course by Eddy Merckx .
He has a good chance of catching those two in the next few days â€ “ perhaps as early as Wednesday 's stage into Rouen â€ “ and beyond that there is AndrÃ © Leducq , who has 25 stage wins to his name .
As for the green jersey , Cavendish was emphatic afterwards that the sole objective at Sky is yellow for Bradley Wiggins but he again snaffled a few points in the intermediate sprint , where he was sixth , and is now second in the points competition , although for the moment it is clearly being targeted by Sagan , who finished sixth here .
Monday was relatively routine â€ “ doomed escape , tricky sprint â€ “ but Tuesday 's leg into Boulogne could be far more taxing than Sunday 's opener , with a series of six short climbs in the final 35 km .
The little hills are on back roads that constantly twist and turn , rise and fall to the south - east of the port and , as ever when the organisers plan a tactical "" moment "" of this kind , the damage could well be done on the run - up .
The contest to gain and maintain position at the front of the bunch before the climbs will be intense and could lead to crashes and punctures while the narrow roads , climbs and corners mean it will be hard for team cars and domestiques to support their leaders .
There was a hint of what might await one team or more when Sky had their hiccup en route to the climb at Seraing on Sunday , when it took only a puncture and a crash involving three of their riders to leave Wiggins exposed , albeit only briefly .
Cadel Evans and company will have taken note and could well attempt to turn the screw ."
2012-07-05,"The war of words between Lance Armstrong and the US Anti - Doping Agency intensified after the Dutch newspaper De Telegraaf named five former team - mates of the Texan at the US Postal Service team as having given evidence to the anti - doping body .
Usada issued a statement saying : "" No individual cases have been finalised and any attempt to guess at whom potential witnesses might be only leads to inaccurate information being reported and subjects those named to unnecessary scrutiny , threats and intimidation . ""
Armstrong , seven times a Tour de France winner , has always denied use of performance - enhancing drugs and he responded by attacking the investigation . ""
So let me get this straightâ€ ¦ come in and tell them exactly what they wanted to hear
and you get complete immunity AND anonymity ?
I never got that offer .
This is n't about [ Usada CEO Tyson ]
Tygart wanting to clean up cycling ; rather it 's just a plain ol' selective prosecution that reeks of vendetta . ""
Since it was revealed in mid - June that Armstrong faced formal doping charges speculation has been intense over the identity of the 10 witnesses cited by Usada in its case against the Texan and how their evidence was obtained .
His five former team - mates named as having given evidence are present on the Tour de France .
David Zabriskie and Christian Vande Velde are racing here for the Garmin - Sharp team , which is directed by another former Armstrong team - mate Jonathan Vaughters , while the other two cyclists named are the overall contender Levi Leipheimer , who races for Omega - Pharma Quick - Step , and the veteran George Hincapie , who rides with Cadel Evans at BMC .
Reports that the riders have been offered six - month suspensions for doping offences in a deal for providing evidence against Armstrong were strongly denied by Vaughters on Thursday , who said that , as far as his riders were concerned , "" the report of any six - month suspensions is completely untrue "" .
He did , however , say in a statement that riders with the Garmin - Sharp team were expected to cooperate with anti - doping bodies if asked to .
Leipheimer and Hincapie were asked about the allegations at the start of Thursday 's fifth stage of the Tour from Rouen to Saint - Quentin .
Leipheimer said : "" I 'm 100 % focused on this race ; that 's all I have to say .
I ca n't say anything , I 'm not going to comment . ""
A spokesman for his Omega - Pharma Quick - Step team said they needed more evidence about the allegations .
"" We have to know the truth
but it 's something that is not related to our team . ""
Hincapie also refused direct comment , saying : "" I 'm just disappointed with this thing being brought up once again .
I feel like I 've always done the right thing for the sport . ""
Asked whether he has spoken to Armstrong recently , Hincapie added : "" I have n't in a while .
I feel bad that he 's going through all this .
Lance has done so many things for the sport .
His accomplishments are incredible , what he 's achieved in the sport of cycling , the attention he brought to the sport of cycling , what he 's done for cancer in society is honourable .
"" All five named rode with Armstrong at US Postal Service in the early 2000s .
Last month Hincapie , Leipheimer , Vande Velde and Zabriskie chose not to be considered for the United States Olympic team ."
2012-07-08,"In the era of Miguel Indurain and Lance Armstrong the first long time trial in the Tour de France marked the point at which the five - times and seven - times
Tour winners would definitively make their mark on the race .
After that first landmark in the normal order of things Big Mig and Big Tex would end up sitting on top of the general classification , well ahead of any potential rivals with the mental and strategic whiphand .
Something of this order is expected after Monday 's 41.5 km time trial between Arc - et - Senans and Besançon , running roughly north - north - east from the start in the site of the former French Royal Saltworks , with , if the forecast is correct , a helpful tailwind .
Bradley Wiggins is widely expected to win and reinforce his lead by perhaps a minute from last year 's Tour winner , Cadel Evans ; and , if the margins from the prologue time trial in Liege are repeated , the damage could be much larger over other candidates for overall victory .
Wiggins himself wanted to play down the test .
"" Anything is possible , so I 'll just try to concentrate on my ride .
It remains to be seen just how key it is .
Every stage is important in the Tour .
There has been so much fuss about it but the Tour is about being good every day , not winning solely on the time trials . ""
The prologue time trial in Liege hints at form , but no more , because Wiggins did not ride flat out for the first half – and it is hard to tell how hard his rivals were working either – while over a longer time trial the gaps will stretch out in the second half as the distance begins to tell .
In Liege Wiggins was roughly 1.5sec per kilometre faster than Evans and Vincenzo Nibali , 1sec faster than Denis Menchov and around 4sec per kilometre faster than Haimar Zubeldia , Nicolas Roche and Maxime Monfort .
Over 41.5 km that would translate to about 1min lead on Evans and Nibali , 42sec on Menchov and close to 3min on the last three .
Over the longer distance in the Dauphiné his gap on Evans was 1min 43sec , or just under 2sec per kilometre , which would equate to a 1min 20sec margin on Monday .
However you crunch the figures , they suggest one conclusion : barring a puncture , overnight illness or a crash , Wiggins is likely to win , and by some distance , whittling down the number of potential rivals to perhaps half a dozen from the 14 or 15 who remained in the hunt after Saturday 's seventh stage to La Planche des Belles Filles .
Having spent much of the winter working on his upper body and core strength in the gym , Wiggins has found that his time trialling ability – already better than average – has improved again , partly because improved core strength improves the transmission of power from his upper body to his legs , as well as making it more comfortable to hold the elongated , flattened aerodynamic position on his time trial bike .
While the Briton has not managed to win a prologue time trial – he has tended to finish close to the best , as in Liege the other week , largely to avoid taking risks – he is unbeaten this season in longer time trials , taking the contre la montre in the Tour of Algarve in February , the hill climb up Mont Faron in Paris - Nice in March , the long uphill time trial in Tour of Romandie in May and finally the Dauphiné test .
It is a redoubtable record in a variety of time trials in distance and terrain and it points one way , with one proviso .
Wiggins has not made a mistake in a time trial over any distance since stage 10 of the Tour of Spain last August , when he lost 23sec over 47 km to his team mate Chris Froome and finished third to Tony Martin of Germany having – by his own admission – made the mistake of starting too hard , meaning that he overheated in the afternoon sun , at high altitude .
Although the race leader has clearly improved since that Vuelta , which he rode without full preparation due to his broken collarbone earlier in the summer , given the form that Froome showed on Friday 's mountain - top finish , if he can finish close to the yellow jersey or in front of him , Sky might suddenly find they have two team leaders rather than one ."
2012-08-24,"If Joe Paterno represents the greatest fall from grace in the history of sports , then many are saying that Lance Armstrong might now have won the silver .
On Thursday , Armstrong was stripped of all seven of his Tour de France cycling crowns and will be banned for life from any connection to the sport he made famous .
Why ?
Because he withdrew his appeal against the US Anti Doping Agency 's contention that he time and again rode steroids and performance - enhancing drugs to victory .
Armstrong quit the fight against Usada but issued a statement without contrition , accusing them of an "" unconstitutional witch hunt "" .
Armstrong said in a statement : "" There comes a point in every man 's life when he has to say ' enough is enough ' .
For me , that time is now .
I have been dealing with claims that I cheated and had an unfair advantage in winning my seven Tours since 1999 ...
The toll this has taken on my family and my work for our foundation and on me leads me to where I am today
â€ “ finished with this nonsense ...
Today I turn the page .
I will no longer address this issue , regardless of the circumstances .
I will commit myself to the work I began before ever winning a single Tour de France title : serving people and families affected by cancer , especially those in under - served communities . ""
With the swiftness of a pro cyclist going 75 miles per hour down a steep hill , Usada acted immediately , treating Armstrong 's surrender as a legal admission of guilt .
Travis Tygart , Usada 's chief executive , spoke as if a jury of Armstrong 's peers had voted to convict , saying : "" It is a sad day for all of us who love sport and athletes .
It 's a heartbreaking example of win at all costs overtaking the fair and safe option .
There 's no success in cheating to win . ""
Tygart maintained that Armstrong did n't give up the fight from exhaustion but because he knew that Usada had 10 former teammates ready to testify that he was doping .
Armstrong it should be noted , made clear that no matter what any witnesses had to say , "" There is zero physical evidence to support [ their ] outlandish and heinous claims . ""
He added : "" The only physical evidence here is the hundreds of [ drug tests ] I have passed with flying colours .
"" I do n't know about Armstrong 's guilt or innocence , but anyone who writes off Armstrong after the Usada ruling and thinks that he 's about to enter some sort of Paterno - Pete Rose - Barry Bond pantheon of infamy , does n't quite understand his appeal or why he connects so strongly with his army of fans .
Of the 70 top 10 finishers in Armstrong 's seven Tour de France victories , 41 have tested positive for performance - enhancing drugs , Armstrong is a hell of a lot more than just number 42 .
The Texas native came to public consciousness not just for beating the Pyrenees but for beating stage four cancer .
In our increasingly toxic world , I do n't think a family exists that has n't been touched by cancer in some way .
Lance Armstrong , and his ubiquitous Livestrong bracelets , are 21st - century totems of survival , and Usada is n't going to change that .
Nothing ever could .
No adult male saw Mark McGwire or Sammy Sosa in 1998 and thought "" Someday I 'm going to hit 70 home runs . ""
No adult female saw Marion Jones and thought "" Someday I 'll win gold at the Olympics . ""
But legions of adults have watched Lance Armstrong and thought "" Someday , I 'm going to beat this damn cancer .
"" That 's a deeper connection than fandom or even the virtual world of fantasy sports could ever provide .
If Lance Armstrong has been able to further the connection because he 's white , photogenic and politically connected , ( and did I mention white ? )
then to his credit , he 's leveraged those advantages to raise more than $ 500 m ( Â£315 m ) for cancer research and access to treatment in poor and minority communities across the United States .
Armstrong , a religious agnostic , was once asked how his belief in God helped him beat cancer .
He answered , according to the great sportswriter Robert Lipsyte : "" Everyone should believe in something , and I believe in surgery , chemotherapy and my doctors . ""
That response in the end is why he wo n't go into hiding .
He wo n't live in self - imposed exile .
He wo n't slink to the margins of US society and he wo n't lose his fans .
Call him a doper .
Call him a cheater .
Call him the dirtiest player in a sport that 's as dirty as they come .
He 'll call himself the guy who keeps fighting to make sure people have the surgery , chemo and doctors they need .
For people like those in my own family who have through trials of unimaginable courage , earned the right to wear that LiveStrong rubber bracelet , that will always matter more ."
2012-08-24,"No one has a better record in the greatest cycle race in the world than the ever aggressive Lance Armstrong .
He won the Tour de France for seven consecutive years from 1999 .
Armstrong has always denied doping allegations , but now he is abandoning the effort to defend himself against charges from the US Anti - Doping Agency that he still dismisses as nonsense .
As a result , the USADA proposes to ban Armstrong and strip him of his seven yellow jerseys for his Tour wins .
This retrospective title - stripping is highly dubious .
No one can simply rewrite the history of the Tour from 1999 to 2005 by writing Armstrong out of the story .
The fact is that , drugs or not , Armstrong won those tours .
No one else did .
To award them to the cyclists who finished second also opens a can of dope - ridden worms .
If Armstrong loses the 1999 Tour , for instance , it will be awarded to Alex Zulle , who admitted using the blood - boosting drug EPO the previous year .
Jan Ullrich , who finished second to Armstrong in 2000 , 2001 and 2003 , was later implicated in a major drugs investigation in Spain .
So was Joseba Beloki , second to Armstrong in 2002 .
Ivan Basso , second behind Armstrong in 2005 , served a two - year doping ban from 2006 .
The grim truth is that the Armstrong years were neither the first nor the last in which professional cycling was widely riddled with drugs .
Those contests of cheats are forever tarnished .
But it is hypocritical to pretend that Armstrong did not win them all the same ."
2012-08-24,"Lance Armstrong was never one for giving up .
The champion cyclist overcame life - threatening testicular cancer to win the Tour de France seven times and put the race on the map in the US .
He did more than most athletes for charity in building a global foundation helping millions of cancer survivors .
He went mountain biking with former US president George W Bush and even talked of running for governor of Texas .
To cap it all , Armstrong once dated a rock singer , Sheryl Crow .
But no matter how hard he pedalled , protested or dissembled , he could not shake off the tide of doping accusations that pursued him for years and have now overwhelmed a man once regarded by millions as a sporting hero .
Late on Thursday , he finally did what he rarely has in the past and abandoned the fight .
Armstrong , 40 , announced he would no longer challenge an investigation by the US Anti - Doping Agency ( Usada ) into allegations that every one of his Tour de France victories from 1999 to 2005 was tainted by the use of banned substances such as the blood - booster EPO and steroids , as well as blood transfusions , testosterone and cortisone .
With that he killed the myth of one of the most inspirational figures in world sport .
Usada on Friday banned him from competition cycling for life and stripped him of his Tour de France titles .
The cyclist said the agency does not have the power to do that and the issue is likely to end up being fought out before the cycling authorities and private company that run the Tour .
"" There comes a point in every man 's life when he has to say : ' Enough is enough . '
For me , that time is now , "" he said .
"" I have been dealing with claims that I cheated and had an unfair advantage in winning my seven Tours since 1999 .
The toll this has taken on my family and my work for our foundation and on me leads me to where I am today
â€ “ finished with this nonsense .
"" The move came after a US court ruled against Armstrong 's attempts to block Usada 's investigation .
He consistently maintained he never failed a test for banned substances , although that is disputed .
But Usada said its investigation revealed a systematic programme of drug misuse in Armstrong 's team and claimed 10 of the cyclist 's former team mates would testify that he was at the heart of it .
The agency also told Armstrong it has blood samples from two and three years ago that are "" fully consistent "" with illegal doping .
Although Armstrong has a solidly loyal band of followers who believe his claim to be the victim of a witch hunt and "" outlandish and heinous claims "" , his withdrawal from the case was widely interpreted as an admission of guilt â€ “ albeit of a crime in a sport that was saturated in illegal drug use at the time .
Bicycling magazine greeted the news with the headline "" The Truth Hurts "" on its cover .
Its editor , Peter Flax , said the case against Armstrong was overwhelming . ""
In my mind there 's no doubt that these activities transpired , "" he said .
"" But he 's also an inspiration to millions . ""
Bernard Hinault , the French five times winner of the Tour de France , told ouest-france.fr : "" This is a problem that should have been sorted out 10 or 15 years ago but which never was . ""
Jan Ullrich , a German former rider who was three times runner - up to Armstrong â€ “ and has faced doping allegations of his own â€ “ said : "" I 've ended my career and I have always said that I 'm proud of my second places .
It does n't really bother me that much . ""
Usada 's chief executive , Travis Tygart , called Armstrong 's move sad but said it was hailed an important step toward ending cheating in sport which costs honest athletes their place on the podium .
"" This is a heartbreaking example of how the win - at - all - costs culture of sport , if left unchecked , will overtake fair , safe and honest competition .
"" But for clean athletes , it is a reassuring reminder that there is hope for future generations to compete on a level playing field without the use of performance - enhancing drugs , "" he said John Fahey , the head of the World Anti - doping Agency , said Armstrong 's decision not to fight the charges anymore was an admission of guilt and he should be stripped of his victories . ""
He had the right to rip up those charges but he elected not to , therefore the only interpretation in these circumstances is that there was substance in those charges , "" he told Reuters .
"" My understanding is that when the evidence is based upon a career that included seven Tour de France wins then all of that becomes obliterated . "" Usada could alsogo after Armstrong 's millions of dollars in winnings .
His climbdown leaves in its wake the wreckage of a career now widely accepted to have been built on a lie , and raises questions over the future of his sporting legacy .
The loss of his Tour de France titles is also likely to harm the race 's reputation .
The damage is also likely to extend to Livestrong , the foundation Armstrong created after he survived his battle with cancer .
It has raised about $ 500 m ( Â£316 m ) to fight the disease and help other survivors .
Millions of people at one time or another bought a Livestrong yellow bracelet in support of the charity , and its jerseys were popular at US sporting events â€ “ particularly triathlons , which Armstrong took up after retiring from professional cycling last year .
Armstrong 's sponsors , which have paid a total of about $ 10 m a year , will be embarrassed and some are likely to drop him although his principal backer , Nike , said it would stand by the shamed athlete . ""
Lance has stated his innocence and has been unwavering on this position .
Nike plans to continue to support Lance and the Lance Armstrong Foundation , a foundation that Lance created to serve cancer survivors , "" it said .
Among the adverts Armstrong made for Nike was one in which he toyed with the doping allegations : "" Everyone wants to know what I 'm on .
What am I on ?
I 'm on my bike busting my ass six hours a day . """
2012-08-24,"The French were always more sceptical of the Armstrong myth than the Americans , who lapped up the notion of the star cyclist with a seemingly impossible personal saga of cancer survival , and winning the Tour de France an unprecedented seven times .
Armstrong 's peak of fame coincided with the years of French - US friction over the Iraq war and the era of the "" cheese - eating surrender monkey "" .
He himself seemed to play up the notion that the French public resented an American triumphing in the country 's biggest sporting event .
But if in reality the French sporting public bore him little rancour
, France 's razor - sharp sporting press was on his case .
It was the top - selling French sports - paper l'Equipe that first published stories linking Armstrong to performance - enhancing drugs , and the book LA Confidentiel that linked the cyclist to doping was only published in French .
When news broke on Thursday night of Armstrong 's decision not to fight the US doping charges , l'Equipe 's website headlined its story "" The fall of the boss "" .
The mood in France was of sadness but no great surprise . ""
Above all I 'm sorry for the Tour de France , for cycling , our sport , my sport , the sport I love , "" said the former French cyclist Laurent Jalabert on French radio station RTL .
He said the sport had been "" getting it in the neck "" for a long time and this was a time of "" sadness , and anger too , because we would have preferred this had n't happened "" .
He said he felt justice existed so if Armstrong were suspended and his titles stripped from him it was probably because there were reasons for it , but he said he felt "" divided "" over the news .
Bernard Thevenet , a former double Tour de France winner , said : "" It 's very bad news for cycling .
Once again the problem of that famous era at the end of the 1990s beginning of 2000s . ""
He said if Armstrong 's Tour titles were stripped it would be "" a very strong message to cyclists and those around them who might be tempted to cheat "" .
Most felt it was a saga that had dragged on for years , damaging the sport .
"" It 's a problem that should have been resolved 10 or 15 years ago and it was n't , "" the former French cyclist and Tour de France star Bernard Hinault told Ouest - France .
Armstrong 's star system penetrated not just the heights of US sport , but the heights of French politics .
He was a buddy of France 's best - known political cycling amateur , Nicolas Sarkozy .
The rightwing politician , whose favourite pastime is donning lycra and jumping on a racing bike , boasted of his friendship with Armstrong both as minister and then president .
In 2004 , brushing aside the unease in the cycling world over the incredible series of wins , Sarkozy said of Armstrong : "" He might have taken drugs ?
Well bring me the same ! ""
Earlier this year , the French media began asking whether Sarkozy 's closeness to Armstrong had hampered the French investigation into doping allegations .
Sarkozy 's outraged sports minister flatly denied the suggestion the government could have put a spanner in the works to protect Armstrong .
Sarkozy â€ “ who spent much of the summer , unshaven on cycling outings near Carla Bruni 's family chateau in the south of France
â€ “ has yet to pronounce on the latest developments over Armstrong , whom he fiercely admired .
One of his bikes was a personal gift from Armstrong , who took the time to ensure it had red , white and blue detailing and embossed Sarkozy 's signature on the crossbar ."
2012-08-24,"If you 're a fan or keen student of human psychology , you 're probably feeling spoiled for choice right now at the number of interesting reactions to a couple of shocking scandals ( for a given value of "" scandal "" ) .
There 's the news that Lance Armstrong has received a lifetime ban and been stripped of his Tour de France titles after not contesting accusations of doping , and of course Prince Harry has been photographed naked in Las Vegas and some papers are going ahead and publishing the pictures , despite criticisms .
The stories are mirror images of each other .
Both feature high - profile , high - status males being caught with their pants down ( literally , in Harry 's case ) in a very public way .
But Lance Armstrong 's scandal involves an individual who supposedly earned his incredible success through hard work and determination but is alleged to have broken the rules and cheated to get ahead ( he continues to protest his innocence ) .
Prince Harry , on the other hand , is someone who was born into success and ca n't shake off the idolisation of many members of the public no matter how hard he tries .
And he has tried .
Both seem to be occupying two ends of the same spectrum .
I do n't follow any sport , so was confused by reading the news that "" Armstrong is to be stripped of his titles "" .
At first I thought this meant Buzz Aldrin is now officially the first man on the moon , but have since checked the details .
Whether you think Armstrong has been unfairly hounded by a vindictive organisation or has cynically avoided facing up to his wrongdoings , that 's a matter for you , but I seriously doubt the truth is as binary as these possibilities suggest .
I myself could take steroids or experience blood doping , but this would n't automatically sweep me to victory in the Tour de France .
It would probably put me into such a hypeorxygenated testosterone - fuelled rage that I would n't be allowed to enter France at all .
And all the steroids and doping you can handle wo n't cure you of advanced cancer .
To beat that and recover to the point where you repeatedly win an extremely challenging athletic contest is still an achievement , with or without chemical assistance .
But , rules are rules .
That 's sort of the point of sport ; if you 're not going to follow them , why bother ?
Prince Harry , by contrast , has done nothing wrong , insofar as he 's not broken any rules .
To get naked among willing friends in a private hotel room is not against the law , no matter who you are .
You could argue that as a royal and influential figure , he should n't do that sort of thing , but taking nude pictures of someone without their consent and selling them to the media is also something you should n't do , surely ?
He 's also a young man in the armed forces .
From stories I 've heard about similar individuals , if this is the worst thing he gets up to when on holiday then we can count ourselves lucky .
Both the Armstrong and Prince Harry stories have so many elements and occupy such diffuse areas of morality and acceptability that people 's reactions to them are often more interesting , from a psychological perspective , than the stories themselves .
Many people have been quick to condemn them .
This could be because they feel let down and want to lash out .
They may feel like those who behave badly deserve to be punished .
A sense of justice is seemingly hardwired into humans ( and maybe even human - like creatures ) , so individuals who appear to have achieved success through dubious means or have had it handed to them purely by accident of birth will frustrate our sense of fairness , and any opportunity to address this will be readily accepted .
There 's also envy to consider .
Celebrities and high - profile figures seem to be exempt from the same rules around privacy and accountability that we extend to most normal people .
Ken from the office fiddles his expenses ?
That 's fine , we all do it .
MPs do it ?
It 's "" heads must roll "" time .
This is arguably as it should be .
People who aspire to positions of authority or trust should be held to higher standards , but this is regularly taken to ridiculous , invasive extremes when it comes to celebrities .
The public loves a bit of schadenfreude , which could be seen as a way of saying "" How DARE this person be successful when I 'm not !
They should suffer for this .
"" The psychological reactions of the public to celebrity scandals and the manipulations of the media have been discussed many times before , but it 's still a source of endless fascination for people like me .
There are so many examples of psychological phenomena being splashed all over the news feeds and social networks by people oblivious to the fact that they are exhibiting them .
For someone in the psychological disciplines it 's like running a UV light over a hotel bed ( not necessarily Prince Harry 's , his privacy has been compromised enough ) .
Much of this comes from people needing a definitive way to conceptualise such ambiguous matters .
The human brain does n't deal well with ambiguity , that 's why visual illusions like the necker cube or classic faces / candlestick are either one or the other interpretation ; the brain imposes structure on visually ambiguous images , but if there is more than one valid interpretation then it keeps changing between them .
So when faced with uncertain scenarios , people may jump to a conclusion and stick to it before their minds get torn apart by uncertainty , like a robot encountering a logical paradox .
You get to see a lot of attribution bias too .
This is where people say other people are at fault for something that , if in the same situation , they would do themselves .
We know our own minds , and we maintain a positive view of who we are and what we 're capable of .
If we do n't , then we lose the ability to function normally .
But we ca n't know how other people 's minds work , so we tend to assume they are personally at fault , when we would / can blame external factors for when something happens to us .
For example someone saying "" I 've gotten naked and acted like an arse when pissed , but that 's because I was hammered and my mates were taking advantage of me .
Harry is a prince though , he should know better , he 's just a privileged idiot .
"" My personal favourite is cognitive dissonance , which can often be seen at work on a large scale among media types .
It 's essentially a way of justifying your actions with the belief that you are right , even when the evidence does n't support this claim .
A perfect example is The Sun publishing the pictures of Prince Harry when nobody else would , then coming up with a variety of bizarre explanations for why this was the right thing to do , other than , "" We 'll shift more papers with pictures of a naked royal in them . ""
A lot of people have wondered why The Sun is bothering with the whole "" our readers have a right to see them "" argument when the pictures are freely available online .
I can offer no real explanation , alternatives or way to stop this sort of thing .
It 's just interesting from a scientific perspective .
For psychologists , it can be like astronomers watching a meteor shower : you do n't do anything about it , you just appreciate the spectacle for what it is , and it 's all the more fascinating when you understand what 's happening .
Witness the deranged ramblings of Dean Burnett 's own mind on Twitter : @garwboy"
2012-08-24,"In 2004 Lance Armstrong sat in a press conference at the start of the Tour de France in the Belgian city of LiÃ¨ge , a week or so after the first serious allegations that he had used performance - enhancing drugs had appeared in the book LA Confidentiel , written by David Walsh and Pierre Ballester .
Armstrong looked straight at Walsh , who was sitting in the front row and said : "" Extraordinary allegations require extraordinary evidence .
"" That settled the argument .
For a while .
To Walsh and Ballester should go credit : they initiated the long , contorted process of revelation that has led the US Anti - Doping Agency ( Usada ) to hand Armstrong a lifetime ban and strip him of his seven Tour titles .
The process had reached a watershed on Friday morning when Armstrong conceded that he did not wish to confront evidence that had been put together by Usada from accounts provided by 10 former team - mates which had led it to charge Armstrong with blood doping , the use of erythropoietin ( EPO ) , testosterone and other substances , among other things .
Had he conceded that the case should go to arbitration , he would have had to face those charges in a public forum .
That evidence could have been "" extraordinary "" : but Armstrong chose not to find out what it was .
It is rare , possibly unprecedented , for Armstrong to withdraw from any combat .
Fighting is his way , and always has been .
But steering away from exposure of that evidence is the only outcome that permits Armstrong to maintain any semblance of control of proceedings , and to cling on to any scraps of the myth he has built around himself .
But he does so with all the credibility of one of those fabled Japanese soldiers who hid on Pacific islands convinced that the second world war was still going on .
By avoiding having to give formal answers to the detailed allegations of his team - mates , he can continue to contend that the process was flawed , that Usada has indulged in a witch hunt , and he can state until he is blue in the face that he has never tested positive .
( Back in 2000 , at the start of a Tour de France stage , a close associate of the Texan told me emphatically that he would never , ever test positive .
How right he was .
But how pointless the notion . )
Those arguments are now simply countered : if he has never used drugs , why did he not argue against the point in a formal setting ?
He has done that before , notably in the case against his insurers , SCA , and caused the opposition to settle .
It is strange now to contemplate the Armstrong journey .
It is just under 20 years since I was introduced to a brash , extremely quick - witted Texan youth who had recently turned professional with the Motorola team .
I liked him .
And I was not alone .
His great critic and eventual sworn enemy , the "" troll in chief "" , Walsh , felt the same way when they first met in 1993 .
In 1997 and 1998 Armstrong could only be respected for the scale of the challenge he had taken on : returning from cancer to attempt to race again .
It is important to recall these things now , because we should remember that Armstrong has not always been what he has been since the early 2000s .
He has not always been lawsuit - happy , was not always ready to browbeat those who raised their voices against him .
If he goes down in cycling history as the biggest name to fall from grace among an entire generation that was tainted by drug - taking , that is partly because of the scale of what he achieved , partly because of the length of time during which he persisted in flying in the face of the evidence .
Lance Armstrong 's personal war is over now .
The sport should not be wringing its hands at this .
The concession is sudden , the revelations anything
but .
It is not a case of "" say it ai n't so "" but "" say it , and let us move on "" .
For the last eight years the weight of evidence against Armstrong has built inexorably : the two - year investigation by Walsh and Ballester that produced a book full of circumstantial evidence but no smoking gun ; the positive tests for EPO uncovered in 2005 during research on samples from the 1999 Tour ; most recently , the detailed account from his former team - mates , Tyler Hamilton and Floyd Landis , about doping practices at the Texan 's US Postal Service .
The Usada released a statement on Friday evening outlining the anti - doping rules that Armstrong had violated since 1998 as they justified the ban and removal of his titles .
More details will emerge , and soon : to start with , Hamilton 's account of his career and his doping will appear within a few weeks .
The discussion over the status of Armstrong 's seven Tour de France victories is irrelevant .
Other than their place in the records , those results ceased to have a great deal of meaning as long ago as 2006 - 7 once it became clear , from the OperaciÃ³n Puerto inquiry that an entire generation of cyclists , Armstrong 's generation
â€ “ Jan Ullrich , Ivan Basso , Alexandr Vinokourov and company â€ “ were tainted with blood doping .
The Tour wins remained Armstrong 's , but the standings beneath them became devoid of all sense .
Now , the question of who the Tour wins should be awarded to would be an amusing party game were it not a grotesque illustration of a sport which completely lost its way in the early years of this century .
The Armstrong concession that he can not win the case against Usada matters , because cycling can look , learn and move on .
It already has moved on , in terms of how doping is discussed and the weight of opinion against it .
Indeed , for several years now Armstrong has seemed like a man out of his time .
The tone of the time was shown in a lengthy interview by Armstrong 's former team - mate Jonathan Vaughters this week in Bicycling magazine .
Vaughters argued with great authority â€ “ authority born of experience at every end of the spectrum â€ “ why the fight against doping matters .
To be deterred from doping , athletes need to feel â€ “ as Vaughters did â€ “ that they have more to lose from doping than they have to gain .
Tests need to be strengthened , as they were in cycling after Armstrong quit for the first time in 2005 .
By taking on Armstrong and pushing him to the point where he felt he would rather not contest the evidence , Travis Tygart and Usada have shown that no athlete can consider themselves immune from being pursued over doping allegations .
As Bradley Wiggins argued recently in this paper , and David Millar has stated repeatedly in the past , to prevent doping , the temptation to dope needs to be countered in the athlete 's mind with "" why would I ? "" rather than "" why would n't I ? "" .
In the sport 's progress down that path , the Armstrong concession is indeed extraordinary ."
2012-08-24,"So no judge in a court of arbitration will ever be called to read sentence in the case of Lance Armstrong .
But for anyone with eyes to see and ears to hear , the jury was never out .
By refusing to mount a defence in the US Anti - Doping Agency 's case against him , Lance Armstrong has â€ “ whatever equivocation and claims of persecution he persists in â€ “ all but conceded that he won his seven Tour de France titles by doping .
And by walking away from a defence he has ceded those yellow jerseys and lost his status as the most remarkable serial winner in the history of the sport .
There may be some small fraternity of true believers who still need the master - narrative of the heroic cancer survivor - turned - sports superstar and still cling to a conviction that he could have beaten the rap if the world had not conspired against him .
Armstrong 's statement repeats a familiar litany of disingenuous indignation â€ “ his record of wins , a lack of physical evidence , the "" nonsense "" of this "" witch - hunt "" and so on â€ “ but by this decision , Armstrong has excommunicated himself from the Church of Lance : he no longer believes in the plausibility of his own denials .
The aggression that kept accusers in check and witnesses silent for so long has been replaced by weariness and resignation .
"" There comes a point in every man 's life when he has to say , ' Enough is enough . '
For me , that time is now , "" his statement reads .
Yet even a dope cheat still needs to be a master tactician to win the Tour de France : if Armstrong decided to quit the fight it was because this was the least worst option remaining to him .
This pre - emptive retreat allows him to avoid the formal process of prosecution and conviction , and the humiliation that would have gone along with that .
Perhaps his Livestrong foundation , and what remains of his tarnished brand , can thus survive in some netherworld of unreason .
Where does that leave cycling ?
With many unresolved questions .
We may never know who were all the former team - mates of Armstrong that USADA had ready to testify against him about the years of EPO use , steroids , blood - doping techniques and whatever else that delivered that unbroken string of Tour victories , though we can guess at their identities .
And we will have to wait and see whether Armstrong 's longtime team manager , Johan Bruyneel , will attempt a defence , though the percentage must be in his folding quietly and taking a ban .
We may never finally know what deals were done to hush up the alleged positive tests Armstrong gave , though we have our suspicions .
And we can only wonder who might now be deemed to have won the Tour de France from 1999 to 2005 , though we must assume that the Tour authorities would rather award no result than attempt the fool 's errand of seeking retrospectively a clean cyclist in the top 10 of any of those years .
Better to look forward and learn .
There is no doubt that the anti - doping agencies have won the upper hand since Lance Armstrong 's heyday in the fight to rid the sport of performance - enhancing drugs .
Many do still cheat , though they are fewer and more are caught .
Teams keep sponsors by staying clean ; they lose them when riders are discovered doping .
The governing body , the UCI , has abandoned its shameful connivance of the EPO era .
But there 's no reason for complacency .
It will only take a tangential advance in medical science for some new substance to become available for which there is no test ; then the cheats will be ahead in the pharmacological arms race once more .
The most important lesson of the Lance Armstrong story , though , is the hardest to prepare for and guard against : our own gullibility and willing complicity .
What is astounding and disturbing is that one man â€ “ a dominant personality as well as a dominant athlete â€
“ was able to enforce his will , isolate , bully and silence his doubters and critics , and win the world 's top cycling event year after year and make people believe in him , despite there being , apparently , dozens of witnesses to its utter phoniness .
Too many people had too much invested in the Lance Armstrong story , and the power of persuasion followed the money .
The moral of the story is that if a cyclist looks too good to be true , then he probably is .
But if a cyclist looks too good to be true and has an entourage of lawyers , press flaks , doctors and bodyguards , then he definitely is ."
2012-08-25,"Identifying the precise moment when the fall from grace began for Lance Armstrong , once the world 's greatest cyclist , is not easy .
Did the fatal moment occur two years ago , when Floyd Landis â€ “ disgraced 2006
Tour de France winner and Armstrong 's former team - mate â€ “ met a special agent of the US Food and Drugs Administration , Jeff Novitzky , to describe how he had seen the seven - times Tour champion doping in his own apartment ?
Or were the seeds of his downfall sown far earlier than that â€ “ in 1999 , the year of Armstrong 's first Tour win , when he is said to have "" bullied "" a young French cyclist , Christophe Bassons , telling him "" he would be better off going home "" after Bassons criticised doping on the Tour , effectively ending his career ?
Or was it eight years ago , when the French anti - doping laboratory decided to conduct retrospective research using its new test for the blood agent erythropoietin ( EPO ) on samples taken from riders during the 1999 Tour ?
The lab identified six positive results from a batch of 15 that the sports newspaper L'Equipe matched to blood - sample records Armstrong and the world cycling federation had agreed to supply to the newspaper .
Its subsequent article â€ “ "" The Armstrong Lie "" â€ “ would set in train a sequence of events that culminated on Friday with the decision by the United States Anti - Doping Agency ( USADA ) to ban the Texan for life and recommend the stripping of all his awards , after Armstrong refused to defend himself against allegations of cheating .
Armstrong explained his decision himself thus : "" Over the past three years , I have been subjected to a two - year federal criminal investigation followed by Travis Tygart 's unconstitional witch hunt
â€
¦
It 's an unfair approach , applied selctively , in opposition to all the rules .
It 's just not right . ""
The suspicion had always been there â€ “ alluded to in the French media , and made explicit by Pierre Ballester and David Walsh in their French - published book LA Confidentiel , which baldly asserted that Armstrong was a cheat .
Now Armstrong has been found guilty by virtue of a "" non - analytical positive "" â€ “ not a blood test , but the testimony of witnesses : the same way that former US sprint champion Marion Jones was stripped of her of her medals .
Now a competition that , through its long history , has been tainted with substance - abuse scandals â€ “ from the brandy and strychnine taken by early riders to the steroids and complex compounds of later times â€ “ is in the spotlight again .
Since the scandalous 2007 Tour , the UCI , cycling 's ruling body , has made stronger efforts to tackle drugs cheats .
That year saw the entire Astana and Cofidis teams withdraw after pre - race favourite Alexander Vinokourov was caught blood doping , and Bradley Wiggins 's Italian teammate Cristian Moreni was arrested after testing positive for elevated levels of testosterone .
And despite Armstrong 's repeated claims of innocence , it was during the 1990s and 2000s â€
“
the most notorious doping â€ “ that he ruled the sport .
The reality â€ “ as Walsh told the BBC in an interview last weekâ€ “ is that many had suspected for years that something was rotten at the very heart of cycling : a rottenness in which not only cyclists and team managers were complicit , but the administrators themselves .
In the end , it appears the unravelling of the Armstrong myth , and the uncovering of what some have called the greatest doping conspiracy in sport , occurred because USADA had accumulated so much testimony â€ “ including from 10 former team - mates , some unsullied by accusations of cheating .
The extent of Armstrong 's surrender is underlined by the knowledge of what he has previously said about the "" guiding principles "" taught to him by his single mother Linda : that "" to give up was to give in "" .
Armstrong reiterated that view in his first autobiography ,
It 's Not About the Bike , written in 2000 .
"" Pain is temporary , "" he wrote then .
"" If I quit , however , it lasts forever . ""
And quit is what Armstrong did on Friday .
As World Anti - Doping Agency chief John Fahey said on the day it happened , Armstrong 's decision added up to nothing less than an admission of guilt .
While it is not clear what pressure was brought to bear on those former teammates who gave evidence to USADA investigators â€ “ after a US federal case examining whether Armstrong 's US Postal Service ( USPS ) team had "" misused federal funds "" was dropped â€
“
it has been suggested that some faced threats of perjury proceedings if they did not speak .
Perhaps what has been most extraordinary about the whole saga is the extent to which suspicions about the American champion had been documented for so long yet never properly investigated , as Armstrong used the force of his personality â€ “ and legal challenges
â€ “ to shut down all criticism .
That included even the testimony of those such as Armstrong 's team masseuse â€ “
a woman with no real axe to grind â€ “ who insisted that she had heard team officials discussing how to get round Armstrong 's positive test for steroids , and described how she was asked to travel to Spain to deliver "" material "" across the French border .
But it has been the USADA finding that has been the most damaging , not least because it stands unchallenged by a man who has long insisted that he is the victim of a witch - hunt .
USADA said its evidence came from more than a dozen witnesses "" who agreed to testify and provide evidence about their first - hand experience and/or knowledge of the doping activity of those involved in the USPS conspiracy "" .
The unidentified witnesses said they knew or had been told by Armstrong himself that he had "" used EPO , blood transfusions , testosterone and cortisone "" from before 1998 until 2005 , the year of his seventh Tour victory , and that he had previously used EPO , testosterone and human growth hormone until 1996 , USADA said .
Armstrong also allegedly handed out doping products , encouraged banned methods â€ “ and , USADA says , even used "" blood manipulation including EPO or blood transfusions "" during his 2009 Tour comeback .
For his part , Armstrong has tried to characterise the investigative process against him as tantamount to bribery â€ “ offering those willing to give evidence the promise of more lenient sanctions if they admitted their part .
Certainly in the last two years the net has tightened very quickly around Armstrong .
After Landis 's meeting with federal investigators , they spoke to Tyler Hamilton , another former teammate , who has admitted to doping .
"" It really was n't until the last few months [ that ] we were able to reach out to all the witnesses we believed had information , "" said Travis Tygart , USADA 's chief executive .
"" They all agreed to testify truthfully . ""
In a separate interview , Tygart added : "" I think Mr Armstrong also knows the truth and decided that instead of a fact - by - fact , piece - by - piece coming - out in open court under oath , he decided his better move at this stage was just not to contest and hold on to baseless soundbites about witch hunts and vendettas . ""
All of which leaves some serious questions still unanswered : such as whether cycling 's administrators turned a blind eye to Armstrong 's behaviour , particularly when he was patron of the Tour , its leader by virtue of his victories .
That is the view of Italian rider Filippo Simeoni , who clashed with Armstrong in the 2004 Tour after giving evidence in an Italian court that Armstrong 's trainer , Dr Michele Ferrari â€ “ also named in the USADA doping allegations â€ “ had advised the Italian to take EPO and testosterone in the late 1990s . ""
When I protested , [ Armstrong ] was in charge of cycling and nothing was done , "" he told an Italian radio station .
"" I paid for things that were n't just .
I only told the truth .
"" There will be more fights and scandal ahead .
Others accused in the affair have opted â€ “ unlike Armstrong â€ “ to fight their case in the Court of Arbitration for Sport .
The UCI has also not yet accepted USADA 's judgment , and its own officials may take up cudgels for Armstrong 's cries of "" injustice "" ."
2012-08-25,"Think this is over ?
Think again .
Lance Armstrong may want closure , but the charges of conspiracy involving four others , including his former team manager Johan Bruyneel and his trainer Dr Michele Ferrari , will continue to keep the Texan in the headlines as the evidence is revealed .
And then there is the business of all the millions of dollars he won during his years of triumph , and whether anyone will be wanting it back .
The debate over what to do about the seven Tours de France from which Armstrong 's name has been unilaterally erased by the US Anti - Doping Agency should be laid to rest immediately .
Nobody won those Tours .
There can be no winner .
Except , now , a sport that can finally get to grips with its own tainted history .
Any attempt to promote the men who finished beneath Armstrong in the years between 1999 and 2005 must be resisted .
Who would want to entertain the pretence that such riders as Jan Ullrich , Alex Zulle and Ivan Basso deserve to be awarded a retrospective yellow jersey ?
There was a measure of sensible sporting realpolitik behind Ullrich 's claim , made in the wake of Friday 's announcement , that he has always been happy with his second places .
The years of Armstrong 's Tour victories constitute a blown - up version of the 1988 Olympic 100 m final â€ “ "" the dirtiest race in history "" , in the title of Richard Moore 's recent book .
Best to write those years off .
Not to ignore them , of course , but to accept the reality of the EPO era and learn its lessons .
By choosing to drop his defence against the charges so doggedly pieced together by the Usada , who picked up the leads gathered by the US federal investigator Jeff Novitzky , Armstrong finally demolished the last lingering illusions of those for whom , in the words of a friend of mine , admiration of his feat in conquering cancer had exceeded suspicion of the means by which he subsequently achieved his unprecedented run of Tour successes .
A man who once looked capable of mounting a run for his country 's highest office will henceforth find himself addressing only a rump â€ “ albeit a sizeable one â€ “ of those who continue to believe in the myth he erected around himself .
As a public figure , the once - great Texan is finished .
On Saturday his long - time associate Bruyneel called it a bad day for cycling .
The contrary is true , and great credit for that is due to the journalists David Walsh , Pierre Ballester and Paul Kimmage and to Travis Tygart of the Usada , who confronted Armstrong and refused to be intimidated into halting their investigations , to the soigneuse Emma O'Reilly , who gave damaging early testimony , and to the sometime Armstrong team - mates Frankie Andreu , Tyler Hamilton and Floyd Landis , who were persuaded to testify against their former leader .
Without their efforts and admissions he might still be operating under the protection of an unsullied reputation .
Tantamount ( although he will continue to deny it ) to an admission of guilt , his decision to decline his day in court may make it harder for the world to learn the full extent of the evidence held by the Usada .
It is to be hoped that everything will be revealed , in order to help heal the wound caused by the years when scientific doping ruled the sport .
Belief in his integrity persisted long after the accumulation of circumstantial evidence had reached critical mass , and could be found in some quarters whose authority was hard to question .
"" I love him , "" Bradley Wiggins said only two years ago , during the last days of Armstrong 's final appearance in the Tour .
"" I think he 's great .
He 's transformed the sport in so many ways .
Every person in cycling has benefited from Lance Armstrong , perhaps not financially but in some sense .
I do n't think this sport will ever realise what he 's brought it or how big he 's made it . ""
Cycling was in the dark ages before he came along , in many ways .
You only have to look at the support along the roads , compared to what it was 20 years ago .
The majority of that is because of Lance Armstrong .
Obviously he has his enemies and people among the fans who do n't like him , but they 've all benefited from him and his existence on the Tour .
"" Wiggins is more entitled than most to his view , but he need not feel that anyone but himself was responsible for inspiring the crowds who flocked to watch his triumphs in France and England this summer .
The Armstrong effect was most deeply felt in his homeland .
In Europe it seems more likely that the present boom would have happened anyway , and that its momentum has increased despite the doping scandals of the past decade .
Only a naif would imagine that doping has been eradicated from the sport , but the good news is to be found in the statistics indicating a significant reduction in the speeds achieved in recent years .
No one climbs the 21 hairpins of the Alpe d'Huez at the speed achieved by Armstrong or Marco Pantani during the EPO years .
There are no epic breaks by riders suddenly displaying extraterrestrial powers .
The sport may be less consistently dramatic as a result , but that is a price worth paying .
Armstrong 's fall will be mourned by many who valued his existence as a worldwide symbol of hope to cancer sufferers and their families and friends .
The two books in which he discussed the experience of his diagnosis , treatment and recovery brought light into the lives of those plunged into mortal darkness .
The yellow wristband became an outward sign of that hope .
Eventually , however , it became impossible to escape the feeling that Armstrong was exploiting his standing as a fundraiser and hope - bringer to armour himself against the increasingly persistent attacks from those who questioned the validity of the achievements which had created the platform for his life as a public figure .
His annexation of the colour yellow â€ “ the colour of the Tour leader 's jersey â€ “ for his Livestrong charity
seemed presumptuous : the colour belonged to the Tour , not to him .
The teams of Livestrong workers who preceded the race 's arrival by stencilling kilometres of road with the charity 's logo and inspirational messages turned a traditional gesture of spontaneous enthusiasm into something rather chilling in its premeditation , however noble the cause .
All we can do is remember the time and emotion spent on deeds now devalued , and chalk it up to experience .
Leave his name in the record books , maybe asterisked , as a reminder .
The past is the past .
The future , we must believe , will be better ."
2012-08-26,
2012-08-28,"The Sunday Times is exploring whether it can review the terms of its costly 2006 libel settlement with Lance Armstrong after the cyclist dropped his challenge to anti - doping charges being brought against him in the US .
Armstrong sued the publisher of the Sunday Times and two of its journalists in 2004 over an investigation that questioned his repeated denials that he had taken performance - enhancing drugs .
The seven - time Tour de France winner reached an out of court settlement with Times Newspapers Limited in July 2006 over the article , which previewed a book on Armstrong titled LA Confidential by the then Sunday Times chief sports writer , David Walsh .
A spokeswoman for News International , the parent company of Times Newspapers , confirmed on Tuesday that it was now exploring whether it could review the terms of the settlement .
Details of the terms â€ “ including whether there was a payout for damages â€ “ have never been made public .
The legal move comes after Armstrong revealed on Friday that he would not fight doping charges brought by the US Anti - Doping Agency ( Usada ) .
On Friday , Usada announced that it had stripped Armstrong of each of his competitive titles from August 1998 , including his seven Tour de France wins .
Despite giving up the fight against the charges , Armstrong has maintained his innocence and on Saturday complained about what he described as a witch - hunt .
"" Nobody needs to cry for me .
I 'm going to be great , "" Armstrong said after competing in a 36-mile mountain bike race in Aspen , Colorado , at the weekend .
"" I have five great kids and a wonderful lady in my life .
My foundation is unaffected by all the noise out there .
"" I think people understand that we 've got a lot of stuff to do going forward .
That 's what I 'm focused on
and I think people are supportive of that .
It 's great to be out here . ""

2012-09-05,"2008 , was it really
that long ago ?
In basic terms no , yet as the Conservatives shift further to the right , Lance Armstrong 's credibility as a world - class athlete is blown away and the thought of giving Charlie Sheen money to appear on TV is deemed by most as absurd , it feels more and more like a year of innocence that belongs to a different era entirely .
Only adding to that sense is the news Arsenal have offered Andrey Arshavin a free transfer in the hope he will find a new club before Thursday 's close of the Russian transfer window .
This , remember , is the same Arshavin who was utterly brilliant at Euro 2008 , a mesmeric talent who scored twice at the tournament and inspired Russia to reach the semi - finals , where they were beaten 3 - 0 by the eventual winners , Spain .
He duly moved to Arsenal for £ 15 m in January 2009 but now , after some years of wandering around the Emirates in a half - mooch , Arshavin has been told he can go home for nothing having already spent the last half of last season on loan at former club Zenit St Petersburg .
From hot property in 2008 to cold shoulder in 2012 , Arshavin has fallen some way .
Speaking of once - great attackers who would now struggle to get into the reserve sides of most top clubs , it appears Michael Owen 's move to Stoke has hit a snag .
The 32-year - old former Old Trafford bench - warmer joined Tony Pulis 's team late on Tuesday but may not actually be able to play for them in the Premier League given he signed after the club was meant to have submitted their 25-man squad for the already - started campaign .
Apparently Stoke are seeking permission from the League to include Owen in their final party and are confident they will be allowed to do so .
Another free agent who could soon be with a new club is Craig Gordon .
The former Sunderland goalkeeper , who arrived at the Stadium of Light for £ 9 m five years ago , has supposedly attracted interest from Aston Villa , West Ham , Celtic and Udinese .
What 's that I hear you cry
: "" Any more whacky news regarding Liverpool ? ""
Well yes , actually .
It has been reported that as part of his attempt to sign Clint Dempsey prior to last week 's transfer deadline , Brendan Rodgers had hawked Stewart Downing and José Enrique around the Premier League , hoping their departures would raise the money he needed to buy the American .
This is the same Downing who Liverpool purchased for £ 20 m in July 2011 and the same José Enrique for whom they paid Newcastle £ 6 m the following month .
Two sizeable , stand - out purchases , reduced to carboot - sale tat in order to scrap a few quid together for a 29-year - old forward from Fulham .
Anfield 's chaos truly knows no bounds .
Speaking of which , Andy Carroll , the £ 35 m striker Liverpool loaned out to West Ham last Thursday , could be out for six weeks following the hamstring injury he picked up during his eye - catching debut for the London club at the weekend .
A blow , but West Ham will still be able to call upon him long before the club he actually belongs to can .
And finally , Manchester United offered Santos £ 38 m for Neymar before last week 's close of the transfer window .
Some bid that , and one cynics would suggest had been leaked by those at Old Trafford who wish to portray the Glazers in a good light , you know , less debt - loving and more big - signing hungry .
That 's what the cynics would suggest , I on the other hand think it 's definitely true .
Definitely ."
2012-09-14,"I met Tyler Hamilton in the lobby of a Toulouse hotel during the 2003 Tour de France .
Hamilton was performing what seemed at the time like one of the greatest rides in the history of the race , appropriately in the centenary Tour ; he was fighting his way through it with a double crack in his collarbone and was highly placed overall .
It made a great interview for the Observer ; my companion and I left feeling quietly impressed with the guy .
I had heard that the American , from Marblehead , Massachusetts , was quiet , even boring , but he was perfectly eloquent at talking about the pain he was enduring .
It was difficult not to be inspired by the suffering Hamilton was going through , just as it was difficult not to raise eyebrows and wonder what the hell was going on when he rode away from the entire field in the Pyrenees , up the steepest climb of the race , broken collarbone and all , to win in Bayonne .
Struggling to stay in contact with the leaders seemed within the bounds of possibility ; winning a stage by four minutes did not add up .
So it was not a massive surprise to learn that Hamilton had injected a bag of blood the night before the stage to Bayonne , increasing his performance by 3 % , or so he writes in his account of his doping journey , The Secret Race :
Inside the Hidden World of the Tour de France : Doping , Cover - ups and Winning at All Costs .
That is pretty much what the book , written jointly with the American journalist Daniel Coyle , inspired in me : not surprise so much as the occasional jolt of shock at the grimy practicalities and the odd drop of my jaw at the means Hamilton says that he , Lance Armstrong and others used to stay ahead of the testers and the police .
In the broader sense this book is old news , at least compared with Willy Voet 's Breaking the Chain , which I translated following its publication in 1999 .
Voet 's revelations were fresh ; the Festina scandal had broken less than a year before it appeared .
In the same way that the Armstrong saga has been a 10-year drip - feed of revelation , we have had eight years to get used to the idea that Hamilton was riding on blood transfusions , because he was busted for blood doping in 2004 , while leaks during the OperaciÃ³n Puerto inquiry left no room for error about his prolific drug - taking .
What Hamilton 's account does do is offer an initial , and deep , insight into the evidence that Armstrong refused to confront when he opted out of arbitration in the case that the US Anti - Doping Agency had built against him and his associates .
Armstrong 's surrender â€ “ with its implicit acceptance of the charges the Usada had raised against him
â€ “ made a contorted kind of sense on 25 August , as it does now , given the material in the book .
Looking back to 1999 , I was naive to assume that year that the threat of police raids would make the cyclists leave their drugs at home .
While the fear seems to have made many of them ride clean ( a vast percentage of the samples from 1999 tested later for erythropoietin were clean ) , that in turn rewarded those who took special measures and doped up .
In the case of Armstrong and Hamilton this meant hiring a motorcyclist , nicknamed Motoman , to transport their EPO .
The following year , with a new test in the pipeline for that blood booster , Armstrong and US Postal switched to microdoses of EPO ( to reduce "" glowtime "" , as they call the period when a rider will test positive after an injection ) but primarily to blood transfusions
â€ “ a bigger boost to performance but involving trips to Spain by private jet to have blood removed before it was reinjected for the key moments in the race .
Blood doping later became more sophisticated , once Hamilton had left Postal and taken up with the egregious Dr Eufemiano Fuentes , alleged supplier of blood doping services extraordinaire , albeit one who insists he is innocent .
Blood is taken out and reinjected in epic quantities ; it is frozen and manipulated .
Occasionally it goes off , to disastrous effect .
The methods used for concealment are the stuff of the underworld : multiple pay - as - you - go mobile phones , constantly changed , codes for the numbers of rooms in obscure hotels where blood is taken out and put back in , elaborate measures to dispose of evidence , on one occasion hiring a flat in Monaco for one transfusion , hidden there for a month with Hamilton and his then wife , Haven , keeping an eye on it .
But above all , constant paranoia , fear of the opposition , fear of discovery .
It is sport but not as mere mortals can imagine it or report it , in the case of my colleagues and I. We suspected and conjectured , while being unable to put our disquiet into print ; quite how we could have uncovered it I can not imagine , given the elaborate measures to which the drugtakers were resorting to ensure secrecy .
Amid the blood there are telling insights into Armstrong : "" He believed â€ “ still believes â€ “ that he was n't cheating , because in his mind all the contenders in the race â€ ¦ had their own version of Motoman , everybody was doing everything they could to win
and , if they were n't , they were choads [ an insult particular to Armstrong , somewhere between a chump and a toad ] and did n't deserve to win .
"" If there is a note of optimism that can be taken from this book , it is not from Hamilton 's story , but the background : testing , more and more stringently , particularly out of competition , clearly does have an effect : it piles on the pressure , forcing the drug takers and the men who run the blood banks into mistakes , such as traces of banned drugs unintentionally finding their way into a bag of blood which then show up positive .
Testing does not net them all â€ “
Armstrong never failed a test
â€ “ but it catches enough to make a difference .
Hamilton 's downfall , that positive for blood doping in 2004 , it seems , is most probably due to an error by Fuentes , who was seemingly supplying so many names in the peloton that he may have given the American the wrong bag .
( In a wry - smile footnote that you simply could n't make up , it seems that his sidekick may have suffered from dementia . )
This is not an account that will engender a great deal of sympathy , at least not in my mind .
Hamilton suffered severe depression , sacrificed his marriage and lost a million dollars fighting for years to maintain the lie that he had raced clean .
He does not paint himself as a victim : he had a choice and he made the choice .
His story , and that of the seven - times Tour winner with whom it runs in parallel , is a defining example of what we all tell our children : one lie leads to another , they grow and take on a life of their own .
Any residual feeling I might have felt for a man who fouled up his life as Hamilton did evaporates on page 19 , after his account of that stage win in Bayonne , where he writes : "" You can call me a cheater and doper until the cows come home .
But the fact remains that in a race where everybody had equal opportunity , I played the game and I played it well . ""
The ultimate drug taker 's argument : they all did it , so
I had to do it .
Not everyone in that race had access to Fuentes or Motoman .
Hamilton did not have to do it .
They do not have to do it .
Tyler Hamilton 's The Secret Race is available now"
2012-10-02,"Tuesday is Livestrong Day , the cancer charity founded by former professional cyclist and cancer survivor Lance Armstrong .
We always used to say "" seven - time winner of the Tour de France Lance Armstrong "" , but that description has been rendered untrue by the fact that , in August , the US Anti - Doping Agency ( USADA ) stripped Armstrong of his Tour victories after he declined to defend USADA 's case against him for systematic cheating by doping throughout that period of his career .
His statement at the time was carefully constructed to cast doubt on USADA 's process and cast himself as the injured victim , but in the eyes of most people he is , by default of his own choice , a convicted dope cheat .
By avoiding a public airing of the evidence against him , however , Armstrong did leave himself a chink of credibility with his cycling career 's remaining legacy , the Livestrong Foundation . ""
This October , "" he reminded us , "" my Foundation will celebrate 15 years of service to cancer survivors and the milestone of raising nearly $ 500 m . ""
The Livestrong Foundation itself has not updated its website and is still citing Armstrong 's seven Tour "" victories "" as part of its inspiring message to people with cancer and cancer survivors .
Even when Armstrong 's friend , Senator John McCain , declined to intervene on his behalf and backed USADA 's investigation , the Livestrong Foundation came out in support of Armstrong , criticising USADA 's "" biased process "" .
The Livestrong Foundation may judge , perhaps correctly , that for the majority of the American public Armstrong 's brand is still untarnished â€ “ and that only among cycling 's relatively small fanbase is he a condemned man .
The Livestrong Foundation may also assume , perhaps rightly , that its own brand is now independent of its progenitor 's and effectively immune from whatever taint is there .
It is a huge operation , undoubtedly does good work ( with a notably high proportion of funds raised going in to actual programs , rather than admin and marketing ) , and most people who get involved probably have only a hazy , if any , idea of what Lance Armstrong and the recent controversy have to do with their cancer survivor work .
So what do you think ?
Is it long live Livestrong on 2 October ?
Or does something not smell right about a cancer charity founded on the "" inspirational story "" of a dope cheat ?
Would you get involved in a Livestrong event or fundraising , or pause for thought ?

2012-10-11,"The drugs mastermind :
Michele Ferrari Usada said it "" has found overwhelming proof that Dr Michele Ferrari facilitated doping for numerous members of the US Postal Service and Discovery . ""
The report showed that Armstrong had paid more than $ 1 m to a company controlled by the Italian and said that Armstrong had conceded he met Ferrari on a monthly basis .
Riders testified that he supervised blood transfusions , EPO injections and the use of testosterone .
Ferrari was quoted as saying : "" If I were a rider , I would use the products which elude doping controls if they helped to improve my performances . ""
The team director : Johan Bruyneel
The report says : "" Lance Armstrong was instrumental in bringing Johan Bruyneel to the US Postal Service . ""
It adds : "" One of the first things the riders noticed was how focused he was on their blood values .
He became displeased when he learned a rider was doping without his knowledge .
Levi Leipheimer realised this was because doping unsupervised by the team doctor put the team at a higher risk of a positive drug test .
The overwhelming evidence is that Bruyneel was intimately involved in all details of the doping programme .
""
The team doctors : Luis GarcÃ­a del Moral and Pedro Celaya "" Moral and Bruyneel worked hand - in - hand in implementing the team - wide doping programme on US Postal from 1999 through 2003 , "" says the report .
Christian Vande Velde said he "" would run into the room and you would quickly find a needle in your arm "" . ""
Celaya 's affable nature was an asset in helping to convince some young riders to try new drugs , "" says the report .
Panicked over a possible drug bust and helped flush "" ' tens of thousands of dollars of doping products down the toilet of the team camper "" .
The witnesses : Floyd Landis and Tyler Hamilton Landis was Armstrong 's protege : "" He gave Floyd the keys to his apartment ; Floyd watched over their blood bags while Armstrong was out of town .
They shared doping advice from Ferrari and when Floyd needed EPO , Lance shared that too , "" says the report . ""
Armstrong explained how blood doping had become necessary due to the EPO test .
He made his apartment available for the first extraction of Floyd 's blood [ by ] Ferrari . ""
After testifying to law officials , "" Hamilton was physically accosted by Armstrong in a Colorado restaurant .
Hamilton has testified that Armstrong said : ' When you 're on the witness stand , we are going to fucking tear you apart .
You are going to look like a fucking idiot . ""
Hamilton testified that Armstrong also said : ' I 'm going to make your life a living â€ ¦ fucking â€ ¦ hell . '
[ They ] plainly constitute an act of attempted witness intimidation . ""
The victims : Filippo Simeone and Christophe Bassons
The report says Armstrong attempted to intimidate Filippo Simeoni , who had testified against Ferrari in Italy .
It says that during a stage of the 2004 Tour de France , Armstrong told Simeoni : "" You made a mistake when you testified against Ferrari â€ ¦ I can destroy you . ""
As the pair returned to the peloton from a breakway , Armstrong made what Usada describes as a "" taunting ' zip the lips ' gesture . ""
Simeoni found himself ostracised from the sport .
Christophe Bassons wrote newspaper columns discussing doping during the 1999 Tour , including one in which he said the peloton had been "" shocked "" by Armstrong 's performance the previous day .
The report says that on the stage to Alpe d'Huez , Armstrong "" rode up to Bassons and berated him , calling him a disgrace and telling him he should get out of cycling . ""
Bassons found himself shunned and ostracised , and eventually quit the sport ."
2012-10-11,"Eleven of Lance Armstrong 's former team - mates gave evidence against him to the United States Anti - Doping Agency .
They revealed what Usada has described as a "" doping conspiracy "" at the US Postal Service Pro Cycling Team in testifying against the 41-year - old .
Floyd Landis
The 36-year - old American was at the team from 2002 to 2004 .
He won the 2006 Tour de France while at Phonak Hearing Systems , but was stripped of the victory and sacked from the team after a doping violation .
Having initially contested the allegations , in 2010 he admitted continued doping and accused Armstrong of having done so as well .
Tyler Hamilton
The 41-year - old American was at the team from 1995 to 2001 .
He won a time trial gold medal at the 2004 Olympics , but later twice was handed doping bans .
In 2011 he admitted to using banned substances in competition and was formally stripped of his Olympic medal the following year .
George Hincapie
The 39-year - old American competed for US Postal Service for 10 years from 1997 to 2007 and was a team - mate of Armstrong for 11 , initially at Motorola .
His career is very closely linked with Armstrong 's and he was the only cyclist who was with Armstrong on each of his seven Tour de France wins .
Frankie Andreu The 46-year - old American was at the team from 1998 to 2000 .
Usada described the super domestique in their "" reasoned decision "" as "" one of Armstrong 's earliest and closest friends in the professional cycling ranks "" .

2012-10-11,"Nike , the global sportswear brand with longstanding ties to Lance Armstrong , has reaffirmed its support for the former cyclist accused of being the key member of "" the most sophisticated , professionalised and successful doping programme the sport has ever seen "" .
Despite the damning conclusions of the US Anti - Doping Agency ( Usada ) , based on the testimony of 26 people â€ “ including 15 riders with knowledge of the US Postal team between 1998 and 2005 â€ “ the sportswear giant has reissued a statement supporting Armstrong that was originally drafted when he was banned for life and stripped of his seven Tour de France titles in August .
"" We are saddened that Lance Armstrong may no longer be able to participate in certain competitions and his titles appear to be impacted , "" it said .
"" Lance has stated his innocence and has been unwavering on this position .
Nike plans to continue to support Lance and the Lance Armstrong Foundation , a foundation that Lance created to serve cancer survivors .
"" Nike 's British website sells 33 running products , from trainers to tracksuits , bearing the Livestrong brand and featuring its distinctive yellow branding .
In the US , the total is 98 .
Armstrong , who founded the charity in 1997 before recovering from testicular cancer to win the Tour de France in 1999 , has since raised more than $ 470 m ( approx Â£293 m ) to fight cancer .
The high - profile charity is most closely associated with the tens of millions of yellow wristbands it has sold since 2005 .
Paula Radcliffe , another athlete endorsed by Nike , said on Twitter that the Usada 's reasoned judgment against Armstrong was "" shocking "" . ""
Shocking !
The depth , organisation , brazen disregard for rules and others .
not just here tho , lots still to be done , "" she said ."
2012-10-11,
2012-10-11,"Lance Armstrong , the seven - times Tour de France winner whose reputation was shredded by a US Anti - Doping Agency report labelling him a bully and a "" serial drug cheat "" , was on Thursday night under increasing pressure to respond to damning charges that included claims he committed perjury and intimidated witnesses .
The cyclist could also end up in court facing an attempt to claw back millions of dollars of bonus money if the Texas - based insurance company SCA Promotions tries to recover a payment to Armstrong for winning the 2004 Tour .
Other civil actions in the US to recover sponsorship and prize money are also possible .
World cycling 's governing body , which is also under pressure to justify its role in the scandal , said it wanted to take time to study the 1,000-plus pages of the Usada judgment that concluded Armstrong was at the heart of the "" most sophisticated , professionalised and successful doping programme that sport has ever seen "" .
The UCI has 21 days to decide whether to comply with Usada 's attempt to strip Armstrong of his career titles or attempt to fight its jurisdiction over the case .
The rider has denied cheating , but he did not fight the Usada charges when they were made public in August .
Armstrong could face charges of perjury after the report highlighted a 2005 court case in which he repeatedly denied doping or having any professional relationship with Michele Ferrari , the Italian doctor accused of overseeing the US Postal team doping ring , after 2004 . ""
As demonstrated by the testimony of numerous witnesses in this case , each of the above statements made under oath and subject to the penalties of perjury were materially false and misleading when made , "" said the Usada report .
The assertions were made after Armstrong went to arbitration to recover a $ 5 m ( Â£3.1 m ) bonus from SCA , which was reluctant to pay out in the wake of his sixth Tour de France win amid increasing rumours of drug use .
Armstrong received a settlement of $ 7.5 m made up of the original bonus plus interest and lawyers ' fees .
"" We will readdress the issue when we see if there is inaction or action [ from UCI ] , "" Jeff Dorough , a lawyer for SCA , said .
It is believed likely SCA will take legal action given the exhaustive nature of Usada 's report .
Meanwhile , the ripple effects of the damning judgment continued to spread : â€¢ Michele Ferrari , the Italian known by the nickname "" Schumi "" to whom Armstrong , according to the report , paid more than $ 1 m over a decade to mastermind US Postal 's training and doping programme , could face criminal charges in Italy .
â€¢
The International Olympic Commission is investigating the possibility of stripping Armstrong of his bronze medal from Sydney in 2000 .
â€¢ Nike , the US sportswear giant that backs Armstrong 's Livestrong brand through a sponsorship deal and a line of almost 100 branded goods , vowed to stand by him .
â€¢ Leading British cyclists condemned Armstrong , with Bradley Wiggins describing himself as "" shocked at the scale of the evidence "" , but others were more equivocal .
Usada announced in August that it was stripping Armstrong of all his career titles including his Tour de France victories due to his central involvement in a large scale doping ring .
"" It was not enough that his team - mates give maximum effort on the bike , he also required that they adhere to the doping program outlined for them or be replaced , "" said Usada in its reasoned decision published on Wednesday .
"" He was not just a part of the doping culture on his team , he enforced and re - enforced it .
Armstrong 's use of drugs was extensive , and the doping program on his team , designed in large part to benefit Armstrong , was massive and pervasive .
"" Ferrari , who is alleged to be Armstrong 's doping guru , was banned for life by the UCI in July but responded then by issuing a statement protesting his innocence .
Doping is a crime in Italy , and Ferrari was cleared on appeal in 2006 of criminal charges of distributing banned products to athletes .
But he could face new criminal changes as a long - running investigation by the Padua prosecutor Benedetto Roberti draws to a close .
He is believed to be investigating up to 70 people including about 20 athletes .
In the US , government lawyers were also poring over the documents amid speculation about whether a criminal case will be reopened against Armstrong .
A spokesman for Andre Birotte , the US attorney for the central district of California , who abruptly ended an earlier investigation , refused to comment .
Some US legal experts thought it unlikely due to the high burdens of proof associated with putting a criminal case in front of a jury .
Armstrong 's lawyers again condemned Usada .
One , Sean Breen , called the report a "" hatchet job "" and another , Tim Herman ,
said : "" What they call a reasoned decision is neither reasoned nor a decision . ""
The 41-year - old , who has raised more than $ 470 m for his Livestrong charity after recovering from cancer to win the Tour de France seven times , himself tweeted on Thursday : ""
Hanging @LIVESTRONGHQ w/ the team talking about next week 's events and plans for 2013 .
Ca n't wait to see so many friends and supporters .
"" A total of 26 witnesses including 11 fellow riders from the US Postal Service team testified against Armstrong in a doping case described as "" more extensive than any previously revealed in professional sports history "" .
Wiggins said the British cycling system may have saved him from being pulled into doping circles : "" Regardless of what team I was in , they supported me with the right way to deal with it .
They probably saved me otherwise it might have been me , who knows ?
The peer pressure was huge .
But the culture has changed .
"" The IOC said it was reviewing the report and supporting evidence .
A spokesman said that while it would be "" premature "" to say whether the IOC would take any action to strip Armstrong of the bronze medal he won in the time trial in Sydney in 2000 , he added : "" Should we come across any evidence that would justify opening a disciplinary procedure , we would of course act accordingly . ""
But Nike , Armstrong 's most high profile sponsor , said it would continue to back the former cyclist â€
“ reissuing an effusive statement of support that it originally put out in August .
"" Lance has stated his innocence and has been unwavering on this position , "" it said .
"" Nike plans to continue to support Lance and the Lance Armstrong Foundation , a foundation that Lance created to serve cancer survivors .
"" The brewing giant Anheuser - Busch , which supports the Livestrong foundation , also said it was standing by him for now .
Paul Chibe , vice president of US marketing for the company , told the Guardian : "" Our current relationship with Lance remains unchanged . ""
Sporting Kansas City 's stadium will also continue to carry the name of Lance Armstrong 's cancer charity Livestrong , said its chief executive .
But British Cycling performance director Dave Brailsford admitted that the allegations cast a cloud of suspicion over the entire sport on a day that the organisation had hoped to trumpet the fact it had added 1 m riders to its participation figures since its partnership with Sky began in 2008 and in the wake of a run of unprecedented British success .
"" It is understandable now for people to look at any results in cycling and question that , "" Brailsford told the BBC . ""
It completely and utterly lost its way
and I think it lost its moral compass . """
2012-10-11,"World cycling 's governing body , the International Cycling Union ( UCI ) , will not give an immediate response to claims made by the United States Anti - Doping Agency ( Usada ) over its role in what is alleged to be "" one of the most sordid chapters in sports history "" , but has promised not to "" delay matters any longer than necessary "" .
The UCI has previously said it was awaiting the full reasoned decision from Usada , which has banned Armstrong for life and stripped him of his titles over what it claims is "" the most sophisticated , professionalised and successful doping programme that sport [ cycling ] has ever seen "" , before commenting on whether it accepted the decision or planned to challenge its jurisdiction .
The organisation 's lawyers are poring over the 1,000 pages that make up Usada 's reasoned decision and supporting evidence and a UCI spokesman said on Thursday that it would be inappropriate to comment further until they had been able to examine it in detail . ""
The UCI will examine all information received in order to consider issues of appeal and recognition , jurisdiction and statute of limitation , within the term of appeal of 21 days , as required by the World Anti - Doping Code , "" the organisation said in a statement on Thursday . ""
The UCI will endeavour to provide a timely response and not to delay matters any longer than necessary . ""
In its reasoned decision , Usada argues that had the UCI wanted to challenge its jurisdiction in the case , it should have done so within 21 days of it "" asserting its results management authority "" on June 12 this year .
On that date , Usada 's chief executive , Travis Tygart , called the UCI 's president , Pat McQuaid , to inform him that proceedings were being initiated against Armstrong and also delivered a letter to that effect .
Usada further argues that the UCI is "" conflicted "" out of any role "" because it has publicly pre - judged the credibility of the witnesses and the evidence "" .
When Armstrong 's former team - mate Floyd Landis first accused the seven - times Tour de France winner in 2010 , McQuaid said the allegations were "" nothing new "" and sued Landis over his claims of a UCI cover - up .
The UCI won its case against Landis last month , with the former rider forced to pay McQuaid and the governing body 's honorary president , Hein Verbruggen , damages and promise not to repeat allegations against them .
And when another former team - mate , Tyler Hamilton , publicly accused Armstrong of doping in a long - form interview for 60 Minutes in the US in 2011 , Verbruggen said : "" That 's impossible , because there is nothing .
I repeat again :
Lance Armstrong has never used doping .
Never , never , never . ""
Usada said that amounted to evidence that even before its investigation was complete , the UCI had "" pre - judged and rejected "" the argument that Armstrong was involved in doping .
The 200-page summary of Usada 's verdict makes a series of claims against the governing body , including repeating allegations from Tyler Hamilton and Landis that Armstrong told both he had tested positive for the performance - enhancing drug , Erythropoietin ( EPO ) , at the 2001 Tour of Switzerland and "" stated or implied he had been able to make the EPO test result go away "" .
Hamilton said in his sworn affidavit that in 2001 Armstrong told him "" his people had been in touch with [ the ] UCI and they were going to have a meeting and everything was going to be OK "" .
Landis said that in 2002 he recalled Armstrong saying that "" he and Mr [ US Postal team director , Johan ]
Bruyneel flew to the UCI headquarters and made a financial agreement to keep the positive test hidden . ""
McQuaid has acknowledged that during 2002 , Armstrong and Bruyneel flew to its headquarters in May and made donations totalling more than $ 100,000 ( Â£62,000 ) to the UCI to help the development of cycling .
But the UCI "" vehemently denies "" that the meeting or payment was in any way tied to a cover - up of a positive test .
The Usada report goes on to state that the testimony of Landis and Hamilton is corroborated by the evidence of Dr Martial Saugy , the director of a World Anti - Doping Agency ( Wada ) accredited laboratory in Lausanne , that he was advised by the UCI that "" at least one "" of several samples detected as suspicious for the presence of EPO during the Tour of Switzerland belonged to Armstrong .
It also says that six Armstrong samples that formed the basis of allegations in a 2005 L'Equipe article about the 1999 Tour de France contained "" resoundingly positive values "" , according to a chart of the results recently obtained by Usada .
The samples were retrospectively tested for EPO by the French Anti - Doping Laboratory in 2005 , because a reliable test was not available until 2000 .
Wada and Usada argue that a subsequent UCI investigation inappropriately focused on whether the lab had followed established protocol , ignoring the fact that such results can be used to corroborate other evidence . ""
While the French Anti - Doping Laboratory 's analysis of the 1999 samples may not stand alone to establish a positive test under the code , the analysis is consistent with and corroborates the numerous witness statements recently obtained by Usada . ""
The report also alleges that Armstong and his team - mates benefited from anonymous tip - offs about when testers would be present .
According to another former team - mate , David Zabriskie , Bruyneel "" always seemed to know "" when drug testers would be coming , while another , Jonathan Vaughters , testified that Postal Service team members always appeared to have an hour 's advance warning of tests â€ “ enough time to use saline to mask the effects of using EPO .
During the 2009 Tour de France , the French anti - doping agency â€ “ jointly responsible for testing with the UCI â€ “ claimed that Armstrong benefited from "" privileged information or timing advantages during doping control tests "" .
On one occasion , testers were delayed for 30 minutes by UCI officials , it is claimed in the report .
Armstrong 's lawyer , Sean Breen , has called the Usada report a "" one - sided hatchet job "" .
"" Usada has continued its government - funded witch hunt of only Mr Armstrong , a retired cyclist , in violation of its own rules and due process , in spite of Usada 's lack of jurisdiction , in blatant violation of the statute of limitations , "" he said .
Tygart has now called on the UCI to "" act on its own suggestion for a meaningful truth and reconciliation programme "" .
He added : "" From day one , we always hoped this investigation would bring to a close this troubling chapter in cycling 's history and we hope the sport will use this tragedy to prevent it from ever happening again . "" ."
2012-10-11,"Lance Armstrong could end up in court facing allegations of perjury and an attempt to reclaim millions of dollars of bonus money if a Texas - based insurance company decides to try to win back a payment to the disgraced cyclist that was made for winning the 2004 Tour de France .
SCA Promotions had promised to pay Armstrong $ 5 m in bonus money if he managed five consecutive Tour de France wins , but refused to do so amid widespread media rumours of doping .
Armstrong took the company to arbitration , where he received a settlement of $ 7.5 m , made up of the original bonus plus interest and lawyers ' fees .
In the wake of a damning report accusing Armstrong of being at the centre of "" sport 's most sophisticated , professionalised and successful "" doping programme , there is every prospect that the issue will be legally revisited , perhaps including charges of perjury if Armstrong can be shown to have lied during testimony first time around .
Jeff Dorough , a lawyer for SCA , told the Guardian that the firm would await a reaction to the report â€ “ which was published by the US Anti - Doping Agency ( Usada ) â€ “ from the world cycling governing body , the International Cycling Union ( UCI ) .
The UCI has not yet officially responded to the Usada investigation .
"" We will readdress the issue when we see if there is inaction or action from UCI , "" Dorough said .
However , it is believed that it is likely that SCA will eventually take legal action , given the exhaustive nature of the Usada report .
In more than 1,000 pages Usada detailed the alleged doping using testimony from 26 people , including 15 riders with knowledge of Armstrong 's US Postal Service and Discovery Channel teams between 1998 and 2005 .
The study accused Armstrong , who has always protested his innocence , of effectively running a systemic blood - doping ring .
The SCA case is not the only potential legal threat to Armstrong .
An investigation into allegations that Armstrong used performance - enhancing drugs was dropped earlier this year by Andre Birotte , the US attorney for the central district of California .
Birotte 's office offered little explanation for the move , which came as a surprise to many in the global cycling community .
A spokesman for Birotte 's office , Bruce Riordan , said : "" Our office declines to comment on the matter in question . ""
Some experts , however , believe that the investigation may be reopened as widespread outrage over the allegations in the Usada report creates political pressure to explain why it was dropped in the first place . ""
The US attorney 's office is always subject to political pressures .
The criticism now will hit home and there is a good chance that the government will indict and charge Armstrong , "" said Peter Keane , a law professor at the Golden Gate University .
Mike Straubel , from Valparaiso University , agreed .
"" It is more of a political question than a legal one , but I would say there is a 70 % chance of the case being reopened , "" he said .
But others suspect there is little appetite for a re - opening a prosecution against Armstrong .
They argue that the likelihood is that government lawyers had already amassed the same evidence as Usada , but had been put off by the high burdens of proof associated with putting a criminal case in front of a jury .
The Guardian also understands that this aspect is a serious concern to government lawyers as they digest the reaction to the Usada report .
"" I think everything in the Usada report , the government already saw .
I do n't think it is new information to them .
Are they going to prosecute Lance Armstrong ?
I think the answer is no , "" said top California criminal attorney Paula Canny .
Canny said Birotte and his team were likely mindful of the political implications of taking on the Armstrong case again , as the alleged crimes took place several years ago and involve a man who is still deeply involved in the fight against cancer .
They would also likely base a case on issues like fraud , rather than steroid abuse in a sporting competition .
"" They have a different and very high standard of proof that they would have to get , "" she said .
Any decision by Birotte to re - open the Armstrong investigation would come after two other high - profile sports cases that ran into trouble .
In December 2011 , prosecutors were able to convict the baseball star Barry Bonds of obstructing justice , but not of steroid abuse .
In June this year , another baseball icon , Roger Clemens , was acquitted of all charges in a perjury trial over steroids .
"" If I were a betting man I would say they are absolutely , positively not going to re - open the investigation , "" said Professor Jordan Kobritz , chair of the Sports Management Department at SUNY Cortland .
Kobritz said that any criminal prosecution would be tough to prove to a jury and would cost millions of dollars .
"" It is a giant leap .
But even if you took [ that leap ] , there are better ways of spending taxpayers ' money than prosecuting Lance Armstrong , "" he said .
For the moment Armstrong is holding firm to his line that he has been the victim of a witch hunt .
His lawyer , Tim Herman , has called the Usada report a "" hatchet job "" put together by people with grudges to settle or personal interests to look out for .
That argument seems to have won through â€ “ for the moment at least â€ “ with sponsors and the cyclist 's charity , the Lance Armstrong Foundation , which is renowned for the Livestrong yellow bracelets that have become a world symbol of the fight against cancer .
The LAF president , Doug Ulman , backed Armstrong and slammed Usada . ""
Usada appears motivated more by publicity rather than fulfilling its mission .
Lance Armstrong 's legacy as a cancer fighter is literally second to none , "" he said in a statement .
Armstrong 's cancer work may also provide a cover for his many sponsors to stand by him , betting that the general public will still see his work in fighting the illness that nearly killed him as being far more important than his sporting behaviour .
The sports giant
Nike has issued a supportive statement and a host of other sponsors â€ “ representing everything from bikes to energy products â€ “ have simply declined to comment .
For Kobritz , that silence speaks volumes .
Even the Post Office â€ “ which sponsored his racing team â€
“ has declined to address the allegations .
"" A lot of people who think he 's guilty are going to say : ' So what ?
Maybe he did dope but look at what else he 's done , ' "" Kobritz said .
However , he added : "" If anyone still believes he was not doping , then they believe in Santa Claus . """
2012-10-11,"EPO and blood transfusions :
Injected Until 2000 there was no viable test for EPO , which boosts red blood cell production , thus improving endurance , and was taken by Armstrong and his team - mates under programmes devised by Dr Michele Ferrari , according to Usada .
Saline solution was used to lower hematocrit levels and evade detection , while Ferrari instructed George Hincapie to inject it directly into the vein , so reducing the window of detection to 12 hours .
At one stage , makeup was applied to Armstrong 's upper arm to hide bruising from an injection , the report says .
After the EPO test came in , blood transfusions became more popular .
Half - litres of blood were extracted , stored in fridges , then rigged up as drips on coat hangers and reinfused into riders , so replicating the effect of EPO .
Andriol :
Taken orally / through patches
Tyler Hamilton describes how he saw Armstrong using a mixture of Andriol , commonly referred to as liquid testosterone , and olive oil developed by Dr Ferrari , which was to be taken orally .
On at least one occasion during the 1999 Tour Armstrong squirted the "" oil "" into Hamilton 's mouth after a stage .
The testosterone , which boosts power , could also be dispensed through patches , which were to be worn overnight .
Because testosterone is naturally produced by the human body , it is difficult to detect in low doses .
Cortisone :
Injected or swallowed A steroid that reduces pain and inflammation , Cortisone is only prohibited if there is no medical need .
So US Postal Service and Discovery Channel team doctors would simply provide false declarations of medical need .
The Usada report claims Armstrong and his team - mates received Cortisone injections or took it in pill form .
During the 1999 Tour , Armstrong tested positive for Cortisone but had no medical exemption â€ “ so the team provide a backdated prescription for Cortisone cream for saddle soreness .
Human growth hormone :
Injected Several of Armstrong 's team - mates , and officials , testify to witnessing Dr Luis GarcÃ­a del Moral injecting human growth hormone , which as an anabolic agent increases size and power .
There was no satisfactory test for HGH between 1998 and 2005 and Wada is only now close to having one .
Actovegin :
Injected night before race
During the 2000 Tour , a discarded box of the anti - diabetes drug
Actovegin was found in a skip .
US Postal said at the time that it was used to treat road rash and Armstrong claimed never to have heard of it .
But his team - mates claim it was administered the night before a race to "" improve oxygen delivery to the muscles "" .
It is not currently banned but Usada said that the evasion of Armstrong and the team during an official French law enforcement investigation showed their willingness to lie ."
2012-10-11,"It was on the road to Lons - le - Saunier in central France on Friday 23 July 2004 that Lance Armstrong 's darker side was put on full public view early on the antepenultimate stage of the Tour de France .
The Italian Filippo Simeoni , a good rider who was a key witness in the trial against Armstrong 's trainer , Michele Ferrari , went on the attack and forced a place in what was set to be the day 's winning escape .
Out of the peloton came Armstrong , bridging the gap to the group alone .
For a maillot jaune to do such a thing was unprecedented , to do so a couple of days before sealing victory was bizarre , but so was what followed : the sight of Armstrong publicly telling Simeoni that he had no option but to slip out of the escape and back to the bunch .
If he did n't , Armstrong told him he would remain with the lead group , forcing the peloton to chase and wrecking its chances .
Simeoni was given two options : capitulate or betray his fellows .
Bitterly unhappy , he capitulated .
It was the act of a playground bully , performed with a bully 's lack of finesse , with the goal of ensuring that Simeoni would be put in his place .
Armstrong made it clear that this was revenge .
The price of going against Ferrari and , through the trainer , against Armstrong was made publicly visible .
It was not the first time , nor the last .
It has long been acknowledged within cycling that the man who dominated the Tour from 1999 - 2005 , and whose doping practices were detailed in a massive , meticulous report from the US Anti - Doping Agency , published on Wednesday , had something akin to a split personality : Dr Armstrong and Mr Lance .
On the one hand , Armstrong could be utterly charming , borderline flirtatious , in a press conference ; those close to him have made it clear over the years that he is well able to win over those he wants to .
On the other hand , Armstrong 's vindictiveness was known , from his habit of calling and making his views known to journalists who had asked questions he did n't like â€ “ doping questions in other words â€ “ to the many lawsuits that peppered his career .
This side of him was seen in 1999 when he told Christophe Bassons that , after writing columns claiming drugs were still in use , the French cyclist had no place on the Tour de France .
Bassons left the race , his morale in tatters .
Those who fell foul of Armstrong include the best American cyclist ever in the Tour de France , Greg LeMond , who spoke out after learning that Armstrong was working with Ferrari .
LeMond claimed that Armstrong had forced him to retract his statement about the Italian : "" [ Armstrong ] basically said ' I could find 10 people that will say you took EPO ' â€ ¦ The week after , I got multiple people that were on Lance â€
¦
Lance 's camp , basically saying ' you better be quiet ' , and I was quiet for three years .
I have a business
â€
¦
I have bikes that are sold ...
and I was told that my sales might not be doing too well if â€ ¦ just the publicity , the negative publicity .
"" The "" Reasoned decision "" by Usada to strip Armstrong of his seven Tour titles includes a brief section ( pages 146 to 153 ) entitled Evidence of Armstrong 's efforts to suppress the truth about his anti - doping rule violations .
The sections include Efforts to prevent witnesses from testifying ; Retaliation and attempted witness intimidation ; Retaliation against witnesses .
The section includes the Simeoni story , and it includes an abbreviated version â€ “ told in full in Tyler Hamilton 's book the Secret Race â€ “ of an episode in which Armstrong accosted his former team - mate in a restaurant in Aspen , Colorado , after it had emerged that Hamilton would testify against him .
The report states : "" Mr Hamilton has testified that in connection with this altercation Mr Armstrong said , ' When you 're on the witness stand , we are going to fucking tear you apart .
You are going to look like a fucking idiot.'""Hamilton further testified that Armstrong said , ' I 'm going to make your life a living â€ ¦ fucking â€
¦ hell ' .
""
An addendum in the report details Armstrong 's campaign against other witnesses : Betsy Andreu , the wife of his former team - mate Frankie Andreu , who gave details about an incident in 1996 in which Armstrong is said to have admitted drug taking to doctors treating him for testicular cancer : "" In response , Armstrong and his representatives have vilified Betsy Andreu , insisting in numerous forums and to many journalists that her testimony about Armstrong is motivated by ' bitterness , jealousy and hatred ' due , allegedly , to Frankie having not been re - signed to the USPS squad for the 2001 season . ""
Another who was targeted was Prentice Steffen , a doctor who spoke out against Armstrong after the newspaper L'Equipe claimed that EPO had been found in five samples from the American from the 1999 Tour when these were retested for research purposes .
The report states : "" Armstrong and his lawyers promptly followed up with TIAA - Cref , the cycling team with which Dr Steffen was employed at the time .
Due to Mr Armstrong 's stature within the sport of cycling , the management of the TIAA - Cref team ultimately concluded that if they did not remove Dr Steffen from his position with the team that the TIAA - Cref team might suffer repercussions .
As a consequence , Dr Steffen was removed from the team for a period of time . ""
As well as litigation and intimidation , Armstrong had the natural protection provided by celebrity and national hero status but he had a shield against his critics which was hard to penetrate : the place on the moral high ground given to him by his cancer charity work through the Livestrong foundation which he founded while fighting testicular cancer .
No one could deny his impact on the cancer community , no one could deny that he inspired those who had suffered from the disease and that in turn meant that those who criticised him could be accused of attacking a man engaged in charitable work .
That duality was perfectly illustrated on Thursday when the president of Livestrong , Doug Ulman , attacked Usada 's report and stated : "" Lance Armstrong 's legacy as a cancer fighter is literally second to none .
Because of his leadership and vision , the Lance Armstrong Foundation has served more than 2.5 million people affected by cancer over the last 15 years . ""
The bullying dope cheat and the cancer fighter .
Dr Armstrong and Mr Lance ."
2012-10-11,"One of the most disturbing stories to emerge from the United States Anti - Doping Agency report into Lance Armstrong is the case of David Zabriskie , who now rides for Garmin - Sharp and broke through as the first American to win stages in all three grand tours ( France , Italy and Spain ) .
This is how the Usada report describes his time with US Postal : "" In early 2003 David Zabriskie was 23 years old , a young man who had postponed a college education to see what he could make of himself in cycling .
He must have felt fortunate to be on Lance Armstrong 's US Postal Service Cycling Team .
Zabriskie was , no doubt , happy to be walking to a meeting at a cafe in Girona , Spain with the team director , Johann Bruyneel [ who has always denied involvement in a drugs programme ] , team doctor , Luis del Moral , and Zabriskie 's room - mate at competitions , and a somewhat older cyclist named Michael Barry .
Zabriskie was away from home , a young man in an unfamiliar environment , he did not know Spanish and frequently felt lonely , one of the younger cyclists on a team of hardened professionals .
However , on this day one would not have been surprised to find him expectant , hopeful .
Zabriskie had recently shown success in the early - season Four Days of Dunkirk , a four - day stage race in which he had finished in a surprising fifth place .
The result placed him in front of some well known racers at the time , men like Richard Virenque , Nicolas Jalabert and Laurent Brochard .
Zabriskie had been warmly congratulated by the assistant team director and perhaps sensed that Bruyneel might have important plans for him .
Bruyneel was respected by Zabriskie whose father had died a few years before , his life shortened by drug addiction .
Zabriskie had sought refuge in cycling .
Long hard training rides were cathartic and provided an escape from the difficult home life associated with a parent with an addiction .
He had vowed never to give in to the temptation to use , never to end up like his father , furtively using drugs to feed his dependency and eroding his physical health .
Barry was about five years older than Zabriskie ; however , Zabriskie had been on the USPS team a year longer .
The group met at or near a cafe , and the conversation proceeded in English .
Bruyneel got right to the point .
He and Del Moral had brought two injectable products for Zabriskie and Barry , something known as "" recovery "" and the banned oxygen booster , erythropoietin ( known as EPO ) .
Zabriskie was shocked .
This was the beginning of David 's third year on the team and he had not realised he would be required to dope .
He realised , of course , that some cyclists in the peloton and likely some team - mates fuelled their success with banned substances .
However , until now he had been largely shielded from the reality of drug use on the US Postal Service Team .
Zabriskie began to ask questions .
He was fearful of the health implications of using EPO , and he had a slew of questions : would he be able to have children ?
Would it cause any physical changes ?
Would he grow larger ears ?
The questions continued .
Bruyneel responded , "" everyone is doing it "" .
Bruyneel assured David that if EPO was dangerous no professional cyclists would be having kids .
David was cornered .
He had embraced cycling to escape a life seared by drugs and now he felt that he could not say no and stay in his mentor 's good graces .
He looked to Barry for support but he did not find it .
Barry 's mind was made up .
Barry had decided to use EPO , and he reinforced Bruyneel 's opinions that EPO use was required for success in the peloton .
The group retired to Barry 's apartment where both David and Barry were injected with EPO by Dr Del Moral .
Thus began a new stage in David Zabriskie 's cycling career â€ “ the doping stage .
Cycling was no longer David 's refuge from drugs .
When he went back to his room that night he cried . """
2012-10-11,"The release of the United States Anti - Doping Agency 's "" Reasoned Decision "" on Lance Armstrong 's use of performance enhancing drugs and organised doping by the US Postal Service and Discovery teams places in the public domain precisely the evidence that Armstrong had aimed to avoid being aired .
Usada noted that Armstrong had "" strategically avoided "" a court of arbitration hearing on his case ; and he must have hoped the report would stay on the shelf .
But Travis Tygart , Usada 's CEO , was never going to accept that .
In presenting the report , as promised , to the sport 's governing body , the UCI , Usada said it was publishing regardless â€ “ first , for the sake of transparency , and second , specifically to counter the efforts of Armstrong 's spokespersons to denigrate Usada witnesses .
Earlier in the day , in fact , Armstrong 's lawyer had dismissed Usada 's evidence as the testimony of "" serial perjurers "" .
Until now , Armstrong 's key accusers have been former team - mates Floyd Landis and Tyler Hamilton , both of whom had fought losing battles against their own doping charges .
Armstrong thus could credibly call them tainted witnesses .
What is immediately clear from Usada 's report , however , is the sheer weight of evidence , backed up by sworn affidavits from former team - mates with no such stain on their integrity : Jonathan Vaughters ( now Garmin team director ) , Christian Vande Velde , George Hincapie , Michael Barry , Levi Leipheimer , Tom Danielson and others .
Six riders now receive six - month bans for their admissions of participating in the systematic doping programme run by Armstrong , and allegedly by Johan Bruyneel and their helpers in the USPS and Discovery teams during the period of Armstrong 's seven Tour de France victories .
In earlier statements , when announcing that it was stripping Armstrong of his Tour titles , Usada had already laid out the charge sheet : systematic doping involving cortisone , testosterone , the blood - doping agent EPO , blood - doping itself , trafficking in performance - enhancing drugs , and a ruthless campaign of concealment , intimidation and misinformation .
The testimony now available in detail is compelling â€ “ sometimes almost comic .
According to two witnesses , the US Postal team doctor Pedro Celaya ( who is charged by Usada and will face a hearing later this year ) was thrown into a panic at the 1998 Tour de France by the Festina scandal , in which the French team was caught red - handed with a vast medicine cabinet of illegal drugs .
Celaya flushed tens of thousands of dollars ' worth of drugs down the toilet â€ “ though this would not have been much help if the French police had raided the team , because the toilet was in a camper van .
At the world championships that year , Usada reports , "" Celaya smuggled a bag of saline under his rain coat , getting [ it ] past the [ UCI ] tester and administering it to Armstrong before Armstrong was required to provide a blood sample .
"" It was a "" daring manoeuvre "" , as Usada says , to ensure Armstrong would not be disqualified for having too high a haematocrit level ( indicative of EPO use ) .
But it was n't enough to save Celaya 's job .
At the end of that season , Vaughters says that Armstrong complained to him that Celaya was much too conservative with the use of doping products .
One of Bruyneel 's first acts as Armstrong 's team manager for 1999 was to fire Celaya , and hire Dr Luis GarcÃ­a del Moral from the ONCE team .
According to Vaughters , "" Dr Del Moral was far more aggressive than Dr Celaya in providing doping products to riders . ""
( Del Moral was recently banned for life from the sport by Usada . )
More sinister is the report 's documentation of Lance Armstrong 's relationship with Michele Ferrari , the notorious Italian doctor and coach now banned for life from the sport .
Ferrari emerges as a central figure in the story : a sort of Svengali of systematic doping .
According to Usada , Armstrong 's relationship with Ferrari went back to 1995 â€ “ well before Armstrong was diagnosed with cancer .
After his comeback , the partnership was cemented , and Usada says it has bank records showing more than $ 1 m ( Â£625,000 ) in payments made by Armstrong to a Swiss company controlled by Ferrari , including $ 475,000 in 2003 alone .
The first recorded payments are in 1996 â€ “ a full five years before Armstrong publicly admitted to any dealings with Ferrari .
In the report , Armstrong 's loyal lieutenant in the pro peloton , George Hincapie , relates how he was encouraged to join the Ferrari programme and was told by team manager Bruyneel , who also faces a Usada case , that subscription to Ferrari 's services cost each rider $ 15,000 per season .
Vande Velde describes how he learned that the team 's nickname for Ferrari was "" Schumi "" â€ “ after the German racing - driver Michael Schumacher , who drove for Ferrari .
Another choice detail is that Ferrari liked to prescribe a blend of testosterone and olive oil for his riders , to aid recovery after hard training .
This was taken orally , under the tongue .
According to Usada , "" the evidence is overwhelming that from 1999 through 2005 Michele Ferrari played a major role with the US Postal Service / Discovery Channel team and in Lance Armstrong 's doping program "" .
After David Walsh of the Sunday Times revealed Armstrong 's relationship with Dr Ferrari , on the eve of the 2001 Tour de France , Armstrong stated : "" [ He ] [ Ferrari ] has never discussed EPO with me and I have never used it . ""
George Hincapie 's testimony is key to Usada 's evidence on this count : Hincapie joined the Ferrari plan in 2001 , and attests that both he and Armstrong engaged in Ferrari - managed blood - doping , using EPO and transfusions , through to 2005 .
Given that , until now , the chief accounts of this had come from Landis and Hamilton , the testimony of Hincapie , Vande Velde and others repeatedly corroborating the squad 's systematic blood - doping is devastating for Armstrong .
On page after page of the report , building a year - by - year picture of the doping plan , the footnotes carefully craft an elaborately cross - referenced body of sworn evidence .
Testimony from Landis , for example , is interwoven with material from the affidavits of "" clean "" witnesses like Hincapie , Vende Velde , Leipheimer and Danielson .
It is clear that Usada 's strategy has been to build up a case so overwhelming that it finally defeats Armstrong 's stonewalling tactic of denial , denial , denial .
Dr Ferrari was convicted in 2004 by an Italian court of "" sporting fraud "" for supplying riders with banned substances , including EPO .
At that point , Armstrong announced he was suspending professional contact with him .
The Usada report comments drily : "" Armstrong 's representation to the public concerning Ferrari was broken soon after it was made . ""
Hincapie , Leipheimer and Danielson all continued to work with Ferrari , and the latter attests that he and Armstrong both trained in Spain with Ferrari in early 2005 â€ “ the year of Armstrong 's seventh and final Tour victory .
Again , Usada followed the money â€ “ and has a record of a $ 100,000 paid by Armstrong to Ferrari in March .
One of the more unsavoury episodes in the Usada report comes from Vande Velde , who relates how , after Armstrong 's fourth Tour win in 2002 , he was called to a meeting by Armstrong and reprimanded for not following Ferrari 's doping programme assiduously enough .
Vande Velde said in an affidavit that "" the conversation left me with no question that I was in the doghouse and that the only way forward with Armstrong 's team was to get fully on Dr Ferrari 's doping program "" .
Accordingly , he stepped up his EPO use â€ “ because "" Lance called the shots on the team "" .
Usada 's language is uncompromising : noting that Armstrong 's behaviour amounts to a specific violation of the anti - doping code for aiding and abetting illegal drug use , the report labels him an "" enforcer for Dr Ferrari 's doping plan "" .
The report also sheds light on a notorious incident at the 2000 Tour de France , when , following Armstrong 's second win , French authorities launched an investigation after a container marked "" Actovegin "" was reportedly found in the team 's garbage bin .
A USPS spokesman issued a statement at the time claiming that the substance was not used by any rider , but was merely for treatment of a non - racing staff member suffering from diabetes .
Armstrong himself specifically denied using the drug .
Now , Usada says , Hincapie , Hamilton , Vaughters and Vande Velde all attest that the team was , in fact , using Actovegin as a performance - enhancing drug .
Actovegin is an extract of calf 's blood , which Vaughters said was used by the riders to "" enhance oxygen circulation and improve recovery "" .
In more than 200 pages , with hundreds more of affidavits , a comprehensive picture emerges of a scientifically developed , planned and managed doping programme â€ “ with Lance Armstrong at the centre of the intrigue , and its chief beneficiary .
Seeing the whole extent of it laid out , what is astonishing is that so much was kept quiet â€ “ hushed up by the "" omertÃ "" , the code of silence , of the pro peloton , as Tygart explicitly calls it .
He has called on the UCI to make good its own suggestion of a Truth and Reconciliation process to rid the sport of doping once and for all .
Now would be a good time for the UCI to act , finally ."
2012-10-11,"A devastating report into years of drug taking at Lance Armstrong 's United States Postal Service team described the squad as running "" the most sophisticated , professionalised and successful doping programme that sport has ever seen "" .
The 1,000-page report from the US Anti - Doping Agency sets out its case against Armstrong with damning clarity , depicting the former cycling hero , US national icon and cancer - campaigning champion as a bully who coerced his team - mates into using drugs and a cheat who paid hundreds of thousands of dollars for doping programmes . ""
His goal [ of winning the Tour de France ] led him to depend on EPO , testosterone and blood transfusions but also , more ruthlessly , to expect and to require that his team - mates would likewise use drugs to support his goals if not their own , "" concluded the report .
"" It was not enough that his team - mates give maximum effort on the bike , he also required that they adhere to the doping programme outlined for them or be replaced . ""
Armstrong fought back , as he always does , with his lawyers attacking the report as "" a one - sided hatchet job , a taxpayer - funded tabloid piece rehashing old , disproved , unreliable allegations based largely on axe - grinders , serial perjurers , coerced testimony , sweetheart deals and threat - induced stories "" .
A five - page letter from his lawyers , Timothy J Herman of Austin , Texas , also described Usada 's case as "" a taxpayer - funded witchhunt "" .
The most damaging testimony came from Armstrong 's close friend and long - time team - mate George Hincapie , who is widely viewed as having no axe to grind .
Hincapie states : "" At a race in Spain in 2000 Lance indicated to me he had taken testosterone .
Lance told me that he was feeling good and recovered , that he had just taken some ' oil ' .
When I heard that drug testing officials were at the hotel , I texted Lance to warn him to avoid the place ... ""
He adds that in 2003 Armstrong used his apartment to have a blood transfusion . ""
In 2003 Lance Armstrong contacted me about needing to do something private at my apartment in Girona because he had guests at his apartment .
I agreed and Lance came to my apartment with Dr Del Moral .
Lance and Dr Del Moral went into my bedroom and Dr Del Moral was carrying what I thought was a blood bag .
He asked to borrow a coat hanger and Lance and Dr Del Moral closed the door behind them .
They were in the room about 45 minutes to an hour which is about the time it generally takes to re - infuse a bag of blood . ""
As well as the testimony of Tyler Hamilton â€ “ whose revelatory book has just been named on the shortlist for the William Hill Sports Book of the Year â€ “ and Floyd Landis , both of whom testified after their personal fights against doping positives proved fruitless , the report lists nine witnesses who have no blot on their escutcheons : Frankie Andreu , Michael Barry , Tom Danielson , Hincapie , Levi Leipheimer , Stephen Swart , Christian Vande Velde , Jonathan Vaughters and David Zabriskie .
Of these , only Vande Velde , Danielson , Zabriskie and Leipheimer are still racing
â€ “ Hincapie and Barry retired a few weeks ago
â€ “ and they will face nominal six - month bans which will enable them to race again next season .
The Canadian Barry and Vaughters have both been proponents of anti - doping since leaving Armstrong 's service ; Vaughters was the founder of the Garmin - Slipstream squad which has been at the forefront of anti - doping since its inception in 2007 , while Barry , who has combined cycling and writing up to his retirement a few weeks ago , has spoken out against the practice in his published work .
Vande Velde and Barry describe being put in a position where they were left with no option but to dope .
"" I was in the doghouse and ... the only way forward with Armstrong 's team was to get fully on Dr Ferrari 's doping program , "" said Vande Velde , referring to Armstrong 's trainer Michele Ferrari .
Barry said : "" After being encouraged by the team , pressured to perform and pushed to my physical limits , I crossed a line I promised myself and others I would not : I doped . ""
Zabriskie 's evidence is similar , and is the more harrowing because he had come to cycling to avoid drugs , after his father 's life had been shortened by addiction . ""
He had embraced cycling to escape a life seared by drugs and now he felt that he could not say no and stay in his mentor 's good graces , "" states the report .
"" When he went back to his room that night he cried . ""
The report also claims to have evidence that Armstrong paid over a million dollars to Ferrari â€ “ whom he apparently nicknamed "" Schumi "" after the German Formula One driver : "" The evidence in this case also includes banking and accounting records from a Swiss company controlled by Dr Ferrari reflecting more than one million dollars in payments by Mr Armstrong , extensive email communications between Dr Ferrari and his son and Mr Armstrong during a time period in which Mr Armstrong claimed to not have a professional relationship with Dr Ferrari and a vast amount of additional data , including laboratory test results and expert analysis of Mr Armstrong 's blood test results .
"" The report quotes email correspondence from Stefano Ferrari to Armstrong in which Ferrari junior appears to be passing on training advice from "" Schumi , "" in 2009 , after Armstrong had returned to cycling and when he had stated publicly that they were no longer working together .
The initial paragraphs of the report 's "" Reasoned decision "" include an utterly damning passage about Armstrong 's era : "" Twenty of the twenty - one podium finishers in the Tour de France from 1999 through 2005 have been directly tied to likely doping through admissions , sanctions , public investigations or exceeding the UCI hematocrit threshold .
Of the forty - five ( 45 ) podium finishes during the time period between 1996 and 2010 , thirty - six ( 36 ) were by riders similarly tainted by doping . ""
Usada 's chief executive , Travis Tygart , described what went on at US Postal as a "" systemic , sustained and highly professionalised team - run doping conspiracy , "" adding : "" The USPS Team doping conspiracy was professionally designed to groom and pressure athletes to use dangerous drugs , to evade detection , to ensure its secrecy and ultimately gain an unfair competitive advantage through superior doping practices . """
2012-10-12,"There 's one victory that the US anti - doping agency can never strip from Lance Armstrong : he beat cancer .
More than that , he inspired a major cultural shift in how we view the disease and people afflicted with it : they 're no longer cancer "" victims "" , "" patients "" or "" sufferers "" .
They 're cancer survivors .
The disease is no longer to be endured ; it 's to be fought .
In 1997 , during his successful treatment , Armstrong established a small foundation , known as Livestrong .
The purpose was to fund testicular cancer research .
In its first year , it took in less than $ 250,000 .
Nine years and seven Tour de France titles later , Livestrong had sold more than 75 m $ 1 yellow wristbands , and had made Armstrong a global hero to millions .
But now that Armstrong has been stripped of those Tour titles , the question has been raised : does his charity work somehow make up for his bad behaviour as a sportsman ?
Is it OK that he cheated , somehow , because ( as more than one influential US sports columnist has written ) he "" does so much for cancer "" ?
Last year I made a thorough investigation of Livestrong for Outside magazine â€ “ what it does , and what it does n't do .
One thing it does n't do â€ “ contrary to popular opinion â€ “ is fund cancer research , in the sense of guys in white lab coats looking for a cancer cure .
Your Livestrong donation will not hasten that cure .
It does help cancer patients and their families "" navigate "" the patchy and hostile realms of the US healthcare system .
But it also does quite a lot to boost the stature and brand value of one Lance Armstrong .
In August 2009 , for example , the foundation spent about $ 7 m â€ “ a quarter of its annual spend â€ “ on a Dublin "" summit "" whose main purpose seems to have been presenting Armstrong as a kind of global statesman , on the same plane as his role models , Bono and Bill Clinton .
That seems a very long time ago .
This week , the US Anti - Doping Agency ( USASA ) released about 1,000 pages of evidence and testimony that Armstrong used banned performance - enhancing drugs and blood transfusions throughout his Tour de France career .
It is gruesome reading .
There is no more room for reasonable doubt .
In the sporting realm , he is utterly disgraced .
Should that opprobrium also extend to Livestrong ?
Without doubt , Livestrong has helped many people with cancer .
There are some good , dedicated people who work there ( their PR director certainly deserves a raise after what she 's been through this year ) .
And without doubt , Armstrong has inspired many more cancer survivors , just by having survived the disease himself , and triumphing as an athlete .
But as we now know , he has also been lying to them , for years .
He lies to them still , every time he repeats his tired denials .
How is that OK ?
A year ago , I predicted that Armstrong would lose his Tour titles .
I did not foresee , however , the extent to which Livestrong would be enlisted in his defence .
Every time there was a new eruption in the doping case , it seemed , Livestrong was launching some sort of new campaign or new "" outpouring of support "" for cancer survivors .
Anything to change the subject .
His lawyers shamelessly cited Livestrong in their letters and press releases , and even in court filings .
On more than one occasion , Livestrong - paid lobbyists were reported to have questioned congressmen and senators about the USADA investigation .
Charity funds were apparently being used to help the charity 's founder avoid doping sanctions .
Again : how is that OK ?
Why would anyone ( but a true believer ) ever write them a cheque , ever again ?
Livestrong may survive this storm .
If it does , one would hope that it is because of the public 's generosity toward its cancer - stricken fellows , and not because people have suddenly decided , in the 21st century , that poor ethics do n't matter any more , so long as the person in question has done sufficient charity work ( historical note : the Catholic church tried that during the middle ages , selling indulgences to make up for sins .
It did n't work out so well ) .
My analysis of Livestrong 's behaviour and its spending , though , leads to one inescapable conclusion .
In order to survive , perhaps it needs to strip Lance Armstrong of one more title : chairman ."
2012-10-12,"The Tour de France organiser , Christian Prudhomme , has called for Lance Armstrong 's seven victories in the world 's greatest cycle race to be erased from the record books following the release of a US Anti - Doping Agency report which said there had been systematic doping at the Texan 's US Postal Service team between 1999 and 2005 .
"" What we would like is for there to be no winner in those years , "" Prudhomme said .
Usada has called for Armstrong to be stripped of his titles and his third place in the 2009 Tour , but that has yet to be ratified .
If Prudhomme has his way , that would mean the Tours from 1999 to 2005 being left without a winner .
Prudhomme , who has been in the Alps reconnoitring stage finishes for the 2013 Tour , said that he was shocked by the findings of Usada .
"" We can not be indifferent to what Usada has uncovered .
It is a dark and deeply disturbing picture .
It has called into question a system and an entire era which remains stained for ever .
It is a lost decade . ""
The Tour organiser pointed out that he and his organisation do not have the power to remove Armstrong 's name from the Tour 's official records : that lies with the International Cycling Union , which is currently studying the 1000-page dossier drawn up by Usada . ""
As astonishing as it may seem , the Tour de France is not the master of its record books .
That goes through the UCI rather than the race organisers .
"" The UCI has yet to comment on the report or to indicate how it will react .
Quoting Victor Hugo â€ “ "" those who live on , fight on "" â€ “ Prudhomme added that in his view the only response to the report is a sharpened focus on anti - doping . ""
The problems which occurred in the Armstrong years meant that progress has already happened .
Cycling today bears no resemblance to yesterday 's cycling . ""
The anti - doping fight of recent years was based on those problems and there has been considerable progress in recent years : cycling has been a pioneer in areas such as targeted testing and the biological passport .
Today , the cheats are caught , and caught more rapidly than before .
We have to continue in this direction .
There is no other way . ""
Six years ago , the presentation of the 2007 Tour route in Paris featured a unique image : a shattered pane of glass to represent the first time the race 's winner â€ “ in this case the American Floyd Landis â€ “ had been stripped of his title .
Prudhomme now faces a challenge similar to that , ironically enough at the end of a process of revelation which was largely initiated by Landis , whose tardy confession to the US anti - doping authorities of years of doping at Armstrong 's side was the spark that led to Usada 's inquiry .
The difficulty faced by the UCI is that if it ratifies the Usada 's conclusions it is in effect ratifying a process over which it has taken contradictory positions ; a further difficulty is that sections of the report are deeply critical of cycling 's governing body , while one passage raises the possibility that the UCI failed to act on a positive test from Armstrong in the 2001 Tour of Switzerland , although it has always denied any wrongdoing .
If Usada 's decision is ratified , Prudhomme 's wish that there be no winner of the Tour from 1999 to 2005
has logic on its side , given that many of those who finished behind Armstrong in the upper reaches of the standings in those years have subsequently been banned for doping .
As the Tour head conceded , "" Our challenge is to regain credibility "" .
That process will be long and painful and an early decision from the UCI is a prerequisite ."
2012-10-13,"The former French racing cyclist Christophe Bassons , who was told to leave the Tour de France and "" go home "" by disgraced champion Lance Armstrong after speaking out about doping , said he did not feel bitter towards the American .
The 38-year - old Bassons , who was nicknamed "" Mr Clean "" , said he had no regrets at all about his refusal to take performance - enhancing drugs that led to him being shunned by colleagues and effectively ended his racing career .
"" I do n't feel bitter at all .
I think if you were to compare the situations today of both Lance Armstrong and myself you might ask who is the happiest , who is the most content , who feels the best about themselves and what they did ?
I certainly do n't have any regrets , "" he told the Observer . ""
Lance Armstrong can not be feeling very comfortable today .
"" Bassons earned the sort of celebrity that had eluded him on the road during the 1998 doping scandal that hit the French team , Festina .
After a car - load of drugs were discovered en route to the team 's riders during the Tour de France that year , it emerged that Bassons was the only member who had categorically refused to take any .
During the Tour the following year , Bassons wrote a column in Le Parisien newspaper saying he was "" shocked "" by the performance of Armstrong , who had overcome cancer to reach the front of the peloton .
Later in the Alpe d'Huez stage , Bassons said Armstrong rode up to tell him it was "" a mistake "" to have spoken out and asked the Frenchman :
"" Why do n't you leave , then ? ""
Shortly afterwards Armstrong confirmed the conversation on French television , saying : "" His accusations are n't good for cycling , for his team , for me , for anybody .
If he thinks cycling works like that , he 's wrong and he would be better off going home . ""
Later , racing with the FranÃ§aise des Jeux team , Bassons was shunned by fellow cyclists who refused to share their winning money with him .
The then French sports minister Marie - George Buffet remarked : "" What a strange role reversal .
Rather than fighting against doping , they 're fighting its opponent .
"" Bassons , who now works as a sports professor for the French ministry of sport and spends up to half of his time trying to prevent doping , said : "" I 'm not out to get him [ Armstrong ] .
Lots of people today are talking about Lance Armstrong , but there were lots of people like him then and there were lots of people who would have been like him if they 'd had the means to be .
Perhaps he has regrets about what he has done .
I do n't have any regrets about what I did . ""
He added : "" My career was not as a cyclist , my career is what I do now as a sports professor .
I was lucky to have the physical qualities to cycle
and I did so for six years .
If I had wanted to continue , to shut up and continue as others did , I could have done so , but I did n't .
A career like that did n't please me . ""
Asked if the outing of Armstrong had changed anything in cycling , Bassons said : "" I do n't think so .
After the Festina scandal in 1998 , perhaps doping on an individual basis changed , that 's all .
Nothing has changed .
The products have changed and we can detect some we could n't detect before , but the intention to cheat is always present .
It 's human nature . ""
He added : "" I do n't think this latest stuff changes very much and it does n't affect my life .
We 've known about Lance Armstrong for some time .
Today 's not the first time it 's come out , it 's just that today he 's facing legal action . """
2012-10-13,"Lance Armstrong was a magnificent performer .
To orchestrate the scale of his subterfuge and to lie consistently at such an elite level for more than a decade â€ “ live at press conferences , on TV , in books , even in court â€ “ was a performance worthy of a champion .
Of a champion liar .
But lying was just part of the artillery Armstrong deployed to keep the deception in place and to deny that he used performance - enhancing drugs in the course of cheating his way to seven Tour de France victories .
The deception was outlined in meticulous and shocking detail over hundreds of pages in the United States Anti - Doping Agency 's ( Usada ) report released last week .
Based on dozens of interviews , including with ex - team mates , the report accuses Armstrong and his handlers of being "" engaged in a massive and long - running scheme to use drugs , cover their tracks , intimidate witnesses , tarnish reputations , lie to hearing panels and the press and do whatever was necessary to conceal the truth "" .
Armstrong did n't just take drugs : he was the enforcer of a small mafia within professional cycling that moved ruthlessly against anyone who threatened to expose him or his collaborators .
He bullied and threatened team - mates , journalists and fellow cycling professionals and officials .
Just ask Emma O'Reilly , a masseuse on the US Postal Service team when Armstrong was leader .
She had a front - row seat and saw how he and the team operated .
She used make - up to cover - up Armstrong 's syringe bruises .
She helped ferry drug packages and delivered them in person to Armstrong .
At one point , he turned to her and said : "" Now , Emma , you know enough to bring me down . ""
A few years later , O'Reilly contributed to a book in which she recounted what she had seen .
Armstrong 's legal team went into overdrive .
They brought her to court .
Armstrong publicly called her "" an alcoholic and a prostitute "" .
They silenced her .
As she said : "" Lance tried to make my life a living hell .
There was intimidation , bullying and stress . ""
The most shocking aspect of the Usada report may not be what it tells us about "" the most sophisticated doping programme sport has ever seen "" , but what it tells us about the vindictive , mendacious , vicious character at the heart of this fraud .
Armstrong did n't just attack mountains with vigour , he attacked anyone who threatened to expose the truth of his doping .
He comes across less like a cyclist , more like a psychopath .
And this may not be the end of the story for Armstrong .
The US attorney 's office â€ “ which dropped an investigation into his alleged doping earlier this year â€ “ will very likely take an interest in the Usada report , particularly where it alleges that Armstrong perjured himself in the course of making seven sworn legal statements to a Dallas court in 2005 .
Armstrong , like most bullies , is also a coward .
Which is why he has chosen not to contest any of the evidence piled high and mighty in the Usada report .
If the US attorney 's office comes calling , that will not be an option open to him .
But there are also questions for others .
Not least for cycling 's world governing body , the UCI .
Under their watch , Armstrong and his cohorts corrupted and defiled the sport that they were supposedly overseeing .
Except that they were n't .
Their oversight was abject , abysmal , appalling .
In 2005 , when the L'Ã‰quipe newspaper leaked the details of Armstrong 's 1999 positive drug test , the UCI conducted an "" investigation "" in which Armstrong was cleared .
Dick Pound , the head of the World Anti - Doping Agency , said the UCI report was "" so lacking in professionalism and objectivity that it borders on farcical "" .
Why was the UCI so useless ?
As one cycling journalist observed last week , the governing body "" consistently , either through naivety , incompetence or complicity , concealed the worst excesses of a decade of doping "" .
Which was it â€ “ naivety , incompetence or complicity ?
This is the same body that accepted $ 125,000 from Armstrong to help fund the UCI 's anti - doping research .
How he must have laughed .
You could n't make it up .
Only Armstrong did â€ “ and the UCI bought it every time .
They have no excuse .
Journalists such as the Sunday Times duo David Walsh and Paul Kimmage were tenacious in their pursuit of Armstrong over a 13-year period , yet the UCI paid no notice .
And there are questions too for Nike .
The world 's largest sportswear brand have pledged to continue their commercial deals with the disgraced doper â€ “
they sell close to 100 items of Armstrong - related clothing .
Why would the world 's leading sportswear brand want to continue to be associated with a man who was at the centre of one of sport 's biggest frauds ?
Just do it , the Nike slogan says .
Do what ?
Should aspirant young sports enthusiast take Armstrong 's lead ?
Lie , bully , dope and cheat your way to the top ?
In a 2001 ad for Nike , Lance Armstrong said : "" This is my body and I can do whatever I want to itâ€
¦
Everybody wants to know what I am on .
What am I on ?
I 'm on my bike busting my ass six hours a day .
What are you on ? ""
That is a question that anyone associated with this debacle â€ “ the UCI , the journalists who failed to report properly what was happening , Nike â€ “ should now ask themselves ."
2012-10-13,"Peter Keen , the former performance director at UK Sport and the founder of today 's all - conquering Great Britain track cycling team , has called for the inception of a process of truth and reconciliation within professional road cycling to enable the sport to draw a line in the sand and move forward in the wake of the devastating revelations in Usada 's report into doping at Lance Armstrong 's US Postal Service team .
Keen launched the GB cycling squad in 1998 on the basis that it would be as distant as possible from professional road racing , which he viewed as tainted by doping .
Central to that distancing was a policy of no needles or drips being used by the team , and mandatory regular blood tests which ended up , insiders say , creating a data bank which was as detailed as the UCI 's biological passport .
The idea of a truth and reconciliation process is not a new one for him . ""
Based on what I 'd seen , what I 'd heard and been aware of , it was clear the truth needed to be out there , but that ca n't happen if it all turns into a witch - hunt .
What it would take is a group of trustworthy individuals to interview people on a basis of anonymity , capture the facts , and their output would be a dossier that says for this period of time , this is what people did , and most critically of all it would say this is what needs to be done to stop them doing it again .
For example , if it 's clear that team doctors who work independently may go native or do things which are wrong , because there is no chain of accountability , that would need to change . ""
Another option , Keen suggests , would be an anonymous deposition or confessional process .
"" Get everyone in a room , ' here are the forms ' , ' here are the questionnaires ' , put them in brown envelopes and put them in a box and go out .
And the key question would be : ' If you crossed the line and doped , when and where did it happen and who was around you ? '
""
The idea of a truth and reconciliation process was mooted briefly by the UCI president Pat McQuaid , who has yet to react to the Usada findings .
It was also raised by Travis Tygart , Usada 's head , who said : "" Allowing individuals like the riders mentioned [ in the Usada report ] to come forward and acknowledge the truth of their past doping may be the only way to truly dismantle the remaining system that allowed that era to flourish .
Hopefully , the sport can unshackle itself from the past . ""
Opinion within cycling is divided , with the UCI rejecting the idea at its congress in September in spite of support from its former anti - doping head , Anne Gripper .
One expert who has spoken out against it is Robin Parisotto , who said he did not think that "" a truth and reconciliation process would unearth anything that the public does not already know or suspect ; that doping is very sophisticated , highly organised and fosters an underlying culture of cheating that reaches down to the grassroots level of the sport .
Would every doping cyclist really want to go through the agony of reliving the lies and cover - ups , and implicate others around them in doing so ?
Would the UCI have the stomach to confront and defend potentially further damning confessions and allegations ? ""
For years there has been a feeling within cycling that until the truth about Armstrong and those around him
â€
“ Johan Bruyneel , Tyler Hamilton ,
Michele Ferrari â€ “ emerged , the sport would never move on .
But the question of what happens now is the critical one .
First up , there are the immediate ramifications .
A flock of chickens will come home to roost in the henhouse Armstrong has defended so vehemently for so long .
The Sunday Times has hinted that , not unreasonably , it will countersue him in the wake of the libel case the Texan filed against them in 2004 , which went his way and did so much to ensure writers and their editors treated any allegations about him with extreme care .
SCA , the company that insured Armstrong 's win bonuses and contested them when the first doping allegations against him emerged in 2004 , may well want to revisit the arbitration case against him .
There are further mutterings of perjury charges arising from the Texan 's flat denials that he had doped or that he was working with the trainer Michele Ferrari .
Merely rooting out anyone who is associated with Armstrong or named in the Usada report is not going to remove links to past scandals and create a squeaky clean sport as has been evidenced by the events of the past two days .
On Friday , Armstrong 's former directeur sportif Bruyneel quit from his post as the head of the RadioShack team in the wake of Usada 's findings about Armstrong .
The reins , it now seems , will be picked up by his deputy Kim Andersen , who tested positive for drugs no fewer than seven times , becoming one of the rare riders to earn a life ban in the days when it was virtually unheard of due to the leniency with which cheats were treated .
By Saturday morning , Matt White , the directeur sportif at Orica - Greenedge , the top Australian pro team , had confessed to doping during his time with Armstrong , and had resigned pending investigation .
White 's No2 is Neil Stephens , one of the nine Festina riders who were thrown off the Tour de France in 1998 after confirmation of systematic blood doping at the heart of the scandal which , until the Armstrong revelations , was the sport 's darkest hour .
Stephens never confessed to doping , stating that he thought he had been given vitamin injections .
"" There is still endless speculation about what people do and do n't do , "" acknowledges Keen , who says he is saddened by "" a massive contrast to an extraordinary summer of Olympic and Paralympic sport which in the vast majority of cases is untainted by what we 're talking about here "" .
He adds : "" But my perception is that the peleton wants to move on , because of the sheer lunacy of it all , the collective madness of everyone doing the same time and ending up poorer and less healthy for it .
The most important thing is to try and see it through the minds of the athletes , what it feels like , what they think .
"" You end up with a massive sample survey â€ “ which needs to be non - attributable â€ “ which can say what the scale of it was , how it was done , what was being done .
And if it 's still doable , things have to change .
You need to start with something that looks like truth or doubts will remain .
It is a massive opportunity for change within the sport but it needs leadership from the UCI and a collective response from the riders . """
2012-10-13,"In the wake of this week 's revelations in the Usada "" Reasoned Decision "" report into how Lance Armstrong 's USPS / Discovery teams ran "" the most sophisticated , professionalised and successful doping programme that sport has ever seen "" , I have seen the argument from several intelligent people ( no names , but here and here ) that perhaps , since they all seem to be at it anyway , the best thing would be to let them take drugs .
Then , at least , the view goes , we would have a level playing field in the sport .
Libertarian arguments often have some superficial seductions for big intellects , but ending anti - doping regulation in sport would not "" level the playing field "" .
It would , in fact , simply tip it further in favour of the cheats .
The short explanation for this : money .
Money , it is true , is always a distorting factor in sport .
In the British football premier league , success breeds success and the table is usually topped by the richest teams – and sometimes , a major investor ( a Russian oligarch or Malaysian magnate ) comes along and pours millions into a club and makes it a major player almost overnight .
In cycling , too , money buys results .
Team Sky currently has one of the biggest budgets in pro cycling : that pays for the best riders , the best equipment , coaching , nutrition and so on .
And all that undoubtedly helped Bradley Wiggins win the 2012 Tour de France .
But this kind of investment is relatively transparent : we can all see how it works plainly enough .
And money does n't buy total dominance .
No one expects Bradley Wiggins to win the next six Tours .
At the 2012 Tour of Britain , for example , the winner , Jonathan Tiernan - Locke , came not from Team Sky , but the tiny Endura Racing squad , with a fraction of Sky 's resources .
But if you add money to legalised doping in sport , Goliath will always kill David .
We know because we tried this .
Legalised doping was effectively where cycling was at when Lance Armstrong won his first Tour de France in 1999 .
There was no test , then , for EPO , the performance - enhancing drug which had already been poisoning the sport for nearly a decade .
In the absence of a reliable test , the governing body , the UCI , set blood parameters permitting a haematocrit of 50 % .
EPO works by stimulating the bone marrow to produce more red blood cells and thus increase the body 's oxygen - carrying capacity ( extremely useful in an endurance sport like cycling ) .
A normal haematocrit value in a trained athlete would be somewhere in the 40s , with a wide degree of natural variation .
By setting an arbitrary "" safe "" level of 50 % , the sport was saying , in effect , "" we know you 're going to cheat and we ca n't stop you ,
so we 're going to have [ yes ! ]
a level playing field that at least stops you overdosing . ""
But EPO is expensive .
And to get as close as you can to that 50 % level without straying above it and getting disqualified , you need an expert clinician , blood lab centrifuges and all sorts .
So teams put doctors on the payroll : doctors they could trust to help them cheat and stay shtum , which does n't come cheap .
And some of those doctors also supplied testosterone , human growth hormone , cortisone , Activogen , etc – depending on what the budget was .
We know from the Usada report that Lance Armstrong spent more than $ 1 m on the services of one single doctor , Michele Ferrari ; and that almost certainly did not account for all his drug supplies .
Thanks to the Usada report , we know what the best doping programme money can buy looks like .
And thanks to the 1998 Festina scandal , we also know what the cheap and desperate version looks like : a random cocktail of drugs stashed in the back of a car driven by a soigneur who was high himself , paid for by an impoverished French team from pooling the winnings of their meagre results .
Legalising this situation would only rubber - stamp what was already happening : a pharmacological arms race that ensured dominance for the best - funded , most professionally managed doping scheme ( USPS / Discovery 's ) , but which was a game of Russian roulette with their health for the sport 's poor relations ( teams like Festina ) .
No one in their right mind wants to go back there .
Cycling is still not clean , and never will be .
The financial rewards involved in the sport always create a temptation to cheat .
But thanks to the anti - doping agencies ( like Wada and its affiliates such as Usada ) , it is cleaner than it has been for decades .
Thanks , too , to outspoken anti - doping advocates like David Millar and Jonathan Vaughters – who have seen the damage done to the sport by their own and others ' doping experiences –
the image of the sport has changed , and with it , the attitude of sponsors .
The smart money in cycling now favours clean teams .
The virtuous cycle is every bit as easy to undo as the vicious cycle the sport got itself into during Lance Armstrong 's tenure at the top was hard to undo .
Which is what makes careless calls for a level playing field of free - for - all doping so irresponsible .
In the end , the choice is a simple one .
Who would you prefer to see winning the Tour de France : the greatest cyclist in the world or the dope - cheat with the biggest budget ?"
2012-10-15,"There is no worse fate that could befall a charity .
An organisation that does great things for its beneficiaries , only for its figurehead â€ “ its founder , its namesake â€ “ to be disgraced .
The Jimmy Savile Charitable Trust and Jimmy Savile Stoke Mandeville Hospital Charitable Trust are considering a change of name , even a change of mission .
The trustees of both charities overseeing funds totalling Â£5 m released a statement on 7 October saying they are "" in the process "" of considering a change of name , as well as "" actively looking at supporting , among others , charities that work with survivors of sexual abuse "" .
Its actions over the next week or so will decide its fate .
Such cases are extremely rare .
But then along came another .
Livestrong , also known as The Lance Armstrong Foundation , is facing similar issues .
Livestrong has taken a different tack to Savile 's trusts .
Arguably , being much larger charity ( a $ 500 m organisation , donating $ 29.3 m in 2011 alone ) , it has much more to lose .
Despite overwhelming evidence against Armstrong â€ “ a 1,000-page indictment from the US Anti - Doping Agency ( USADA ) , the testimonies of 26 people including 11 former team - mates , being stripped of all seven Tour de France titles â€ “ the chief executive of Livestrong Doug Ulman issued a statement on 10 October in full defence of its founder .
Questioning the impartiality and fairness of USADA , Ulman reiterated Armstrong 's "" legacy as a cancer fighter "" and said : "" We are deeply grateful for his leadership and incredibly proud of his achievements , both on and off the bike . ""
Alex Massey , senior policy officer at the Association of Chief Executives of Voluntary Organisations ( ACEVO ) , believes that , in the light of these two cases , charities will now be much more reluctant to associate themselves too closely with one person . ""
Certainly charities will be more cautious now , "" he says .
"" It reinforces the need to do your homework , if you are going to adopt the name of a well - known person as the main selling point or eye - catching feature of your brand . ""
There are numerous examples of charitable trusts named after individuals who are beyond reproach : Marie Curie Cancer Care , Joseph Rowntree Foundation , Mary Seacole House .
Massey argues that such names , "" carry an association that conveys a message in a concise way and gives you an idea of what the priorities of the charity 's mission are .
There can be value in that .
But clearly in the last week or so we 've seen that there are also risks attached .
"" A name change may be enough to survive if the charity can successfully disassociate itself from its former figurehead .
A Charity Commission spokesperson confirmed that many charities change their names , typically following re - brands or mergers .
However they "" would normally need to seek permission from the Charity Commission if they wish to change their charitable objects ,
ie what they are set up to do ...
If trustees decide that a charity is no longer viable , either because of reputational issues or otherwise , they may take the decision to wind the charity up .
In this case , they must give any outstanding funds to a charity that works in the same general area that their charity did . ""
Andy M Turner , a PR consultant for multinational organisations , thinks a change of name is "" almost certainly the best course of action "" in such instances "" because they 'll be forever tainted if not "" .
He describes the Savile and Armstrong cases as timely reminders that "" celebrity reputations tumble at lightning speed "" and recommends having a risk management plan in place for such eventualities : "" The last thing you want is to be caught on the back foot , making it up as you go along and possibly making a disastrous move under pressure . ""
Livestrong , however , may survive intact because its achievements in fighting cancer arguably outweigh the issue of cheating in sport .
Nike has backed its star , saying it "" plans to continue to support Lance and the Lance Armstrong Foundation , a foundation that Lance created to serve cancer survivors "" .
Joe Favorito , sports marketing expert and professor at Columbia University , told CBS on Saturday that he believed the charity will survive this crisis : "" This is one of the rare instances where the charity is actually bigger than the celebrity ...
When people think about Livestrong , they do n't necessarily think about Lance Armstrong , and that 's not true with a lot of celebrity charities . ""
He added : "" I think the charity will continue ...
What happens to Lance Armstrong , that 's a totally different story . ""
On 19 October , Livestrong celebrates its 15th anniversary with a fundraising gala .
Major donor Jeff Mulder , who recently purchased two tables at the event for $ 150,000 , told Associated Press : "" I do n't do stuff for Livestrong because of Lance .
He got it started , but I raise money because people have cancer . ""
Armstrong has so far insisted that he will attend , telling his 3 million - plus followers on Twitter last week that he was helping to plan the event and "" ca n't wait to see so many friends and supporters "" .
Only time will tell whether both star and charity can brave out the situation .
If there is a lesson for the charity sector here , it may be a cautionary one of living and dying by the actions of one person .
Ceri Edwards , a director of policy and communicationsat the Institute of Fundraising , argues that "" charities of all sizes , locally and nationally , have always been grateful for the endorsements they get from celebrities and well - known supporters for their work .
The appalling allegations currently surfacing should n't detract from [ that ] . ""
Perhaps some charities have gone so far down the celebrity route that it would be hard to turn back even if they wanted to .
Elaine Smethurst , a former executive at NSPCC and the NCVO , is now an independent consultant and part - time managing director of small gambling addiction charity the Gordon Moody Association , named after its founder , the Rev Gordon Moody . ""
I think if I were creating a charity from scratch [ today ] , I would try to go for an issues - based name and choose celebrities to be associated with the charity but not necessarily name the charity after them ...
"" I would n't say ' do n't do it ' , "" says Smethurst .
"" Use celebrities as much as you can to get your name out there and get the money in .
But putting all your eggs in one basket is probably not the best idea . ""

2012-10-17,"One week after the publication of the Usada report that revealed the gory details of Lance Armstrong 's doping , laying to rest any remnants of his sporting credibility , the public persona of the former seven - times Tour de France winner began disintegrating .
With damage limitation clearly their goal , Armstrong 's long - time backer Nike dropped the Texan .
By the end of the day a number of other long - time sponsors followed suit .
Anheuser - Busch , brewers of Budweiser , cut their ties as did Trek bicycles and Honey Stinger , a maker of foods and gels for athletes .
Radio Shack were reported to have dumped Armstrong while sunglasses maker Oakley said they were "" reviewing their relationship "" with the disgraced cyclist .
Almost simultaneously to the Nike announcement , Armstrong stood down as the chairman of the cancer foundation Livestrong , which he had founded just over a year after his diagnosis for testicular cancer in September 1996 .
Armstrong 's resignation from Livestrong came in advance of a ball on Friday in his hometown of Austin , Texas , to celebrate the 15th anniversary of the foundation 's inception , with thousands expected to attend , including stars such as the actor Robin Williams , a longstanding Armstrong fan .
A statement from the charity said that "" to spare the foundation any negative effects as a result of controversy surrounding my cycling career , I will conclude my chairmanship "" .
Explaining his decision to employees in a conference call
Armstrong reportedly told them "" I 've been better and I 've been worse "" when asked how he was feeling .
Following publication of the massive Usada report condemning Armstrong as a serial drug taker â€ “ who coerced team - mates into blood doping and bullied witnesses who attempted to blow the whistle on him â€
“
Nike had stated only a week earlier that they would stand by their most prominent athlete .
This was an abrupt U - turn , citing "" seemingly insurmountable evidence that [ Armstrong ] participated in doping and misled Nike for more than a decade "" .
That brought to an end an association which had lasted since Armstrong 's first Tour win in 1999 , and at one time seen the US company produce the Tour de France leader 's celebrated yellow jersey .
The Armstrong sponsorship had spearheaded the company 's move into cycling clothing on the back of his Tour successes , and he was said to earn about $ 7.5 m ( Â£4.6 m ) annually from the connection .
The sponsor added : "" It is with great sadness that we have terminated our contract with him .
Nike does not condone the use of illegal performance - enhancing drugs in any manner .
Nike plans to continue support of the Livestrong initiatives created to unite , inspire and empower people affected by cancer . ""
A spokesman also confirmed Nike will change the name of the Lance Armstrong Fitness Center at its world headquarters in Beaverton , Oregon .
Livestrong , Armstrong and Nike are a closely - knit trio thanks to the sportswear company 's production of the yellow silicone Livestrong wristband which was introduced in May 2004 .
It has sold more than 80 million units , and having been initially launched to raise $ 25 m ( Â£15.4m)for the cancer charity , achieved its target within six months .
It was worn by many of the riders in the 2004 Tour , which was won by Armstrong , and has been seen on the wrists of celebrities as diverse as the actor Matt Damon and various US presidential candidates .
Recently , there have been reports of wearers crossing out the "" V "" to create the motto "" LieStrong "" .
As well as possible moves by these sponsors , Armstrong faces other issues in coming weeks if the UCI ratifies the Usada decision to strip him of his Tour titles .
The Sunday Times will look to recover around Â£1 m in costs arising from a libel case in 2004 ; Armstrong could also face a counter suit from promotions company SCA which insured bonuses for four of his wins to the tune of $ 12 m ( Â£7.4 m ) ."
2012-10-17,"Nike has severed its connections with Lance Armstrong , finally acknowledging the "" seemingly insurmountable "" evidence that that the seven - times Tour de France winner was a drugs cheat .
In a near - simultaneous statement , Armstrong said he would relinquish his position as chairman of Livestrong , the cancer charity he founded , in order to "" spare the foundation any negative effects "" after a damning report by the United States Anti - Doping Agency ( Usada ) , which concluded he ran a sophisticated doping ring for years .
Armstrong 's decision to step down from Livestrong allowed Nike to continue to support the initiative .
In the US , 98 products bearing the Livestrong name are sold by Nike .
Nike â€ “ which initially indicated that it would stand by Armstrong â€
“ said in a statement it had been misled by Armstrong and did not "" condone the use of illegal performance - enhancing drugs "" .
The full statement said : "" Due to the seemingly insurmountable evidence that Lance Armstrong participated in doping and misled Nike for more than a decade , it is with great sadness that we have terminated our contract with him .
Nike does not condone the use of illegal performance enhancing drugs in any manner . ""
Nike plans to continue support of the Livestrong initiatives created to unite , inspire and empower people affected by cancer . ""
Armstrong has been dogged for years by allegations that he cheated his way to his Tour de France titles , while he was lead cyclist with his US Postal Service and Discovery Channel teams .
Last week , Usada released a 1,000-page dossier which concluded that what had transpired amounted to "" the most sophisticated , professionalised and successful doping programme that sport has ever seen "" .
Despite strongly denying the doping allegations , Armstrong elected not to fight Usada 's claims , saying he thought the process was unfair .
The loss of the Nike deal will come as a financial blow , but stepping down from Livestrong is likely to be more personally damaging .
Armstrong , a cancer survivor , set up the foundation in 1997 , in order to help inspire others battling the illness .
His inspiring story , of recovering from testicular cancer that had spread to his lungs and brain and then winning the world 's most famous cycle race , helped the foundation grow from a small operation in Texas into one of the most popular charities in the US .
The cyclist insisted he was drug free at a time when doping was rampant in professional cycling .
In 2004 , the foundation introduced yellow "" Livestrong "" bracelets ; more than 80 million were sold , creating a global symbol for cancer awareness and survival .
Armstrong , who was not paid a salary as chairman of the Lance Armstrong Foundation , will remain on its board , but his duties will be handed to the vice chairman , Jeff Garvey . ""
This organisation , its mission and its supporters are incredibly dear to my heart , "" Armstrong said in a statement on Wednesday . ""
Today therefore , to spare the foundation any negative effects as a result of controversy surrounding my cycling career , I will conclude my chairmanship . ""
As chairman , Armstrong did not run the foundation 's day - to - day operations , which are handled by the Livestrong president and chief executive , Doug Ulman .
Ulman had said that Armstrong 's leadership role would not change .
Armstrong 's statement said he would remain a visible advocate for cancer issues .
He is expected to speak at Friday night 's 15th - anniversary gala for Livestrong in Austin , Texas . ""
My family and I have devoted our lives to the work of the foundation and that will not change , "" Armstrong said .
"" We plan to continue our service to the foundation and the cancer community .
We will remain active advocates for cancer survivors and engaged supporters of the fight against cancer . """
2012-10-17,"How quickly empires crumble .
Wednesday 's announcement that Lance Armstrong has stood down from his position as chairman of his Livestrong cancer charity and lost the backing of Nike means the collapse of the entire Armstrong edifice that mushroomed so quickly between 1999 and 2001 , when , almost overnight , the Texan went from being a relative obscurity – the cyclist no European team wanted when he was seeking employment in 1997 – to a sporting icon , with the wealth and the connections that go with these things .
The Nike move is a defining moment in the Armstrong saga , as the corporation has a history of sticking with its athletes , a case in point being Tiger Woods during his marital troubles .
It is also defining because of the extent to which the corporation bought into cycling , establishing a massive presence on the ground during the Tour de France , part of the American invasion of the race in the early noughties which led , in part , to Armstrong 's lack of popularity in France .
The end of Armstrong 's chairmanship of Livestrong has other implications .
Like Nike , the charity bought into the Tour de France , most famously late on in his reign , printing vast numbers of mottoes in yellow paint supporting Armstrong on the tarmac .
But critically , it ends the notion that in attacking Lance over doping , the cancer community is being put under assault .
That was part of the fiction that supported the seven - times Tour winner for so long against his attackers ; while you would need to be a cynic of the first order to claim he founded the charity as a deliberate front for his doping , it can not be denied that it served his purposes later .
There is not a great deal left now for the Texan , other than a belated confession which will do nothing to repair his reputation .
In its sheer scale and the significance of the personalities involved , the Armstrong saga already far outstrips the defining doping scandal within cycling , the Festina debacle of 1998 .
But like the Festina scandal , Lance - gate has acquired a life and momentum of its own .
Not only does it touch corporate America and the world of high - profile celebrity charity – how long will the likes of Robin Williams be sticking with him , one wonders ?
–
its tentacles reach into so many corners of the cycling world .
On 12 December , a court case brought by the International Cycling Union against the writer Paul Kimmage will be heard in a Swiss court ; the governing body is suing the writer for having alleged that it covered up a positive test involving Armstrong in the Tour of Switzerland in 2001 , a charge it vigorously denies .
A defence fund within the cycling community has raised over $ 60,000 ( £ 37,000 ) to support Kimmage in a matter of weeks , and with the allegations repeated in the Usada report , the case looks set to test the robustness of the UCI 's assertions that it did not give Armstrong favourable treatment over the years .
The UCI , its president , Pat MacQuaid , and its honorary vice - president , Hein Verbruggen , are increasingly under pressure over their treatment of the man who was the biggest star the sport had ever produced .
Its former head of anti - doping Anne Gripper has publicly questioned the UCI 's decision to allow Armstrong , as he made his comeback to racing in 2009 , to compete outside the six - month window – albeit by a mere 13 days – within which he was required to be available for random drug - testing .
It is not just the UCI in the firing line .
The long list of cyclists named in the report who either confessed to doping in the Armstrong era or are connected to him and his trainer Michele Ferrari means that many teams are now under strutiny .
That was shown on Tuesday when the Belgian squad Omega - Pharma - Quickstep sacked the American Levi Leipheimer , who had confessed to doping as part of his testimony against Armstrong .
There has been some hard thinking at Team Sky as well , prompted by the presence of testimony from their former rider Michael Barry in the Usada file , in which the Canadian admitted to doping in the years before he joined the British team , and media questions over their hiring of the former Rabobank doctor Geert Leinders , which went against their principle that their team medics would come solely from outside cycling .
The connection between the Sky road captain Michael Rogers and Armstrong 's Italian trainer Ferrari , albeit during the 2005 season and with Rogers denying any wrongdoing , has also been made public by the Usada file , while they may also be wondering about the historic link between the Texan and their lead directeur sportif , Sean Yates , who worked at Armstrong 's Discovery Channel in 2005 and was his mentor at the Motorola team from 1992 to 1996 .
They will now beef up their zero - tolerance policy on riders and staff with connections to doping and ask them to sign a statement confirming they have never been involved in any wrongdoing ."
2012-10-17,"Team Sky , winners of the Tour de France this year with Bradley Wiggins , have decided to reinforce their zero - tolerance doping policy on staff and riders in the light of the Lance Armstrong affair and because of the possibility of further revelations emerging .
"" I do n't want a team with anybody in it who has been involved in industrial doping , "" said the Sky head Dave Brailsford , who compared the impact of the Armstrong revelations to "" an atomic bomb in the sport "" .
All Sky staff and riders will be interviewed in the light of the Armstrong inquiry to attempt to find out where they stand now and whether they have anything more to say about their past than when they were hired .
They will be asked to sign an agreement they have not been involved .
The interviews began on Wednesday and will continue indefinitely , and will be carried out to a standard format , primarily by Brailsford and the GB psychiatrist Steve Peters .
The Armstrong report , said Brailsford , "" makes you think fundamentally about what you are doing .
We need to stop , reassess where we are at .
We 've won the Tour clean , there 's been nothing untoward , no one has spoken about any concerns or suspicions , but we want to look at it all again . ""
He set no time limit on the process .
"" It might take years .
But we 've got a bunch of great young riders on our team , we 've got to work towards their future , not let the past drag them down . ""
"" We will sit down with every member of staff , every rider , have an interview , a discussion , "" said Brailsford .
"" It wo n't be sitting in a room with a light in their face .
It will be a supportive discussion whereby we can encourage the truth .
The information now , the context now , is different to what it was before .
I 've read the report and found it quite shocking , the light of that will direct the discussions . ""
"" The shadows of the past are impacting upon us , maybe more than we were expecting , "" added Brailsford , conceding that members of his staff or riders may not have told him the full story .
"" We tried to have a [ zero - tolerance ] policy and we are not going to change that .
It has proved very challenging to implement .
It 's back to basics , we are looking at it all again .
"" Most notably historically , the process failed to uncover that the Canadian Mike Barry had been doping in his time at Armstrong 's US Postal Service team – he was one of the 11 former team - mates who gave evidence against Armstrong and admitted doping – and that the doctor Geert Leinders had connections which subsequently the team felt were damaging .
Brailsford must now make decisions regarding his road captain Mike Rogers – who denies any wrongdoing but was named in the Usada report as being linked to Armstrong 's trainer Michele Ferrari – and lead directeur sportif Sean Yates who worked at Armstrong 's Discovery Channel team but again denies any involvement with doping programmes .
There is no suggestion in the Usada report that either has been involved in doping while Yates insisted on Wednesday night : "" I worked with Lance but never had any inclination this type of practice was going on , "" he said .
The likelihood is that some members of the team will leave , but Brailsford said he had no idea how many .
What is certain is that there will be no amnesty .
Brailsford said he felt that doping should have consequences .
"" I do n't believe in a general pardon .
I 'm not sure [ riders ] can turn round and just say ' OK , I did that . '
The challenge is trying to achieve a balance between supporting someone , not throwing them out of the door and never seeing them again , saying we will support you , this is an opportunity , but if you lie again , there will be no support at all . ""
He added "" I 'm not saying people ca n't be rehabilitated , but [ zero tolerance ] was our stance when we started
and I want to see it through . ""
However , Sky 's aim , stated Brailsford , is to end up with a team which can not be questioned .
"" I 've worked with a lot of guys in British Cycling over the years , with no past history .
I 'd like to have a team of people like that .
It is a challenge .
If our performances go backwards , if they go back to square one , I can accept that . ""
Brailsford conceded that he had made an error in hiring the Rabobank doctor Leinders , who was in place at the Dutch team in 2007 when it became embroiled in a scandal over the Dane Michael Rasmussen but was never convicted of any wrongdoing .
That went against the team 's policy of not hiring medical staff with past involvement in cycling .
Asked why he had not retained Leinders , Brailsford said : "" It was not about medical practice , there was some information coming out that we had n't been aware of . ""
"" He was a brilliant doctor , he was more forceful on [ doping ] issues than anybody .
We went through the screening process with him , he sat down with [ Sky and GB psychiatrist ]

Brailsford hired Leinders in the wake of the death of the team 's carer Txema González and said his primary concern was to resolve medical issues rather than communicate the change of policy to the media .
He added that their recruitment policy would be tightened in future .

2012-10-19,"The Dutch banking group Rabobank is to pull out of the sport in the wake of the Lance Armstrong doping revelations after almost 30 years of continuous involvement , saying it is "" no longer convinced "" professional cycling can be realistically viewed as clean .
The surprise announcement will see Rabobank 's distinctive orange and blue jerseys disappear from its men 's and women 's professional teams at the end of the year , though the financial support , worth more than Â£12 m a year , will continue for a period .
In a statement Rabobank said it had made its decision following the publication last week by the US Anti - Doping Agency of an exhaustive and damning report into the organised doping activities of Armstrong , the now - disqualified seven times Tour de France winner , and his US Postal team .
The report has sparked fresh coverage about the endemic nature of drug use in professional cycling during the Armstrong era .
The Usada report "" speaks volumes "" about the sport , Rabobank said .
Bert Bruggink , a member of the bank 's managing board , said : "" We are no longer convinced that the international professional world of cycling can make this a clean and fair sport .
We are not confident that this will change for the better in the foreseeable future . ""
He continued : "" Cycling is a beautiful sport , which millions of Dutch people enjoy and a large number of those Dutch people are clients of Rabobank .
But our decision stands : we are pulling out of professional cycling .
It is painful .
Not just for Rabobank , but especially for the enthusiasts and the cyclists who are not to blame in this .
"" The announcement comes the day after a Spanish Rabobank rider , Carlos Barredo , was suspended for possible doping , though there is no indication the two are linked .
The 27-strong men 's team , more than half of whom are Dutch , and the women 's squad , led by the 2012 Olympic road race champion Marianne Vos , will not be immediately broken up but will continue to ride under the "" white label "" of a new foundation , the teams ' managers said in a statement .
"" We will honour our contracts with the riders , "" Bruggink told a press conference , according to Cycling News .
"" The pro teams come in a separate foundation and hence contractual and financial obligations are unconditional .
"" The announcement was nonetheless unexpected and brought criticism , with Robert Gesink , a Dutch Rabobank rider , saying he was "" extremely bitter that we are now paying for what happened in the past "" .
David Millar , the British rider who returned from a drugs ban to play a leading role in the vehemently ani - doping Garmin squad , was even more vehement , tweeting : "" Dear Rabobank , you were part of the problem .
How dare you walk away from your young clean guys who are part of the solution .
Sickening . ""
Millar 's point is that the Dutch bank stood by the team even when they were embroiled in some of the worst aspects of the doping era .
In 2007 Rabobank looked set to gain their only Tour de France win through Michael Rasmussen , who led the race with four stages to go .
But the Danish rider was sacked by the team as pressure built over his failure to attend a series of earlier doping tests .
Levi Leipheimer , one of Armstrong 's key Tour de France lieutenants who confessed to doping as part of the Usada investigation , is a former Rabobank rider .
The Usada report named another former rider for the team , Johan Bruyneel , who went on to manage Armstrong , as a key player in the doping conspiracy , charges he says he will fight .
The decision is a significant reverse for professional cycling as it seeks to emerge from the shadow of Armstrong 's legacy and convince the public and other sponsors it is becoming largely drug - free .
These efforts have been boosted by the appearance of vehemently and publicly anti - doping teams , also including Team Sky , led by Britain 's 2012 Tour de France winner , Bradley Wiggins .
In the wake of the Armstrong revelations Sky this week announced they would oblige all staff and riders to sign a pledge saying they have never doped .
Rabobank 's departure is all the more significant given both the company 's long association with cycling and its base in the Netherlands , one of the most enthusiastic cycling nations in the world ."
2012-10-20,
2012-10-22,"Lance Armstrong faces imminent legal action over a $ 7.5 m bonus paid out by a Texas insurance firm that had accused the disgraced cycling champion of taking performance enhancing drugs .
SCA Promotions ' move comes after Armstrong was stripped of his seven Tour de France titles by the International Cycling Union ( UCI ) and lost deals with sponsors including Nike and Oakley .
Armstrong 's latest woes relate to an insurance policy taken out by Tailwind Sports , then owner of Armstrong 's US Postal team .
It asked SCA , a Dallas - based insurer , to cover a $ 5 m performance bonus that was eventually paid to Armstrong after he won his sixth Tour title in 2004 .
SCA and Armstrong clashed after the insurer said the champion rider may not have been a clean rider .
Armstrong sued and was awarded the $ 5 m bonus plus $ 2.5 m in damages and costs .
The UCI stripped Armstrong of his titles after the United States Anti - Doping Agency ( Usada ) concluded in a 1,000-page report that Armstrong and his US Postal and Discovery Channel teams had colluded in what it called "" the biggest doping conspiracy in the history of sport "" .
Jeffrey Dorough , SCA 's general counsel , said : "" None of this was news to us .
We fully stand behind Usada 's efforts to clean up sport .
This has been a fully open and transparent process . ""
In a statement the company said that it was "" considering all legal options to pursue a return of the funds paid by SCA to Mr Armstrong .
Mr Armstrong is no longer the official winner of any Tour de France races and , as a result , it is inappropriate and improper for him to retain any bonus payments made by SCA .
"" If the funds are not returned to the company , it intends to launch a formal legal action against Armstrong that could come before the end of the month ."
2012-10-22,"Amid admissions that cycling was facing its worst crisis â€ “ and even debate over whether it could survive â€ “ the UCI president , Pat McQuaid , in increasingly ragged attempts to draw a line under the blighted Lance Armstrong saga and move on , included one statement that spoke volumes .
It was a defensive response to a query about whether the UCI could remain both policeman and promoter of the sport and it cut to the heart of the debate about what a sport 's governing body should be and whether it is inherently conflicted when it comes to tackling doping .
Asked whether the promotional and regulatory functions of cycling should be formally split , McQuaid said : "" I do n't see why we should .
We are responsible for the regulation , the development and the promotion of cycling worldwide .
That includes
anti - doping . ""
From amid the alphabet soup of international federations , national governing bodies , national anti - doping organisations and law enforcement agencies , the World Anti - Doping Agency must somehow corral a coherent approach to the issue .
While Wada , which has an annual budget of Â£17.8 m from national governments and the Olympic movement , can provide a framework for the rules it is largely down to federations and individual countries to enforce them .
David Howman , the Wada director general , has conceded that the set - up is far from ideal . ""
The model we 've got is the one we 've got
and it 's not going to be changed in a hurry .
It 's not perfect , "" he said .
"" We acknowledge the imperfections and try and work with them . ""
Other clashes between governing bodies and Wada down the years â€ “ most recently with Fifa , the world football governing body , and other team sports over its "" whereabouts "" out - of - competition testing programme â€ “ highlight the frustrations .
The United States Anti - Doping Agency report made uncomfortable reading for McQuaid .
It repeated allegations , strongly denied by the UCI , from Floyd Landis and Tyler Hamilton that , when Armstrong and Johan Bruyneel visited its headquarters in Aigle in May 2002 to offer $ 100,000 to help the development of cycling , they were doing so in order to buy its silence .
McQuaid admitted accepting donations totalling $ 125,000 from Armstrong 's camp in 2002 and 2007 but strongly denied there were any conditions attached .
The UCI president attempted to draw a distinction between Armstrong 's imperial phase between 1998 and 2005 , before he was president , and afterwards â€ “ claiming there was no evidence to suggest that Armstrong had been doping when he came back to the sport in 2009 and 2010 .
And yet the Usada report says that there was a "" one in a million "" chance of Armstrong 's blood profile occurring naturally .
Moreover , it said , expert examination of his blood values "" build a compelling argument consistent with blood doping "" .
That dual role also makes McQuaid 's insistence that there was nothing untoward in accepting a donation from Armstrong in 2002 hard to square while the current regime remain in place .
Even taking its strong denials of any impropriety into account , he faced inevitable questions over the wisdom of accepting such large donations from the very athletes it is supposed to be policing .
The Irishman said himself that the UCI 's relatively impoverished state â€ “ "" we do n't have billions in the bank like Fifa
"" â€ “ made it reliant on donations such as that from Armstrong .
He also said he was not about to stop associating with the sport 's biggest names just in case it came back to bite him .
Challenged as to whether it should have taken the money when there were already suspicions about drug use , McQuaid fell back on the explanation that Armstrong had never failed a test .
Which , given that the organisation had just banned him for life and stripped him of his titles on the basis of a damning report that does not rely on tests for its proof , seemed a little inconsistent .
In the fall - out from Ben Johnson 's demise â€
“
perhaps the only individual fall from grace comparable in impact to Armstrong 's â€
“
it was widely debated whether the sport had , consciously or not , turned a blind eye to the fact that one of its biggest names had exhibited a pattern of behaviour consistent with doping .
The methods may be more subtle and harder to detect these days .
McQuaid admitted in his press conference that it was only during the London Paralympics that an effective test of Human Growth Hormone had become available , while a test for blood transfusions of an athlete 's own blood remains some way off .
But McQuaid also pointed out , with some justification , that it was not the UCI or Usada that ultimately did for Armstrong but a federal investigation in the US.Once a gun and a badge were placed on the table , it finally broke the code of omerta .
Other major drug conspiracies â€ “
notably the Balco scandal â€ “ have only unravelled once law enforcement agencies have become involved .
That is why Wada has been talking for some time about increasing the focus on so - called "" non - analytic "" or evidence - based findings .
But for that to happen it will need large resources and unashamed co - operation from the biggest sports governing bodies , not to mention the police and politicians .
And , of course , money . ""
The global sport industry is presently generating somewhere in the region of $ 500bn [ Â£312bn ] in annual revenues , against which the annual budget for the fight against doping in sport pales into insignificance , "" said Wada in its last annual report .
"" I [ the chairman , John Fahey ] would suggest that it may be time for this sector to assume more of the responsibility for protecting athletes from doping and defending the integrity of all sports and , by extension , all leagues "" â€ “ the implicit point being that , if international federations are happy to take responsibility , they ought also to invest the necessary time , focus and cash in catching the cheats â€ “ whatever the consequences ."
2012-10-22,"At one stage in Pat McQuaid 's heavily stage managed press conference on Monday the president of the UCI paid tribute to the riders who had testified against Lance Armstrong in the long and agonising process of exposing the doping conspiracy that enabled the Texan to win a record seven Tours de France . ""
The UCI indeed thanks them for telling their stories , "" he said .
Many believe that McQuaid and his organisation should have played a bigger part in exposing such a massive example of cheating .
To the 63-year - old Irishman , however , the UCI never had a chance .
"" I do n't want to justify what happened , "" he said in a more informal conversation later in the day , "" but it 's very easy to sit here in 2012 and criticise the lack of action in 2002 , 2003 or 2004 .
You have to work with the system in place at the time .
Bear in mind that in the early 2000s there were not laws in place and
police forces were not involved .
It was left to international federations .
Now it 's a different landscape .
"" All the UCI could do at that time was send samples to the laboratory .
If they came back negative , then they came back negative .
You ca n't do much more than that .
We did n't have police powers to go any further .
All we could do is say we were going to chase you .
We caught loads of guys as a result of chasing them .
But they [ Armstrong 's teams ] had a sophisticated system and they beat the system .
"" We could n't put a gun on the table or a badge and say you 're up in front of a grand jury , which is what happened in this case .
None of these witnesses volunteered to come forward .
They were subpoenaed by the police . ""
He described it as "" a landmark day for cycling "" , although he refused to mark it in the way his detractors would prefer , by announcing his own resignation .
McQuaid , a former amateur rider who twice won the Tour of Ireland , even made a plea for sympathy when , having refused to countenance the prospect of resignation , he described his experiences in the fight against doping over the past seven years .
"" I was elected in September 2005 at the world championships in Madrid , "" he said .
"" On the Sunday prior to that I went to a dinner to congratulate the winner of the Vuelta a España , Roberto Heras .
A week after I was made president we heard that he had tested positive for EPO .
That was the beginning of my presidency .
Since then I 've had to deal with Operación Puerto in 2006 , Floyd Landis in 2007 , and Michael Rasmussen , Alexander Vinokourov , Andrey Kashechkin , Patrik Sinkewitz and the Telekom affair , in 2008 the Cera cases , with Bernhard Kohl , Stefan Schumacher and Davide Rebellin , in 2009 the [ blood ] passport cases with Danilo Di Luca , in 2010 more passport cases with Alberto Contador , in 2011 Ezequiel Mosquera and now Armstrong .
It 's been a pretty horrific seven years .
But I 'm optimistic , although there 's still work to be done . ""
The biggest fish , however , was completely missed by the UCI , who now have been forced to accept the findings of Travis Tygart and the US Anti - Doping Agency .
The governing body 's deeper feelings may have shown through in the statement it produced when it criticised Usada 's "" on occasion animated and overstated language "" and "" intense involvement in the prosecution which not always serves the degree of detachment that one may expect from a disciplinary decision "" .
If intense involvement were what it took to persuade Armstrong 's team - mates to give their incriminating evidence , then perhaps cycling needs more of it .
"" I 'm grateful to Usada for what they achieved , "" McQuaid admitted , "" but they needed the support of federal agents to do it . ""
He also refused to heed the call of David Millar for the resignation of Hein Verbruggen , McQuaid 's predecessor , who was in charge during the Armstrong years and remains as honorary president .
"" Hein Verbruggen was n't holding David Millar 's hand when he stuck a needle in his backside , "" McQuaid said .
"" The riders have to take responsibility .
They 're adults .
They know the rules and they know when they 're breaking them .
It 's not the president 's responsibility if they go into a doping programme . ""
But the current president refused repeated requests to say what he would like to see Armstrong do now , for the good of the sport .
"" I know what I 'd like him to do
but I 'm not going to say .
It 's up to him to decide .
From what I gather he 's finished with cycling . ""
McQuaid was insistent that Tuesday marked a turning point . ""
This affair has been hanging over us for some time , "" he said .
"" This is the culmination and we can now put it behind us .
We must take what we can learn from it and put in place measures so such a thing never happens again . ""
He declined to discuss the stories in last week 's Gazzetta dello Sport previewing the findings of a two - year investigation by a public prosecutor in Padua into the activities of Dr Michele Ferrari , Armstrong 's trainer , involving a network of Italian and Russian riders and secret bank accounts in several cities in Italy and Switzerland .
On the face of it this is the uncovering of a scandal of almost equal and complementary weight to Usada 's Armstrong investigation and is likely to shadow the sport for some time to come , although McQuaid refused to accept the Gazzetta 's verdict that the sport is now in "" a bottomless black hole "" .
"" It 's a difficult period , "" he said , with considerable understatement . ""
The UCI in one sense has had a great year .
There has been some magnificent racing at the Olympics and the world championships .
But this is a very critical moment for the sport . ""
Yesterday was an opportunity to take advantage of that critical moment and show that big decisions are being taken to lead cycling into a better future .
Instead McQuaid conveyed the impression that , in the face of scandal and retreating sponsors , the sport is being offered more of the same ."
2012-10-22,""" Lance Armstrong has no place in cycling , "" said UCI President Pat McQuaid at Monday 's press conference of cycling 's governing body , as he presented its response to the Usada report on Lance Armstrong .
The event left many , including journalists who asked outright about whether McQuaid was considering resignation , wondering whether McQuaid or the UCI as presently led has a place in cycling .
Let 's look at McQuaid 's statements in more detail . '
Fight against doping '
When I took over as president of the UCI in 2005 , I made the fight against doping my priority .
That still remains my priority .
There is some justice in this claim .
Under McQuaid 's presidency , Anne Gripper , an Australian , was appointed head of the UCI 's anti - doping programme .
Gripper made significant headway , inroducing of the biological passport in 2008 as a means of identifying suspicious activity by cyclists year - round .
Gripper left the UCI in 2010 .
Last week , Gripper made critical remarks about how the UCI had bent the rules to allow Armstrong to compete without full anti - doping vetting on his comeback in 2009 .
About McQuaid , Gripper said specifically : "" I know his commitment to this was very strong while I was there .
It may have wavered a bit . ""
UCI ' at the forefront '
The UCI has always been in the forefront of the fight against doping .
That 's a bit of a gloss .
In fact , after the 1998 Festina scandal , the Tour de France 's management company , ASO , then under the leadership of Patrice Clerc , was much more pro - active and tougher than the UCI on doping .
In 2006 , for instance , Clerc excluded 13 riders who had been implicated in Operation Puerto , the Spanish police investigation into a blood - doping ring run by Dr Carlos Fuentes .
In 2008 , he shut out the entire Astana team because of its record and reputation .
The UCI excluded riders on the basis of positive tests ; it never adopted such presumptive , pre - emptive action .
The former World Anti - Doping Agency ( Wada ) chief Richard Pound has been an outspoken and consistent critic of the UCI for not doing enough to stop doping .
The UCI even sued Pound for remarks he made after stepping down from the presidency of Wada in 2007 .
( That resulted in a settlement in 2009 , as part of which Pound issued a clarification –
he insists it was in no way a retraction ) .
Pound has recently said that the UCI 's testing regime was "" designed to fail "" , alleging that riders were tipped off about tests in advance and were often unchaperoned .
"" It is not credible that they [ the UCI ] did n't know this was going on , "" Pound said . '
Adapting ' to the EPO era
When EPO came in , the whole situation changed .
The UCI then – and I do accept it took some time for the UCI to adapt to that and to start a strong amount of out - of - competition controls – but we moved forward .
EPO use started in the pro peloton at the very beginning of the 1990s .
Despite cyclists being the leading endurance athletes using the blood - boosting drug , the UCI failed to develop a test for it .
Only for the 2000 Olympics did the IOC introduce a blood and urine test for the drug , which was afterwards adopted by the UCI .
True , the science is complicated , and a reliable test for EPO was challenging to develop .
But when McQuaid says it took "" some time "" , this was an entire lost decade in which a pervasive culture of medicalised , systemic doping was allowed to establish itself , virtually unchecked . '
I 'm not Hein ' Me personally , I was n't president of the UCI in that period .
I can only account for my tenure from 2005 onwards .
Here , McQuaid attempts to distance himself from the regime of Hein Verbruggen , who was the UCI president from 1991 until 2005 .
Verbruggen , who as a vice - president and an IOC official , continues to play a key role at the UCI .
McQuaid has backed the actions and reputation of his predecessor on every occasion – including joining him in defamation lawsuits against former Wada president Dick Pound , ex - pro Floyd Landis and Irish journalist Paul Kimmage ( see below ) .
The UCI and cycling 's omerta
The UCI always had a commitment to try to protect clean riders .
Any rider or member of the entourage who pointed a finger of suspicion at Lance Armstrong was brutally ostracised , as can attest Christophe Bassons , Filippo Simeone , Emma O'Reilly , and Betsy and Frankie Andreu .
To break cycling 's code of silence on doping was to make yourself untouchable , as Jörg Jaksche eloquently testifies .
It 's hard to think of any UCI policy or action that encouraged whistleblowers or tackled the power of the omertà in professional cycling .
Floyd Landis ' confession McQuaid was asked if he regretted that the UCI had not listened to Floyd Landis ' accusations against Armstrong , which formed the basis of the Usada report .
We did listen to Landis back then [ in 2010 ] .
McQuaid allowed his colleague Philippe Verbiest to explain that the UCI received a copy of Landis 's confessional email of 30 April 2010 .
Verbiest said the UCI sent Landis a letter sent telling him to retract his allegation that it covered up a 2001 "" positive test "" by Lance Armstrong , and saying it favoured an investigation of his other allegations .
Verbiest said the UCI let Usada get on with the investigation .
What neither Verbiest nor McQuaid mentioned is that they have subsequently sued Landis in a Swiss court over the cover - up allegation .
Landis did not defend the case and lost by default , but the allegation has been repeated in near identical detail , as the Usada report notes , by Tyler Hamilton ( see below ) .
The haematocrit permission
In early 2000s … the UCI introduced haematocrit controls to stop people dying in their beds .
What that did , as we all know now , was allow riders to use EPO to a certain limit , control it .
Whenever we saw suspicious tests , especially on important riders , we called them into the UCI and asked them what they were doing .
One of those indeed was Tyler Hamilton
…
Tyler Hamilton was in the UCI , and was tackled about his activities .
His response at the time was that your machines must be calibrated wrong , I 'm doing nothing .
This is interesting , if only because it illustrates the weakness of the UCI 's anti - doping regime during the early 2000s .
Essentially , riders were asked to come in and deny their doping :
other than reminding them to be more careful and not get caught , it 's hard to see what these consultations achieved .
Revealing , also , though , is McQuaid 's remark that these cosy chats took place "" especially on important riders "" .
This corroborates the context for the Usada account of the meeting that took place in 2002 between Lance Armstrong and his manager Johan Bruyneel and the UCI President Hein Verbruggen , after which Armstrong made his now - infamous donation to the UCI ( see also below ) .
Losing sponsors We lost a very important sponsor , Rabobank , last week .
That 's true .
But I am quite confident that sponsor will be replaced .
For a governing body that complains , as McQuaid did on Monday , of not having "" billions in the bank like Fifa "" , this is a remarkably insouciant and cavalier statement .
Crisis , what crisis ?
I like to look at this crisis as an opportunity .
In which case , the UCI has had a great many missed opportunities to address the doping problem already : the Festina scandal , Operation Puerto , the T - Mobile / Team Telekom revelations , Marco Pantani 's death , Floyd Landis ' revelations , the Italian criminal investigations of Dr Michele Ferrari and Dr Francesco Conconi
…
The 2001 Tour de Suisse story
The UCI would absolutely deny that ever happened .
McQuaid is responding to a direct question about the Usada report 's account of Floyd Landis and Tyler Hamilton , who both attested that Lance Armstrong had told each that he had made a positive test in the 2001 Tour de Suisse go away following discussions with the UCI and agreeing to donate $ 125,000 for anti - doping programmes .
The UCI , Verbruggen and McQuaid strongly deny the allegation of corruption and cover - up .
While McQuaid and Verbruggen have sued Floyd Landis , the same accusation has been made by Tyler Hamilton on CBS 's 60 Minutes programme and in his recently published book The Secret Race .
Verbruggen and McQuaid have not sued Hamilton .
The Irish former professional racer and sports journalist Paul Kimmage is , however , being sued for running Landis ' account of the story .
Usada , Landis and Kimmage
What you have to do is separate this action and this Usada report .
The case against Paul Kimmage has nothing to do with Usada , nothing to do with Lance Armstrong , nothing to do with Paul Kimmage as an anti - doping advocate , nothing to do with Paul Kimmage who wrote the book
The Rough Ride .
This is about a journalist who accused me and my predecessor and the UCI of being corrupt .
It 's a straightforward defamation case .
The denials are unambiguous , but it is hard to discern any consistency in the pattern of legal action taken by the UCI over accusations of corruption .
Further , Kathy LeMond , wife of America 's last remaining Tour de France champion , Greg LeMond , has testified under oath that a US Postal team mechanic , Julian DeVries , told her that the UCI took $ 500,000 to cover up Armstrong 's positive test for cortisone in the 1999 Tour de France .
DeVries does not now corroborate the story , and Verbruggen has denied the allegation .
At this time , no legal action has ensued .
As David Walsh , the Sunday Times ' crusading journalist and author of LA Confidentiel , tweeted : The Armstrong donation McQuaid was then asked directly whether the appearance of a conflict of interest , if not worse , in accepting a large donation from Lance Armstrong was not a resignation issue .
It 's certainly not a resignation issue .
What I 've admitted is that it would be best if we did n't do it [ accept money from riders ] , if we had n't done it .
Or if we were to do it in the future , it would be done in a different way .
But there is no connection between a donation given to the UCI and a test covered up , because there was no test covered up .
There was nothing to cover up .
…
We would accept it differently and announce it differently than we did before .
McQuaid was asked again about the problem of taking Armstrong 's donation .
His response : We did n't know he [ Armstrong ] had had a suspicious test for EPO .
And do n't try to make the connection between the donation and the test .
There were no positive tests on Lance Armstrong .
McQuaid was careful to correct the term "" suspicious "" to "" positive "" , though his statement thus acquired an unfortunate resonance with Armstrong 's own oft - repeated protestation that he never tested positive .
In fact , as the Swiss laboratory director Martial Saugy says in the Usada report ( and has affirmed in interviews since ) , the samples he had were "" suspect "" , around 85 % probable , but not positive for EPO use .
Saugy also confirmed that he was informed by the UCI itself that one of these samples was Armstrong 's .
He attested that he later , in 2002 , met with Armstrong and Bruyneel to explain exactly what a "" suspect "" result meant scientifically .
Saugy 's statements thus directly contradict McQuaid 's , since Saugy says the UCI did know of Armstrong 's suspect sample .
Unsurprisingly , McQuaid was asked yet again how the UCI could accept a donation for fighting doping when it knew that the rider ( Armstrong ) had a suspicious test for EPO .
On this occasion , revealingly , McQuaid did not deny knowledge of the suspect test , nor attempt to equivocate by saying it was not a positive test that they did n't know about .
Instead , with something like resignation or regret , McQuaid shook his head .
We accepted it .
We used the money to assist in the fight against doping ."
2012-10-23,
2012-10-23,"Though Lance Armstrong has been stripped of his seven Tour de France titles by the UCI , the former champion Miguel Indurain still refuses to accept his guilt .
Indurain , who , along with Jacques Anquetil , Eddy Merckx and Bernard Hinault , is now back at the top of the all - time Tour annals with five victories , told Spanish radio station Marca : "" Even now I believe in his innocence .
He has always respected all the regulationsâ€ ¦
He has won all the cases he 's had . ""
On that basis , Armstrong waiving his right to appeal confused Indurain . ""
What surprises me is that he does n't keep fighting , "" he said .
"" I think he will come back and appeal and try to show that he played fair for all those years . ""
Indurain also took issue with the investigative process , challenging the validity of the evidence it produced .
"" I am a little taken aback .
It is strange that this is done only from testimonies .
Rules were in place and now it seems they have changed . ""
The US Anti - doping Agency ( USADA ) relied on witness testimony from 11 former team - mates and 15 other riders , and their thoroughness was praised by the World Anti - Doping Agency chief John Fahey .
"" It has always been incumbent on anti - doping organisations to undertake a more coherent approach to widespread allegations of doping , "" said Fahey , "" and it is not sufficient to claim that enough was done just because testing did not lead to analytical violations .
"" UCI 's decision to strip Armstrong of his titles was further reinforced aftrer Armstrong 's former team - mate , Steffen Kjaergaard , supported their allegations .
"" For 15 years I hid a lie , "" he told a news conference .
"" I had believed it was best for me and the sport to carry this dark secret to the grave . ""
Kjaergaard , who raced in the 2000 and 2001 Tours , said that the team took care of his doping needs but kept information in a "" closed circuit "" .
"" When I was a part of the US Postal Service team , everything was organised by the team .
I did not need to arrange for a doctor or do anything by myself , "" he said .
"" I can not say if any of my team - mates were using illegal substances , "" he added .
"" I can assume that others at U.S Postal were using something that the witness reports said .
I have no direct knowledge though . ""
"" The reason that I am coming forth now is that I have had a big problem with my own conscience , "" Kjaergaard admitted .
He began using banned substances - primarily erythropoietin ( EPO ) and cortisone - in 1998 , before joining Postal Service . ""
During this period there was a new EPO test and we had to resort to intravenous micro - dosages to shorten the window where we could be caught , "" he said .
"" I also used other illegal substances on the list but not many . ""
Armstrong , who denies wrongdoing , lost his titles after former team mates testified against him and themselves , describing what USADA called the "" most sophisticated , professionalised and successful doping program that sport has ever seen "" .
Kjaergaard 's admission dented Norway 's self - image as a "" clean "" nation , at the forefront of the fight against doping in sports .
He was instantly removed from his job as sports director for the Norwegian Cycling Federation .
"" This is a sad day for Norwegian cycling , but we wanted to have this out in the light , "" said federation President Harald Tiedemann Hansen , lamenting a "" dark day "" .
"" He has admitted to doping and he has nothing to do with the cycling world anymore , "" Tiedemann Hansen told The Associated Press later . ""
He has been suspended until his term ends on 31 December and he will not continue in the job . """
2012-10-23,"Although Lance Armstrong was finally and definitively cast out of his sport and stripped of his seven Tour de France titles on Monday , the cycling world will have to wait a while longer to discover whether or not new winners will be declared for the races held between 1999 and 2005 .
Pat McQuaid , the president of the UCI , the international cycling union , announced at a press conference in Geneva on Monday that the governing body has accepted the verdict of the United States Anti - Doping Agency ( Usada ) , which concluded that Armstrong and his US Postal and Discovery Channel teams colluded in what it called "" the biggest doping conspiracy in the history of sport "" and handed the Texan a lifetime ban .
The UCI will not be appealing against Usada 's 1,000-page "" reasoned decision "" , with McQuaid making it clear that he would now like to erase the former seven - times champion from cycling 's history . ""
Lance Armstrong has no place in cycling , "" McQuaid declared . ""
He deserves to be forgotten . ""
McQuaid was equally severe in his condemnation of Floyd Landis and Tyler Hamilton , two former Armstrong team - mates who tested positive , vehemently denied the charges , served suspensions and then wrote books in which they admitted guilt and turned whistleblowers . ""
Landis and Hamilton are being made out to be heroes , "" he said .
"" They are as far from heroes as night from day .
They are not heroes .
They are scumbags .
All they have done is damage to the sport . ""
On Friday his management committee will meet to decide whether the runners - up to Armstrong in those seven Tours will be retrospectively handed a winner 's yellow jersey or whether those races will be deemed to have had no winner .
The complication of elevating riders from second and third places is that so many of them have subsequently been implicated in doping scandals .
The committee will also discuss whether or not Armstrong will be made to refund his $ 3 m of Tour prize money , as was requested on Monday by ASO , the race 's owners .
Traditionally the winner 's cheque is divided between all the riders of his team , many of whom testified against him to Usada .
SCA Promotions , an insurance company , has said that it will demand repayment of $ 7.5 m in bonuses and on Monday Armstrong lost the last of his big personal sponsorships when Oakley sunglasses announced that it was following Nike , RadioShack and Anheuser - Busch by terminating its relationship with the cyclist .
McQuaid denounced the claims made by Landis and Hamilton that their team leader had given more than $ 100,000 to the UCI in order to persuade it to cover up an alleged positive test for EPO at the 2001 Tour de Suisse .
The money was said to have been used to buy a blood analysis machine to increase the effectiveness of the UCI 's dope testing programme .
While admitting that Armstrong had indeed made two donations , one of $ 25,000 in 2002 and another of $ 100,000 promised in 2005 and paid in 2007 , McQuaid said that any suggestion of a cover - up was "" absolutely untrue "" .
In similar circumstances , he said , he would accept further donations from riders â€ “ "" but in a different way "" .
Friday 's committee meeting will also consider the possibility of setting up some sort of truth and reconciliation process on the lines of that utilised by the South African government in the wake of apartheid , including the notion of an amnesty .
"" The trouble is that amnesty means different things in different languages , "" Philippe Verbiest , the UCI 's legal advisor , said on Monday .
"" It 's not something that you can figure out in one day . ""
The idea of an amnesty does not , however , appear to extend to journalists .
McQuaid confirmed that he and his predecessor , Hein Verbruggen , will be continuing their legal action for alleged defamation against the Irish journalist and former rider Paul Kimmage , one of a handful of reporters who showed the persistence and courage to pursue the Armstrong story through years of veiled and explicit threats .
"" It 's a straight defamation case , "" McQuaid said .
"" He called us corrupt . ""
Supporters of Kimmage , whose book Rough Ride , published in 1990 , was the first to expose systematic doping in the modern peloton , have raised a significant sum of money to help with his defence .
The World Anti - Doping agency said on Monday night it was "" encouraged "" that the UCI felt it could use the case as a "" catalyst "" to thoroughly clean up the sport .
But it also warned that the governing body needed to act on evidence of doping , no matter how long ago , and said it would await "" with interest "" the decisions the UCI planned to take on Friday . ""
The fact the World Anti - Doping Code only came into force in 2004 is not a valid excuse for an organisation failing to act on evidence of widespread doping , and nor is the Statute of Limitations contained within the Code an excuse not to investigate evidence of doping that dates back longer than eight years , "" said Wada 's president , John Fahey .
The organisation will have three weeks from the end of the month to decide whether to appeal against the UCI 's verdict .
Fahey added : "" It will announce that decision in due course , and will continue to examine the evidence encouraged by the fact that the biggest doping scandal in the history of sport is close to reaching a correct conclusion . """
2012-10-25,"Team Sky 's refusal to employ riders , coaches or backroom staff with a prior history of doping claimed its first victim on Thursday when it was announced that Bobby Julich , a member of Lance Armstrong 's Motorola squad in 1995 - 96 , would be leaving his job as a race coach .
The Texas - born Julich , 40 , arrived in Europe in 1995 and rode for several top teams .
He wore the King of the Mountains jersey in the 1996 Vuelta a EspaÃ±a , finished third in the 1998 Tour de France , came third in the Olympic time trial in Athens in 2004 ( his bronze medal was upgraded to silver last year after the winner , Tyler Hamilton , admitted doping ) and became the first American to win the Paris - Nice stage race the following year .
He retired from racing in 2008 and worked as a sporting director with SaxoBank before joining Sky last year .
Dave Brailsford , Sky 's team principal , said last week that every employee would be formally interviewed and would have to leave the team if they admitted to any history of involvement in doping .
Brailsford told the BBC on Thursday night it was "" highly likely "" more staff would go .
Julich , in a statement to the US website cyclingnews.com , made a public confession on Thursday of using EPO from August 1996 , when he was riding with Armstrong , until July 1998 .
"" I knew that it was wrong , "" he said , "" but over those two years the attitude surrounding the use of EPO in the peloton was so casual and accepted that I personally lost perspective of the gravity of the situation . ""
During the 1998 Tour my fiancÃ
© e [ now wife ] found out what was going on from another rider 's wife .
She confronted me on it and it was one of the most dreadful experiences of my life .
She told me that if it ever happened again , our relationship would be over .
That was motivation enough
and I knew I had to stop .
"" From that moment on , I tried to shield young riders from the temptations that were out there .
The following years my own resolve with doping may have wavered but it did not break . ""
He apologised to Team Sky .
"" I am extremely honoured to have been a member of this team and a small part of the success they achieved during this period , "" he said .
Brailsford praised Julich 's courage in making the admission .
"" It 's important to emphasise that there have been no doubts about his work with us or his approach as a coach , "" he said ."
2012-10-27,"Is the UCI calling on Lance Armstrong to hand back his $ 3 m prize money an empty gesture ?
The International Cycling Union did not go into detail about whether the governing body would take any legal action against Armstrong or what its next steps might be .
Given that the president , Pat McQuaid , has already said that Armstrong should be forgotten and cast from the sport , it is hard to see what leverage they have over the Texan should he refuse to hand back his prize money .
Armstrong 's more immediate concern will be SCA 's efforts to recover the Â£6.9 m bonus it paid out in 2005 after Armstrong took the prize money insurance company to a tribunal over its refusal to forward the money .
Success for SCA could open the floodgates for other sponsors to make claims on Armstrong .
How independent will the UCI tribunal be ?
The key question .
In 2005 , when L'Equipe published "" The Armstrong Lie "" , a revelatory report on a French Anti - Doping Laboratory research project to re - test six samples from the 1999 Tour that linked the Texan to EPO use , the UCI responded to pressure from the International Olympic Committee and World Anti - Doping Agency and launched an independent investigation .
Headed by the Dutch lawyer Emile Vrijman , his report concentrated on the extent to which the French lab had followed the correct protocol at the expense of whether it could be used to corroborate other evidence and was criticised by Wada .
To some , it appeared to be more an attempt to knock down the evidence than to get to the truth .
The new commission must be the opposite â€ “ wide - ranging in its remit and with the power to make recommendations in the knowledge they will be acted upon .
The composition of the panel will be crucial .
The British Cycling president , Brian Cookson , a member of the UCI committee , insisted they were "" unanimous in our determination that this independent commission will just be the start of the process and nothing will be off the agenda â€“cycling must and will learn the lessons of the Armstrong era . ""
The commission , to be appointed by an independent sports body , must translate those words into action .
In addition to looking at how to clean up the sport and rebuild its reputation , it must also examine the claims made by Floyd Landis and Tyler Hamilton , and fervently denied by the UCI , that $ 100,000 donated by Armstrong was tied to a cover - up of suspicious tests .
Why has the UCI taken this action now ?
There is a disparity between the tone of some of the defensive material posted on the UCI website on Monday when they agreed to ratify the United States Anti - Doping Agency 's damning report and the more strident measures revealed on Friday .
Without the need to defend the reputations of McQuaid and the honorary president , Hein Verbruggen it may be that the UCI recognised the need to go further .
Partly , it was a response to pressure from within the sport .
The International Association of Professional Cycling Teams and Association of Professional Cyclists called for independent reviews .
Yet a nagging suspicion remains that the UCI was only bowing to pressure .
McQuaid almost said as much .
"" We have listened to the world 's reaction to the Lance Armstrong affair and have taken these additional decisive steps in response to the grave concerns raised .
"" They will have to prove that the measures are more than an attempt to buy some time .
Why has no one resigned ?
There have been loud calls for McQuaid and Verbruggen to step aside if the sport is to move on but they have foundered .
As with other global sporting bodies , personal loyalties still appear to count for much and the pair feel they have done nothing wrong .
Both will almost certainly remain in post until the commission reports next year , but that will not ease the pressure on them in the meantime .
McQuaid feels he has not been granted enough credit for the steps that cycling has taken to combat doping â€ “ from introducing biological passports to developing new testing techniques .
He makes a distinction between the pre-2005 era â€ “ before he became president during which Armstrong won his seven Tour de France titles , now made void from the record books â€ “ and the seven years since .
Not only does the Usada report contain compelling evidence that Armstrong was doping on his comeback in 2009 but McQuaid has other questions to answer about the extent to which the UCI failed to consider evidence not based on analytical findings , such as riders ' testimony .
Why have the UCI suspended their legal action against the former Sunday Times writer Paul Kimmage ?
This , too , seems to chip away at McQuaid 's personal authority .
On Monday , he said continuing the action was a "" straightforward defamation case "" unrelated to the Armstrong affair , only to "" suspend "" it on Friday .
Yet the independent commission will look into the very claims that McQuaid , Verbruggen and the UCI had sued over .
The case was due to be heard in Switzerland in December and supporters of Kimmage 's position had already contributed $ 83,000 ( Â£51,000 ) to a fighting fund .
Suspending the action was the only sensible course of action if the UCI wanted their claim that the commission would have free rein to investigate all allegations against it to have any credibility ."
2012-10-27,"Sean Yates has resigned from his job as directeur sportif with Team Sky after being interviewed as part of the team 's zero tolerance policy on doping , according to reports .
Yates coached Bradley Wiggins to victory in this year 's Tour de France , but in his career as a rider he tested positive in 1989 .
He rode alongside Lance Armstrong in the Motorola team in the 1990s and coached the American in 2005 and 2009 .
The British team 's general manager Dave Brailsford interviewed Yates and asked him about any involvement in doping as part of a series of discussions with all members of staff and it was after this that Yates resigned , according to the Sunday Telegraph .
Yates has denied any involvement in doping programmes and was at no point mentioned in the US Anti - Doping Agency report that revealed the extent of Armstrong 's doping ."
2012-10-28,"Sean Yates has denied he was forced out of Team Sky after he announced his retirement from cycling .
The sport director said he wanted to "" spend more time with his family "" and leaves cycling with his "" head held high "" .
In the wake of the Lance Armstrong doping scandal Sky asked every member of the team to sign up to a written policy affirming no past or present involvement with performance enhancing drugs but the British team said Yates 's departure was not forced by an admission of any kind . ""
Sean Yates , Team Sky 's lead sports director since 2010 , has decided to retire from cycling after three decades in the sport , "" the team announced on Sunday . ""
After Team Sky reaffirmed its position on anti - doping the management team started individual interviews with riders , management and support staff .
Sean has been interviewed and there were no admissions or disclosures that would have required him to leave the team . ""
Yates acknowledged there would be rumours surrounding his exit from Team Sky but said he was leaving due to ill health and to focus on his family . ""
The last three years with Team Sky have been fantastic and a highlight of my long career in cycling , "" the 52-year - old said .
"" I 'm proud to have been involved with the team at such an incredible time for the sport .
I have suffered with my health in recent years and have spent a lot of time away from my home , so I feel the time is right to focus on myself and my family .
I realise the timing of my retirement will lead to speculation , given what is currently going on in the sport , but I can walk away with my head held high knowing I have done nothing wrong . ""
Dave Brailsford , the general manager , led the praise for Yates 's contribution to Team Sky 's success . ""
Sean joined us in our first year and has been with us for three tough but rewarding seasons , "" Brailsford said .
"" After a long career in professional cycling , he has told us that he wants to move on , for purely personal reasons . ""
Sean has been a great support to the riders on the road and a valuable colleague to us all .
We wish him the best for the next step in his life . ""
Yates was a high - profile recruit ahead of Team Sky 's first season two years ago .
During his riding career as a successful domestique he wore the yellow jersey at the Tour de France and had stage wins at high - profile races such as the Vuelta a España , Paris - Nice and Critérium du Dauphiné Libéré .
He spent five years with the Motorola team , where he was a team - mate of Armstrong 's .
After retiring from riding in 1996 he briefly worked with the Linda McCartney team before switching to Discovery in 2005 .
There he helped the Texan to the last of his seven – now rescinded – Tour de France titles .
He then moved on to Team Sky and was seen as a key figure in helping Bradley Wiggins become the first British rider to win the Tour .
After the United States Anti - Doping Agency 's document on Armstrong , Yates said on BBC Five Live he had no reason to believe the American used doping products , which raised eyebrows .
Yates ' decision comes three days after Team Sky lost another key staff member when Bobby Julich stood down from his role as race coach .
Julich admitted to having taken a banned substance in the 1990s during his racing career and his two - year spell came to an end on Thursday .
The Dutchman Steven de Jongh , a Team Sky coach who looked after their classics riders , has also left the team ."

2012-11-02,"Bradley Wiggins has pulled out of a controversial tax - avoidance scheme following a barrage of criticism , the first British Tour de France winner has told the Guardian in an exclusive interview in which he also details his considerable disdain for Lance Armstrong and the legacy left by the US rider 's years of organised doping .
Last week , Wiggins was criticised for having joined Twofold First Services , a tax partnership which takes advantage of farming tax reliefs .
But in the interview in Weekend magazine , Wiggins says : "" I had a small investment in Twofold , following guidance from my professional advisers .
I had , however , claimed no tax relief of any amount in regard to this investment .
Given the concerns raised about it , I have now instructed my advisors to withdraw me from the scheme with immediate effect .
"" Wiggins is odds - on favourite for the BBC Sports Personality of the Year award , but his victory in this summer 's Tour was dogged by innuendo that his dominant performance , and that of his team , Team Sky , must be shaped by drug use , something he has repeatedly and passionately denied .
Calling his accusers "" wankers "" â€ “ not for the first time â€ “ Wiggins describes the corrosive legacy of Armstrong , newly stripped of his seven Tour wins because of his endemic , team - wide doping regime .
"" It was n't a surprise , "" Wiggins says of the report that damned the Texan .
"" The anger is more : I 've got to pick up the pieces .
He 's still a multimillionaire , and he 's not here to answer the questions .
I ca n't not answer them because I 've got to go and race next year , and I hate talking about it . ""
Armstrong was never his hero . ""
He was someone I respected and admired .
I 've met quite a few sportsmen , but I do n't think I 've met anybody as â€ ¦ powerful as him . ""
He describes Armstrong as "" quite an intimidating person to be around "" and someone who exists in a cosseted bubble of entourages and chauffeur - driven cars .
"" If I 'm going to Kilburn , I get on a bus .
He 'd have a car waiting for him with a bodyguard .
He 'd go to races on a private jet .
I take my kids to school .
It 's what keeps you normal .
I do n't want my kids growing up as fucking idiots , d'you know what I mean ?
"" Wiggins describes how he is determined to be a good father to his children , Ben and Bella , because of his own experiences growing up .
His Australian cyclist father , Garry â€ “ ""
he was n't a nice person "" â€ “ walked out when Wiggins was two , and ended up a violent alcoholic .
He died in 2008 . ""
Because of what he did to us , I 'm , sort of , the way I am with my own family , "" Wiggins says .
"" I cherish them .
It was a lesson of how not to be with my own children .
So it 's not ' like father like son ' .
It 's the complete opposite â€ ¦ Not having my father around has made me a better person . ""
Ben , seven , is a promising junior cyclist .
Wiggins says : "" I 'm not just saying this because he 's my son , but he is fucking good .
I think he 'll be better than me .
But I 'm not pushing him at the moment .
I feel sorry for him that he 's my son , because he 'll never get a fair shot ; he 'll always be compared to me , which is sad really .
"" Wiggins appreciates the attentions of well - wishers but says his new fame brings difficulties , particularly for his family . ""
They ask your wife to take the photo , which is a bit rude , "" he says of some . ""
After a while that becomes tiresome , especially when you 're having a pizza with your children , or you have to have a photo with somebody else 's kids while yours stand to the side .
"" Wiggins describes himself as fundamentally shy and even , to use his wife 's phrase , "" emotionally retarded "" when it comes to expressing feelings , and he is prone to having a drink if he has to go on stage to talk .
In a lull following his three - medal haul from the 2004 Olympics , he had a well - documented period in which he drank heavily .
In the interview he describes a period of being "" bored shitless "" , often arriving at his local pub when it opened and gaining weight : "" I got quite big .
I was n't huge .
I was probably 83 kilos ( 13 stone ) . ""
Lack of money was one of the post - Olympic depressions faced by Wiggins , he says : "" It got me down .
You think if you win the Olympics , you 'll become a millionaire overnight .
But I was still scraping the barrel , looking down the back of the settee for pound coins to buy a pint of milk . ""
It remains to be seen if Wiggins will even race in next year 's Tour , with the Giro d'Italia his stated goal for 2013 .
More unlikely sounding is the notion , floated in his autobiography , that he could compete at the Rio Olympics in 2016 in a completely different sport . ""
Imagine that , going and winning the coxless lightweight four : Olympic gold in rowing four years off . """
2012-11-02,"Mark Casse is a placid Canadian , tempered by the highs and lows of three decades around racehorses , but even he seemed a little indignant at Santa Anita on Thursday when the name of Lance Armstrong was linked to the debate about the use of drugs in racing .
"" We 've done it , it works , everybody knows that we 're doing it , "" Casse said .
"" How can you compare that to Lance Armstrong ?
We 're telling them that this is what we 're doing and we 're doing it for the good of the horse . ""
The drug in question is Lasix , a diuretic which helps to prevent horses suffering bleeding in their lungs during exercise and races .
For decades , it has been administered to racehorses in the US about four hours before they are due to race , almost as a matter of routine , a course of action that would be illegal in any other major racing jurisdiction .
In some of the races at this year 's Breeders ' Cup , however , the American trainers are being forced to play by rest of the world 's rules and there are many who find it difficult to accept .
At next year 's event , all the races are scheduled to be Lasix - free , while this year it is just the two - year - old events in which the drug is banned .
It is a brave move by the Breeders ' Cup , which needs the goodwill of American owners and trainers to survive and prosper , although Craig Fravel , its chief executive , sees it as a commonsense decision . ""
Some trainers have made no secret that they do n't agree with the situation , "" Fravel said this week , "" but we felt that horse races of this calibre are run around the world under these conditions and at some point along the way , Americans need to get in line with it . ""
European racing followers sometimes fail to appreciate the extent to which Lasix is ingrained in the culture of American racing , or the strength of many trainers ' conviction that they use it for the good of their horses .
"" I scope every horse after he works or runs , "" Casse says , "" and I do n't know that I have a horse in my barn that 's started more than four or five times that at some point did not have some form of blood in his trachea after stress .
"" I hear about this study or that study , but I 've been studying for 34 years , it 's the only thing I know .
And some of the people that are making these decisions , I do n't know where they gained their knowledge , but they did n't gain it by training horses or being around them every day . ""
An important argument against Lasix is that by masking bleeding , it helps to retain infirmities in the gene pool .
There is also concern that Lasix can mask illegal performance - enhancing substances too , such as steroids .
Most American trainers , though , say they are simply doing their duty by their horses and the betting public , by reducing the discomfort of bleeding and helping them to produce their best form consistently .
Casse , meanwhile , suggests that if trainers can not use Lasix , some at least might try to mimic its effects in other ways .
"" I 've raced where there was no Lasix , "" he said , "" and I know the extreme measures that some people will take , like maybe withdrawing your horse 's water for 48 hours , or not feeding them .
Is that kinder to the horses ?
I do n't think so . ""
John Gosden , soon to be Britain 's champion trainer for the first time , spent the first 11 years of his career at Santa Anita and can see both sides of the argument , though he would welcome a more European approach to medication in the US .
"" I can understand where people who train here are coming from , "" he said this week , "" but if you 're talking as a purist , and for the breed , I can strongly see why it [ the ban ] is being done .
"" There 's no doubt that Lasix improves a horse 's performance .
One basic reason is that it reduces body weight [ via fluid loss ] .
It also reduces pressure on the capillaries , so there 's no doubt that as a drug , it helps horses to run faster . ""
But we now go to the sales in Kentucky and you 're looking at six or seven generations of horses that have raced on quite strong medication .
If you 're having a so - called world championship , from that point of view you probably need to have it drug - free .
It 's [ an argument ] that will go on , but it 's a concern to a lot of us that the American thoroughbred is not the tough creature of old , that is for sure . ""
The results of this year 's juvenile races will be minutely dissected , not least with an eye on next year 's meeting , when even the $ 5 m Classic will be Lasix - free .
Betting turnover , or "" handle "" , could also prove crucial if the punters – or "" handicappers "" as they are known locally – seem lukewarm about clean races .
"" I think it makes it a little bit more of a challenge for the handicappers rather than the horses and horsemen , hopefully , "" Todd Pletcher , one of the country 's leading trainers , said on Friday .
"" Some of [ the long - term impact ] could depend on how things go Friday and Saturday .
I think the juvenile races on the dirt were a little bit shorter [ smaller ] fields than they are accustomed to , but I have no idea whether that is a direct impact from no Lasix . ""
But it would be my thought that older horses that have had longer campaigns might have more of a tendency to have some bleeding issues , so my thinking would be that it could potentially impact the entries [ at next year 's meeting ] . ""
Smaller fields would mean smaller handle , a threat to the financial wellbeing of the entire event .
Fravel 's most earnest hope is that it will not come to that .
"" It 's one of those things where reasonable minds can differ , "" he said , "" but at the end of the day , people have shown it can be done , so some of our guys need to be a little more open - minded at times .
We 're looking for good , clean competitive races and I think that 's what we 're going to have .
I 'd like to get to the point where we 're talking about how competitive the races are , rather than what they 're running on . """
2012-11-21,"A brand is built on trust .
People buy into a brand because they believe and feel an emotional connection with its values and what it offers .
Never was this more apparent than with Lance Armstrong and the former Lance Armstrong Foundation or "" Livestrong "" .
But what happens when this trust breaks down ?
How do you go about rebuilding the brand ?
The key rule of building a strong brand is to have a compelling , authentic , and credible brand promise , and to defend it .
Livestrong 's brand promise was built on determination in the face of adversity .
So the narrative went , it was determination that helped Armstrong recover from cancer and go on to win a record seven Tour de France titles .
This gave hope to cancer patients and survivors around the world and attracted millions of dollars ' worth of donations .
But in refusing to contest the doping allegations against him , Armstrong has left the brand promise undefended and lacking authenticity .
Despite being founded following his remarkable recovery from cancer , Livestrong prospered due to his successes in cycling .
However , he has tacitly acknowledged that his achievements on the bike were n't built solely on determination , but also on cheating .
He has cast doubt over whether the message of strength and integrity the brand was built on was ever honest .
EMR 's research in the immediate wake of the doping scandal found that the majority of marketing professionals felt that Livestrong should sever all ties with Armstrong .
Of these , a significant proportion felt the best course of action would be a complete rebrand .
But how do you go about rebranding an organisation with a tarnished reputation ?
How do you go about regaining trust ?
There are three key stages crucial to any organisation going through this process .
1 .
Consider the past Rebrands happen for a reason , and it is important to address the issue that has caused it .
This is true of examples from Scope to New Labour â€ “ its past problems and failings must be tackled head - on .
Honesty and swift action are extremely important .
In this case , it must come from Armstrong himself .
He would best serve Livestrong , not to mention his own credibility , by accepting what seems to be an overwhelming weight of evidence against him and explaining why he did it .
Despite stepping down from the board , he has retained ties with the foundation , and neither the brand nor Armstrong has addressed the issue .
In seeming to thumb his nose at the charges , as with his twitter photo posted last week , he is becoming a damaging figure .
2 .
Go back to basics The question needs to be asked who this is currently affecting , who it may affect and why .
More important than this , the organisation needs to answer the basic questions of why the organisation exists in the first place , who for and why .
Livestrong relies on its supporters to donate funds in order to help people who have cancer or have survived it .
If Armstrong 's continued presence results in a fall in donations , Livestrong should cut ties and consider a name change .
The basics of the brand are fighting cancer and helping survivors .
These are worthy aims that can be emphasised without needing Armstrong 's presence .
By demonstrating the good work it does , the foundation can continue to attract support from donors .
In essence , reverting focus back to the victims a charity is set up to support , will always resonate with their key audience .
This can actually have a hugely positive impact for a charity as the public tends to respond accordingly .
Rebrands that do n't do this are doomed to fail .
If the reason for the rebrand is falling revenues as in the case with Yell rebranding as Hibu , organisations must be careful that it is not simply window dressing and must address the more fundamental business problem .
In one of the most spectacular rebranding failures , they did nothing to make their business model more relevant in a digital age and therefore it did nothing to reverse its decline .
3 .
Over - Communicate
Once these basics are addressed , communication is key in any rebrand .
The reasons you 're rebranding , who 's involved and who it may affect all need to be explained to stakeholders .
This must be done clearly and in a way that leaves them in no doubt as to the brand 's position .
As charities do not sell a product , their brand and messaging is their lifeblood .
If Livestrong decides to sever ties with Armstrong and completely rebrand , it must be communicated as a business decision in order to continue supporting those who rely on its funding .
It must ensure this is conveyed sympathetically to stakeholders however , as their emotional connection to a charity brand will be so strong .
As well as explaining what they have done and why , they also need to clarify where they stand now .
What is its current stance on doping ?
How does it plan to attract donations when its founder member can no longer inspire donors or call on celebrity contacts ?
Who will lead the organisation now that Armstrong has stepped down ?
It needs a new brand promise that can be easily communicated to stakeholders and that makes sense to them .
There 's a strong argument that a new face , a new personality is the best way of enabling this mind shift , otherwise the brand will always be known as the old ' Lance Armstrong ' charity .
The public has a long memory and so does the internet , so giving the brand a new face and therefore a new story can help erase the connections .
After all , the world is full of sporting and other heroes who have won in the face of adversity , even cancer .
We 've just had the most celebrated paralympics of all time â€ “ potential fertile ground for hero seeking ?
As with any organisation facing a rebrand , Livestrong faces an uncertain future .
Can it survive after the departure of a man tied up so completely with its ethos and branding ?
It faces tough decisions and a long road in rebranding sufficiently to rebuild its lost trust .
Perhaps determination in the face of adversity is what 's required .

2012-11-26,"The Secret Race , the 287-page confessional by Tyler Hamilton and Daniel Coyle exposing doping , double - dealing and cover - ups at the court of Lance Armstrong , has won the William Hill Sports Book of the Year for 2012 .
The book is the third about cycling to have won the award in its 24-year history , after Paul Kimmage 's Rough Ride in 1989 and Armstrong 's It 's Not About the Bike in 2000 .
Hamilton , one of Armstrong 's lieutenants in three of his Tour de France victories , said he was "" truly humbled "" to win . ""
This is really special , "" he added .
"" I 'm really proud of writing this book but not what 's in there .
But it 's the truth and the truth needed to be told . ""
The Secret Race details how Hamilton – "" the sort of everyman hero sportswriters used to invent in the 1950s : soft - spoken , handsome , polite and tough beyond conventional measure "" , according to his co - author , Coyle – went from wide - eyed wannabe into systematic doper while at Armstrong 's US Postal Service team .
That journey , from testosterone pills to EPO – or "" Edgar Allan Poe "" to his team - mates – to the Frankenstein practice of blood doping , is retold in intimate detail .
Detail that bloodied cycling 's code of omerta and Armstrong 's reputation ; injection by injection , transfusion by transfusion .
"" The first interview we were asked : why should we believe you ?
You have n't told the truth in the past and Lance has always denied it , "" said Hamilton .
"" We did n't know what to expect .
Yes , I am an ex - liar .
I lied and I did it for a long , long time .
But the world has flipped upside down and the reaction has been great .
"" One of the judges John Inverdale said the book had "" fundamentally changed cycling "" , adding : "" It 's not a prerequisite of a book to change a sport , but this one did "" .
Hamilton , however , believes cycling needs to go further and set up a truth and reconciliation commission , with a "" complete amnesty "" for riders who have doped .
"" It 's a good indicator of how dark this sport was that in the eight years I was part of the Tour de France there were only two riders who spoke out against the dopers – Christophe Bassons and Filippo Simeoni , "" said Hamilton .
"" And look how they were treated .
If the sport was 80 % clean at the time then a lot more people would have spoken out . ""
Hamilton says that he is still hopeful that Armstrong will admit his part in a dark decade .
"" I still have hope , "" he said .
"" He 's obviously going through a process , and typically the first part of the process is denial .
I did it .
Denial comes first and it lasts for a long time .
There are plenty of people out there today who are still denying .
It 's a long process .
There 's more to come . ""
Hamilton and Coyle beat a shortlist comprising Rick Broadbent 's account of the world 's most dangerous race , Inside the TT , Adharanand Finn 's Running with the Kenyans ,
Simon Jordan 's memoir Be Careful
What You Wish For , Miles Jupp 's Fibber in the Heat , which regales his sojourn in the cricket press corps , A Life Without Limits by Chrissie Wellington , and Shot and a Ghost :
A Year in the Brutal World of Professional Squash by James Willstrop .
As well as a £ 24,000 cheque , the winners also receive a £ 2,000 William Hill bet , a hand - bound copy of their book and a day at the races ."
2012-11-30,"The commission that will look into the way that cycling 's governing body , the UCI , handled the Lance Armstrong doping affair has been given a wide - ranging remit to examine the background to the American 's years of doping .
A report issued in mid - October by the US Antiâ€‘Doping Agency ( Usada ) led to the Texan being stripped of his seven Tour de France wins .
It was announced on Friday that the commission will be headed by the former appeal court judge Sir Philip Otton , who will be assisted by Baroness Tanni Grey - Thompson and the Australian lawyer Malcolm Holmes QC .
There are 11 detailed terms of reference , one of which is to examine the allegations made against the UCI by Usada in its "" reasoned decision "" on Armstrong .
For example , pages 160 to 161 state : "" Even before Usada 's investigation was complete the contention that Mr Armstrong engaged in doping was prejudged and rejected by the UCI despite the fact that neither [ UCI president ]
Mr [ Pat ] McQuaid , nor [ UCI former president ]
Mr [ Hein ] Verbruggen , nor any other representative of the UCI , have met with [ witnesses ]
Mr [ Tyler ] Hamilton , Mr [ Floyd ] Landis , or apparently , with any other of Usada 's numerous witnesses concerning these matters
â€ ¦ the UCI has responded with similar disdain and disinterest towards other cyclists that have tried to bring forth evidence of the serious extent of doping within the peloton . ""
In other words , the commission will examine what the UCI knew and when , and what it did with the information .
It is also to look into the strength of the UCI 's anti - doping measures , which again were criticised in Usada 's report , which stated : "" At the 2009 Tour de France the AFLD [ France 's anti - doping agency ] conducted joint testing with UCI testers and recorded in their official report that ' the Astana team , of which Lance Armstrong was a member , benefited from privileged information or timing advantages during doping control tests .
For instance , on one testing mission doping control testers were delayed by UCI officials for at least 30 minutes in testing the Astana team . '
"" The commission will also investigate payments made by Armstrong to the UCI , and will examine whether it was appropriate for them to be accepted and whether there was a conflict of interest .
In 2005 , after the donation of cash became public knowledge , McQuaid acknowledged that there might be a perception of conflict of interest and told the Guardian : "" Certain people might perceive it as [ a conflict of interest ] , but intelligent people would n't . ""
The commission will sit next April in London and will deliver its recommendations in June 2013 ."
2012-12-03,"The aftershocks of the Usada report on systematic doping by Lance Armstrong and associates are still shaking the cycling world .
Just last week , the sport 's governing body , the UCI , which has come under severe scrutiny over allegations contained in Usada 's Reasoned Decision that it helped cover up suspect laboratory test results for Armstrong , announced the three - member panel which is to conduct a Leveson - like investigation into the ethical record of the UCI .
And this week , following a conference in London of a new reform movement , three - time Tour winner – and America 's only Tour de France champion now that Armstrong has had his titles stripped –
Greg LeMond has confirmed in an interview with , appropriately enough , Le Monde that he has agreed to run for the presidency of the UCI .
This would involve challenging and unseating its current president , Pat McQuaid , who has made himself a staunch ally of his predecessor , Hein Verbruggen , the Dutch official and IOC member who presided over the period of Armstrong 's Tour dominance ( up until his first retirement , in 2005 ) .
For many cycling fans , who wish to see an end to the culture of doping and silence in pro racing , Greg LeMond is a figurehead and hero – regarded by some as possibly the last unimpeachably "" clean "" rider up to the end of the Armstrong era to win the Tour , which he did three times ( 1986 , 1989 and 1990 ) .
With Armstrong discredited by the Usada report , set in motion by the revelations of former team - mates Floyd Landis and Tyler Hamilton , the reformers see an epochal opportunity to usher in a new era of transparency , of credible anti - doping controls , and of stability in the sport that constantly risks the loss of vital sponsors through the drip - drip of the past decade and a half 's dope - cheating scandals – from the Festina affair in 1998 , through the Operation Puerto investigation , the Team Telekom / T - Mobile confessions , right up to this year 's dramatic events .
As LeMond said : "" It is now or never to act .
After the earthquake caused by the Armstrong case , another chance will not arise .
I am willing to invest to make this institution more democratic , transparent and look for the best candidate in the longer term .
"" LeMond himself floats the name of Richard Pound , former head of the World Anti - Doping Agency , as a possible candidate .
A Canadian lawyer , Pound really established Wada as an effective enforcer against doping in sport in its first decade of existence ( from its foundation in 1999 ) .
He has been outspoken critic , in particular , of the UCI 's approach to anti - doping – clashing with Verbruggen and McQuaid , who attempted to sue Pound for defamation in 2007 , though that seemed to have had little effect .
LeMond is right : Pound would be a leading candidate – with both the ethical record and the leadership qualities to change the governance of cycle sport for good .
So , the question then is , does cycling need a stalking horse to challenge McQuaid – regardless of the outcome of the Otton Commission ?
And is LeMond the right guy for the role of caretaker president or interim leader ?
The fact that the reformers are pushing ahead with this scheme suggests a lack of confidence in the commission to be truly independent and have teeth – despite its seemingly broad remit and good access .
Given the apparent behind - the - scenes power that Verbruggen wields , able to rely on McQuaid 's fealty despite having formally retired over seven years ago , such scepticism that the UCI will not somehow control or manipulate the outcome of the commission is not surprising .
Among cycling 's sans culottes , there is a fundamental lack of trust in the capacity of the ancien regime to reform itself .
The politics of the situation is that the reform movement senses that the UCI 's leadership has never been more isolated or vulnerable in its Swiss eyrie – and chooses to press now for the defenestration of McQuaid and Verbruggen .
LeMond has standing .
He has long been an outspoken critic of Lance Armstrong , clashing with his compatriot publicly as early as 2001 after Armstrong 's association with Italian doctor Michele Ferrari ( also now banned from the sport by Usada ) .
My personal sense of that is that LeMond 's attitude to Armstrong was , at the time , also mixed with a certain amount of envy : LeMond 's own remarkable story of being the first American to win the Tour de France , then being nearly killed in a hunting accident , only to come back and win two more Tours ( including the thrilling seven - second win in the French republic 's bicentennial year ) , was supplanted by Armstrong 's cancer survival narrative – and
then by the accumulating wins that surpassed LeMond 's record .
Does that personal animus matter now ?
LeMond pointed the finger at Armstrong and accused him of cheating at a time when few dared to do so ( the Sunday Times journalist David Walsh being a notable exception ) , and he lost by it – Trek Bikes , who sponsored Armstrong , eventually dumped LeMond 's brand of racing bikes .
And LeMond made himself a voice in the wilderness : without hard evidence , his accusations were easily made to appear petty , mean - spirited and self - serving .
He was often called a loose cannon , or dismissed as a stuck record …
But he was right .
And in that vindication , any tincture of taint in the original motivation behind his complaints seems increasingly irrelevant .
Though no other names have been floated , other than Pound 's , there are other figures in cycling who have been comparably stalwart in the anti - doping cause .
Jonathan Vaughters , former pro rider , director of the Garmin - Sharp team and outgoing president of the International Association of Professional Cycling Groups ( AIGCP ) , is a possible candidate .
Against that , of course , is that he is still a player in the sport ; also , that despite long being an advocate for clean racing , his own personal doping mea culpa was relatively recent in appearing .
Betsy Andreu , wife of former Armstrong team - mate Frankie , is another possible figurehead , who has won a following for her long record of whistleblowing on Armstrong .
But without a career either as an athlete or as a sports administrator behind her , she 'd be unlikely to win wide backing .
What about Australian Anne Gripper , who was chief of UCI 's anti - doping in the brief spell when the organization seemed to make real headway : the biological passport , which is generally accepted as the gold standard in all sports , was introduced on her watch .
She has also been critical of the current UCI regime .
But she was McQuaid 's appointee , and that association might count against her with the reform wing .
More credible as a candidate , perhaps , might be Patrice Clerc , former head of the Amaury Sports Organisation ( ASO ) , which owns and runs the Tour de France .
Under his leadership , the ASO took a notably tougher line on doping than the UCI – disinviting teams , for instance , with key riders who had been associated with the Operacion Puerto doping ring investigation in Spain .
He was eventually eased out of ASO , which led to an unfortunate rapprochement with the UCI ; and he has recently called for a "" revolution "" in the sport 's governance .
He could be the character to administer "" un grand coup de balai "" .
But in the European - dominated world of pro cycling , the nationality of the UCI presidency is itself a political issue .
An American would be an outsider but in a constructive way – symbolising a clean sweep .
It 's also worth remembering that Armstrong was so damaging to the sport partly because he brought a degree of professionalism and ruthless efficiency to his teams ' doping programmes : this was , in a sense , an American problem – the systemic cheating 's technical expertise and "" get it done "" attitude .
There is a just symmetry in selecting an American to begin the process of letting in the daylight on the previous decades ' darkness .
The Otton Commission will deliver its verdict : it is conceivable that a critical enough report would make McQuaid 's ( and Verbruggen 's ) position untenable ; but it is by no means certain .
In that case , who would you rather see act on Otton 's recommendations : McQuaid or LeMond ?
Assuming that LeMond , who , whatever his foibles , commands much affection and respect , makes good on his promise to give way soon to a more professionally qualified administrator , that seems a pretty easy question to answer .

2012-12-05,"Sunday Times chief sports writer David Walsh has picked up the first of what is likely to be many awards for his groundbreaking Lance Armstrong investigation , winning two prizes at the inaugural British Journalism Awards .
Walsh conducted a dogged 13-year investigation into the former champion cyclist 's use of drugs , which led him to being stripped of his record seven Tour de France titles earlier this year .
He picked up sports journalist of the year and the top award â€ “ journalist of the year â€ “ at the Press Gazette event , held in central London on Tuesday night .
The British Journalism awards judges said Walsh became a "" pariah for years "" in the cycling world
â€
“ Armstrong reached a substantial out - of - court libel settlement with the Sunday Times in 2004 at a time when he was still vigorously denying doping allegations â€ “ and has now been vindicated . ""
He pursued it and pursued it and the US Anti - Doping Agency would never have pursued this if it had n't been for David Walsh , "" the judges said .
"" It was a fine example of great investigative journalism . ""
Earlier this year , the Sunday Times said that it was looking at whether it can review the terms of the costly libel settlement with Armstrong .
The BJAs also recognised Marie Colvin , the Sunday Times foreign correspondent killed earlier this year while reporting in Syria , with a special award .
Judges said that she did "" more than any other to inspire journalists , young and old "" .

2012-12-05,"When David Walsh picked up two awards at the British Journalism Awards on Tuesday evening he received terrific applause .
The assembled journalists were showing their appreciation for a reporter who had soldiered away in the face of official hostility , legal intimidation , public scepticism and rival media apathy for 13 years in order to tell the truth about the drug - taking cyclist , Lance Armstrong .
Who could possibly disagree with the judges in naming the Sunday Times 's writer as the sports journalist of the year and also being accorded the accolade journalist of the year ?
The answer , it appears , is Tom Clarke , one of the original judges , who withdrew from the judging panel in protest at Walsh 's inclusion in the shortlist .
In a piece on the Sports Journalists ' Association website , Clarke says he did so because the awards ' organisers , the Press Gazette , bent their own rules in order to ensure Walsh was honoured .
Clarke , former sports editor at the Daily Mail and The Times and Sporting Life editor , explains that Walsh 's entry contained two articles published after the closing date .
They appeared after 1 September 2012 and should therefore have been rejected .
In an email to Gazette editor Dominic Ponsford he wrote : "" We journalists are forever urging others – politicians , bankers , footballers , cyclists – to abide by the rules , and we should have done the same ourselves . ""
Clarke is full of praise for Walsh 's "" brave and relentless "" work .
He also pays tribute to the Sunday Times 's sports editor , Alex Butler .
But he says he is "" making a fuss "" because the rules are the rules .
Comment :
I can understand Clarke 's complaint , but I 'd bet that the majority of other writers who entered do n't feel upset that Walsh won despite the rule - bending .
He was a worthy winner .
Perhaps it could have been handled better .
Maybe the Gazette could have canvassed the other entrants about Walsh 's eligibility .
That 's the perfection of hindsight however .
The point surely is that Walsh 's case was special and special measures were required to ensure he got his awards .
He deserved them , and the Sunday Times deserves the kudos too ."
2012-12-19,"The United States Anti - Doping Agency chief executive responsible for pursuing Lance Armstrong has said he is "" very concerned "" about the zero - tolerance approach taken by Team Sky to drugs , fearing it could be counterproductive .
Travis Tygart , who drove Usada 's investigation into what he said was "" the most professionalised , sophisticated doping programme that sport will ever see "" , said he "" firmly believed "" that a truth and reconciliation process would be more beneficial in healing the sport .
Since the Armstrong revelations , Team Sky 's performance director , Dave Brailsford , has overseen a rebooted zero - tolerance process via a series of interviews where employees have been encouraged to come clean about any doping in their past .
If they had been involved with doping , they were asked to leave the team but were supported financially .
Two members of the coaching staff , Bobby Julich and Steven de Jongh , were released from their contracts under the policy .
The team leader Sean Yates left the squad in October citing personal reasons .
Tygart , in his first interview since the UCI ratified its decision to annul Armstrong 's seven Tour de France victories , said he feared the approach would have unintended consequences and discourage those with something to hide from coming forward .
"" We 're very concerned about this zero - tolerance approach right now , "" he said .
"" We firmly believe , and we 've put a lot of thought into it over the last year and a half , that a limited truth and reconciliation commission and process is the only way to move forward .
That past will come out , one way or the other – whether it 's through books or athletes who retire and want to tell their kids or whatever .
It 's going to dig itself out drip by drip .
But why would n't you now , in a very limited period of time , given the background and the other athletes involved , have an opportunity for a truth and reconciliation commission to start afresh , to have a clean sport ? ""
His concerns echo those earlier expressed by David Howman , the World Anti - Doping Agency director general . ""
If it is destroying their lives then you have got to wonder if it is a sound idea , not many are going to fess up if they lose their jobs , "" Howman said .
"" Zero - tolerance does n't make much sense in the overall effort to clean up sport . ""
Usada is continuing to investigate those involved in the US Postal conspiracy .
"" There are still several dozen redacted names from our reasoned decision , "" said Tygart . ""
Footnote 18 [ in its reasoned decision ] says we 're still continuing our investigation and that 's about those names . ""
The Usada chief executive said he hoped the Armstrong case would be a "" watershed "" moment not only for cycling and drug - free sport but for society in general . ""
This was the most professionalised , sophisticated doping programme that sport will ever see , "" he said .
"" Let 's hope it never sees one of this scale and this successful .
It was designed to win and they won .
It was designed to keep it quiet and it kept it quiet for a long period of time .
We need to show that win at all costs does have costs .
"" Our interest is ensuring that no other athletes chase a dream as a young kid and end up only able to achieve that dream by using dangerous performance - enhancing drugs and then living a fraud . ""
He said that even Armstrong 's most ardent supporters had now had to accept that the 41-year - old was at the centre of a highly sophisticated doping ring .
"" It 's undeniable what the truth is .
I do n't think any reasonable people , or even unreasonable people , could question what happened .
The grand heist , as we 've called it , actually took place .
The process has confirmed that . """

2013-01-05,"Is Lance Armstrong really contemplating coming clean and making a confession of dope - cheating ?
That is the claim made in the New York Times in a report based on undisclosed number of anonymous sources said to be familiar with the situation .
On its face , the story does not seem so outlandish : Armstrong has been on the retreat for months , since he waived his right for a hearing in a court of arbitration for sport in the case built against him by the US Anti - Doping Agency .
After Usada announced that Armstrong would be stripped of his seven Tour de France titles ( among others ) , and then published its "" Reasoned Decision "" detailing the systematic doping that took place on the US Post and Discovery Channel teams Armstrong led , Armstrong 's world imploded .
One by one , his long - time major sponsors , including Nike and Oakley , ditched him ; finally , even the Livestrong Foundation â€ “ the cancer charity Armstrong founded and cherished as his legacy
no matter what became of his Tour titles â€ “ cut its ties with him in November .
Since then , there has been speculation about his finances , given the ongoing legal fights that beset him .
Given this relentless pressure â€ “ the chief of which now comes from the Livestrong Foundation , which must fear that Armstrong 's dope - cheating scandal is negatively affecting revenues â€ “ it is not impossible to imagine that Armstrong might finally throw in the towel .
What he has to gain might be some catharsis and public rehabilitation of his reputation ;
the rescuing of the Livestrong Foundation from his taint , and the possibility of renewing ties there ; and the chance to serve a limited ban and compete as an athlete again .
That is the rationale for this story .
But ranged against that logic are several powerful strands .
The greatest of these is that Armstrong currently faces several very expensive lawsuits : first , there is the "" whistleblower "" lawsuit filed by Armstrong 's former team - mate and nemesis Floyd Landis ( and it is still possible the US justice department could join this action under the False Claims Act ) ; then , there is an $ 11 m civil suit from Texas insurance company SCA Promotions , which is returning the compliment after Armstrong successfully sued the company for a 2005 payout over a disputed Tour win bonus ; finally , the British Sunday Times is suing Armstrong for the return of the $ 500,000 damages the newspaper was obliged to pay Armstrong over publication of excerpts from journalist David Walsh 's LA Confidentiel , plus $ 1 m in costs .
It is hard to see how Armstrong could defend any of these cases if he made even a limited admission of doping .
That is potentially a bankrupting situation .
Worse , for Armstrong , any confession would raise the possibility of prosecution for perjury for statements Armstrong has made under oath denying doping .
Regarding the original SCA Promotions case , Armstrong probably now escapes that jeopardy because of the statute of limitations ; but he could still be liable for criminal investigation for depositions made to a federal grand jury in 2010 .
So the legal risk to Armstrong as a consequence of confessing is huge â€ “ certainly , impoverishment , possibly bankruptcy , and conceivably prison .
Then there are the story 's denials .
The claim that Armstrong has been in discussion with US or world anti - doping authorities has been specifically denied by Armstrong 's lawyer , Tim Herman .
The head of Wada could not be reached by the New York Times ; and Usada 's chief , Travis Tygart , made no comment .
So , the story 's credibility comes down to anonymous sources .
Juliet Macur is a highly reputable journalist : her record of reporting on the Lance Armstrong affair has been exemplary .
She is now under a reported six - figure contract for a book about the undoing of Armstrong , Cycle of Lies , due out this year .
We can be sure that she has good sources .
My guess would be that , previously and in this case , some of those sources would be close to and possibly include , off the record , Tygart himself .
It is , though , also just imaginable that Armstrong associates may have fed this story â€ “ kite - flying to measure official reaction , perhaps to gauge the risk of perjury prosecution .
But does folding his hand and fessing up sound like Lance ?
Really ?
According to Macur , the reason given for Armstrong supposedly considering admission of doping offences is the possibility that his lifetime ban would be reduced , allowing him to compete as an athlete ( presumably in the triathlon events he now favours ) .
Macur quotes anti - doping experts who say the most Armstrong could expect from a confession , in the circumstances , would be to cut his ban from life to eight years , at best four .
That would make him 45 before he could compete again as a clean athlete , and perhaps nearly 50 .
After all that we 've seen of Lance Armstrong down the years â€ “ the bullish obstinacy , the extreme alpha - male aggression , the ruthless willingness to burn relationships and ruin others ' lives
â€ “
can we really be expected to believe that the guy would now hold up his hand and take some very bitter medicine , just so that he could compete in his twilight years as a masters athlete ?
Armstrong won ( sic ) seven consecutive Tours de France by cheating , yes , but he was also the master tactician .
Even now , with the limited avenues open to him , I ca n't see how Lance 's lizard brain would run the cost - benefit analysis of his options and come up with "" confession "" .
I hate to say it , but to me , this smells more like the story of a reporter with a book contract tempted to over - reach and one or two anti - doping officials still settling scores ."
2013-01-08,"Disgraced cyclist Lance Armstrong offered to "" donate "" up to $ 250,000 towards anti - doping campaigns , according to an interview with the head of the US Anti - Doping Agency .
CEO Travis Tygart told CBS 's "" 60 Minutes Sports "" that a representative for Lance Armstrong offered the agency a "" donation "" in 2004 , several years before a Usada investigation led to Armstrong being stripped of seven Tour de France titles .
In an interview on the show 's premier to be aired on Wednesday , Tygart said he did n't hesitate to turn the offer down .
Tygart tells interviewer Scott Pelley , according to a statement issued by the show : "" I was stunned .
It was clear - it was a clear conflict of interest for Usada .
We had no hesitation in rejecting that offer . ""
Asked how much money Armstrong offered the agency , Tygart replied : "" in excess of $ 150,000 . ""
Told that 60 Minutes had learned it was $ 250,000 , Tygart answered : "" It was around that ballpark . ""
Tygart also alleges Armstrong offered the International Cycling Union ( UCI ) , a regulatory body for the sport , a gift of $ 100,000 .
Armstrong 's attorney , Tim Herman , told AP that no such offer was made : "" No truth to that story .
First Lance heard of it was today .
He never made any such contribution or suggestion . ""
In October Usada produced a 1,000 page report which alleged that Lance Armstrong 's team "" ran the most sophisticated doping programme ever "" .
During the interview , Tygart describes Armstrong and his team of doctors , coaches and riders as similar to a "" Mafia "" that kept their secret for years and intimidated riders into silently following their illegal methods .
Some of those riders are considered victims by Tygart and he says they were forced to choose between following the doping program or being off the team .
Tygart says he was "" stunned "" when the U.S. Justice Department failed to charge Armstrong at the end of a two - year investigation and failed to share their findings with Usada .
"" I do n't know ( why they failed to charge Armstrong ) , "" says Tygart .
"" It 's a good question and one that if you finally answer , let me know . ""
Armstrong has denied ever using performance - enhancing drugs but according to a recent New York Times story is considering coming clean about doping in an effort to return to competition ."

2013-01-09,"The Lance Armstrong interview in which the disgraced former cyclist will deal with the doping revelations that led to a lifetime ban from sport and the stripping of his seven Tour de France titles will be streamed live around the world as well as broadcast on television in the United States .
The 90-minute special will air next Thursday at 9 pm eastern time in the US , or 2 am in the UK , and will be streamed on Oprah.com at the same time .
It is the first time Armstrong has given an interview since he lost his titles , was dropped by sponsors and pilloried by the public for his part in what the US Anti - Doping Agency called the "" most sophisticated doping programme that sport has ever seen "" .
According to reports , he also came under pressure from the board of Livestrong â€ “ the charity he founded to support cancer sufferers and from which he stood down as chairman in October â€ “ to speak publicly .
The Oprah Winfrey Network , which will show the programme , is a joint venture between Winfrey 's Harpo Productions and Discovery Channel .
Discovery Channel was the headline sponsor of Armstrong 's team between 2004 and 2007 .
It was the network 's logo that was displayed on his shirt when he won his seventh Tour in 2005 , when rumours had been swirling around his team for at least three years , and said it was a victory over "" the people that do n't believe in cycling , the cynics and the sceptics "" .
Discovery was a vocal supporter of Armstrong and one of the last sponsors to distance itself from the Texan once damning evidence emerged .
Usada revealed how Armstrong was accused by a string of witnesses and former team - mates of systematic doping throughout his career and banned him for life , a decision later ratified by the World Anti - Doping Agency and world cycling 's governing body , the UCI .
In a statement announcing the programme , Winfrey 's network said she would "" speak exclusively with Lance Armstrong in his first no - holds - barred interview "" at his home in Austin , Texas . ""
Armstrong will address the alleged doping scandal , years of accusations of cheating , and charges of lying about the use of performance - enhancing drugs throughout his storied cycling career , "" it said .
Social media networks immediately began speculating on whether Armstrong would use the programme as a platform to come clean or to further defend himself in the face of all available evidence .
Armstrong had previously told a US court tribunal that he had never used performance - enhancing drugs , opening up the possibility that he could perjure himself if he now admitted doping .
Many believe that Winfrey will give Armstrong an easy ride , recalling her interview with Marion Jones in which the disgraced American sprinter claimed she took performance - enhancing drugs unintentionally in the wake of the Balco scandal .
Kathy LeMond , wife of the American Tour de France winner Greg , tweeted : "" @Oprah I hope you get educated before the interview .
I know people that can help you . ""
A spokeswoman for the Oprah show said Armstrong was not being paid to appear and that Winfrey was free to ask him any question she wanted .
She said in an email : "" No payment for the interview .
No editorial control , no question is off limits .
"" The producers are unlikely to release the transcript of the show before it is screened .
Earlier on Tuesday , the US current affairs programme 60 Minutes featured an interview with the Usada chief executive , Travis Tygart , in which he claimed that Armstrong offered the agency a donation of $ 250,000 in 2004 , which it turned down .
Tygart also repeated his view that it was "" totally inappropriate "" that Armstrong made donations totalling more than $ 100,000 to the UCI around the same period ."
2013-01-09,"Lance Armstrong , the seven - time Tour de France winner who was stripped of his cycling championships for doping , is to break his silence in a television interview with Oprah Winfrey .
The Oprah Winfrey Network announced on Tuesday it will broadcast the interview on Thursday 17 January .
It will be Armstrong 's first formal interview since he was banned from racing for life . ""
Armstrong will address the alleged doping scandal , years of accusations of cheating and charges of lying about the use of performance - enhancing drugs throughout his storied cycling career , "" Winfrey 's network said in a statement .
On Saturday , reports emerged that Armstrong , 41 , had told associates and anti - doping officials he was considering an admission of using banned drugs .
It said Armstrong hoped to persuade anti - doping officials to allow him to resume competition in athletic events that adhere to the World Anti - Doping Code , under which the Texan is subject to a lifetime ban .
However , Armstrong 's lawyer , Tim Herman , later denied there had been talks with anti - doping bodies about any admission .
Armstrong has always vehemently denied charges of doping and has never been proven to have tested positive .
A 10 October 2012 report from the US anti - doping body Usada cited Armstrong 's involvement in what it characterised as the "" most sophisticated , professionalised and successful doping program that sport has ever seen "" involving anabolic steroids , human growth hormone , blood transfusions and other doping .
Less than two weeks later , Armstrong 's seven Tour de France victories were nullified and he was banned from competitive cycling for life after the International Cycling Union ratified Usada 's sanctions against him .
In November , Armstrong , a survivor of testicular cancer , stepped down as a board member of Livestrong , the cancer - support charity he founded in 1997 ."
2013-01-09,
2013-01-09,"It took years of defiant rejection of his critics , recovery from cancer , seven now - discredited Tour de France victories and a position at the heart of the "" most sophisticated doping programme sport has ever seen "" .
But as for so many other tarnished public figures , the journey of disgraced cyclist Lance Armstrong will next week end opposite Oprah Winfrey .
Winfrey has confirmed that Armstrong , who in October was stripped of all his titles and labelled a "" serial drug cheat "" by the United States Anti - Doping Agency ( Usada ) , will seek redemption on her show .
In a 90-minute interview from his home in Austin , Texas , he will speak publicly for the first time about the doping revelations that led to a lifetime ban from sport .
It will be streamed live around the world on Oprah.com next Thursday as well as broadcast in the US at 2 am UK time .
It is the first time Armstrong has given an interview since he lost his titles , was dropped by sponsors and pilloried by the public for his part in a doping conspiracy that spanned more than a decade and was described in excoriating detail in a 202-page report by Usada .
Within hours , bookmakers were offering odds on which words Armstrong would use in the interview , with Ladbrokes quoting 1 - 4 on "" apologise "" and evens on "" confess "" .
They were offering 8 - 11 on Armstrong breaking down in tears .
Travis Tygart , the Usada chief executive , told the Guardian in an interview last month that he hoped an Armstrong confession could yet act as a powerful symbol for drug - free sport .
But others , including another former cycling drug cheat who has since become a respected anti - doping campaigner , immediately voiced concerns that a stage - managed talkshow was not the right forum to discuss claims that as recently as October Armstrong 's lawyer was dismissing as a "" one - sided hatchet job "" .
"" Only Lance would get to have his moment of truth , if that 's what it will be , in front of Oprah Winfrey , "" said British cyclist David Millar , who was banned for two years in 2004 for injecting EPO at a time when doping was rife in the professional peloton .
"" It is not sitting in front of a judge or a disciplinary hearing being properly questioned about the things he has done wrong .
I doubt very much it will be a proper interrogation , "" added Millar , who is a member of the World Anti - Doping Agency 's athletes commission .
"" My biggest concern is that it will be completely stage - managed , that he will just be ' given the ball ' , and that it will all be about his emotions rather that concentrating on exactly what he did wrong . ""
A spokeswoman for the Oprah show said Armstrong was not being paid to appear and that Winfrey was free to ask any question she wanted .
"" No payment for the interview .
No editorial control , no question is off limits , "" the spokeswoman said in an email .
The Oprah Winfrey Network ( OWN ) , which will show the programme , is a joint venture between Winfrey 's Harpo Productions and Discovery Channel .
Discovery was the headline sponsor of Armstrong 's team between 2004 and 2007 .
It was that network 's logo that was emblazoned on his shirt when he won his seventh Tour in 2005 and claimed it as a victory over "" the people that do n't believe in cycling , the cynics and the sceptics "" .
Discovery was a vocal supporter of Armstrong and one of the last sponsors to distance itself from the Texan once Usada 's damning evidence was published .
Former colleagues and rivals immediately began speculating on whether Armstrong would use the programme as a platform for contrition or an attempt to shift the blame .
Armstrong had previously told a US tribunal that he had never used performance - enhancing drugs , opening up the possibility that he could perjure himself if he now admitted doping .
The Texan is at the centre of several ongoing legal disputes , while the Sunday Times is suing him for the repayment of a libel settlement the newspaper was forced to pay him over doping allegations .
Many fear Winfrey will give Armstrong an easy ride , recalling her interview with Olympic gold medallist Marion Jones , in which the weeping American sprinter claimed she took performance - enhancing drugs unintentionally .
Kathy LeMond , wife of the US Tour de France winner Greg , tweeted : "" @Oprah I hope you get educated before the interview .
I know people that can help you . ""
Since Usada published its "" reasoned decision "" in October , ratified some weeks later by cycling 's much criticised global governing body , the UCI , Armstrong has been deserted by a succession of high - profile supporters and sponsors , including Nike , and lost millions of pounds ' worth of endorsements .
He has also stepped down from his position as chairman of Livestrong , the charity he established to help fellow sufferers after winning his battle with testicular cancer .
Reports in the US at the weekend suggested he was considering making a confession and wanted to negotiate with the World Anti - Doping Agency over his ability to compete in the field of triathlon and running events ."

she 's the one who used to be Gayle King 's best friend .
Did n't she have a TV show in which she read books , lost and gained weight and gave away cars ?
There was a guy called Dr Phil and a bunch of Favorite Things and one time Tom Cruise came to jump all over her couch .
It was Oprah who taught me how to be my Best Self , which was good , because one day she just up and disappeared on me .
They said she 'd gone to cable , but I could n't find her .
Maybe I did n't try hard enough , maybe it 's because I ca n't go above channel 600 on my service .
But Oprah had gone , and all I had left was The View .
I stopped by her website once or twice , looking for her , but there were only so many times I could click on The Hair She Used to Wear and it was discouraging that her interactive timeline ended in 2009 .
What had happened ?
Had she retired ?
No way guys !
Oprah Winfrey is BACK .
Just like in a fairy tale , or the segment after commercial , she has been reborn in a bright red dress on this week 's cover of the Hollywood Reporter , as one of AdAge 's Most Influential Women in Advertising .
She also beaten Barbara , Diane â€ “ even Katie !
â€ “ to land the interview of the DECADE .
It 's just like the old days .
Put that in your Spanx , Gayle .
Next Thursday , 17 January , Oprah will sit down with Lance Armstrong in one of her Next Chapter "" enlightening and in - depth conversations "" on her cable channel , OWN .
It will be a crucial 90 minutes for both of them .
Armstrong has already hinted he is ready to come clean about the doping allegations that have dogged and ruined his cycling career .
It 's up to Oprah to tease that confession out of him .
If she succeeds , the interview will mark his permanent demise while crowning her own comeback .
Talk about a Next Chapter .
It turns out that Oprah has been working on her next chapter all along , even if us fair - weather friends had stopped paying attention .
Forget what you heard about things not going well at OWN .
So what if staff turnover was rapid ?
Oprah 's made herself the CEO and she 's going nowhere .
If â€ “ like me â€ “ you stopped buying O Magazine , causing a precipitous drop in its circulation ,
well Oprah does n't care .
She 'll shut it down if she needs to .
"" You know you are in your sweet spot when whatever you 're doing gives you energy instead of depleting it , "" she wrote recently , with her usual take - no - prisoners confidence . ""
In 1992 , I wrote in my journal that one day I would create a television network ...

With OWN , we now have a platform that can do that seven days a week on a 24-hour cable channel . ""
OWN is available in about 85 million homes and viewers are tuning in .
Oprah has been industriously wooing them .
She 's recently announced four new original series for this year , including a documentary , a drama and a comedy from Tyler Perry .
She 's continuing with Oprah 's Master Class , Oprah :

Oprah 's ratings have risen solidly but , more importantly , she has turned her attention from network to the internet .
She has her own section on the Huffington Post , her Book Club 2.0 takes place mainly on Twitter ( while maintaining its Midas best - seller touch ) and her interviews are live - streamed online .
To date , the highest rated show on OWN was Oprah 's interview with the Houston family after Whitney 's death last year .
Almost 3.5 million viewers tuned in .
The Armstrong "" no - holds - barred exclusive "" looks set to shatter that record .

2013-01-09,"Exposure of doping among cyclists has come to seem commonplace but a public confession of doping by a cyclist , unmitigated by a publisher , unleaked to the press , is a rare event .
In October 2000 , Richard Virenque broke down in a Lille courtroom under persuasive probing from Judge Daniel Delegove and ended two years of denial with a muttered assertion that he had indeed used drugs .
It was unforgettable drama in a public forum , but it was to prove the exception in cycling .
Do n't expect anything similar to happen next Friday when Lance Armstrong is interviewed by Oprah Winfrey .
Armstrong 's appearance on Oprah follows a pattern that is pretty clear to those who have followed cycling 's seemingly interminable run of drug scandals since Virenque and Festina .
There is a well - established sequence : denial for a lengthy period as confrontation with the evidence intensifies , followed by eventual confession , or , more accurately , a mitigated acceptance of reality .
Usually , the final phase is redemption of a kind .
That is what he will be hoping for , with hints from the US of pressure being applied over the damage being done to the Livestrong charity in particular .
It would be better to describe the process as being one of concession rather than confession and it is almost always done on terms that fit the agenda of the individual in question , be it a book deal ( Willy Voet , Tyler Hamilton ) or a rapid return to the sport ( Ivan Basso ) .
Armstrong 's agenda is the same : damage limitation , so what we should expect is pretty much what we have seen in the past .
Why now ?
As a bike racer , Armstrong always had a good idea of when to make his move , no matter whether he was fuelled by fresh blood or raw indignation , or both , and it 's no exception now .
He 's bided his time before the counterattack , allowed his many critics to have their say .
The more that was said the better for him in some ways : all those words create the media equivalent of the fog of war .
A reasonable amount of time has lapsed â€ “ the Christmas holiday helps here â€ “ and the intimate details of the US Anti - Doping Agency 's reasoned decision will have become a little hazy perhaps in many minds .
His performance will not be aimed at European fans and media , but at the American public , who have historically been more indulgent towards him .
The mere fact of seeing Armstrong sitting there on Oprah 's couch being Armstrong could well be enough for many viewers .
It 's not about warding off retribution .
He is cold - blooded enough to know that the Sunday Times , the US justice department or others will have their pound of flesh , and whether he stays quiet or speaks to Oprah , that 's in the hands of his lawyers .
What can be shifted is public perception in the event of retribution .
If he appears to be a victim of his time , as much sinned against as sinner , the argument will be made : has n't he suffered enough .
Expect vague concessions that wrongdoing took place
â€ “ I may have done things that I regret â€ “ but without any concession to the details , protestations of unfair hounding by the "" witch - hunters "" at Usada , and mitigating pleas of good behaviour : fundraising for the cancer community , perhaps the myth that plays so well of the boy from the wrong side of the tracks who made good against the odds .
Look out for hints that some of those involved might have other agendas in bringing him down : Hamilton and David Walsh 's respective books , Greg LeMond 's willingness to be president of the UCI if asked , the mitigated bans given to some of the whistleblowers .
Those suggestions do n't have to be true , they merely have to muddy the waters , complicate the picture , make it possible for the argument to be made as follows :
he was a driven man , he did n't want to do whatever he denied doing , but he had no choice because the others were all doing it
( they were n't ) , he was brought down by a multifaceted conspiracy , he is a victim and can we move on now please ?
A dignified exposition of all this will mark the beginning of a new narrative and , who knows , a publisher may be watching with an eye to bidding for volume three of The Lance Years .
The lesson Armstrong learned in his Tour - winning years is that much of the audience will create its own truth , for or against .
Whatever the media reaction , whatever the unpleasant details in those Usada pages , his personal performance â€ “ in the theatrical sense â€ “ will count for most in the process of winning over public opinion ."
2013-01-09,"America may not , to its occasional twinging regret , have a royal family , but for the past four decades it has had its own regal mother confessor .
When Michael Jackson , the former sprinter Marion Jones and countless less starry but no less remorseful Americans have sought public redemption , they have all turned to Oprah Winfrey .
So it is entirely in keeping with this , if not noble then at least long - running tradition that for his first TV interview since the alleged doping scandal , Lance Armstrong has sent , not the Bat Signal , but the Oprah Winfrey Signal .
It 's a light that bathes the sky in a sudsy , soppy and occasionally saccharine glow .
Yet while Winfrey might not be known as the hardest hitting of interviewers ( except , that is , when the interviewee is seeking forgiveness for a wrong they committed against Winfrey herself , as authors James Frey and Jonathan Franzen learned to their cost ) , to choose Winfrey at all is something of a statement from Armstrong .
News last weekend that Armstrong is "" considering making a public confession that he used performance enhancing drugs "" sounded to many like a confession in itself ; the announcement that he is to kneel at the forgiving feet of Winfrey has the decided smack of a penitent man who has lost the bullying defiance that has long defined his attitude towards allegations of doping .
You do n't go to Winfrey just to confess : you go to Winfrey to confess , cry and beseech public sympathy ( and hopefully to pry open leeway to some kind of post - scandal career ) .
Going by past examples , Winfrey probably wo n't be too tough on Armstrong , disappointing his angry former fans .
But she will , guaranteed , wring tears out of him , however genuine they might be .
It is not difficult to fathom how Winfrey has carved this deified role for herself .
The woman positively quivers with warmth and empathy .
She 's soft , but exudes a starry , even regal aura , which in turn flatters her guests who feel that , OK , they might have been strong - armed into riding the redemption train , but at least they 're going first class with a billionaire .
She has long perfected the skill of appearing to share intimate details of her own life while , in fact , revealing nothing of her actual self , retaining a dignity and reassuring blankness that few other American TV chatshow hosts , let alone celebrities , have managed .
Yet while many miserable masses have huddled on Winfrey 's sofa , Armstrong 's decision to turn to Winfrey is a huge coup for her .
This interview will not be on the easily accessible TV channels where her hugely successful show ran for a quarter of a century until 2011 , but on Winfrey 's cable network , OWN , and her website .
The network has had a shaky first 18 months , with some Winfrey fans complaining they ca n't actually find it .
But even if Winfrey 's blue chip quality has suffered , she is still â€ “ when it comes to flawed celebrities â€ “ the first - class option and , arguably most importantly , the soft and safe choice ."
2013-01-09,"The Oprah Winfrey Network 's promise of a "" no - holds barred "" confessional from Lance Armstrong would be a break from the tested Oprah format .
The reality is likely to be more cuddles than confrontation .
The Oprah - branded cable channel â€ “ run by Discovery , the broadcaster that sponsored Armstrong 's team between 2004 and 2007 â€
“ promised a forensic trawl through the rider 's "" alleged doping scandal , years of accusations of cheating and charges of lying "" .
Previous form , though , suggests the encounter with Armstrong will follow a more familiar pattern for Oprah - led celebrity relaunches , involving the host 's famous "" rapport talk "" and the guest 's ability to cry in public .
In 2008 , the former Olympic champion Marion Jones gave her first post - prison interview ( video ) , having served six months for perjury after lying about her use of steroids to US federal prosecutors .
The set - piece confessional â€ “ another attempt to address a "" doping scandal , years of accusations of cheating and charges of lying "" â€ “
included Jones breaking down in tears three times .
Still on probation when she gave the interview , Jones insisted she had no idea she was being given a performance - enhancing drug by her coach , maintaining she thought all along that it was just a supplement .
She blamed childhood trauma on her decision to lie and tearfully made public a letter she sent from prison to her children , apologising to them for the hurt she had caused .
"" I did n't love myself enough to tell the truth , "" she wrote .
"" I have hidden behind my obvious talent for much of my life for fear that the weak , sad , hurt and vulnerable Marion would emerge and ruin the plan for my life . ''
She said that , while in prison , she felt reborn .
"" There were moments , Oprah , where I felt like my world was overâ€
¦
[ But ] there were remarkably days where I just felt empowered , almost .
It 's almost like I got this renewed energy where I felt that : ' I 'm here for a reason . '
The searching for that reason , I think , is what really changed my life . ""
Jones added that she thought she would still have won her Olympic medals even without doping .
"" I still think I would have won .
It was n't as difficult to give back the medals because it 's not about the hardware .
But it 's the memory that will be tarnished . ""
She concluded : "" I 'm trying to move on .
I hope that everybody else can move on , too . ""
The interview earned a mixed reception .
ESPN called the performance "" squirm - inducing "" , while The Examiner wrote : "" Apparently even six months in a Texas jail cell has n't diminished her hubris . """
2013-01-10,"It 's a paradox that just as sacramental confession has grown less popular with Catholics , so it seems to have taken root in the secular world .
There is counselling ; and there are shrinks to whom you disclose the errors of your ways â€ “ or at least , the unhappiness that derives from your psychological problems .
There are self - help groups , such as the admirable Alcoholics Anonymous , in which addicts confess some of the hair - raising activities carried out while under the influence .
Then there are the public , televised confessions , such as that due to occur between Lance Armstrong and Oprah Winfrey .
This is a little more akin to a medieval ritual in which the offender makes a public avowal of his sins and is thus granted forgiveness , and possibly a plenary indulgence .
It 's an ordeal , but there is shriving at the end of it .
And in return for Armstrong 's mea maxima culpa before the great St Oprah , he may well be restored to some kind of grace for having been a sports cheat , using drugs to enhance his cycling performance on the Tour de France .
So , is confession good for the soul , cathartic therapy , and a useful way of self - correction ?
That is what we Catholics have usually felt on emerging from the confession box â€ “ though much depended on the confessor , some being liberal , some being stern .
If the Blessed Oprah is to be Armstrong 's confessor , she will have to be convinced that he is sorry for what he has done , and that he has made "" a firm purpose of amendment "" to virtue .
Traditional confession used to involve what we now call "" restorative justice "" .
If you confessed to stealing money , you were enjoined to restore what you had stolen ; or , if you could n't afford to pay back the whole lot , then whatever was manageable .
This restorative element was essential to the sinner 's recovery process : by restoring moral order he gains self - worth .
Thus will Armstrong agree to restore the $ 11 m that an American insurance company claims he now owes ?
Will he be redeemed in the eyes of the public by "" making a clean breast "" of his failings ?
There are major differences between public confession and the private kind .
While the New Testament tells us that , on the last day , our sins will be shouted from the rooftops , in the meantime we are permitted to recount these sins in confidence and under the unbreakable "" seal of the confessional "" .
Remember the adorable Montgomery Clift in Hitchcock 's I Confess â€ “ the sensitive priest who refuses to break the seal even under the threat of death ?
The idea here was to give the penitent a safe and confidential space in which to talk , and the notion was usefully transferred to counsellors and psychoanalysts .
This protocol of confidentiality is now somewhat dented : if you go to a counsellor these days she will tell you that if you have broken the law , either by involvement with terrorism , or a paedophile offence , she will be obliged to inform the authorities .
I daresay this is a well - meant measure of security , but it is regrettable in some respects : I have spoken to psychiatrists who are concerned that paedophiles who genuinely want to be helped to overcome their orientation will be too anxious to seek treatment , because they fear it could be put into the public realm .
After the clerical paedophile scandals in Ireland , the Irish justice minister , Alan Shatter , said that the seal of the confessional could no longer hide the offences of those who sexually abuse children â€ “ priests must reveal what they hear in confession .
This has not yet been enforced by law , but it may still be introduced .
Granted , paedophile offenders should be brought to justice .
But there is also much to be said for someone confronting an agonising personal problem in confidence .
Public confessions on TV , via social media , and as a celebrity stunt to gain sympathy ( or regain a wife , as with Tiger Woods ) have something of the same components as the traditional confessional rite â€ “ except discretion .
And as there may soon be no such thing as a private life , perhaps all our sins will be shouted from the rooftop well before judgment day ."

2013-01-11,"The head of a Swiss laboratory accused by the chief executive of the US Anti - Doping Agency of giving Lance Armstrong "" the keys to beating EPO tests "" has dismissed the claim as "" a nonsense "" .
Usada 's Travis Tygart made the claim in an interview given to the US current affairs programme 60 Minutes , in which he also said his organisation had turned down the offer of a $ 250,000 donation from Armstrong in 2004 .
Dr Martial Saugy , the Swiss laboratory 's director , conceded he had met with Armstrong in Luxembourg in 2002 at the request of the UCI , cycling 's governing body , shortly before the Tour de France started .
But he said he was "" surprised "" by Tygart 's claim that he passed on the key to beating the then recently introduced test for erythropoietin ( EPO ) .
Saugy suggested that Tygart had "" deficiencies "" in his recollection of their discussion in Moscow in 2010 soon after US federal investigators opened a probe into Armstrong and said his interpretation of that part of it was "" a nonsense "" . ""
The answer to the question of whether I gave Lance Armstrong the key to circumvent EPO tests , is clearly no .
I remain convinced that it [ the meeting ] was the right thing to do .
It was not a mistake , nor naive as some have written , "" he said .
"" It would be paradoxical for the laboratory that reported the first case of EPO to give the key to circumvent tests .
The fight against doping is our life 's work . ""
Tygart , the man who brought charges against Armstrong that led to him being stripped of his seven Tour de France titles , told 60 Minutes that Saugy told him over dinner that he had met Armstrong and Johan Bruyneel , the US Postal team 's leader , at the request of the UCI in 2002 to explain how the EPO test worked .
The UCI insists that the meetings were arranged as a "" deterrent "" to show riders it was getting tough on doping and not to show them how to beat the system .
The UCI has set up an independent commission , with Baroness Tanni Grey - Thompson among the members , to investigate Usada 's findings
â€ “ including those related to donations made by Armstrong to the UCI .
The findings are expected before June .
In the TV programme , Tygart said he asked Saugy : "" Did you give Lance Armstrong and Johan Bruyneel the keys to beating EPO tests ? ""
"" And he nodded to say : ' Yes , ' "" Tygart said . ""
He explained to them , just the two of them .
As far as I know , it 's unprecedented .
It 's completely wrong to meet an athlete with a suspect result and explain to him how the test works .
"" The Swiss official denied suggestions he had made an error or was naive in meeting the rider to discuss anti - doping strategy .
About the meeting Saugy said : "" I have absolutely no regret .
I would repeat it . ""
He argues that Armstrong and other riders at that time had a right to information about false positive results in EPO tests .
A UCI spokesman insisted it had never tried to cover up the meeting and that such talks had taken place with "" many riders and many teams "" . ""
The UCI organised meetings with some riders to make them aware of the steps we were taking , "" he said .
"" We never met to tell them how to beat the system â€ “ the purpose was to say we are working in this direction .
It was just an information policy and a deterrent .
It has emerged that Armstrong 's interview with Oprah Winfrey , in which he will for the first time discuss the doping allegations that led to him being banned for life , will be filmed on Monday at his home in Austin , Texas .
The 90-minute interview will air at 9 pm Eastern Time in the US on Thursday , or 2 am on Friday in the UK .
It will be screened by the Discovery Channel in the UK , as well as streamed live on Winfrey 's website ."
2013-01-12,"Lance Armstrong will make a limited confession to doping during his televised interview with Oprah Winfrey this week .
The disgraced cyclist , who has long denied doping , will also offer an apology during the interview scheduled to be recorded on Monday night at his home in Austin , Texas , according to an anonymous source .
While not directly saying he would confess or apologise , Armstrong sent a text message to the Associated Press on Saturday saying : "" I told her [ Winfrey ] to go wherever she wants and I 'll answer the questions directly , honestly and candidly .
That 's all I can say . ""
Meanwhile , the Sunday Times has placed an advertisement in Sunday 's Chicago Tribune in the form of an open letter from the newspaper 's chief sports writer , David Walsh , a long - standing critic of Armstrong .
It lists 10 questions Oprah should ask Armstrong and includes : "" Did you sue The Sunday Times to shut us up ? ""
In December the News International title said it would sue the Texan for Â£1.5 m after paying out a Â£300,000 libel claim by Armstrong in 2006 .
USA Today , citing an anonymous source , reported that Armstrong plans to admit using performance - enhancing drugs but is unlikely to reveal details of the allegations outlined in a 2012 report by the US Anti - Doping Agency .
That report led to Armstrong being stripped of his seven Tour de France titles and banned for life from the sport .
Armstrong 's representatives declined to comment .
The New York Times reported last week that Armstrong was considering making a confession .
The 41-year - old , who denied doping for years , has not spoken publicly about the Usada report .
That cast him as the leader of a sophisticated and brazen doping programme on his US Postal Service teams that included use of steroids , blood boosters and illegal blood transfusions .
Winfrey 's network said that Armstrong had agreed to a "" no holds barred "" interview .
A confession to Winfrey would come at a time when Armstrong 's legal troubles appear to be easing .
Any potential perjury charges stemming from his sworn testimony denying doping in a 2005 arbitration fight with a Dallas promotions company over a contract bonus worth $ 7.5 m would fall foul of the statute of limitations .
Armstrong faces a whistle - blower lawsuit filed by his former team - mate Floyd Landis , which accuses him of defrauding the US Postal Service , but the US Justice Department has yet to say if it will join the case ."
2013-01-14,"Lance Armstrong apologized to the staff of his Livestrong cancer foundation on Monday before sitting down for a confessional interview with Oprah Winfrey , according to the Associated Press .
The disgraced cyclist , who was stripped of his seven Tour de France titles amid overwhelming evidence that he was guilty of doping , addressed an emotional meeting of Livestrong staff on Monday and said "" I 'm sorry "" , an unnamed source told AP .
Apologizing for disappointing them and putting the foundation at risk , Armstrong reportedly "" choked up "" during the meeting , and several other employees were in tears , too .
Armstrong told staffers he would try to restore Livestrong 's reputation , and encouraged them to continue supporting the charity 's mission to help cancer patients and their families .
Armstrong , a cancer survivor , founded Livestrong in 1997 .
He stepped down as a board member in November 2012 following the release of a damning report by the US Anti - Doping Agency ( Usada ) that accused him of doping .
The report alleged that Armstrong had masterminded the "" most sophisticated , professional and successful doping program that sport has ever seen "" .
After years of denying any involvement in doping , and aggressively pursuing those who accused him of doing so , Armstrong is expected to make a limited confession to using performance - enchancing drugs in the interview with Winfrey .
Although the interview is his first since the Usada report , it is not expected that he will discuss the findings , or the charges against him , in detail .
Armstrong texted the AP on Saturday and said : "" I told her [ Winfrey ] to go wherever she wants , and that I 'll answer the questions directly , honestly and candidly .
That 's all I can say .
"" Winfrey 's network OWN said Armstrong agreed to a "" no - holds - barred "" interview . ""
Amstrong will address the alleged doping scandal , years of accusations of cheating and charges of lying about the use of performance - enhancing drugs throughout his storied cycling career , "" the network said in a statement .
The interview is set to air Thursday at 9 pm eastern time in the US on the Oprah Winfrey Network and will be streamed live internationally on Oprah.com .
Armstrong has continued to maintain his innocence , but is facing several legal challenges , and has lost millions of dollars in sponsorship deals and endorsements .
The Sunday Times of London is suing him for recovery of damages from a libel settlement he made with the newspaper after they accused him of doping .
Usada 's sanctions against Armstrong were ratified by the International Cycling Union ( UCI ) , and he was later stripped of his seven Tour de France titles and banned from competitive cycling for life ."
2013-01-14,"Jodie Foster is gay and Lance Armstrong is a doper .
These are the large stories of the day â€ “ at least , the stories that people in the media are having serious palpitations about .
Of course , there is no news here .
Foster has lived openly with a partner and their adopted children , then broken up just as publicly : all in all , a quarter century or so of being indubitably gay .
Indeed , her coming out at the Golden Globes was , in fact , a coming - out to say that she had long ago come out .
Nevertheless , paroxysms of media attention and praise .
Armstrong has been meticulously investigated , found guilty , and stripped of all his awards , standing , and reputation .
He 's now pretty much the last word in steroids .
And , to boot , we 've discovered that he really is n't very nice : he 's sports ' nastiest guy .
But he is taping with Oprah for a much anticipated show on which he will admit that he 's a doper .
And everybody , at least everybody in the media , is on the edge of their seats .
Two fabulous nonstories , with no reveals ( as they say in the reality television show business ) whatsoever , and everybody , everybody in the media anyway , is gaga , intent on reporting that â€ ¦ Jodie is gay and Lance is a doper .
This is the news .
Except this is really not the news .
Rather , what 's going on here is our fascination â€ “ that is , our fascination as media people â€ “ with how we are used and manipulated .
That 's what 's mesmerizing .
In part , this may be because we are masochists .
We are drawn to people who seduce and use us .
But it 's admiration , too : people like Foster and Armstrong are the ultimate media people , more adept at playing the media than even we are in the media .
That 's what makes a star .
How is it that Jodie Foster , openly gay at the dawn of celebrities being openly gay â€ “ when the culture was undergoing a revolution and there was a whole journalistic subgenre of outing people who were barely hiding â€ “ managed to avoid being a fabulous and groundbreaking story ?
For media people , it is almost more interesting to us when stars avoid being the story than when they are the story .
When they hide in plain sight , when they baldly lie , that 's talent .
In a sense , of course , that 's their ultimate job , and what separates them from other celebrities : their ability to handle and control the media .
In Armstrong 's case , his denials will go to the hall of fame of denials .
Even among liars and convicts , his denials are statements of ultimate chutzpah .
They were denials of such verve and certainty that even when everybody â€ “ everybody in the media â€ “ knew he was absolutely lying , they were willing to believe him , or at least maintain a straight face .
For Foster and Armstrong , there has been , on our part , a kind of self - censorship .
Not to protect them , per se , but to protect the audience .
We believed that the audience was not quite ready to know what we knew .
Or rather , both Foster and Armstrong had such strong public images and followings , that we in the media were not taking any chances with an abrupt and rude unloading of the full truth .
That 's media power
â€ “ when we think our audience trusts our subjects more than it trusts us .
However , we are not resentful about this or , frankly , even itching to tell the truth .
Instead , we are admiring of how certain people commanded our restraint .
Again , this is a star .
Even as late as this past August , Buzz Bissinger , one of the most famous sports journalists in the nation â€ “ as famous a sports journalist as Lance Armstrong was an athlete â€ “ wrote a Newsweek cover story on how much he continued to believe Lance .
While his literal belief is not credible , it is reasonable that he believed Lance Armstrong would get away with it , and that therefore Lance 's counterintuitive virtue could make an effective Newsweek cover .
So much for Newsweek .
As for Bissinger , he is now beating his chest about his own pathetic gullibility , in a way that curiously seems to mirror the grand mea culpa that Armstrong will perform on Oprah .
Likewise , Foster is now retailing the obvious as reinvention .
For much of her career , Foster developed a reputation as an actor above the fray , a fiercely artistic performer not concerned with , well , the media ( although as it happens , most of her career has been a steady stream of largely undistinguished star - vehicles ) .
This hauteur helped her navigate the gay story : she was simply too good for that , and she was powerful enough in her younger years to be able to threaten retribution .
But now she is an actress in her fifties , facing the same issues of all actresses in their fifties , heterosexual or not : beyond ingÃ © nue and mother , there are few roles .
But her Golden Globes coming - out could change that nicely .
She 's used her long - time avoidance of attention on the gay issue to gain attention now .
She 's repositioning herself as the gold standard of Hollywood lesbians .
And we 're delighted to see her do it .
It 's a deft sleight of hand .
And now Lance .
From the media view , Lance Armstrong on Oprah 's couch is a Houdini moment .
Can he get out of the chained and locked box of his vast public disgrace ?
Clearly , he would not have picked Oprah for his confession if he was n't bent on trying .
This is confession as rehabilitation .
The headline will be that he 's admitted his crime .
But the real issue is whether he can escape the punishment .
That 's what 's riveting here : the mechanics of the escape .
It really does n't seem possible : he 's the world 's most famous cheat and liar .
Surely , none of us in the media is media - savvy enough to imagine quite how he 'd emerge from such universal opprobrium .
But if he does , if he is able to manipulate even a little forgiveness , to engender a bit of curiosity as to the normal human failings and higher aspirations that might have led him down the road to such disgrace , we 'll cheer him on .
That 's a story ."
2013-01-14,"The former world and Olympic cycling champion Nicole Cooke has retired from the sport with a stinging broadside at Lance Armstrong , Tyler Hamilton and other drug cheats who "" robbed "" her and other clean riders of victories and prize money during her 11-year professional career .
Cooke , who kickstarted Britain 's golden run of success at the Beijing Olympics by winning the women 's road race and also became world champion in the same year , also took aim at the sport 's governing body for being more obsessed with protecting its own image than promoting women 's cycling .
Confirming her decision to retire , Cooke said she was "" very happy "" with her career but lamented that it had coincided with an era tainted by doping scandals .
"" I am so very fortunate to have been able to have won clean , "" said Cooke , for whom cycling had been her "" life 's work "" since the age of 12 .
"" I have been robbed by drug cheats , but I am fortunate , I am here before you with more in my basket than the 12-year - old dreamed of .
But for many genuine people out there who do ride clean , people with morals , many of these people have had to leave the sport with nothing after a lifetime of hard work . ""
The 29-year - old took aim at Hamilton , a former team - mate of Armstrong 's who failed tests but consistently denied doping before belatedly laying bare the extent of the conspiracy within their team in his book The Secret Race . ""
Tyler Hamilton will make more money from his book describing how he cheated than I will make in all my years of honest labour , "" said the Welsh rider .
Cooke , who blazed a trail for women 's cycling in the UK and won the British road race championship 10 times , made her announcement in the same week as Armstrong will appear on Oprah Winfrey 's show for the first time since he was stripped of his seven Tour de France titles and banned for life . ""
When Lance cries on Oprah later this week and she passes him a tissue , spare a thought for all of those genuine people who walked away with no reward â€ “ just shattered dreams .
Each one of them is worth a 1,000 Lances , "" said Cooke .
"" I do despair that the sport will ever clean itself up when rewards of stealing are greater than riding clean .
If that remains the case , the temptation for those with no morals will always be too great . ""
She said the cycling 's world governing body , the UCI , had failed to grow road cycling for women because it was engrossed in defending itself against accusations of complicity in Armstrong 's doping . ""
The UCI have been so engrossed trying to find receipts for the equipment they bought after Lance made donations to them , and suing Floyd Landis after he blew the whistle , and holding press conferences calling Landis a liar , "" she said .
"" Whilst they have been busy with all these priorities , the women 's road sport , that looked so promising in 2002 when I turned professional , has crumbled . ""
Despite the perceived strength of cycling in the UK at present , there has been consistent criticism of the low financial rewards and lack of competitive opportunities for women in the sport .
"" I hope I will look on in 10 years ' time and see a vibrant and healthy women 's road scene .
The key to that will be that the female athletes are treated with respect , "" said Cooke ."
2013-01-14,"As Britain edges towards its European showdown it 's worth asking what Ken Clarke and Peter Mandelson have in common with Lance Armstrong , the disgraced ex - winner of multiple Tours de France .
No , not a systemic and fraudulent use of performance enhancing drugs to the detriment of a much - loved sport .
Clarke and Lord M have no need of stimulants to get them excited over Europe or fiscal policy .
The problem the Westminster pair share with Armstrong is the one he is preparing to tackle when he appears on Oprah Winfrey 's "" no holds barred "" TV sofa this week : how to atone for error and thereby regain the respect and â€ “ for politicians , more important â€ “ the attention of disillusioned voters .
Failure to get it right will end arrogant Armstrong 's career .
Clarke and Mandelson 's latest Centre for British Influence through Europe ( CBIE ) campaign could fail for the same reason , as will Ed Balls 's recurring attacks on the coalition 's deflationary economic response to the recession .
It 's all getting urgent .
David Cameron was on the airwaves this morning
â€ “ ahead of next week 's big Cameron speech in The Hague on EU policy
â€ “ trying to steer a course between renegotiation and repatriation of some powers from Brussels and a stampede for the fire exit , which is what many Tories , MPs , ministers and voters would prefer .
Ed Miliband says the PM risks "" sleepwalking out of Europe "" .
He 's right .
And it 's not something I say every day .
Even Eric Pickles is cheeking Dave now , echoing George Osborne in saying that we 've got to be prepared to quit Europe if we are to obtain the revised terms we need .
It 's a risky strategy , a bluff which both Brussels and Ukip could easily call .
Harold Wilson was allowed a pretty phoney "" renegotiation "" in 1975 â€ “ he later won the in / out referendum by 2 to 1 â€ “ but patience is wearing thin nowadays .
The "" renegotiate or bust "" lobby is wrong ( says me ) , as guilty of panacea politics as Alex Salmond is in Scotland . ""
Let 's cast off the chains of foreign domination and enjoy our freedom to do what suits us , "" they cry .
It 's a fantasy ( ask the Irish ) , albeit a potent one .
But the sceptics and the phobics do have a point when they say to the Clarke / Mando crowd : "" You got it wrong before and you have never said sorry . ""
Well , have they ?
If one of them made a big "" Sorry "" speech I missed it .
Clever Robert McCrum wrote a subtle Observer article on Sunday about redemption after a public fall from grace which Clarke and Mandelson could usefully read .
Richard Nixon , Tiger Woods , John Profumo , Bill Clinton and the rest
, they all managed in different ways to atone for their very public failings , he wrote .
Gerard Depardieu , the thespian Russian tax exile , may soon have to embark on the same stony path of contrition and hard work now
he 's realised he has made a fool of himself .
On a week when all the big guns are firing over Cameron 's promised renegotiation with Brussels the contrition bit matters for people such as Ken Clarke â€ “ there are plenty like him , including fellow campaigners such as Tony Blair and Michael Heseltine â€ “ because their impassioned pleas for Britain to remain at the heart of Europe overlook one important fact : all the dire warnings they now issue about the dangers to British jobs and interests in leaving the EU are near - identical to the warnings they gave about Britain NOT joining the new single currency in 2001 .
It 's a bit like Ed Balls and economic policy .
Every time the shadow chancellor urges a more expansionary fiscal policy â€ “ more public spending , more debt , even some tax cuts â€ “ to float HMS Britain off the recessionary rocks , he reminds any voter with half a brain that he and Captain Brown were at the helm when lax fiscal and regulatory policies helped the rackety bankers steer us on to those self - same rocks .
Likewise Heseltine , Blair , Mandelson , Clarke and Co over their misplaced enthusiasm for the euro , from which , incidentally , Brown and Balls saved us ; though they get little credit for it .
Sooner or later there was bound to be trouble with the currency .
You ca n't have a currency without some form of state in place to manage it , a measure of banking union and fiscal oversight .
That 's what 's happening now , as Germany makes perfectly reasonable demands for control over its neighbours ' budgets , which German taxpayers may have to underwrite .
The new German model may , or may not , work .
Some EU officials are already saying the euro crisis of 2008 is now past its worst .
Well , maybe , though even a multilingual europhile such as Nick Clegg said within my hearing last week that such talk is a bit premature .
He also said that Britain will not be joining the euro in his political lifetime .
Correct on both counts .
But it 's not our fight .
Ever since Britain finally joined Europe 40 years ago this month , Brussels , Berlin and Paris have had to make adjustments to accommodate us , that Wilson referendum , Margaret Thatcher 's rebate , John Major 's assorted opt - outs at Maastricht , taken up by Blair and Brown when they did n't join the euro but did join the social chapter to show goodwill .
Now Cameron and Co want to opt back out again of assorted policies â€ “ crime and justice for example â€ “ while reserving the right to opt into the bits they like , a reciprocal European arrest warrant being one .
The warrant is unpopular for all sorts of reasons , good and bad , but we do need it .
You can see why the foreigners , busy with their own problems ( which include rising resentment and nationalism at home ) get cross .
Why ca n't the Brits make up their minds and stick to it ?
Even the Obama administration , usually not much bothered with tired old Europe , is telling us to stay put , although that Bush team idiot John Bolton has popped up in the Times on Monday to encourage the hotheads .
It 's a replay of Donald Rumsfeld 's "" Old Europe "" vs "" New Europe "" jibe ; except it does n't play so well in New Europe nowadays .
Cameron may ( may ) be able to negotiate a credible new deal with Paris and Berlin â€ “
he 's already got useful leverage over banking reforms and the Fresh Start group of not - daft Tory MPs
believes he could do better .
Other countries want to change things , too .
But the big players may feel they have better things to do with their time than pander ( again ) to a grandstanding , self - centred strategy , driven by fear of Ukip 's appeal to fed - up voters .
It is fraught with peril , with potential benefits clearly outweighed by the risks .
As for Fleet St 's anti - EU cheerleaders , the folk who gave you phone hacking and much else unsavoury besides , they are poor judges of the national interest , too .
The people who own these papers do n't pay income tax here and ( mostly ) do n't have correspondents in Brussels either .
They have plenty of good reasons to gripe about over - ambitious , under - performing EU policy , quite apart from the eurozone crisis , which damages us all .
But much of the problem we perceive is of our own making ( for instance , the way we apply EU regulations domestically ) or mere scapegoating for our own failings , economic , social and political .
Monday 's Guardian letters include a number of useful reminders â€ “ disputed in other letters â€ “ of the benefit of EU membership .
Ukip 's remedies are pretty flaky , just as Alex Salmond 's unanswerable case for independence does n't stand up to a robust kicking .
The tone of aggrieved , panacea populism sounds much the same in London , Edinburgh or in small town America with its Tea Party enthusiasm for more guns and less tax .
Life will go on if Scotland votes for independence in 2014 and Britain votes to leave the EU in 2015 - 16 , though the thought of Scotland reapplying for membership after England and Wales leave ( and Belfast embraces Dublin ? ) is certainly not dull .
Life will alway go on until the sun dies and even the FT 's pro - EU German columnist , Wolfgang Munchau , admits in Monday 's column that UK membership is "" virtually irrelevant "" in macroeconomic terms since we left "" the heart of Europe "" by sidestepping the euro 20 years ago , a view not widely shared by his paper .
As a "" Son of Thatcher "" Eurosceptic , Cameron does not carry the baggage of the older Heathite generation of Clarke and Hezza .
If he is to try a renegotiation he needs to show real leadership and courage in keeping his own party in line and
Ukip holed up in its natural habitat , the saloon bar .
But the allies that Cameron will need on the pro - EU wing must first own up to their past mistakes and errors of judgment .
We look to Lance Armstrong to show them the benefits of confessional contrition with Oprah ."
2013-01-15,"Oprah Winfrey has confirmed that after years of furious denials and threats Lance Armstrong finally "" came clean "" over his doping past during their two - and - a - half hour interview , due to be broadcast later this week .
The US TV presenter appeared on CBS This Morning to talk about the interview with Armstrong , which was filmed on Monday in his home town of Austin , and said that the manner of his confession was "" surprising "" to her .
She implied that Armstrong , stripped of seven Tour de France titles after a Usada report placed him at the heart of the "" most sophisticated doping programme sport has ever seen "" , had been more candid than she expected . ""
He did not come clean in the manner I expected .
I was surprised , "" said Winfrey , who said that Armstrong was highly prepared and had "" certainly prepped himself "" .
Winfrey , who said that the interview will now be broadcast over two days rather than one , said she was "" satisfied with the answers "" .
She added : "" He was just ready â€ ¦ he met the moment . ""
The interview will be aired on Winfrey 's OWN network in the US and the Discovery Channel in the UK and she said it was the biggest she has ever done .
"" A couple of times he was emotional but emotional does n't begin to describe the intensity and the difficulty he had talking about these issues , "" she told CBS .
Winfrey also said she did not allow Armstrong 's lawyers in the room while they were recording , although he did have a team of people present who would address any issues they had afterwards .
She said they had none .
Arrangements were made when Winfrey , who has interviewed Armstrong several times before , met with the disgraced cyclist in Hawaii .
She had earlier emailed him when the Usada 's sensational report was published
but he was "" not ready "" to talk at that point .
The interview was moved to a hotel in Austin after the original plan to film at his house had to be changed because news crews had staked it out .
Winfrey told CBS she "" hand - carried "" the interview tapes "" in my bag with dog food "" and revealed that during a break in filming Armstrong asked : "" Will there be a point where you lighten up ? ""
It is the first time Armstrong has given an interview since he lost his titles , was dropped by sponsors and pilloried by the public for his part in a doping conspiracy that spanned more than a decade and was described in excoriating detail in a 202â€“page report by Usada .
The Texan is at the centre of several ongoing legal disputes , amid renewed speculation that he would repay some of the millions of dollars that US Postal invested in his team , while the Sunday Times is suing him for the repayment of a libel settlement the newspaper was forced to pay him over doping allegations .
Since Usada published its "" reasoned decision "" in October , ratified some weeks later by cycling 's much criticised global governing body , the UCI , Armstrong has been deserted by a succession of high - profile supporters and sponsors , including Nike , and lost millions of dollars ' worth of endorsements .
He has also stepped down from his position as chairman of Livestrong , the charity he established after winning his battle with testicular cancer ."
2013-01-15,"It could just be that Lance Armstrong has done a deal giving Oprah Winfrey the exclusive rights to any confession he may make .
Or it could be that he still does n't think he has done anything wrong .
Either way , though his visit to the Livestrong cancer charity in Austin , Texas , yesterday was billed by many as Armstrong 's first PR steps towards an admission of guilt for doping offences , it was actually a classic of the art of non - apology . ""
He had a private conversation with the staff , who have done the important work of the foundation for many years , "" Livestrong Foundation spokeswoman Katherine McLane was quoted as saying by Reuters .
"" It was a very sincere and heartfelt expression of regret over any stress that they 've suffered over the course of the last few years as a result of the media attention . ""
The first thing to note is that Armstrong was apologising for something that came very low down on anybody 's list of the things people working for his charity might want an apology for , such as lying bare - faced to everyone for the past 10 years or so , or putting his cancer charity in an impossible position of having to defend him regardless for the same amount of time .
Those are the sort of things the Livestrong team might have hoped Armstrong would address .
To apologise for "" the stress he 's caused ... "" ?
It 's a bit like a doctor apologising at length for having kept you waiting unnecessarily for half an hour , when you 've come in to discuss why she failed to diagnose your fatal condition several years previously .
Just as important is the absence of the word sorry .
Armstrong expressed regret , not sorrow .
Politicians and celebs only say "" sorry "" in absolute extremis .
Tony Blair has never said sorry for anything .
Rather he too has expressed regret and â€ “ on occasion â€ “ apologised for having had to take some very difficult decisions .
Partly this is a legal matter ; if Blair did say sorry for his failures during the war in Iraq , he might just find there were a bunch of lawyers ready to indict him for alleged war crimes .
But it 's also semantically important .
The word "" sorry "" â€ “ even if said insincerely â€ “ carries a sense of personal responsibility .
The word "" apologise "" is much more ambivalent , as it suggests the possibility of some confusion over culpability .
As for "" regret "" ... well that 's something even more arm 's length .
Still , Armstrong 's non - apology is still a long way off being the greatest non - apology of recent years .
For that , one has to turn to Diego Maradona 's explanation of his handball goal against England in the 1986 World Cup .
Confronted with the video evidence , Maradona did n't back down at all .
Instead , he celebrated it as an example of divine intervention .
The Hand of God .
This surely is Armstrong 's way forward .
No mealy - mouthed
, "" I might have done it a little bit "" teary - eyed confessions on Oprah .
Bring on the triumphant "" syringe of God "" ."
2013-01-15,"Lance Armstrong is reportedly ready to testify against several people within the world of cycling who helped cover up his doping past after finally confessing to using performance enhancing drugs , it has been claimed .
According to the New York Times , in his interview with Oprah Winfrey â€ “ which was recorded on Monday and will be broadcast on Friday morning ( GMT ) â€ “ the disgraced cyclist has confessed that he took performance - enhancing drugs throughout his career .
However , the extent of Armstrong 's confession remains unclear .
Admitting to a doping past is Armstrong 's first step towards lessening his lifetime ban from cycling .
It is also the first step towards testifying against anyone in the world of cycling who may have known about the extent of his doping and perhaps allowed it to continue unchecked .
The disgraced American , who won the Tour de France seven times only to be stripped of the titles , is also said to be in talks with the US department of justice to testify in the whistle - blower case brought by his former team - mate , Floyd Landis .
It would involve the cycling team sponsored by the US Postal Service and would see Armstrong testify against several of the team 's owners as well as other officials .
On Monday , it was reported that Armstrong apologised to the staff of his Livestrong cancer foundation and said "" I 'm sorry "" , an unnamed source told Associated Press .
The sports governing body , the UCI , today released a statement saying Armstrong should testify to the independent commission it set up to look into its handling of the Armstrong affair .
Its statement read : "" The UCI will not be making any further comments on matters concerning Lance Armstrong until it has had the opportunity to view his much publicised interview with Oprah Winfrey .
The UCI notes the media speculation surrounding the interview and reports that he has finally come clean and admitted doping during his cycling career .
"" If these reports are true , we would strongly urge Lance Armstrong to testify to the Independent Commission established to investigate the allegations made against the UCI in the recent USADA reasoned decision on Lance Armstrong and the United States Postal Service ( USPS ) team . """
2013-01-15,"It is now absolutely clear that Lance Armstrong will make some form of admission in Thursday 's interview with Oprah Winfrey to the dope - cheating that the Usada report called "" the great heist sport has ever seen "" .
The public relations strategy of drip - by - drip leaking has been expertly executed .
First , there was the New York Times ' scoop about Armstrong 's contacts with Usada to reduce his lifetime ban ( disclosure : my sceptical response has proven 100 % wrong ) .
Then , we learned about the Oprah appearance , and it became ever harder to imagine what they would have to talk about for 90 minutes if Armstrong continued his career - long practice of stonewalling doping accusations and destroying those who spoke the truth .
On Monday , the day his Oprah show was being recorded , Armstrong met with staff at the cancer charity he founded but recently resigned from , and rendered a tearful , "" choked up "" apology to his former Livestrong colleagues .
And finally , we learn via CBS that Armstrong may even be willing to testify himself against fellow cyclists on doping charges .
In short , this now looks like a carefully choreographed , slow - release PR plan â€ “ likely managed by Armstrong 's long - time agent Bill Stapleton â€ “ to perform a 180-degree turn on all previously held positions : belligerent denial , self - righteous indignation and bullying belittling of accusers .
Instead , we have Lance Armstrong the penitent sinner : the weepy , choked - up prodigal son , who is finally coming clean and seeks redemption .
As is well - established , an audience with Oprah achieves that almost instantaneously : I can see her right now , reaching out and taking his hand as he shakes with emotion and talks about the pain of living the false life we all made him lead .
And from redemption to rehabilitation .
Armstrong will leverage his confession to the maximum to get his lifetime ban reduced , to four years , perhaps less .
He 'll be back before we know it : a slightly grizzled and more wrinkled version of himself , glad - handing and fist - bumping on the triathlon circuit , getting back to fundraising for the Livestrong Foundation , making faux - humble speeches for fat fees on the after - dinner circuit , mopping up some handy corporate sponsorships , reconnecting with his Washington power - broker contacts , and â€ “ older and wiser
â€ “ maybe even running for office himself , as was once mooted .
But this only stacks up because , for the second half of his life , Armstrong needs not to be permanently exiled from American public life : to be a viable celebrity brand is all his future .
The costs are significant : he will almost certainly have to settle with SCA Promotions , but they will probably take a lot less than the $ 11 m that headlines their suit .
The Sunday Times wants to recover $ 500,000 in damages , plus another $ 1 m in costs ; but they 'll take less .
But here 's the thing : Armstrong 's net worth is estimated to exceed $ 100 m .
These sums sting , but they do n't really hurt him .
And next to his post - rehabilitation earnings potential , they 're chump change .
The only remaining obstacle is Floyd Landis ' "" whistleblower suit "" under the False Claims Act .
Also called a "" qui tam "" suit , most such civil legal actions fail â€ “ unless the US justice department chooses to join as a co - plaintiff , in which case the chances of success multiply dramatically .
Landis ' suit alleges that Lance Armstrong , in effect , defrauded US taxpayers who were , via the US Postal Service , the title sponsor of Armstrong 's Tour de France - winning cycling teams from 1999 - 2003 .
That sponsorship was worth , reportedly , about $ 10 m per year , making $ 50 m in total .
If Armstrong was choking up and sobbing at his Livestrong Foundation encounter , it was far more likely because he had received word that senior officials in the justice department had recommended that the federal government join Landis ' lawsuit , than for any show of true contrition .
It must be a rattling prospect , even for Armstrong , that the US government would be coming after him , along with Landis , for potentially tens of millions of dollars â€ “ which , all the pre - publicity tells us to expect , Armstrong will confess he took under false pretences when he won by cheating .
As this latest turn in the Armstrong saga demonstrates , the disgraced cyclist is nothing if not well - advised : the combination of off - the - record briefing ( Mark Fabiani , Bill Stapleton ? ) and official denial ( attorney Tim Herman ) was text - book stuff .
No doubt , they have done their sums , too .
So if Armstrong has already opened negotiations with Travis Tygart at Usada to get his ban reduced , then it 's likely , as CBS reports , that there have been talks with the justice department about a deal to settle the qui tam suit .
The question of why the US justice department is piggybacking on Landis ' suit now , when a US attorney in California inexplicably nixed a prosecution based on the federal grand jury investigation into precisely the same charges of fraud is now mainly of academic interest .
In his book , The Secret Ride , Tyler Hamilton hinted strongly that Armstrong 's political connections pulled strings .
We do know that Armstrong lied repeatedly , even under oath , but thanks to the statute of limitations in one case ( the suit against SCA in a 2005 lawsuit ) , and a wayward federal attorney in another , Armstrong has dodged a felony rap .
A criminal conviction , no ; but civil damages he can afford .
Armstrong will have done his math , and worked out where the percentage lies : it 's with confession .
The benefits outweigh the costs : he 'll earn that rehabilitation , but he will come out ahead .
The irony of this day is that it also saw the retirement of the greatest female cyclist of her generation : former world and Olympic champion Nicole Cooke .
In her statement , of great dignity but justified anger , she directly pointed to the damage Lance Armstrong 's dope - cheating did to her career , and to the entire women 's sport , by killing its sponsorship .
Please read it in full ; it is a historic document .
But this line says everything we need to hear about Lance Armstrong 's confession : I ca n't help thinking that the cheats win on the way up and the way down ."
2013-01-15,"After years of furious denials and a policy of omertÃ that kept the lid on a sophisticated cheating conspiracy for more than a decade , Lance Armstrong has finally admitted his doping past in a televised interview with Oprah Winfrey , according to the US presenter .
The cyclist , stripped of seven Tour de France titles after a United States Anti - Doping Agency ( Usada ) report placed him at the heart of the "" most sophisticated , professional and successful doping programme sport has ever seen "" , apparently disarmed Winfrey with his candour and his willingness to confess . ""
He did not come clean in the manner I expected .
I was surprised , "" Winfrey told CBS after she had recorded the two - and - a - half - hour interview and flown from Austin , Texas to Chicago with the tapes in her bag alongside her "" dog food and dog leashes "" .
The interview could have severe consequences for cycling as a world sport .
Dick Pound , the former head of the World Anti - Doping Agency ( Wada ) and an International Olympic Committee member , warned on Tuesday night that if Armstrong implicated cycling 's global governing body , the UCI , in covering up widespread doping , then the sport could be removed from the Olympic programme .
"" We could say : ' Look , you 've clearly got a problem why do n't we give you four , eight years to sort it out , ' "" said Pound . ""
And when you think you 're ready to come back we 'll see whether it would be a good idea to put you back on the programme .
"" There had been speculation that Winfrey , who has known Armstrong for a long time and interviewed him several times , would give the Texan an easy ride .
But she said she had been fully prepared and had drawn up 112 questions , having carefully read Usada 's 202-page judgment and the books of the Sunday Times journalist David Walsh , who has pursued Armstrong for more than a decade .
"" There were a couple of times when he was emotional but emotional does n't begin to describe the intensity or difficulty he experienced in talking about some of these things , "" said Winfrey , for whom the interview is a coup as she tries to establish her Oprah Winfrey Network channel .
"" For myself , my team , we were mesmerised and riveted by some of his answers , "" said Winfrey , who conducted the interview in a sparse hotel room after the intended location at Armstrong 's house was besieged by news crews .
She said it was "" certainly the biggest interview I 've ever done in terms of its exposure "" .
The presenter , who claimed the material was so good that it would now be broadcast in the US over two days rather than one , starting on Thursday night , said Armstrong was also well prepared .
"" Most of the important questions that many people around the world wanted to hear were answered .
I was satisfied with the answers , "" she said .
"" I thought he was thoughtful , he was serious .
He had certainly prepared himself for this moment .
He met the moment .
At the end of this , we were both pretty exhausted . ""
Winfrey spoke as more details emerged of Armstrong 's strategy to mitigate the fallout from a lifetime ban that has excluded him not only from cycling but from all sport worldwide .
Usada 's chief executive , Travis Tygart , told the Guardian last month that one of his greatest regrets was that Armstrong did not come clean when he had the chance , while its investigation was under way .
Instead , he refused to co - operate and his lawyers attacked Usada .
The Wall Street Journal reported that he met Tygart in December to explore whether his ban could be reduced if he testified against others , allowing him to compete in elite triathlon events .
But , according to the paper , the meeting ended with a frustrated Armstrong firing an expletive at Tygart and storming off .
He later met Winfrey in Hawaii , where they both have houses , over the Christmas holidays to finalise the terms of their interview .
Wada , which ratified Usada 's decision to ban Armstrong for life and strip him of all his titles , said on Tuesday that unless Armstrong made a full confession under oath and told the anti - doping authorities all he knew there would be no chance of his ban being reduced . ""
While Wada encourages all athletes to come clean about any doping activities they have been involved with or know about , these details must be passed on to the relevant anti - doping authorities , "" said its director general , David Howman .
"" Only when Mr Armstrong makes a full confession under oath â€ “ and tells the anti - doping authorities all he knows about doping activities â€ “ can any legal and proper process for him to seek any reopening or reconsideration of his lifetime ban commence . ""
Wada , which has longstanding concerns about the way the UCI has handled the issue , said on Tuesday night that it would play no further part in the cycling body 's independent inquiry into the issues raised by the case , due to concerns over the remit , timeframe and terms of reference . ""
In particular Wada is concerned that the scope of the inquiry is too focused on sanctioned former cyclist Lance Armstrong â€ “ especially as his case is closed and completed with there being no appeal â€ “ and will therefore not fully address such a widespread and ingrained problem , "" it said in a statement , adding that the June deadline to complete the review was "" wholly insufficient "" .
Usada chief executive Travis Tygart told the Guardian last month that he also had serious concerns about the terms of reference of the independent panel , which were drawn up by the UCI .
Since Usada published its "" reasoned decision "" in October , ratified some weeks later by the UCI , Armstrong has been deserted by a succession of high - profile supporters and sponsors , including Nike , and lost millions of pounds ' worth of endorsements .
He has also stepped down from his position as chairman of Livestrong , the charity he established to help fellow sufferers after overcoming testicular cancer .
He apologised personally this week to staff .
Attention is now likely to turn to whether Armstrong will implicate anyone else .
Most of the cyclists involved have already confessed to doping and testified against him , but unanswered questions remain around the role of the UCI .
It has admitted accepting $ 125,000 ( Â£78,000 ) in donations from Armstrong but hasstrenuously denied"
2013-01-15,"It would be nice to think that Armando Iannucci and Peter Capaldi are watching this week 's intense build - up to Lance Armstrong 's "" tell - all - I - want - to "" interview with Oprah Winfrey with wry smiles on their faces .
As they did during his racing career , the disgraced former Tour de France star and those around him are adopting tactics which could have come straight out of the Malcolm Tucker textbook to salvage what they can from the wreckage .
We 've endured the denials , amid the diversionary bluster about being the "" most tested athlete on the planet "" and about being the victim of a witch - hunt , and we 've seen the bullying .
Next up , we are apparently going to encounter the most surreal twist of all ,
Armstrong the whistleblower : "" planning to testify against several powerful people in the sport of cycling who knew about his doping and possibly facilitated it "" , reports said .
If the former great man goes down , he will take some other big men with him , so it seems .
The irony of the prospect of Armstrong turning States Evidence on others , with accusations of skullduggery , will be lost on no one who has watched his progress over the years .
This is the man , after all , who spent eight years intimidating and vilifying those who spoke out against him : Emma O'Reilly , Greg and Kathy LeMond , Frankie and Betsy Andreu , Filippo Simeoni , Floyd Landis , Tyler Hamilton .
He did n't like whistleblowers .
Indeed , he devoted much time and energy to attempts to shut them up .
The sight of Armstrong bursting out of the peloton to retrieve Simeoni , when he attempted to break away in the 2004 Tour de France , to make sure there was no chance he could win a stage , was one of the defining images of the man for me , one of the rare moments when the carapace cracked a little and you could glimpse the unpleasantness inside .
Ultimately , it was a whistleblower , Landis , who made the key revelations that opened the floodgates .
So now , floating the prospect of Plucky Ol' Lance the whistleblower spilling the beans about the guys who may variously have not minded him doping , profited from him doping , let him dope to his heart 's content , is a tactic worthy of the spinmeister dark angel Tucker .
It may happen , but it does n't have to happen .
The idea that Lance may have been a victim of a kind will be out there in people 's minds .
And hell , he ca n't be all bad if he wants to reveal who the bad guys really were , can he ?
Lest we forget , Armstrong is a past master at putting stories out into the ether that muddy the waters , create an impression , but then do n't materialise â€ “ the "" possible Hour Record attempt "" , which was "" revealed "" to Gazzetta dello Sport in 2001 to spike the Sunday Times story that he was trained by Michele Ferrari ;
the independent testing by a leading expert that was supposed to accompany his comeback in 2009 then eventually dropped .
Floating the notion of "" Armstrong the whistleblower "" achieves precisely what the other stories did : it keeps the momentum of events with Armstrong and keeps the media working to his agenda .
Most critically , it contributes to a fog of detail and speculation that hides the key fact revealed by Usada 's Reasoned Decision : this guy was at the top of the biggest fraud in sporting history .
This guy doped persistently to win the biggest event in cycling .
There are questions out there involving Lance and some big names within sport , men and companies who variously run or finance bits of cycling .
The reasons for the $ 125,000 dollar donation he made to the sport 's governing body , in two tranches at different times between 2001 and 2004 , has never been adequately explained .
There is the claim and counter - claim over the mysterious "" positive or possibly not "" test at the Tour of Switzerland from 2001 , and the claim made by the Usada head , Travis Tygart , that Armstrong was "" given the keys "" to the test for the blood booster erythropoietin , denied recently by the lab involved .
Clarity on these areas would be an interesting prospect and might help to clear up the mess that Armstrong and his cohorts have left cycling in .
If they led to a resignation or two , that might be of benefit .
But the notion that Armstrong might point the finger at bigger fish for the good of the sport is not to be entertained .
This is the man who refused to cooperate with Usada as it investigated the doping allegations against him and described their inquiry as a "" vendetta "" .
He could have given them the complete story , but that would have meant following their agenda .
Few of those who have been unmasked in the series of doping scandals that have scarred professional cycling in the last 14 years have emerged with any credit , from Richard Virenque claiming that he was doping "" without his knowledge but by his own free will "" , via Raimondas Rumsas 's story that the drugs in his wife 's car were for his mother - in - law , to Hamilton 's claims of a "" false twin "" in his blood .
Armstrong should be seen in the same light .
He was the one who took the decision to dope .
He knew what it meant and he knew what the implications were .
Any "" revelations "" will be in the same spirit that any "" confession "" may have been made to Oprah Winfrey : not to advance the cause of clean cycling but to save the skin of Lance Armstrong ."
2013-01-15,
2013-01-15,"Lance Armstrong 's decision to appear on Oprah Winfrey 's OWN network on Thursday and confess that he used performance - enhancing drugs during his cycling career has precipitated a cascade of potential legal consequences .
Winfrey has confirmed , ahead of this week 's two - part broadcast of her encounter with Armstrong , that the disgraced former racer has made some admission of the doping offences that saw the US Anti - Doping Agency ( Usada ) strip him of his titles in October .
With several lawsuits outstanding against him , Armstrong is reported to be in negotiations with the US Justice Department about possibly testifying against former confederates in what the Usada report called the "" most sophisticated doping programme sport has ever seen "" .
Justice Department officials have recommended that the federal government join the "" whistleblower "" lawsuit launched by Armstrong 's former team - mate Floyd Landis .
This "" qui tam "" suit alleges that Armstrong and his associates effectively defrauded US taxpayers by dope - cheating while sponsored by the US Postal Service ( to the tune of at least $ 30 m over five years , and possibly as much as $ 50 m ) .
The New York Times reports that Armstrong is not only attempting to negotiate a settlement to return a portion of those millions , but may also give testimony for the plaintiffs in the whistleblower lawsuit .
Because Tailwind Sports was the company formed to manage the USPS team , several of Armstrong 's most loyal and long - time supporters could be drawn into the case .
According to Bloomberg Business Week , investment banker Thomas Weisel has already been subpoenaed .
Other former directors of Tailwind include Armstrong 's agent , Bill Stapleton , and his business partner , Bart Knaggs , both of whom also occupy key positions at Livestrong , the cancer charity Armstrong founded after being declared cancer - free in 1997 .
Stapleton remains the linchpin of Armstrong 's inner circle , and he and Knaggs would be key to Armstrong 's ability , after an Oprah - led rehabilitation , to return to a more active role at the Livestrong Foundation .
As well as his negotiations with authorities over the tam qui suit , Armstrong is also reported to be willing to testify to Usada against officials of the UCI , cycling 's governing body .
In return for his co - operation , Usada would use its discretion to reduce his lifetime ban from Olympic competition .
So , with Armstrong poised to confess and the Department of Justice expected to be a player in the "" whistleblower "" lawsuit , who among his associates and former confederates are most likely to be affected by the fallout ?
Here is the shortlist : Hein Verbruggen and Pat McQuaid Dutch sports administrator Verbruggen , pictured , was president of the International Cycling Union ( UCI ) from 1991 until 2005 â€ “ a period that coincided with pro cycling 's worst problems with EPO and blood - doping , and all the other illicit performance - enhancing techniques described in detail by Floyd Landis , Tyler Hamilton and in the Usada report .
After his retirement , Verbruggen remained honorary president , even as he was succeeded in the top job by Pat McQuaid .
Verbruggen is also an honorary member of the International Olympic Committee .
While Pat McQuaid initially made advances in anti - doping after he took over direction of the UCI â€ “ under his tenure , the "" biological passport "" was introduced â€ “ he has since chosen a path of loyalty to Verbruggen and the ancien rÃ
© gime at the UCI .
Tensions ran high during Usada 's report on the Armstrong scandal : Usada chief executive Travis Tygart publicly criticised the UCI for its lack of co - operation with his investigation , and for failing to tackle the problem of doping in the sport .
Usada 's report repeated the allegations of Landis and Hamilton : that Armstrong had admitted to each of them that he had failed an EPO test during the Tour de Suisse in 2001 .
In their versions , Armstrong told them that Verbruggen had helped hush up the problem and helped arrange a meeting between Armstrong , Bruyneel and the laboratory director , Martial Saugy , to explain the test .
Saugy confirms that a meeting took place , but denies that he told Armstrong and Bruyneel how to cheat the test .
Verbruggen and McQuaid , pictured , strenuously deny that the UCI was involved in any cover - up .
Armstrong later made two donations , totalling about $ 200,000 , to the UCI for anti - doping purposes .
Verbruggen and McQuaid deny that there was any connection between the 2001 "" suspicious test "" reported by Usada and Armstrong 's giving .
Whether Armstrong has a different story to tell now must be pricking Travis Tygart 's curiosity .
The UCI is conducting its own inquiry , by an independent panel , into the body 's conduct over the Armstrong era â€ “ and specifically into these allegations of corruption .
That commission could be trumped if any UCI officials were to be incriminated by Armstrong in witness statements to Usada â€ “ with potentially seismic consequences for the governance of the sport .
Johan Bruyneel A former cycling professional himself , Bruyneel , pictured , managed all of Armstrong 's Tour - winning teams â€ “ making him the most successful directeur sportif in cycling history .
Bruyneel was also a director of Tailwind Sports , but the most immediate problem he faces is a lifetime ban from the sport for his role in the USPS and Discovery Channel teams ' systematic doping uncovered in Usada 's "" Reasoned Decision "" .
Unlike Armstrong , Bruyneel has opted to contest Usada 's decision , but his case has not yet been heard before a court of arbitration for sport .
It is difficult to see how Armstrong 's confession will help Bruyneel 's case , or how he will beat the ban .
Thomas Weisel A former speedskater and cycling enthusiast , Weisel , an investment banker who made hundreds of millions of dollars during the dotcom boom , is Armstrong 's biggest and oldest financial backer .
Described in Tyler Hamilton 's book , The Secret Race , as a bullish go - getter ( "" Just get it fucking done ! "" ) , Weisel has been deeply involved in professional cycling since the early 1990s .
In 2000 , he even organized a bailout of the then financially distressed American governing body , USA Cycling , which enabled him to get his own people on the board , including CEO Steve Johnson , also a long - time cheerleader for Lance Armstrong .
It was Weisel who was the key backer of Tailwind Sports , the company formed to manage the US Postal team , which Armstrong joined in 1998 .
Stapleton and Knaggs were also directors , as was Armstrong 's directeur sportif for all his Tour de France "" victories "" , Johan Bruyneel .
As owner of the USPS squad for the first five of Armstrong 's wins ( 1999 - 2003 ) , the directors of Tailwind Sports are clearly at risk of being dragged in to the whistleblower suit now joined by the Justice Department .
Court papers opened in Washington last month reveal that the San Francisco financier has been served with a subpoena by federal investigators pursuing possible fraud claims against Armstrong .
Weisel has made no comment to the media about reports of doping on the USPS team ."
2013-01-15,"As soon as Lance Armstrong announced that he would be going on Oprah to talk about his fall from grace , we began to ponder .
We imagined the questions Oprah Winfrey probably asked -- the Guardian 's Barney Ronay gave his not - so - tongue - in - cheek guesses here -- and what she should 've asked .
Though we caught glimpses of forgiveness on Twitter from people willing to overlook Armstrong 's doping because of his charity work , the overarching belief seems to be that Armstrong got what he deserved .
Below , we 've grouped what we think are the four main themes being explored about Armstrong ahead of his chat with Oprah , which airs on Thursday .
Yes , that big chat with Oprah Among the most - read stories by Guardian readers Tuesday morning was Oprah Winfrey 's debriefing of her chat with Armstrong .
Here 's a snippet of what she had to say to CBS
This Morning : A couple times he was emotional but emotional does n't begin to describe the intensity and the difficulty he had talking about these issues .
Also check out Matt Seaton 's piece on Armstrong 's apparent cost - benefit analysis of confession .
Does his charity work endear him at all ?
This piece by John Crace examines Armstrong 's address to his Livestrong charity staff .
Whether or not Armstrong uttered the word "" sorry , "" Crase writes that he now takes his place among a pantheon of infamous non - apologists , including Diego Maradona .
The word "" sorry "" â€ “ even if said insincerely â€ “ carries a sense of personal responsibility .
The word "" apologise "" is much more ambivalent , as it suggests the possibility of some confusion over culpability .
As for "" regret "" ... well that 's something even more arm 's length .
Outside magazine has published this long read examining what , exactly , the millions of Livestrong dollars funded during Armstrong 's reign .
How did it take Armstrong so long to get caught ?
CNN 's John Sinnott and Tom McGowan published this long read on Armstrong 's legacy , focusing on the long - held suspicions the cycling industry had of Armstrong , even as he won Tour de France titles and raised nearly $ 500 million through his cancer charity Livestrong : Armstrong is expected to face up to the extraordinary body of evidence the United States Anti - Doping Agency put together before releasing more than 1,000 pages of evidence in October 2012 .
A positive test for a banned substance during his first Tour de France win in 1999 was explained away by a prescription for a cream to treat saddle sores , but the doubts and rumors surrounding Armstrong refused to go away .
What did he do that was worse than doping ?
Forbes writer Patrick Rishe says Armstrong 's bullying of team members was worse than the act of doping itself : I do n't begrudge Mr. Armstrong the millions he earned in a sport where most of his competitors were also getting a synthetic enhancement to their performance .
I do , however , agree with Mr. Wetzel that he owes considerably more apologies to the people he tried to intimidate and bully while trying to maintain his lucrative sponsorships and his perch atop the cycling world .
Michael Wolff , for his part , thinks the real crime was media manipulation : Armstrong has been meticulously investigated , found guilty , and stripped of all his awards , standing , and reputation .
He 's now pretty much the last word in steroids .
And , to boot , we 've discovered that he really is n't very nice : he 's sports ' nastiest guy .
But he is taping with Oprah for a much anticipated show on which he will admit that he 's a doper .
And everybody , at least everybody in the media , is on the edge of their seats .

2013-01-16,"However queasy the prospect of Lance Armstrong "" coming clean "" under the Oprah Winfrey spotlight on Thursday night tonight may make you feel , one thing can not be denied .
The entire circus , with its elegantly choreographed week - long build - up , is in keeping with the rest of the Texan 's cycling career .
Having taken cycling on to the celebrity circuit , produced the biggest sporting comeback
ever â€ “ based on deception though it was â€ “ and brought a whole new economic and charitable dimension to the sport
, all the while being at the head of what the US Anti - Doping Agency described as the biggest sporting heist ever , Armstrong is now behind the most hyped up episode of media theatre cycling has ever witnessed .
The prospect of Armstrong 's "" confession "" on Oprah has its own logic to it within the context of a career in which he earned celebrity status and milked it for all it was worth .
This is , after all , the cyclist who brought Hollywood stars such as Jake Gyllenhal and Robin Williams to the Tour de France .
He is the man who introduced bodyguards and spin doctors to European cycling , whose romance with Sheryl Crow kept the French press on tenterhooks , and who developed elaborate charades to avoid crushes of press and fans at race starts and finishes .
When he was merely a seven - times Tour winner , his press conferences were major occasions .
It 's perfectly logical that now he has been exposed as a lying , cheating , bullying , disgraced and disqualified seven - times Tour de France winner , we have to live through a week of intense hype and leaks followed by a two - part interview that presumably will attract an audience of epic if not record - breaking proportions .
As with so much that Armstrong did in the two decades he 's been in cycling , this is way beyond the normal bounds of the sport .
Cycling has had plenty of drug scandals but even when they do n't disappear into the morass of the European justice system , they tend to be messy affairs , with a sordid side to them :
Tom Simpson keeling over on a mountainside in southern France and unleashing 40 years of speculation and recrimination ; Festina 's cyclists being body - searched in grubby French police cells and placed under interrogation a little more aggressive than that of Oprah ; Marco Pantani lying dead and half - naked in an apartment hotel in an out - of - season Italian coastal resort ; Tyler Hamilton gazing into a toilet bowl , terrified at the colour of his urine after a bungled blood transfusion .
They do n't play out their final act in front of chat show queens .
Back in the 1990s there were mutterings from conservative European followers of cycling that the Tour de France 's dominance of the sport , the race 's metamorphosis into a televisual soap - opera rather than a bike race , would lead to something the French in particular decried as sport - spectacle .
The fear was that the race , and with it the upper end of the sport , would end up consuming itself in a mix of celebrity and money .
Once industrial doping appeared , the cocktail became all the more toxic so the thinking went .
And as sport - spectacle goes , you ca n't go much further than the biggest celebrity the sport has produced "" confessing "" to industrial doping â€ “ however ambiguously or platitudinously
â€ “ to the most famous celebrity interviewer of them all .
There is plenty of gruesome stuff in the lengthy details of the Usada Reasoned Decision on the US Postal Service scandal .
It is fair to wonder how much of it will be put out there on Thursday night .
Maybe Oprah will ask Lance about "" Motoman "" on the 1999 Tour , the syringes of EPO that were put into empty Coke cans , passed to a soigneur through the camper window and carried to a bin through the adoring crowds .
Maybe she will ask about his treatment of the whistleblowers , or how he felt when he recorded the Nike ad in which he told the world the only thing he was "" on "" was his bike .
Not to mention the way that David Zabriskie was cajoled into doping for US Postal when he had come into cycling precisely to escape drugs .
There is no shortage of material .
Is redemption possible on the Oprah sofa ?
Perhaps , if what she elicited from Armstrong earlier this week is a complete , unconditional acceptance of the contents of the Usada report together with full apologies to those who were on the receiving end of his campaign to keep his reputation and earnings unscathed and to the cancer victims who believed in the myth .
Not to mention an explanation of why he lied so persistently for so long .
( We can imagine why , but it would be good to hear it from the horse 's mouth nonetheless ) .
The problem for Armstrong is a legal inferno that way lies : perjury charges , Floyd Landis 's whistleblowing suit , and so on .
A full confession , and he reaps the whirlwind .
Follow that logic , and the best option , for him , is an interview from which the message emerges that the context of the time left him with no option but to dope ( it did n't ) , in which the men who ran the sport condoned doping ( very debatable ) and he is the victim â€ “ that the witch - hunt has been terribly hard on him , his family , and all those cancer sufferers who believed in him but even so he 's sorry , in a general way .
Will it work ?
Who knows .
The legal notices may still end up dropping through the letter box , but this is a throw of the dice that 's worth making .
As my colleague Matt Seaton wrote recently , all Armstrong has left to market is his celebrity status .
Thursday night is the big sell ."
2013-01-16,"With the sort of killer timing that made her both World and Olympic champion , Nicole Cooke bowed out of professional cycling with a well - timed attack on the industry cheat who is about to try and relaunch himself on TV .
But while her comments on Lance Armstrong and drugs are to be welcomed , I hope that her brave and brutal portrayal of sexism in cycling will have an even bigger impact .
In a retirement speech , the 29-year - old talks about what she hopes will be the "" legacy "" of her career . ""
At the age of 12 one is unaware of the problems ahead .
One expects there to be an infrastructure for both boys and girls to develop and demonstrate their talents ; to nurture them .
One does not expect that nothing is available if you are a girl or that worse still , girls will be specifically excluded , not allowed to compete . ""
Having had many bitter experiences as well as successful ones , Cooke offers a glimpse of what girls and women have to endure to perform at the top levels of sports in this country .
Her colleagues Victoria Pendleton and Emma Pooley have also pointed out the injustice but Cooke is prepared to name names and demand action too .
Like nearly all women 's sports in the UK , cycling suffers from a chicken - and - egg situation : a relative lack of prestige results in a lack of media coverage , sponsorship or support .
The Commission on the Future of Women 's sport revealed that 0.5 % of sponsorship in this country went to elite women 's sports in an 18-month period of 2010 - 11 compared with 61 % for men .
But what Cooke has done is provide inside knowledge of how these overall figures hide deeper injustices in the way women are treated .
Among the shocking things she discusses is that the sport 's governing body , the UCI Road Commission , has stated that a minimum wage is required for all male professionals , but not women .
How on earth are they allowed to get away with such blatant discrimination ?
What 's more , Cooke 's comments come just as the bad behaviour of Armstrong and his chums looks set to make things even worse for those left cycling . ""
Every scandal on the men 's side has caused sponsors to leave on the women 's side , "" she said .
"" And with such thin budgets , the losses have a greater relative impact on what survives . ""
So with no female Team Sky our homegrown talent will , like Cooke , have to go abroad for training .
Cycling has enjoyed great success since last summer 's Olympics .
It is a sport with one of the lowest barriers to entry and , as such , could form one of the best ways to tackle the appalling fact that only 12 % of teenage girls do enough physical activity to benefit their health .
Her medal - winning days may be over , but Cooke deserves another one for turning the spotlight on the injustice and inequality in a way that should make a difference to us all ."
2013-01-17,"Lance Armstrong was n't the only sportsman , or the only hero , to make headlines this week for telling lies .
Manti Te'o is one of America 's most celebrated college footballers ( that is football as in rugby played by storm troopers ) .
In the US , college players are stars in their own right , and Te'o was valorised for being an inspiring leader on the field , and a devout young man off it .
He had an irresistibly compelling personal story , endlessly repeated in media profiles .
Te'o plays for Notre Dame , from Indiana , a team which , when he joined them , had their best days behind them .
This season , he led Notre Dame back to their place among the sport 's elite .
He did so while bearing a terrible personal burden .
His aged grandmother had been very ill and his girlfriend , Lennay Kekua , had been in a car crash and then developed leukemia .
Te'o had been nursing her from afar while she lay on a hospital bed in California ; in every spare moment , he would talk to her on the phone .
One day last September , Te'o received news of a double tragedy : his grandmother and his girlfriend passed away within six hours of each other .
Rather than collapsing with grief , Te'o led his team out on to the football field , to win a famous victory .
It is a heartbreaking and uplifting tale .
It is also a lie .
This week , news broke that Lennay Kekua does not exist , at least not in the form Te'o described her .
There is no record of a Lennay Kekua being in a car accident , or having leukemia , or dying .
Te'o 's fall from grace has been instant and shocking .
At least with Armstrong , Americans have had time to adjust their perceptions of a man once universally regarded as a paragon .
Many are still in the process of doing so .
A defence of Armstrong still commonly heard is that they were all doing it .
Cyclists during Armstrong 's prime were routinely breaking the rules .
It was n't one or two individuals ; it was a whole subculture .
Armstrong took illegal substances only in order to compete on the same track as everyone else .
This is fiction too .
Armstrong was n't regretfully injecting himself with a few banned substances to keep up with unscrupulous foreigners .
He was the prime mover of cycling 's love affair with illegal drugs .
Armstrong was the Steve Jobs of doping , obsessed with finding innovative ways to take performance - boosting drugs and fool the drug - testers â€ “ a pioneer who pushed the boundaries of what was technically possible , an authority figure who encouraged and in fact demanded that teammates follow his example .
But that is n't the worst of it .
The worst of it is that Armstrong built a monumental edifice of lies on top of his original sin .
He repeatedly expressed outrage at any accusation that he had violated rules , and poured vitriol over his accusers .
He made $ 30 m a year from businesses that wanted to be associated with the noblest of human qualities .
He made a commercial for Nike , his major sponsor , in which he explicitly rebutted accusations of drug - taking .
He built a charity foundation that raised money for cancer research by burnishing the legend of a man who had overcome life - threatening illness and seized the heights of sporting achievement purely through the exercise of his indomitable will .
Armstrong was n't just a man , he was a myth .
Actually , perhaps myth is putting it too highly
â€ “
it implies a grandeur he never quite achieved , even when his reputation was at its peak .
What 's certainly true is that Armstrong was a brand , and an exceptionally powerful one .
A brand , in today 's world , is more than a name for a product .
It 's a set of values , and an idea to which people aspire .
Armstrong turned his life into a story , with the enthusiastic collusion of the media and their advertisers â€ “ and the story was his brand .
We are still waiting to get to the bottom of Te'o 's case , and it is unclear whether the lie was his or he was himself the victim of a cruel hoax ; Te'o is claiming it was the latter .
Either way , the fact he felt the need to retail this story so intensively , and that the reporters who repeated it felt no duty to check its veracity , tells us something about the pressures on modern sports stars to be much more than sportspeople .
These days , they must also be brands : ideas for people to live by , stories by which to sell products .
In this respect , if no other , Lance Armstrong 's legacy remains intact ."
2013-01-17,"Ahead of his "" no - holds barred "" interview with Oprah Winfrey in which he is expected to admit to doping for the first time , Lance Armstrong has been told to hand back the bronze medal he won at the 2000 Sydney Olympics .
It is understood that the International Olympic Committee wrote to the disgraced former cyclist on Wednesday to inform him he had been stripped of the medal , which the Texan won in the time trial .
Sources told the Guardian that the decision was taken in principle at December 's executive board meeting but that the IOC was waiting for confirmation from global governing body , the UCI , that he had not appealed against Usada 's decision to strip him of his seven Tour de France titles and ban him from sport for life .
The 21 days in which he could have appealed have now elapsed and the US Olympic Committee was also informed of the decision last night .
"" Following the recent decisions of Usada and the UCI regarding the competitive cycling results of Lance Armstrong , the IOC has disqualified Armstrong from the events in which he competed at the Sydney 2000 Olympic Games , "" the IOC said in a statement . ""
Namely , the men 's individual road race , where he finished 13th , and the men 's individual time trial , where he finished 3rd and was awarded with a bronze medal and a certificate . ""
Tyler Hamilton , one of the 11 former team - mates who testified against Armstrong , handed back the time - trial gold medal that he won at the 2004 Athens Olympics in early 2011 , after he confessed to doping ."

2013-01-17,"The wall and gates of Lance Armstrong 's home in north - west Austin , among a hilly community of millionaires , are not quite large enough to obscure the opulence of his vast , Spanish - style villa .
Long before Oprah , it 's where he went through an earlier process of revelation and apology .
In 2008 , it was discovered that he was a champion water - consumer , using 330,000 gallons on his grounds that July alone ; more than almost anyone else in one of the United States ' most eco - conscious cities .
Armstrong said sorry and vowed to do better .
Armstrong 's present problems make that flood look like a trickle .
In a hotel room in Austin , the former cyclist confessed to Oprah Winfrey last Monday that he used performance - enhancing drugs during what was once regarded as an illustrious career , for an interview that will be broadcast on Thursday and Friday nights .
The reasons for the confession have been picked over at length .
But whatever the fallout , his association with this part of the US will be hard to erase .
He is tattooed on Austin 's landscape in three places .
On Sixth Street , once you pass the Soho - esque crumple of bars and clubs and find yourself in the gentrifying residential area that an estate agent would term "" diverse "" , you find Livestrong 's headquarters , a stylishly re - built 1950s warehouse .
There was bad news to spin from headquarters this week from the improbable location of Kansas City , where the Major League Soccer club Sporting Kansas City said they were banishing the first word from the name of their stadium , Livestrong Sporting Park .
Robb Heineman , the team 's chief executive , claimed in a statement that Livestrong was "" utilising aggressive tactics designed to force us into an unsatisfactory arrangement "" and "" our faith and trust in this partnership have been permanently damaged . ""
According to ESPN , the charity said that they had initiated the split because the club had paid only a quarter of the $ 1million it owed Livestrong for last year as part of a donation agreement .
If the timing of the rupture seemed masochistic in this of all weeks , it represented a way for Livestrong to sever a link with professional sport , and by extension Armstrong .
But references to the charity 's founder are still visible on motivational slogans daubed on its office walls .
In a statement on Wednesday , Livestrong said they "" expect Lance to be completely truthful and forthcoming in his interview and with all of us in the cancer community . ""
Near the core of the city is Armstrong 's bike shop , Mellow Johnny 's .
The name is a pun on "" maillot jaune "" , French for yellow jersey .
Decorated with Tour memorabilia , it is part store , part shrine .
Attached is the Juan Pelota cafe : Spanish for "" one ball "" , a phrase with special resonance for the testicular cancer survivor .
A block away stands La Zona Rosa , a nightclub where Armstrong had a slanging match with a bouncer in 2008 after leaving holding a drink , against city regulations .
In 2004 , after his sixth Tour de France victory , he invested in a bar in the Warehouse District called Six Lounge .
The Lance Armstrong Bikeway begins to the west .
This riverside trail through downtown opened in 2009 and showcased the city 's growing enthusiasm for cycling , a trend prompted by Armstrong 's influence , environmentally - aware residents and because the city has grown so fast in the past fifteen years that the traffic is now dreadful .
On Tuesday , an art installation of twelve big rectangles signifying yellow wristbands wobbled in the wind , their protective coating warped and peeled by sunlight .
Graffiti on a bridge barked a message Armstrong would approve : "" NEVER QUIT "" .
New condominium buildings cluster in the background and speak of the city 's boom .
Many joggers but few cyclists passed on a freezing afternoon .
One , Tom , talked cautiously and declined to give his surname , as one might if fearing reprisals when discussing a mafia don .
"" I think the general community in Austin still looks at him as a pretty accomplished athlete regardless , "" he said .
"" I 'm proud to have him here in Austin - why not ? ""
Tom did not want to say whether he felt the Bikeway should be renamed , but the city 's mayor , Lee Leffingwell , is not so reticent .
"" Lance is not only a friend to me , but also a friend to Austin , and a friend and hero to millions of cancer survivors and their families around the globe .
As for the Lance Armstrong Bikeway , it is a symbol in the fight against cancer , "" he said in a statement on Tuesday .
"" It 's a path toward healing and reminds us , as Lance Armstrong does , that cancer is a struggle we can overcome .
I 've heard no call from the Austin community to rename it and have no plans to do so . ""
This refusal to backpedal would have more credibility if Armstrong 's own charity had not decided to make him an unperson because the association with him was hurting their work .
He resigned as chairman last October .
But , even as the world 's media bellows its outrage and lawyers limber up to fight over his fortune and his future , Austin itself seems reluctant to kick up a stink about its resident liar â€ “ whether from pragmatism , loyalty or embarrassment .
It is as if to judge him harshly would be a form of self - criticism .
For a while he seemed the archetype of what this one - time quiet university city wanted to become : business - savvy , internationally - renowned , cool yet commercial .
A leader ( Austin styles itself as "" the live musical capital of the world "" ) .
Five years ago , while he was dating the actress Kate Hudson , he even hinted he was considering running for political office .
The previous year he went on a bus tour as he lobbied successfully for Texas voters to back state funding for a $ 3 billion cancer research institute that is presently mired in controversy about the integrity of its grant - awarding process .
This is not to say he is universally popular , or was even before this scandal .
But there appears greater relish for the debate - the polarising drama of guilt , shame and possible forgiveness - from out - of - towners , those who know Armstrong as a star they see on television rather than a man they might pass in the street .
On October 21 last year , Armstrong addressed the crowd at Austin 's annual Livestrong Challenge benefit ride , which attracted a record 4,300 riders .
The next day , the International Cycling Union stripped him of his seven Tour de France titles .
He is from Plano , a Dallas suburb , which helps given the sense of solidarity many Texans feel for each other in this most stubborn and independent of states .
"" We 're not going to give him up . "" said Fred Meredith , editor of Austin Cycling Quarterly .
"" No matter what they say we all know who came in first in all of those Tours and we know he was n't the only person who was hedging his bets .
"" I 'm a firm believer that even seemingly negative things at critical mass eventually promote cycling because they cause the public to be more aware , "" he added .
"" It 's like working this whole thing out in increments and this is the next increment .
It almost demanded that he deny it for a certain amount of time , to let people down gently ....
sure , we 're disappointed .
[ But ] the fault is as much the lack of policing by the association and letting it get so far .
He denied it longer than anybody else but he 's not the only one who denied . ""
The cycling scene , he said , has "" outgrown our dependence on Armstrong .
This city 's not going to stumble on this , it 's going to keep moving . ""
Armstrong 's status has adjusted since the revelations : from a celebrity whose presence in Austin helped author its recent success story to something more like a boil on the city 's handsome face .
Not unlike the dozens of hard - line Republican politicians who govern Texas from the capitol building here in the state 's most liberal and bohemian city , he is in Austin , but not of Austin ; integral , but detached ."
2013-01-17,"You do n't win the Tour de France seven times by backpedaling .
Even if you 're a cheater .
Especially if you 're a cheater .
But after more than a decade of rooking the world , Lance Armstrong finally realized he was down to one move on the chessboard â€ “ confessing .
It 's a strategy that countless other scandalous athletes have tried ( and mostly failed ) to employ successfully over the years , but Armstrong is hoping his mea minima culpa with Oprah on Thursday will be the start of rehabilitating his now - shameful image .
Good luck with that , Lance .
Now that we know , once and for all , that it was n't about his bike , it has become painfully obvious that it was really just about Armstrong .
And still is .
After all , this come - to - Oprah moment is n't about penance or humility , it 's merely a first step toward getting the United States Anti - Doping Association to lift its lifetime ban so he can compete in triathlons again .
That 's not exactly Sydney Carton heading toward the guillotine .
Even Oprah came forward to say that she was "" surprised "" by Armstrong 's confession . ""
He did not come clean in the manner I expected , "" she told CBS This Morning on Tuesday .
So what can Armstrong say to the world on Thursday , in order to start repairing his image ?
Consider the approaches that have been employed by other disgraced sports stars :
Denier As with Elisabeth KÃ¼bler - Ross 's five stages of grief , everyone who gets caught in a scandal starts here .
Barry Bonds and Roger Clemens famously championed this technique with an aggressiveness only rivaled by one other person : Lance Armstrong .
In the steroid era , it 's certainly fair for an athlete to defend himself by claiming : "" I have not tested positive for a banned substance . ""
But the campaign that Clemens waged against his former trainer Brian McNamee , and that which Armstrong unleashed against a peloton of former team - mates and friends ( including Greg LeMond , Floyd Landis and Frankie Andreu ) , suggests a ruthless pathology that 's hard to forgive .
Armstrong did n't just defend himself against false accusations
â€ “ he tried to ruin the lives ( and livelihoods ) of people he knew to be telling the truth about him .
There 's no denying it .
Liar When deniers come up against an Alp 's worth of evidence against them , they typically move to the next logical phase of image rehabilitation â€ “ lying .
Again , Bonds and Clemens stand engorged head and pumped - up shoulders above the crowd when it comes to embracing this strategy , though it did n't exactly work for them .
Both players were hit with federal perjury charges , which â€ “ even if they appeared to be overkill on the government 's part â€
“ does n't exactly bode well for Armstrong .
Not only have his monumental lies now been exposed , but he also faces his own perjury charges , thanks to statements he made under oath in a lawsuit he filed to claw back bonus money that a Dallas - based insurance company was unwilling to pay him for winning his sixth Tour de France , because of doping allegations .
As I believe they say in Texas , that 's chutzpah .
Crier
In the classic "" I 'm Not Gon
na Cry , Roy "" scene from Jerry Maguire
, Rod Tidwell understood how getting a little misty goes a long way toward healing an athlete 's bad reputation .
No real - life athlete embraced this better than Mark McGwire .
In 2010 , the disgraced former home - run king emerged from exile to seek absolution from Bob Costas .
There may be no crying in baseball , but Big Mac 's severe case of the sniffles appeared to be sincere .
Granted , McGwire 's motive for the Costas interview was his return to baseball ( as a hitting coach for the St Louis Cardinals ) , but he seemed truly remorseful about his cardinal sins as a steroid user .
When asked what he would say if players ask about performance - enhancing drugs , McGwire swung away , telling Costas : "" It 's the stupidest thing I ever did . ""
McGwire 's tears , however , seemed relatively subdued next to the sob story the sprinter Marion Jones told in 2007 , after pleading guilty to perjury charges ( Denier !
Liar ! ) from giving false statements to federal agents in the Balco case .
As Jones stood on the steps of the courthouse in White Plains , New York , knowing she was heading to prison , she wept profusely and apologized to her friends and family .
A year later , though , Jones returned from prison and sat down with ( who else ? )
Oprah , to reveal what she had learned from being incarcerated .
Not much , it turned out .
Asked how she would have done in the Olympics without doping , Jones told Winfrey : "" I still think I would have won . ""
She then added , coolly : "" I 'm trying to move on .
I hope that everybody else can move on , too . ""
And while Armstrong reportedly got teary when he apologized to the staff at his Livestrong charity this week , does anyone really expect to see major waterworks when he sits down with Oprah ?
Besides , if Armstrong does weep , he 'd be violating his own advice when , after being stripped of his seven Tour de France titles , he told his remaining fans last August : "" Nobody needs to cry for me .
I 'm going to be great . ""
So hold the Kleenex .
Retire
In simple terms , this move is the mic drop .
A scandalized athlete just walks away from his career
, does n't say goodbye , does n't say he 's sorry , and hopes all will be forgotten so he can still get into the Hall of Fame .
Recovering denier Sammy Sosa has personified this technique , but it 's only worked out so - so for him .
In 2007 , he became the fifth player in baseball history to hit 600 home runs , and the next year he retired and moved back to the Dominican Republic .
In a bizarre meta - metaphorical twist he started bleaching his skin with a lightening cream , but otherwise Sosa has mostly stayed out of the spotlight .
And apparently sunlight .
Until this year , of course , when he became eligible for Cooperstown .
The Baseball Writers ' Association of America slammed Sammy , however , only giving him 12.5 % of their votesâ€”well below the 75 % needed for a Hall of Fame plaque .
Judging from Sosa 's wacky Pinterest page â€ “ on which he poses like a replicant in the Sears catalog â€
“
Sammy 's not too broken up about the snub .
But can Armstrong try the disappearing act ?
Not a chance .
For one thing , his motivation for finally confessing was so he could resume competing in triathlons .
Retire ?
Lance Armstrong wants to show Robert Downey Jr what a real Ironman looks like .
Beyond that , he does n't want fans to forget what he did on a bicycle .
Back in November , shortly after losing those Tour de France titles , Armstrong shamelessly tweeted a photo of himself sprawled out on his couch at home â€ “ under his seven yellow jerseys .
Lie down strong , Lance .
And while we 're at it , let 's consider Livestrong for a moment .
Unquestionably the foundation he started has done phenomenal work in the battle against cancer .
But not a penny of that mitigates the fraud Armstrong perpetrated .
Supplier
Now here 's a strategy Armstrong could actually embrace .
Beginning with his Oprah interview , he could come forward and admit that he was the mastermind of the most elaborate doping conspiracy in sports history .
And he could name names .
This is exactly what Usada and cycling 's governing body want him to do â€ “ under oath .
In fact , it 's the calculus behind Armstrong 's admission .
Like a mafia rat , he 's hoping that finally coming clean will give him a second chance .
No one exemplifies this technique more than JosÃ © Canseco .
In 2005 , the onetime Bash Brother wrote a tell - all book , Juiced , in which he not only admitted taking steroids , but also injecting other players , including Mark McGwire , Rafael Palmiero , Ivan Rodriguez and Jason Giambi .
At the time , Canseco was vilified for confessing to such crimes against the game , but over the years he does seem to be just the kind of guy Diogenes was looking for â€ “ an honest man .
Adopting this approach could actually work for Armstrong .
It might even allow him to play the victim card a bit and still enjoy a kind of perverse claim to greatness â€ “
Yes , I doped .
But so did everyone else .
And I beat them unfair and square .
Pariah No strategy will work better for Armstrong than the one he will never use â€ “ becoming a pariah .
In professional wrestling , this would be known as the "" heel turn "" .
In real life , it 's pulling an OJ .
Following the murder of his ex - wife , Nicole , in 1994 , OJ Simpson abandoned the impeccable image he had spent decades cultivating and protecting .
He was , arguably , the first black athlete to be truly embraced by white America â€ “ consider his endorsement deals , his movie roles and the country clubs that welcomed him .
But the Juice gave all of that up â€ “ and the rest was taken from him
â€ “ when he stood trial for murder .
That black leather glove may not have fit , but his hateful new image did .
The apotheosis came in 2007 , when Simpson , years after his acquittal , published If I Did It â€ “ his hypothetical theory of how Nicole was killed .
Will Armstrong be willing to trade a yellow hat for a black one ?
Almost certainly not .
With the possible exception of Lord Vader himself , no one has ever gone over to the Dark Side and later been redeemed .
Armstrong has spent his entire career craving love from the public â€
“
his hubris will prevent him from asking to be loathed .
So what will life look like for Lance Armstrong once he 's done confessing to Oprah ?
He 'll spend years in litigation , lose most of his fortune , and if he 's very lucky he 'll get to compete again as a triathlete .
Of all those fates , the one that would likely hurt him most is maintaining that lifetime ban from competitive sports .
You want to truly punish an elite athlete ?
Damn him to an eternity of playing Wii ."
2013-01-17,"Andy Murray , like millions of people fascinated by Lance Armstrong 's fall from grace , was planning to watch the former champion cyclist 's performance in the celebrity confessional box with Oprah Winfrey .
But the world No3 was quick to defend tennis from guilt by association , despite renewed suspicions that the increased physical demands of his sport have tempted some players to experiment with performance - enhancing drugs .
There was another provocative claim this week by the former fringe Belgian player and serial alarmist Christophe Rochus that "" it is inconceivable that you can play five hours in the sun and run around like a rabbit the next day "" .
It has not gone down well in the locker room at the Australian Open .
"" I would say that is far from the truth , "" Murray said after beating the Portuguese João Sousa 6 - 2 , 6 - 2 , 6 - 4 in an hour and 41 minutes in temperatures that reached 38C to go through to the third round .
"" Anyone can see the amount of hours of training and practice that go into what we do .
[ Murray has just come off a five - week winter training bloc in Miami ] , and there are other sports that , endurance - wise , are far more challenging than tennis .
No , the guys ca n't just play five or six hours and then come back the next day and run around like rabbits . ""
When guys play five or six hours in the slams like we often do , we have a day 's rest .
I was told that after our semi - final here last year that Novak [ Djokovic ] on the day off [ before the final against Rafael Nadal ] did n't practise , did n't hit a ball , did n't get out of bed until three in the afternoon . ""
Providing you put the work in , it does n't mean it hurts any less when you have to play a couple of days later after a five - hour match –
but I would not say it is impossible . ""
Slightly put out to be discussing a subject some way removed from his immediate task – beating his friend and occasional hitting partner Ricardas Berankis on Saturday , he added , "" I discussed [ the Armstrong case ] at the end of last year and I do n't want to get into again because it caused more questions .
But all sports will take note of what has been said , what has happened and improve their doping controls . ""
He did acknowledge that tennis is now a fierce proving ground , and that players have to adapt to survive at the top . ""
Rafa was the first one to have a physique that looked like a true world - class athlete across any sport .
Tennis players are always in good shape but I think he looked like he could do any sport .
"" The game has changed , for sure , physically .
It 's much more demanding , and I have adapted my preparation and training , reducing the amount of tournaments I play and spending more time preparing , getting myself ready for events .
""
Not everybody does that
but I believe that 's the best way to go about it , spending more time in the gym in the off - season .
You do see better results .
"" It is , he says , tough on the generation of young players coming through . "" I played Wimbledon as a junior for the first time at 16 and my first Tour event at 17 .
Rafa played his first senior tournament at 16 , Novak was young , too .
Now , you look at the juniors in the locker room and there is no chance they could compete yet .
"" I practise with guys like Ollie [ Golding ] and various others and even someone like Ben Mitchell , the Aussie kid .
I practised with him the year after he had won the Australian juniors and you can see how much his body has changed in the past couple of years .
Only now is he starting to be able to compete .
Before , guys were able to compete when they were 16 and 17 .
Now it is at least four more years . ""
The average age of the top 100 is 28 , I would guess that is a couple of years older than five years ago .
The game is changing , it takes guys longer to physically and mentally cope .
You come out of the juniors and you are used to hitting clean winners , then you come on to the main tour and the ball is coming back with interest .
"" You have to develop mentally much quicker , to understand and appreciate how much the game is changing .
It will , for sure , take guys longer to break through unless you get someone who is an incredibly gifted and talented athlete . ""
And , of course , clean ."
2013-01-18,"As confessionals go , the Oprah Winfrey show is probably not the place for the excoriation of the soul .
Rather less blood was drawn in the first session of Lance Armstrong 's hugely trailed interview than might be lost receiving an intravenous dose of erythropoietin .
At the halfway stage of the two - parter , all that has really been established is that Armstrong 's self - belief and his appetite for manipulation are undimmed .
Yet although his determination to come first should never be underestimated , his story is about much more than one obsessive who exploited the power structure of his sporting world .
If his calibrated , choreographed confession is allowed to be his passport back into world - class sport then a catastrophic disservice will be done to the cause of public morality .
What makes the Armstrong case so much more than the latest felling of a sporting cheat 's reputation is the extent to which he once bestrode the world of cycling .
Armstrong utterly dominated those around him , and he lied without conscience in defence of his interests .
All this , he claimed to Oprah , was internally legitimised by a worldview in which doping was on a par with , say , weight training in the armoury of competition .
If some close to the sport were always a little sceptical of the Armstrong myth , to millions outside it he was an inspiration , an endurance cyclist of breath - taking courage , with a nobility of spirit that allowed him to escape cancer and establish a charitable foundation with his own money that helped thousands of fellow sufferers .
His is a fall from grace like no other .
A man who can dismiss the US anti - doping agency 's finding of "" conclusive and undeniable proof "" of cheating as a tax - payer funded hatchet job probably does n't do remorse .
His confession is a classic of falling back , the better to renew the attack .
Justice alone requires that that does not happen .
But his fate must have a wider significance .
Armstrong 's hold on his sport went far beyond his immediate circle .
The UCI , the international cycling union , bought into the Armstrong legend because they wanted to harness the sport 's damaged image to this demi - god .
As a result , both its former president Hein Verbruggen and his successor Pat McQuaid , who once described the true whistleblowers ,
former Armstrong teammates Floyd Landis and Tyler Hamilton , as "" scumbags "" are damagingly implicated .
Even if the alleged cover - up of a suspect dope test in 2001 is never proved , there 's no doubt that cycling 's parent body was the most wilfully blind of guardians .
Unless the UCI transforms itself , an operation that will require a good deal more energy and rigour than it has so far displayed , then before long another Lance Armstrong will triumph ."
2013-01-18,"What did we learn from Lance Armstrong 's interview with Oprah Winfrey , the first par of which was broadcast on Thursday night ?
â€¢ That Lance Armstrong did use performance - enhancing drugs .
But the US anti - doping agency , Usada , told us that already .
So did the Oprah interview pre - publicity .
â€¢ That Lance Armstrong is prepared to call himself a "" jerk "" and an "" arrogant prick "" , but that he only admits to bullying in limited circumstances and as a personal flaw .
A bit like biting one 's nails .
â€¢
He looked amazingly sleek and healthy , only slightly greyer .
For a guy whose world has been torn down in the last six months , he appeared remarkably unstressed .
Whatever he 's on now , I 'd like some too , please .
â€¢
He 's still friends with George Hincapie , his loyal lieutenant in all his Tour - winning teams â€ “ and as Armstrong admitted , the most "" credible "" witness against him .
But George Hincapie is incapable of falling out with anyone .
His overtures in this interview to Betsy Andreu , Emma O'Reilly and others
he victimised when he had the power to do so may go unanswered .
There were several hundred people owed apologies by Armstrong who went begging here .
In fact , did he really apologise to anyone ?
â€¢
He refused to give any clue of whether he would , as has been reported , cooperate with Usada , and possibly testify against senior officials of cycling 's governing body , the UCI .
His denial of the 2001 Tour de Suisse "" cover - up "" story suggests strongly otherwise .
â€¢
In this part , Oprah did not ask him about whether he would agree that his dope - cheating amounted to defrauding the US Postal Service , which sponsored his team 1999 - 2003 to the tune of at least $ 30 m .
We 'll see if she goes there in part 2 .
â€¢ Oprah is no Scott Pelley , David Walsh or Paul Kimmage .
Oprah may have had 112 questions prepared , but she let Armstrong evade her and even allowed him to trespass into afternoon TV touchy - feely territory .
Sometimes , you really do need a journalist .
â€¢
In short , this was not very edifying .
If Armstrong was able to reduce his Livestrong Foundation staff to tears with his confession and apology , I hope OWN 's audience are made of more skeptical , sterner stuff .
This was more strategy by Armstrong .
The confession he got out of the way very quickly ; it was actually limited .
The rest was obfuscation and camouflage ."

2013-01-18,"After a decade of lies , cheating , and a relentless campaign of vilification against his accusers , it was unsurprising that those most adversely affected by Lance Armstrong felt short - changed by his confessional interview with Oprah Winfrey .
The Texan 's belated admission that he took performance - enhancing drugs also received a lukewarm response from the anti - doping authorities who pursued him for years .
They called on him to go further in revealing the full scale of the conspiracy and repeat his admission under oath rather than on a pre - recorded TV show .
Although Armstrong confessed , for the first time , that he took EPO , testosterone , cortisone and human growth hormone to help him to seven Tour de France victories â€ “ admitting his career was "" one big lie "" and that he had been a "" jerk "" , a "" liar "" and an "" arrogant prick "" â€ “ he said he felt "" uncomfortable "" naming names and was criticised for a lack of detail and contrition .
Emma O'Reilly , the former US Postal team masseuse who was sued by Armstrong â€ “ and who he had described as a "" prostitute "" and an "" alcoholic "" â€ “ after she revealed a prescription had been faked following a positive test at the 1999 Tour , said his apology was "" not at all enough "" .
Armstrong had tried to get in touch with O'Reilly before the programme went out .
Betsy Andreu , the wife of Armstrong 's former team - mate Frankie , criticised him for failing to admit that he had confessed to using performance - enhancing drugs while being treated for cancer in 1996 .
He conceded for the first time that his doping had begun before he contracted testicular cancer , but refused to go into detail of the alleged hospital bed confession , which Andreu had testified about in a previous legal dispute between Armstrong and the Texas insurance company SCA Promotions .
Andreu said Armstrong had left her "" really disappointed "" . ""
He owed it to me ; you owed it to me Lance , and you dropped the ball .
After what you 've done to me , what you 've done to my family , and you could n't own up to it , "" Andreu told CNN . ""
And now we 're supposed to believe you ?
You had one chance at the truth ; this is it . ""
Travis Tygart , the United States Anti - Doping Agency chief executive who oversaw the pursuit of Armstrong that resulted in a damning 202-page report last October , said the confession had not gone nearly far enough . ""
His admission that he doped throughout his career is a small step in the right direction .
But if he is sincere in his desire to correct his past mistakes , he will testify under oath about the full extent of his doping activities , "" said Tygart .
Armstrong told Winfrey he would not have been caught had he not made a comeback in 2009 .
He said he did not consider his doping to be cheating because he was trying to create a "" level playing field "" .
However , Armstrong , 41 , denied being a mastermind who threatened other team - mates to dope , and rejected allegations that he bribed the International Cycling Union and a Swiss laboratory to cover up his cheating .
He also denied taking drugs during his comeback in 2009 and 2010 .
This limited confession will fuel suspicion in some quarters that it was made only because Armstrong was backed into a corner and that , in a strategy devised by his close - knit team of advisers , he chose to withhold the full truth in an attempt to avoid criminal prosecution .
Winfrey opened the interview with a series of questions , to which she requested "" yes or no "" answers .
Asked if he used drugs to win his Tour titles he replied : "" Yes . ""
Asked if they included steroids , and EPO , he said : "" Yes . ""
Asked if it was humanly possible to win the Tour seven consecutive times , as he did from 1999 - 2005 , he said in his opinion it was not . ""
I view this situation as one big lie that I repeated a lot of times , "" he said .
Dressed casually in a navy blazer , blue shirt and slacks , Armstrong looked tense and at times bristled while casting himself as a flawed , contrite human being who got caught up in a "" culture "" of doping , which , he implied , included most riders of his generation .
Armstrong said the doping during his triumphs â€ “ which revolved around oxygen - boosting drugs to improve endurance
â€ “ was brazen and not at all threatened by testing during and after races because the cheating happened before .
"" So you 're not going to get caught .
Because you 're clean at the races , clear .
It 's a question of scheduling . ""
Out of competition testing and the biological passport had since cleaned up the sport , he said .
Challenged by Winfrey over multiple accounts that he ordered teammates to dope , he appeared to squirm .
"" I was the top rider â€ ¦ the team leader but not the manager .
There was never a direct order or directive that you have to do this .
We were grown men , we all made our choices . ""
Asked if was he a bully , he replied : "" Yeah , yeah , I was a bully .
In the sense I tried to control the narrative and if I did n't like what someone said â€ ¦
I tried to control that .
"" Having publicly admitted doping after previously denying it under oath , Armstrong now faces the possibility of a string of legal challenges .
SCA is pursuing the return of $ 12 m it had to pay out in bonuses following Armstrong 's 2006
Tour win while the Sunday Times is confident of recouping the Â£1 m it paid to Armstrong in 2006 after a libel action .
The second part of Armstrong 's interview with Winfrey is due to be broadcast on the Discovery channel in the US and on her website on Saturday morning UK time ."
2013-01-18,"Lance Armstrong has admitted for the first time that he doped to win all seven of his Tour de France titles , turning his back on years of denials and confessing that his storied career at the top of competitive cycling was fuelled by drugs , lies and bullying .
In a television interview with Oprah Winfrey broadcast on Thursday night , Armstrong said it would not have been possible to win the titles without cheating , such was the prevalence of performance - enhancing drugs in the sport at the time .
However , Armstrong , 41 , denied being a mastermind who threatened other team - mates to dope , and rejected allegations that he bribed the International Cycling Union and a Swiss laboratory to cover up his cheating .
He also denied taking drugs during his comeback in 2009 and 2010 , and did not indicate â€ “ at least not in the first of a two - part broadcast â€ “ whether he would cooperate with the anti - doping agency Usada so that he can return to competitive sport , as has been reported .
This limited confession will fuel suspicion in some quarters that it was made only because Armstrong was backed into a corner after an excoriating report from Usada last year and that , in a strategy devised by his close - knit team of advisers , he chose to withhold the full truth in an attempt to avoid criminal prosecution .
Winfrey opened the interview with a series of questions , to which she requested "" yes or no "" answers from Armstrong .
Asked if he used drugs to win his Tour titles he replied : "" Yes . ""
Asked if they included steroids , EPO and PED , he said : "" Yes . ""
Asked if it was humanly possible to win the Tour seven consecutive times , as he did from 1999 - 2005 , he said in his opinion it was not . ""
I view this situation as one big lie that I repeated a lot of times , "" he said .
The confession , even if widely deemed partial , was a dramatic turnaround for a man who has spent two decades defying and threatening those who challenged his record .
Dressed casually in a navy blazer , blue shirt and slacks , Armstrong looked tense and at times bristled while casting himself as a flawed , contrite human being who got caught up in a "" culture "" of doping , which , he implied , included most riders of his generation .
"" I did n't invent the culture and I did n't try to stop the culture ... and the sport is now paying the price of that
and I 'm sorry for that .
I did n't have access to anything else that nobody else did . ""
He said he "" lost himself "" in the fairytale narrative of an athlete who battled back from testicular cancer to triumph in cycling 's most gruelling race , raise a beautiful family and launch a cancer charity , Livestrong . ""
The truth is n't what I said .
And now it 's gone ...
this story was so perfect for so long . ""
At times slipping into the second person , he said : "" You won the disease ...
it was this mythic perfect story .
And it just wan't true . ""
The interview , a huge scoop for Oprah 's Los Angeles - based Oprah Winfrey Network ( OWN ) , was broken into two 90-minute segments , the second of which will air on Friday .
Seated with his legs crossed in a armchair at the Four Seasons hotel in his home town of Austin , Texas , Armstrong rejected claims that his leadership of the US Postal Service team represented the biggest and most sophisticated doping enterprise in sport . ""
No , it was definitely professional , and smart if you can call it that .
But it was very conservative , and risk - averse .
But to say that programme was bigger than the East German doping programme of the mid-1980s ... not true . ""
He said he did not remember stashing syringes in Coke cans â€ “ an incident described in a book by his fellow rider Tyler Hamilton .
"" I did n't read Tyler 's book ...
I do n't remember that , i 'm not going to say that 's a lie .
Armstrong said the doping during his triumphs â€ “ which revolved around oxygen - boosting drugs to improve endurance
â€ “ was brazen and not at all threatened by testing during and after races because the cheating happened before .
"" So you 're not going to get caught .
Because you 're clean at the races , clear .

"" I was the top rider ... the team leader but not the manager .
There was never a direct order or directive that you have to do this .
We were grown men , we all made our choices . ""
He denied threatening to expel those who refused to cheat but conceded the "" level of expectation , of pressure "" could have compelled some riders to do so .
Asked was he a bully , he replied : "" Yeah , yeah , I was a bully .
In the sense I tried to control the narrative and if I did n't like what someone said ... I tried to control that .
Said that 's a lie , they 're liars . ""
Armstrong , who was closeted with his advisers in advance of the interview , cited his mother and his cancer for reasons he was so competitive , but admitted doping before the cancer .
The cheating programme was so effective he knew he was going to beat rivals . ""
Those tours ...
I knew ,
I knew I was going to win . ""
He declined to confirm that his long - term doctor , Michele Ferrari , was complicit and said he was a good person .
"" There are people in this story that are not monsters , are not toxic .
I 'm not comfortable talking about other people . ""
Calling himself a "" jerk "" as well as a humanitarian , he said he was flawed and wrought the disgrace which has now engulfed him . ""
I deserve this . ""
Showed an old clip of him denying the accusations , he said : "" I look at that clip and think , look at that arrogant prick .
That 's not me today .
"" Shown a clip of his victory speech after winning the 2005 Tour , in which he assailed "" cynics "" who did n't believe in miracles , he shook his head . ""
Looking at that now it looks ridiculous ...
I 'm definitely embarrassed . ""
Armstrong prompted a gasp from Winfrey when he said he had not felt like he was cheating because cheating meant to gain unfair rival over a foe , implying that all his rivals were also cheating .
Several times he made what verged on a plea for forgiveness . ""
These were people who believed in me , who believed me , and they have every right to feel betrayed .
I 'll spend the rest of my life trying to earn back trust and apologise to people . ""
He apologised to Emma O'Reilly , a team masseuse whom he sued for calling him a cheat .
"" She 's one of these people I have to apologise to ... who got bullied , who got run over . ""
Armstrong said accusers such as the journalist David Walsh and Betsy Andreu , a teammate 's wife , suffered the wrath of a "" guy who expected to get everything he wanted , and to control everything "" .
He said his comeback was a tactical mistake that galvanised investigations which eventually unravelled his deception .
"" We would n't be sitting here if I did n't come back . """

2013-01-18,"The American ritual of celebrity confession and redemption is an exercise in having your cake and eating it too .
You get to commit the career - ending crime â€ “ to fabricate the memoir , to have the affair with the intern â€ “ without actually having to end your career .
But Lance Armstrong 's much - hyped encounter with Oprah Winfrey , the first part of which aired on Thursday night , was something even more cynical and calculating : an attempt to confess without confessing .
It was an effort to meet the minimum standards required for a celebrity confession while avoiding further legal liabilities , and leaving Armstrong 's weapons - grade sanctimony intact .
He wanted to have his cake and eat it too , but also not to eat it , and in any case , everyone was eating cakes , and it depends what you mean by "" cake "" , andâ€ ¦
This made for compelling television , but not for any of the reasons Armstrong or his handlers might have wanted .
Bursting into tears during a conversation with Oprah may be corny , but appearing to be almost totally without emotion , as Armstrong did , is far worse .
It draws the audience 's attention to the fundamental falsity of the whole operation .
You 're supposed to leave the viewer feeling moved , and perhaps a little morally superior â€ “ not soiled for having tuned in at all .
He admitted to doping , of course , and did so within the opening seconds of the show , under Winfrey 's calmly precise questioning .
( Because of her history of giving away free cars , and sometimes bestowing too much credibility on dubious guests , it 's often overlooked how good an interviewer Oprah can be when she chooses . )
But almost the whole of the rest of his 90-minute performance consisted of lawyerly quibbling .
Had he pressured teammates to take performance - enhancing drugs ?
"" I do n't want to split hairs here , "" Armstrong replied , before going on to explain that he had n't pressured them , but had allowed a situation to exist in which they 'd felt pressured .
At one point , he claimed , he 'd even looked up the word "" cheating "" in a dictionary , and concluded , astonishingly enough , that it did n't apply to him .
Then there were the flat - out contradictions .
Had he acted like a bully since he was a child ?
Yes , Armstrong conceded â€ “ only to claim , seconds later , when it helped him make a different point , that he 'd only become a bully after being diagnosed with cancer at the age of 25 .
Like an only partially competent table magician performing a card trick , Armstrong seemed to hope he could distract and confuse to the point where neither Oprah , nor the audience , would detect the problems with his argument .
Fighting cancer had given him a "" relentless , win - at - all - costs attitude "" , he explained , which had the unfortunate side - effect of making him relentlessly determined to take whatever banned substances his cycling victories required .
But when Winfrey pointed out that he 'd already admitted to taking such drugs prior to his diagnosis , he barely paused to agree , before galloping onwards with his talking - points .
The lowest and most alienating moment came when Armstrong purported not to remember whether he had sued Emma O'Reilly , the team 's massage therapist , whom he 'd labelled an alcoholic and a prostitute after she blew the whistle .
Winfrey had given Armstrong an easy opportunity to apologise to O'Reilly , but his self - absorption made that impossible . ""
We sued so many people , I do n't even â€
¦
I 'm sure we did , "" he said .
If there was a detectible emotion , it was that Armstrong was enjoying himself â€ “ which is a disaster , in crisis - management terms .
Not that this should have been shocking .
He had already shown an epic disregard for the rules of competitive cycling , so it was hardly surprising that he showed a similar disregard for the rules of the Oprah confessional .
Winfrey never once elicited a shred of empathy on Armstrong 's part .
But the likeliest explanation for that , to judge from his responses on Thursday night , was that there was n't any there ."
2013-01-18,"She was soft on him ...
she did n't tell him he was a disgrace to humanity ...
she did n't even make him cry .
Such criticism of Oprah Winfrey 's Lance Armstrong coup is churlish .
Who cares ?
Oprah got the TV confession of the decade â€ “ and what 's more
she did it on her own channel .
Would any interviewer be happy with that ?
And some .
It was brilliant journalism .
The genius is not in the form of the interview â€ “
she more or less strokes this stony - faced rottweiler into a mea culpa .
Her genius is in getting the interview in the first place , to have worked her way up from nowhere over 26 years to being the world 's great go - to mother confessor .
Did Oprah and Lance Armstrong :
The Worldwide Exclusive Part 1 ( no flipping , as Larry Sanders would say , we 've got part two tonight ) make for compelling telly ?
Not really .
Certainly , not consistently .
There were basic structural problems .
First , the set ; the cod domesticity â€ “ brown sofa and chairs , lace curtains â€ “ stripped it of tension .
Then , the cameras were too polite â€ “
we needed more unforgiving John Freeman - style close - ups .
If Armstrong was ever going to writhe and wriggle , we wanted to see it up close and personal .
Perhaps the biggest problem was Armstrong himself .
He repeatedly referred to himself as a "" flawed character "" .
Which is a bit of false modesty on his behalf .
But he is also a flawed victim , ie wholly unconvincing as a victim .
He is too chiselled , his eyes too cold and quartz - like , face too composed , legs too smugly crossed .
He said that he saw the anger and disappointment and betrayal in people , but he did n't look as if he felt it .
His body language was always at odds with his words .
At one point , he laughed in the camera 's eye , and says he might have called Betsy Andreu ( the wife of his former team mate Frank Andreu ) a "" crazy bitch "" , but he never called her "" fat "" .
He admitted he still felt wronged about the way that has been reported â€ “ a fascinating insight into his character , as Oprah pointed out .
"" I will apologise to people for the rest of my life , "" he said , making it sound more like a threat than a promise .
Last night Lance Armstrong was still burning with righteous indignation .
What made David Frost 's interview with Richard Nixon the greatest TV confession ever was the two protagonists â€ “ both exhausted , desperate , playing for huge stakes .
Nixon sweated with fear and shame
â€ “ when he talked about his flaws you could see and smell them ; they dripped down his face .
Frost - Nixon was TV interviewing 's Thrilla in Manila , Ali v Frazier , two giants battering each other into submission .
Martin Bashir 's TV interview with Princess Diana was wonderful in a different way
â€ “
she was a pure victim , with great lines ( "" There were three of us in this marriage "" ) , and she was part of the royal family .
Armstrong 's confession had less emotional impact than either Diana 's or Nixon 's .
Could Oprah have handled it differently ?
Sure .
She did n't need to make excuses for him , telling us that nearly everyone was doping so what else could he do ?
She did n't need to suggest that he could become a role model for clean cycling ( even he did n't have the chutzpah to go with that line ) .
When Armstrong mentioned the toxic monsters in professional cycling , she could have asked him 12 times , a la Paxman , whether he was a toxic monster ?
There are numerous questions that would have benefited from repeated asking , or just being asked the once .
How could Armstrong systematically go about suing and destroying the lives of those who told the truth about him ?
Should he be in jail ?
Will he give away all his ill - gotten gains ( to be fair Oprah might still ask in part two tonight ) .
But the bottom line is , Armstrong almost certainly would n't have agreed to the interview if she had done .
The greatest structural problem was that the interview started so strongly it could only go downhill from there .
Whereas Frost - Nixon built up to the spine - tingling confession , Oprah began with the money shot .
So , as TV drama , it was all downhill from there .
But this is nitpicking .
She got Armstrong to admit he is a jerk , a bully , a cheat , and a fraud .
What more could you want than that ?
And the actual confession , albeit in the cosy court of Oprah , is pure drama .
Five questions , yes or no answers , and he pleads guilty to every one .
"" Yes or no , did you ever take banned substances to enhance your cycling performance ? ""
"" Yes . ""
"" Yes or no , was one of those banned substances EPO ? ""
"" Yes . ""
"" Did you ever blood dope or use blood transfusions to enhance your cycling performance ? ""
"" Yes . ""
"" Did you ever use other banned substances like testosterone or human growth hormone ? ""
"" Yes . ""
"" Yes or no , in all seven of your Tour de France victories did you ever take banned substances or blood dope ? ""
"" Yes . "" This exchange will rightly go down in television history
â€ “ in its own way every bit as significant as the Diana and Nixon confessionals ."

2013-01-18,"The Sunday Times says it is confident of recouping the Â£1 m it paid out on a libel action taken by Lance Armstrong now that the disgraced Tour de France - winning cyclist has admitted taking banned substances in his Oprah Winfrey interview .
But the paper 's chief sports writer , David Walsh , who relentlessly pursued Armstrong over 13 years and exposed him as a drugs cheat , said on Friday he did not want an apology from the disgraced cyclist .
"" It was my job , I 'm not looking for any thanks from anybody .
Any concern I have is for the sources who told the truth and were vilified for it , "" he told BBC News .
The News International paper is suing Amstrong to recover the Â£300,000 it paid in an out - of - court settlement in 2006 .
It is also seeking to recover its legal costs and interest , which took the full amount paid out to Â£1 m .
"" We watched Lance Armstrong 's interview with interest and noted his numerous admissions regarding taking performance - enhancing drugs .
The Sunday Times believes that our case for recovering the Â£1 m plus he obtained from us by fraud is now even stronger .
We will be pursuing that case vigorously , "" the paper said in a statement .
The seven - times Tour de France winner was stripped of all his cycling titles going back to August 1998 and banned from the sport for life last autumn after the US anti - doping agency , Usada , released a report detailing allegations of widespread doping by Armstrong and former colleagues in his cycling team .
Usada 's document resulted in 14 years of Armstrong 's career achievement being erased , including the Tour titles .
It contained sworn statements from 26 witnesses , including 11 former team - mates .
In the interview with Winfrey , he was asked if he used drugs to win his Tour titles and replied : "" Yes . ""
Asked if they included steroids , and EPO , a blood dope that increases the generation of red blood cells , he said : "" Yes . ""
Armstrong said it would not have been possible to win the titles without cheating , such was the prevalence of performance - enhancing drugs in the sport at the time .
However , Armstrong , 41 , denied being a mastermind who threatened other team - mates to dope , and rejected allegations that he bribed the International Cycling Union and a Swiss laboratory to cover up his cheating .
He also denied taking drugs during his comeback in 2009 and 2010 , and did not indicate â€ “ at least not in the first of a two - part broadcast â€ “ whether he would co - operate with Usada so that he can return to competitive sport , as has been reported .
Armstrong 's interview was his first public response to the 1,000-page Usada report that showed he was willing to go to any lengths to win the Tour de France , the sport 's most gruelling race .
The Sunday Times decided to sue last year and in a letter to Armstrong 's lawyers it said : "" It is clear that the proceedings [ in 2006 ] were baseless and fraudulent .
Your representations that you had never taken performance - enhancing drugs were deliberately false . ""
The Sunday Times is now demanding a return of the settlement payment plus interest , as well as its costs in defending the case , "" it said .
Amstrong brought the high court action against Walsh and Times Newspapers , the News International subsidiary that publishes the Sunday Times , in 2004 over an article which referred to a book , LA Confidential â€ “
The Secrets of Lance Armstrong .
The book , published only in French , contains circumstantial evidence that the cyclist used banned substances to improve his performance .
In an agreed statement in 2006 , the paper said : "" The Sunday Times has confirmed to Mr Armstrong that it never intended to accuse him of being guilty of taking any performance - enhancing drugs and sincerely apologised for any such impression . ""
Mr Armstrong has always vigorously opposed drugs in sport and appreciates the Sunday Times ' efforts to also address the problem . ""
Walsh first raised questions about Armstrong in 1999 , when made a comeback after life - threatening testicular cancer and made an extraordinary break from the pack in a mountain stage during that year 's Tour de France .
The Sunday Times journalist said on Friday that Armstrong needed to name those who had helped him and criticised Winfrey for not going far enough .
He said it was "" reprehensible "" that Armstrong had sued the paper in a bid to hide the truth . ""
There is a legal issue in that the Sunday Times was sued by Lance Amstrong , in a sense he won even though there was an out - of - court settlement .
The Times paid Â£300,000 towards his costs .
They had Â£600,000 of their own costs .
They are seeking to recoup that money and they have every entitlement , "" Walsh told BBC News . ""
Remember the Sunday Times was the only newspaper who consistently asked questions about a guy who was probably the biggest cheat sport has ever known .
Now to be penalised for asking those questions is just reprehensible and hopefully the Sunday Times will get its money back . ""
On a personal level I do n't want any apology from Lance Armstrong or any kind of explanation , because I was a journalist being paid to do what I did .
It was my job , I 'm not looking for any thanks from anybody .
Any concern I have is for the sources who told the truth and were vilified for it . ""
Walsh was heavily criticised by Armstrong over his years covering cycling .
Once asked about Walsh in an interview by American writer Daniel Coyle , Amstrong said : "" I just hate the guy .
He 's a little troll .
Fucking Walsh .
Fucking little troll .
"" In the interview with Doyle , Armstrong went on to say that he hoped he was someone that people in the US looked up to .
But he said : "" You know what ?
They do n't even know who David Walsh is .
And they never will .
And in 20 years , nobody is going to remember him .
Nobody . ""
Walsh said he did not think Oprah went far enough in her questioning of Armstrong . ""
My feeling is that the interview was fine in as far as it went , but it did not go nearly far enough , and even in as far as it went , I was particularly disappointed that he did n't admit what might be called the hospital room admission from 1996 , "" Walsh told the BBC .
The interview went out live in the US on Thursday night and will be repeated on Friday in the UK on the Discovery Channel at 8 pm ( GMT ) .
The second part of the interview will be broadcast live on Discovery at 2 am on Saturday morning and repeated at 8 pm on Saturday night .

2013-01-18,"As Lance Armstrong insisted to Oprah Winfrey in Austin that the six - figure donations he gave cycling 's world governing body were not related to a failed test being covered up , you could almost hear the sighs of relief from Lausanne .
Beneath the personal soap opera and the devastating impact of Armstrong 's actions on those he bullied and threatened during a decade of deceit , his belated confession shed little light on the unanswered questions that remain over the conspiracy that lay beneath it or the extent to which the sport 's governing body was complicit or at fault .
While the very fact Armstrong admitted taking a cocktail of drugs to win his seven Tour de France titles laid bare the total inadequacy of the testing programme throughout that era , his claim that he was clean when he came back in 2009 and that the UCI 's biological passport had "" really worked "" was seized upon by the UCI .
It had also been suggested before Armstrong 's interview with Winfrey that he might implicate the UCI , its under - pressure former president Hein Verbruggen and his successor , Pat McQuaid , in a conspiracy that the Texan admitted was second only to East Germany 's industrial doping programme .
Last year 's damning US Anti - Doping Agency report made uncomfortable reading for Verbruggen , McQuaid and the UCI .
It repeated allegations , strongly denied by the UCI , from Armstrong 's former team - mates Floyd Landis and Tyler Hamilton that when Armstrong and Johan Bruyneel , then the team 's directeur sportif , visited its headquarters in Aigle in May 2002 to offer $ 100,000 to help the development of cycling , they were doing so in order to buy its silence .
McQuaid has admitted accepting donations totalling $ 125,000 from Armstrong 's camp in 2002 and 2007 but strongly denied there were any conditions attached .
Hamilton has said Armstrong told him that an alleged failed test in the 2001 Tour of Switzerland "" was going to be taken care of "" .
But Armstrong told Winfrey that there was no failed test and that the money was paid simply because the UCI asked for it . ""
That story is n't true .
There was no positive test , there was no paying - off of the lab , there was no secret meeting with the lab director .
I am no fan of the UCI but that did not happen , "" he said .
Martial Saugy , the head of the Lausanne lab that conducted the tests , insisted last October there was no positive test but admitted one of the results for Armstrong was "" suspect "" .
The following year , Saugy said , the UCI asked him to meet with Armstrong and explain the testing procedure for EPO .
"" It was not in exchange for help , "" Armstrong said of the donation .
"" They called and said they did n't have a lot of money .
I did .
They asked if I would make a donation so I did . ""
The UCI risked further criticism for concentrating in its response on the extent to which the interview apparently exonerated it rather than dealing with the remaining unanswered questions .
"" Lance Armstrong has confirmed there was no collusion or conspiracy between the UCI and Lance Armstrong , "" McQuaid said .
"" There were no positive tests which were covered up and he has confirmed that the donations made to the UCI were to assist in the fight against doping . ""
Verbruggen said : "" I am pleased that after years of accusations being made against me the conspiracy theories have been shown to be nothing more than that .
I have no doubt that the peddlers of such accusations and conspiracies will be disappointed by this outcome .
"" As the UCI seized on the comments , the World Anti - Doping Agency director general , David Howman , said Armstrong had "" no credibility "" and Usada 's chief executive , Travis Tygart , said the televised admission was merely a "" small step "" .
The British Cycling president , Brian Cookson , raised the question of whether anything Armstrong said could be believed given the scale and vehemence of his denials over the past 15 years .
But while the UCI has avoided a damning revelation from Armstrong , the walls continue to close in on the governing body .
Wada and Usada have been consistently critical of its approach , believing that it is more concerned with justifying its own behaviour than genuinely learning the lessons for the sport .
They renewed their attack on the UCI this week after a tit - for - tat exchange of statements over the independent commission the cycling body had set up to look into the allegations contained in the Usada report .
Hours before the Armstrong interview aired , Howman lobbed another grenade , saying the independent commission would be a "" useless exercise "" due to the limited terms of reference laid down by the UCI and its short time frame .
"" It has again become apparent that rather than deal with the obvious problems that exist within the sport of cycling , the UCI once again would like to avoid its responsibilities and instead seek to blame Wada and others , "" he said .
Howman also made damning reference to the UCI 's missed opportunity in 2005 when Armstrong was accused of doping . ""
In 2005 when an opportunity arose to address an allegation of doping by Armstrong , the UCI commissioned a so - called independent report â€ “
the Vrijman report â€
“ which totally failed to address the substance of the allegations , "" he said .
The independent commission process risks becoming mired in internal dispute , after its panel this week said it required a "" truth and reconciliation "" element that would give whistleblowers immunity .
Tygart , whose dogged pursuit of Armstrong was the driving force behind his fall , has consistently argued that such a process is the only way for the sport to move forward .
In response the UCI said that the role of the independent commission was "" not to act as a doping confessional "" but to investigate the UCI 's own "" alleged complicity "" with the "" alleged doping "" of Armstrong .
It insisted it would welcome a wider truth and reconciliation commission if it included all endurance sports .
Armstrong , after years of bullying , denials and law suits , insisted to Winfrey that he would be "" the first man through the door "" if a truth and reconciliation process were set up .
Tygart said : "" His admission that he doped throughout his career is a small step in the right direction .
But if he is sincere in his desire to correct his past mistakes , he will testify under oath about the full extent of his doping activities .
"" The battle lines appear drawn .
The UCI will press on with its independent commission and attempt to make peace with the three - strong panel , chaired by the former appeal court judge Sir Philip Otton and including the former Paralympian Baroness Tanni Grey - Thompson .
In going public with their concerns over the process , they have at least demonstrated their determination not to be cowed .
Wada and Usada , meanwhile , insist that only a truly independent , wide - ranging inquiry able to set its own terms of reference , offer immunity to key witnesses and avoid the temptation to draw a line and move on will do ."
2013-01-18,"It was not hard to make the obvious comparisons between the Lance Armstrong Tours of 2000 - 2005 and the guided tour Lance Armstrong gave Oprah Winfrey around his world of cheating , lying and bullying .
Apart from the occasional moment when a chink opened in the carapace , Armstrong was in control and , by and large , the opposition â€ “ Oprah playing the role of Jan Ullrich
back then â€ “ was pretty much where he wanted , doing what he would have expected .
The big question â€ “ how Armstrong would be led to confess to doping , and how long Winfrey would leave it before getting him there
â€ “ was resolved at once .
It did n't take the gentle coaxing that judge Patrick Keil used at the Festina trial to guide Richard Virenque into the admission that he had used EPO ; it was perhaps the biggest surprise : the quickfire succession of closed questions that opened the programme .
Had he used banned substances ?
EPO ?
Blood doping ?
Testosterone , cortisone , growth hormone ?
In all seven Tour wins ?
Each time , the answer was yes .
If there was a surprise , it came in one of the few moments when Armstrong showed emotion : when Winfrey mentioned the US Anti - Doping Agency 's conclusion that he had blood doped in the 2009 and 2010 Tours de France , after his second comeback . ""
The last time I crossed that line was 2005 , "" he asserted .
Asked again if he had doped in those Tours , he replied : "" Absolutely not . ""
The fact that Armstrong would confess to doping was widely leaked , leaving the main question how he would position himself , how he would use the occasion to garner sympathy .
The strategy could be reduced to a handy acronym : FO .
Flaws and Oprah .
The f - word came up frequently : "" I am flawed , deeply flawed . ""
Suing people who had told the truth was "" a major flaw "" , and so on .
The use of the f - word was a tactical masterstroke , the subtext being that all the bad stuff was the outcome of how Armstrong is made .
He repeatedly accepted responsibility while keeping the subtext running strongly , simultaneously giving the impression that yes , he had done wrong but , well , it was the result of forces beyond his control .
He and his mother were fighters , he said , and the urge to fight had grown stronger after he defeated cancer .
And the O - word ?
There were moments when you realised the true virtue , from Armstrong 's viewpoint at least , of being interrogated by Oprah Winfrey rather than Travis Tygart , the head of Usada , or Jeff Novitzky , the FDA agent investigating the use of steroids in professional sports .
Time after time , Winfrey would raise a key issue , then fail to press him on it .
The interview would , she said early on , be all about the detail , but she seemed to shy away from that detail whenever it raised its ugly head .
Winfrey did press him on the question of his responsibility for his teammates doping , although she allowed him to build the case that if there was coercion it was implicit rather than overt .
But the assertion that the story of a covered - up positive in the 2001 Tour of Switzerland was untrue was accepted at face value ; the contradiction when Armstrong was asked about his donation to the International Cycling Union , the UCI ( he said it came after his retirement , but the sums are widely held to have been paid in 2001 and 2004 when he was still racing ) was not followed up .
With blatant ease , he dodged the question about the notorious hospital room incident , when he is claimed to have confessed to doctors that he used performance - enhancing drugs , something he has always denied .
As with those Tour wins , there was the odd jarring note , enough to remind you that the performance you were watching might not be what it was made out to be .
The joke that whatever he might have called Betsy Andreu , one of his main critics , at least he had not called her fat , had the finesse of a fingernail scraped down a blackboard ; the assertion that he could n't remember if he had sued Emma O'Reilly , another whistleblower , because he had sued so many people , would have been laughable but it was made with a straight face .
Another eye - opener was the claim that when accused of cheating , he looked in a dictionary to get a definition .
Most people have a good idea what the word means .
Much of the rest was more subtle .
He overtly avoided accusing any of his rivals of using drugs , so much so that , as was presumably the intention , the implication was rammed home that they were all on the same programme .
He asserted his love for his sport , offered to help clean it up , and issued just the right amount of apologies , not so many that it grated , but more than enough to be noticed .
He was attempting to make peace with those he had variously sued and insulted ( to her credit , it did n't sound as if Betsy Andreu was buying it ) .
Most insidiously of all , he made doping seem banal , like pumping up his tyres or making sure his bike had a water bottle in the cage , he said .
But the problem all through was one he outlined himself : what to believe from a man who has lied so comprehensively , so determinedly , for so long ?
As he put it , he is "" not the most believable guy in the world right now "" ."
2013-01-18,
2013-01-18,
2013-01-19,"After the confession , the lawsuits .
Lance Armstrong 's extended appearance on the Oprah Winfrey network , in which the man stripped of seven Tour de France wins finally admitted to doping , has opened him up to several multi - million dollar legal challenges .
According to reports , the US government may join a "" whistleblower "" lawsuit launched by Armstrong 's former colleague , Floyd Landis , on the grounds that Armstrong , while riding for the US Postal Service team , defrauded the American taxpayer .
The Sunday Times is set to try to claw back nearly Â£1 m in damages and costs that Armstrong was awarded after he sued it over allegations of doping .
A Texas - based sports marketing firm is also suing Armstrong to get back millions of dollars in bonuses it paid out to the cyclist .
Meanwhile , the International Cycling Union is urging Armstrong to pay back his prize money , and even Australian government officials are reportedly mulling over going to the courts to get back hefty fees paid for appearances in the country from 2009 to 2011 .
Finally , and perhaps most seriously , Armstrong 's confession has opened up the prospect that he might be prosecuted for perjury after previously testifying under oath that he had not taken drugs .
In seeking public rehabilitation , and a second chance to compete , it is possible that Armstrong has in fact dug himself into a deeper hole than he imagined .
His emotional mea culpa last week was an audacious move .
But the man who beat cancer and regularly â€ “ with illegal help
â€ “ triumphed over any rival on his bike seems to have failed to beat his toughest opponent : public opinion .
The hours of dialogue with Winfrey , which culminated in a choked - up moment on Friday night as he discussed the impact of his cheating on his family , appear to have failed to give Armstrong the redemption that he craves .
His confession , which many believe is aimed at reducing his ban from competitive sports and allowing him to take part in triathlons , has been greeted with dismay and criticism .
Few critics and fellow athletes who watched his display have extended the hand of sympathy . ""
Armstrong said he was sorry for all the years of lying , but he sounded like he was reading a shopping list , "" retorted Howard Kurtz , the media critic for cable news TV station CNN .
Indeed , part of the problem was that Armstrong was rowing back on so much previous behaviour and years of aggressive lambasting of reporters , officials and team - mates who had claimed he was doping .
"" I do n't forgive Lance Armstrong , who lied to me in two interviews .
And I suspect most of America wo n't , either , "" Kurtz wrote .
That was a common sentiment .
Many sports stars condemned the former hero , saying his actions â€ “ in both taking drugs and then denying it for so many years â€ “ had damaged the image of sports far beyond cycling .
"" I guess all I needed to see was the first few minutes [ of the interview ] and then I knew what was the deal , and the rest I do n't really care , "" tennis player Roger Federer told reporters at the Australian Open .
"" I 'm an active athlete right now , and it 's not fun times really to be in sports to a degree . ""
Anti - doping officials were equally unimpressed .
If Armstrong 's aim was to reduce his ban , then it appears to have failed . ""
He spoke to a talk - show host .
I do n't think any of it amounted to assistance to the anti - doping community , let alone substantial assistance .
You bundle it all up and say , ' So what ? ' , "" said David Howman , the director general of the World Anti - Doping Agency , in an interview with the New York Times .
On Friday night , Armstrong appeared more emotional in his talk with Winfrey than in the first interview .
Winfrey is renowned for being a virtual therapist to the public ordeals of disgraced celebrities , often bringing them to tears .
Armstrong , who throughout last week had appeared unnervingly controlled , did not shed a tear but he did appear to choke up .
"" I saw my son defending me and saying , "" That 's not true .
What you 're saying about my dad is not true .
That 's when I knew I had to tell him , "" Armstrong said .
The cyclist paused , lip trembling , and looked away as he composed himself .
But aside from that moment the rest of the interview went largely as expected , with Armstrong confessing to his sins â€ “ though by no means agreeing to all the accusations levelled against him â€ “ and showing perhaps unwise flashes of defiance and self - regard .
He told Winfrey he was desperate to compete again , effectively admitting he was not coming clean out of guilt but because he can not tolerate life outside of sports . ""
If you 're asking me , do I want to compete again ...
the answer is , hell , yes .
I 'm a competitor .
It 's what I 've done my whole life .
I love to train .
I love to race , "" he said .
He even said he deserved a second chance , perhaps breaking the cardinal rule of such TV confessions , which is to remain entirely contrite . ""
Frankly , this may not be the most popular answer , but I think I deserve it , "" he told Winfrey .
In choosing Winfrey , Armstrong dodged the news media that had been accusing him for years , trading Winfrey 's softball questions and avoiding an interrogator who would have grilled him properly .
Yet even in those circumstances Armstrong seemed to fail to come entirely clean .
He did not reveal why he chose to take the doping route , how he did it and who helped him do it and cover it up for so long .
He denied trying to buy influence with the anti - doping body USADA with an offer of a donation of millions of dollars .
He said he had stayed clean of drugs in his 2009 attempted comeback , something that runs counter to a damning USADA report that catalogued all the accusations against him .
Winfrey asked Armstrong if he might "" rise again "" in public life to reclaim some of his once golden boy reputation as the cancer - beating super athlete . ""
I do n't know .
I do n't know .
I do n't know what 's out there , "" Armstrong replied .
Whatever it is , it 's almost certainly not good .
Armstrong 's errors Did n't cry properly When high - profile guests appear on Oprah Winfrey 's show , they are expected to weep copiously as they reveal all .
Someone as competitive as Armstrong knows that second place counts for nothing : his choking up and near - tears just did not cut it .
America wanted rivers of tears .
Did n't give a full confession
The only way to do a confession is to go all the way .
Armstrong appeared to want to go only so far .
He needed to name names and give full and frank details .
But Armstrong seemed happy with generalities and still denies key allegations .
Did n't lose the ' attitude '
During the hours of interview , many commentators remarked on Armstrong 's controlled and emotionless demeanour .
Armstrong needed to show he was human and worthy of sympathy and â€ “ most importantly of all â€ “ genuine .
His performance came across as just that : something fake for the camera .
Played the victim Armstrong seemed to break another cardinal rule of such confessions in having too much self - pity .
At one point , he felt that he "" deserved "" a chance of a comeback .
He had failed to understand that in the world of TV confessions that is not up to you any more ."
2013-01-19,"BEST MOMENT Oprah 's yes - and - no round ensured the interview peaked after two minutes .
Clear potential for a new quickfire celebrity confessional format .
WORST
MOMENT Oprah teasing out this admission - "" I was a bully
â€
¦
I was a bully in the sense that you just â€
¦
I tried to control the narrative "" â€ “ then failing to spot Armstrong controlling the rest of the narrative .
He divided the session into show - and - tell : part one a display of wounded narcissism ; part two a direct admission : "" I 'm narcissistic . ""
KEY BATTLE Good Lance versus Bad Lance - an allâ€‘American hero tainted by an independent inner - doper .
Reacting to seeing a clip of his 2005 doping denial , Armstrong told Oprah : "" I do n't like that guy .
That is a guy who felt invincible â€ ¦ that guy is still there . ""
MOST REVEALING INSIGHT Armstrong 's "" sense of humour "" .
After repeatedly refusing to discuss his relationship with Betsy Andreu - the wife of team - mate Frankie Andreu who overheard him discussing doping , and who he tried to ruin .
He shared a phone conversation they had , which he found funny .
"" I said , ' Listen , I called you crazy .
I called you a bitch
, I called you all these things , but I never called you fat . '
Because she thought I said , ' You were a fat crazy bitch ' .
And I said , ' Betsy , I never said you were fat . ' ""
WORST APPEAL FOR SYMPATHY ""
I 've lost all future income .
You could look at that day and a half when people [ sponsors ] left .
That was a $ 75 m day .
Gone .
Gone .
And probably never coming back . ""
THE INEVITABLE NEXT STEP
Paramount Pictures confirmed plans for a biopic , based on New York Times reporter Juliet Macur 's upcoming book "" Cycle of Lies :
The Fall of Lance Armstrong . ""
US reports said : "" No director , writer , star or start date have yet been set . ""
VIEWER VERDICTS With hashtags # Doprah , # LiveWrong and # LieStrong doing well , @WickChris offered : "" Lance Armstrong sends a powerful message to the kids of America : do n't do drugs and cheat unless you want to be rich and go on Oprah . ""
@MensHumor went with "" Remember in "" Dodgeball "" when Armstrong gives a speech to Vince Vaughn ?
If I knew he was lying , I would 've rooted for Globo Gym to win . ""
But @d_whitehouse came up with the most retweeted gag : "" Lance Armstrong should be applauded for being able to ride a bike so well on drugs .
I tried it once .
Hit a dog and fell into the canal . """
2013-01-19,"There was an elephant in the Four Seasons hotel room throughout the two hours in which Lance Armstrong 's eyes swivelled downwards , upwards and sideways in the second episode of his ordeal under the Oprah spotlight .
The elephant was this : what narrative would cycling 's greatest liar and cheat produce ?
How would the process of concession â€ “ look at the lack of revelation on night one and substitute this for "" confession "" â€ “ fit into the story he would want us to believe ?
For those who may wonder why Armstrong took the risk of appearing on Winfrey 's show , the tale he wished to tell may hold the key .
The elephant broke cover a few minutes before the end of the second episode .
If part one of the Lance and Oprah show could loosely be termed What and When ( certainly not How ) , part two was How It Felt .
The ground was prepared with the subtlety of an emoting rotovator : how Armstrong felt when telling his son Luke he was a liar and a cheat
( not good â€
“ Armstrong looked close to tears ) ; how Luke had had to defend his father 's name at school ( at which point the stomach did leap , because how could it not ? ) ; how Lance 's mom , Linda , took it ( she was a wreck , but it took a call from her partner to alert her son ) .
How about the trauma of losing $ 75 m in sponsorship in a day , and perhaps struggling to make more in future ?
That lost a little impact if you wondered how much of his ill - gotten gains from the doping years remain in his bank account , and cursed that Oprah was charitable enough not to ask him .
He is in therapy , he confirmed , going through "" a dark time "" .
Having established How It Felt , Oprah teed up the big moment by asking : "" Will you rise again ? ""
Unintentional it may have been , but the vision it conjured up , momentarily , was that of Voldemort emerging out of the cauldron in Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire .
The elephant sprinted out into the foyer of the Four Seasons when Oprah changed her questioning tone .
From soccer mom reproving a child who had mislaid his lunchbox
she , very briefly , became Torquemada dealing with a mentally deficient suspect .
"" Did - this - help - you - become - a - better - human - being ? ""
she intoned , the enunciation of every syllable at half - speed making it clear that this was THE CLIMAX . ""
Without a doubt , "" Armstrong said , twice , and then the narrative emerged . ""
This has happened twice in my life .
When I was diagnosed [ with cancer ] I was a better human being .
I lost my way .
This is the second time .
I ca n't lose my way again .
I 'm in no position to make promises â€ ¦ the biggest challenge for the rest of my life is not to slip up again . ""
He added a few seconds later : "" It 's an epic challenge . ""
In other words , the story Armstrong wants the world to read when he tells the tale of his doping is the second coming of Big Tex the comeback hero .
In this narrative , the dope scandal is the equivalent of a second cancer .
His way back into hearts and minds after the fall , from the hell of losing his seven Tour de France titles , the terrible whirlwind that has engulfed him and his family , will be a second great comeback .
Utterly nauseating it may be , profoundly offensive to anyone who has had cancer or knows anyone who has , but that is it .
"" It 's an epic story , "" breathed Winfrey .
In the sense that it features the hero 's descent into the underworld , perhaps the Armstrong story could be termed an epic .
But any purgatory the disgraced cyclist is living in is of his own making .
The distancing mechanisms he used with Winfrey are intended to create the opposite impression : that Armstrong resembles Icarus , who aimed too high thanks to his soaring ambition , and was felled by superior forces outside his control .
Defrauding sponsors of millions , perpetrating the biggest robbery in sporting history , crushing minnows such as Christophe Bassons and Filippo Simeoni , bullying and intimidating witnesses , more than a decade of lies , some under oath , became a "" slip - up "" , a euphemism comparable to the "" flaws "" in his character he had revealed the previous evening .
He rammed home the point : "" I had it , it got too big , things got too crazy . ""
If he had cheated his way to seven Tours , the blame could be placed on "" it "" or perhaps the "" things "" .
Armstrong 's wider agenda became clear as well .
There was an obvious bid for a lower sanction â€ “ or at least an attempt to lodge in the public mind that he is being unfairly treated â€ “ when he referred to his life ban as a "" death sentence "" and said he was not saying it was unfair , an outstanding piece of doublespeak .
There were few moments in the entire pantomime when he appeared to be genuine , and one was when he said he would "" love the opportunity to compete "" and would like to be running the Chicago Marathon at the age of 50 .
The first volume of Armstrong 's memoirs , It 's Not
About the Bike
, tugged heartstrings worldwide and became a must - read for cancer sufferers and their families .
The follow - up , Every Second Counts , was more self - serving .
The plotline for the third volume laid out in those few minutes under Winfrey 's prompting can be summed up as : How I Returned From The Doping Hell
That Was n't My Fault .
The title would need to express the utter selfishness of the man and his utter detachment from the reality of what he did in his doping years .
One quote he gave Winfrey when asked about the prospect of competing again might work : ""
I think I deserve it .
""
As a summary of why cheats dope , lie and bully , that would suffice ."

2013-01-20,"The fall - out from Lance Armstrong 's interviews with Oprah Winfrey continued on Sunday after it was revealed that SCA Promotions plans to file a lawsuit against the disgraced cyclist for $ 12 m ( Â£7.5 m ) .
The Texas company insured performance bonuses to Armstrong for his victories in the Tour de France in 2002 , 2003 and 2004 .
However , Armstrong admitted in his interview with Winfrey that he used performance - enhancing drugs , including testosterone and EPO as well as blood transfusions , for all of his seven Tour victories .
A statement released by SCA said that , even though they are happy about Armstrong 's confession , they still intend to pursue their legal options for the money that was paid to him "" under fraudulent circumstances "" .
The statement said : "" While SCA is pleased that Mr Armstrong has finally come clean about his use of performance - enhancing drugs and shown the world that SCA was right all along , the fact remains that SCA suffered substantial damage as a result of Mr Armstrong misleading the world about his use of banned substances . ""
Therefore we will continue to pursue our legal options for the return of the prize amounts that were paid to Mr Armstrong under fraudulent circumstances . ""
Speaking to BBC 5 Live 's BeSpoke programme , a lawyer for SCA Promotions , Jeff Tillotson , said that a lawsuit could be filed as soon as next week : "" We will likely file that lawsuit as soon as next week unless we get a satisfactory response from Armstrong 's camp .
As you can imagine , we paid him $ 12 m for being the official winner of three Tour de France races and swearing under oath he was a clean rider during those races . ""
He 's now told us , at least though Oprah , that he lied when he told us he was a clean rider .
He doped during all those races and Usada and UCI have stripped him of his official title status .
So under those circumstances my client naturally wants his money back .

2013-01-20,"What was the old , cancer - surviving , rival - bashing Lance Armstrong like ?
He was , he revealed to Oprah Winfrey last week , "" a guy who expected to get whatever he wanted and control every outcome "" .
But here was the problem : that old Lance Armstrong bore more than a passing resemblance to the new , flawed , semi - contrite one .
By choosing the medium of the TV confessional , Armstrong believed he could manipulate the discussion once again .
His failure to recognise quite how deep a hole he 's in is hubris on an epic scale .
It is hard to think of anyone in public life who has lied as Armstrong has .
Everything about his cycling career has been built on a persistently restated deception : I did not take performance - enhancing drugs .
He became a really world - class liar and there is evidence that even now he is finding the habit a hard one to give up .
His claim that he never doped after 2005 is strongly contested by the United States Anti - Doping Agency .
There are numerous other unanswered questions from the Oprah interview that need to be addressed now by legal and anti - doping authorities .
Armstrong was right on one point : he may have been a kingpin , but he is only one guy .
It 's worth remembering just how ingrained drug use is in professional cycling .
In the very first races , in the late 19th century , riders took morphine , cocaine , even bull 's blood and the crushed testicles of wild animals .
There has never been an era that has not been tainted by doping .
All of which should give us hope â€ “ and caution â€ “ for the future of the sport .
Armstrong hogged the headlines last week , but on Thursday there was a cheerier announcement when the routes for three British stages of the 2014 Tour de France were revealed .
Millions of Britons will turn out to watch .
Will they be able to believe what they are watching ?
A full , explicit confession from Armstrong is essential for everyone to move on .
Cycling may be the boom sport of the new century , but the people who love it do n't have infinite patience ."
2013-01-21,"The story of shamed cyclist Lance Armstrong , who cheated his way to seven Tour de France titles , is heading to the big screen .
Star Trek director JJ Abrams has optioned the forthcoming book Cycle of Lies : The Fall of Lance Armstrong by New York Times reporter Juliet Macur with the intention of turning it into a high - profile film , reports Deadline .
The proposed movie is the first to be announced since Armstrong admitted that an extensive programme of blood doping and steroid use played a part in all seven of his consecutive Tour de France victories during an interview with Oprah Winfrey last week .
Macur has covered Armstrong 's career for more than a decade , through his return to cycling after battling potentially fatal cancer in 1998 , the championship - winning years of 1999 to 2005 , the allegations of cheating that dogged him throughout the latter stages of his career and his comeback in 2009 .
The Armstrong biopic is in the very early stages of production but will be put together by studio Paramount and Abrams 's production company Bad Robot .
It is not yet clear whether Abrams will direct and there are no casting details .
Rival studio Sony once had a biopic of Armstrong in the works with the cyclist 's friend Jake Gyllenhaal in the lead , but that was prior to its subject 's high - profile confession .
Presenting Armstrong as a heroic figure who battled his way to the top of his sport after surviving cancer , the biopic is now highly unlikely to see the light of day in its original form ."
2013-01-21,"The sign put up in a Sydney library suggesting it had reclassified Lance Armstrong 's two autobiographies as fiction has , disappointingly , turned out to be a prank .
But it ca n't be long before some reader â€ “ or publisher for that matter
â€ “ joins the queue of those wanting to sue Armstrong for breach of contract .
Or can it ?
Most autobiographies of well - known people tend to be a little "" economical with the actualitÃ © "" , as the politician and diarist Alan Clark once described his answers to parliamentary questions about export licences to Iraq during the Matrix Churchill trial .
The desire to spin events in the most favourable way and to conveniently forget minor details , such as extra - marital affairs , can be overwhelming .
But does omission necessarily turn a work of non - fiction into fiction ?
Or does all non - fiction occupy a morally dubious hinterland where what 's written is n't necessarily all true or untrue ?
Clearly , Armstrong played rather more freely with versions of the truth than most , but he could possibly argue that he was still operating within accepted limits .
After all , if Armstrong is to be found guilty of misrepresentation of genre , then perhaps some novelists ought to be feeling a little anxious about their fiction .
Edward St Aubyn 's Patrick Melrose series is closer to autobiography than any thing that Armstrong has ever written .
As are Melvyn Bragg 's seemingly interminable quartet of novels about a brilliant , working - class young man with an equally brilliant head of hair , who was forced to leave the small town of Wigtown in Cumbria , where horses and carts clip - clopped outside his privy , to fulfil his potential as one of the greatest broadcasters of his age ."
2013-01-21,"Lance Armstrong 's life is to be dramatised on the big screen .

2013-01-21,"Lance Armstrong 's doping admission to Oprah was a public relations nightmare in the making .
While we can all agree that Lance would have been better - off not cheating at all ( or at least confessing sooner ) , it 's fairly clear that once he cheated and lied , he probably should have kept lying if he wanted to maintain his public standing .
Yes , Lance 's favorability took a hit with the American public in the past year , but â€ “ even after the Usada report revelations in October 2012
â€ “ this drop in public approval was stabilizing prior to Oprah .
His net favorable rating ( + favorable minus â€“unfavorable ) dropped 75pt , as doping rumors became louder and louder , from + 76pt , in 2005 , to + 1pt , in October 2012 .
Yet , by early January 2013 , only 37 % of American sports fans believed he should not get credit for his career accomplishments â€ “ including his seven Tour de France victories ( sic ) .
This compares with October 2012 , when 49 % thought Armstrong should give his medals back .
Before Oprah , in other words , Lance had more Americans with him than against him .
And there was little sign that this would have changed , had he kept up the charade .
The first public polling on Lance seems to show that all his support is gone .
After the Oprah interview aired , only 21 % of Americans polled thought that he could now restore his reputation .
This scientific poll conducted with Tampa Bay area residents by SurveyUSA demonstrated no gender , race , or real age gap .
Polls done in the Portland and San Diego metropolitan areas produced the same findings .
Lance 's confession succeeded in alienating everybody .
Only 17 % in the SurveyUSA survey thought that Lance was being completely honest with Oprah .
Those who thought he was a liar beforehand continue to think so now .
Those who defended Lance for years , like ESPN 's Rick Reilly , now just feel they were duped .
This is the political equivalent of having your own base turn against you .
This series of events matches the research on athletes who admit to steroid use in US sports , which indicates that it 's better just to keep denying : MM Haigh found that baseball players who apologized to their fans were no more likely to receive positive news coverage than those who did not .
Jessica Korn studied polling data ( pdf ) and discovered that admission and apology actually resulted in decreased favorability , while denial was a more successful PR strategy .
That 's why Lance 's interview was a mistake .
Had he just continued lying , history says that he still would have been able to convince many people , perhaps even the majority , that he was telling the truth .
Armstrong , after all , was the person who had come back from cancer to "" win "" the Tour de France ; the man who used his legacy to start the Livestrong charity foundation .
Public skepticism about whether Armstrong is even capable of candor will also hurt him if he tries to get back into competitive cycling and triathlon ( even assuming he succeeds in getting his lifetime ban reduced ) .
Anti - doping officials claim he cheated during his comeback in 2009 and 2010 , while Lance told Oprah otherwise .
Lacking almost all credibility , Armstrong is not in a good position to negotiate over that ban .
The only silver lining for Lance is that if he and cycling officials ever agree on terms for his return to competition , the public will be with them : 52 % think that , at least at some point , he should be allowed to ride again .
The problem for Armstrong is that 45 % think he should never get a chance ; an additional 26 % that he should at least have to wait a few years .
In all , a clear majority , 71 % , considers that his punishment should stand for some time yet .
Whatever Armstrong 's strategic goal â€ “ to return to competition or just to begin a process of rehabilitation that makes him less toxic as a public figure â€ “ the trade - off would only be worth it if Armstrong 's favorability could recover .
But this stain on his favorability is likely permanent : 63 % of Americans say it 's unlikely Armstrong will be able to restore his reputation .
The numbers say that Armstrong has painted himself into a corner by confessing : the problem for this fallen American icon is that few , if any , now even believe in his apologies ."

2013-01-23,"The former president of world cycling 's governing body Hein Verbruggen has admitted that for years it warned Lance Armstrong and other riders when they came close to testing positive for performance - enhancing drugs .
Verbruggen , who is still an honorary president of the UCI , and his successor , Pat McQuaid , have come under increasing pressure since Armstrong was stripped of his seven Tour de France victories and admitted doping throughout each of them .
In an interview with the Dutch magazine Vrij Nederland published on Wednesday , Verbruggen said dozens of top riders and team managers were invited to the UCI 's headquarters in Aigle "" one by one "" , where the UCI 's chief doctor Mario Zorzoli gave them presentations on its anti - doping strategy and information about suspect values .
Other riders were called with the information , either by Zorzoli or by Lon Schattenberg , a Dutch member of the UCI anti - doping commission .
Verbruggen said this was part of a conscious strategy to try to reduce doping .
"" You might convince them not to use doping any more or you might not , "" he said in the interview .
Michael Ashenden , the Australian anti - doping expert instrumental in developing the biological passport for the UCI between 2008 and 2012 before he resigned claiming he was being gagged , said he was not aware of any other international federation pursuing a similar strategy .
Verbruggen justified his defence of Armstrong during his tenure as president between 1991 and 2005 despite the fact the UCI warned him in 2001 about his red blood cell values being suspect .
"" It was hard for me to the extent that you know more than you can say .
You have questions but you ca n't express it publicly , "" he said .
Before a test was developed for EPO , Verbruggen oversaw the introduction of a controversial rule that simply required any rider with a hematocrit ( red blood cell count ) reading of over 50 to be suspended from the sport for 15 days .
The former UCI president also confirmed in the interview that Thomas Weisel Partners managed some of his assets between 2001 and 2004 .
Weisel was the co - owner of Armstrong 's US Postal team and a key business partner of the Texan .
Verbruggen said he did not know that was the case but added : "" Even if I had known , I would n't have thought twice about it . '
In an interview with another Dutch magazine last week , Verbruggen insisted the UCI did not bear any responsibility for Armstrong 's cheating .
"" If you test someone 215 times and he is always negative , then the problem is in the test itself , "" he told De Muur .
"" I 'm not responsible .
I do n't understand the whole fuss at all . ""
An independent commission set up by the UCI to look into claims that the governing body covered up a positive drugs test in 2001 in return for $ 125,000 in donations from Armstrong , which the UCI strongly denies , holds its first meeting on Friday .
Armstrong said the allegations were not true in his Oprah Winfrey interview .
The World Anti - Doping Agency and the United States Anti - Doping Agency have refused to co - operate with the commission due to concerns over its inability to set its own terms of reference and the tight timeframe imposed by the UCI .
The commission itself is insisting on a truth and reconciliation element to its work , which the UCI is resisting .
Brian Cookson , the president of British Cycling , has distanced himself from speculation that he could be a possible contender to replace McQuaid if he was forced to resign .
"" I am fully supportive of UCI president Pat McQuaid who since his election in 2005 has done an impressive job in frequently difficult circumstances , "" he said .
"" Any speculation at this difficult time is particularly unhelpful , and I think it is absolutely vital for the future of our sport that we all remain united . """
2013-01-23,"Remember when communities named stadiums after human beings , not corporate sponsors ?
The history of stadium naming rights is as messy as the actual business side of it .
Some claim it started with Fenway Park in 1912 ; others point to Wrigley Field in 1926 .
Regardless , sometime after the second world war , sports "" franchises "" started to prod local communities for stadium funds , refuse to commit long - term and then profit from selling the public / private stadium 's name .
In 2011 , Sporting Kansas City opened a soccer - specific stadium .
Afterwards , they named it Livestrong Sporting Park .
It was a decision they would soon regret .
First , some background .
As any fan of college basketball ( or any Civil War buff ) knows , a bit of rivalry exists between the states of Kansas and Missouri .
Sporting KC originally planned to build a new stadium in Missouri , but then the financial crisis hit .
The developer asked for more financing from Kansas City , Missouri , the city declined , and the developer brokered a deal with Wyandotte County and the state of Kansas .
Seen in the worst light , some might think that Sporting KC played state and local communities like a fiddle , to get a sweeter deal .
However , Sporting KC committed to the Wyandotte construction before the bonds were approved and even had construction equipment on the site before the vote .
In the best light , Sporting KC 's owners were desperate to get a large stadium project done during a recession .
In March 2011 , Sporting KC brokered a naming - rights deal with the Livestrong Foundation , a nonprofit that supports cancer research .
Livestrong was then closely tied to Lance Armstrong , a world famous cyclist who won seven Tour de France titles after recovering from cancer .
Granted , there were clouds on the horizon
â€
“ Armstrong was dogged by rumours of doping .
Still , this was n't a stadium named after an insider - trading bank , and even cynics like me could n't object to a link with an anti - cancer foundation .
A year later , the US Anti - Doping Agency launched an investigation , accusing Armstrong of doping .
He did not contest it , and Wada stripped him of all his titles .
Sponsors dropped him â€ “ but Sporting KC stood by their link with Livestrong .
Then , on Oprah 's couch last week , Armstrong confessed to doping .
However , the confession came after years of lawsuits and public denials and counter - accusations .
Can he be forgiven ?
Should he ?
Sporting KC 's Livestrong Stadium dilemma harked back to the old days of stadiums .
Yes , the KC stadium was named after a foundation , but everybody associated that foundation with Lance Armstrong , the cancer survivor and champion athlete .
Now , only one of those titles was true .
Sporting KC and Livestrong issued press releases .
Sporting KC said "" trust "" had been "" permanently damaged "" ; Livestrong said Sporting had only paid $ 250,000 of $ 1 m it owed .
And that 's where things got even stickier .
Owed ?
Correct me if I 'm wrong , but do n't teams sell stadium naming rights to garner profit , not increase liabilities ?
Not in this case .
As part of the deal , Sporting KC had promised to donate a portion of their revenues to the foundation â€ “ no less than $ 7.5 m over six years .
Wyandotte County bondholders rest assured ...
your investment was actually paying somebody to buy naming rights on a stadium .
Just as you envisioned .
On the plus side , this odd arrangement has now come to an end .
Even better , the stadium will be named Sporting Park .
A stadium named after its professional team ?
In the United States ?
In the same town as the tenant - less Sprint Center ?
Yessir .
At least for now .
In a few years , Sporting may change their name to the Wiz , the Wizards or maybe even the Spurs .
Until then , bask in the exception : Sporting KC have a lovely stadium with none of the corporate hangover .

2013-01-23,"The under - pressure former president of cycling 's international governing body has defended its doping policy during the Lance Armstrong era , after admitting that it regularly informed riders about suspicious test results .
Hein Verbruggen , who was head of the UCI between 1991 and 2005 and remains its honorary president , told the Dutch magazine Vrij Nederland that it had informed dozens of riders including Armstrong over a period of years if they had recorded suspicious test results .
"" It used to be the UCI 's policy â€ “ and indeed also of other federations â€ “ to discuss atypical blood test results , or other test results , with the riders concerned , "" said Verbruggen on Wednesday in an attempt to justify the policy .
"" Riders who were doping [ but who had yet to fail a test ] were effectively warned that they were being watched and that they would be targeted in future with the aim of getting them to stop doping , "" he said .
"" However , if the atypical test results were genuinely not caused by doping , the rider also had the opportunity to have a medical check . ""
Armstrong 's suspicious test at the 2001 Tour of Switzerland led the UCI to set up a meeting with a laboratory director to explain how the test worked .
The UCI has vehemently denied that donations totalling $ 125,000 that were received in 2002 and 2007 from Armstrong 's camp were in any way linked to covering up a failed test at the 2001 Tour of Switzerland .
The policy of telling riders about suspect tests was formed "" after some considerable debate and deliberation "" , said Verbruggen .
"" Its purpose was to protect clean riders against competitors who might be doping , rather than to let those clean riders continue to be put at a disadvantage until such time that the drug cheats could be caught .
It was intended to be a two - pronged attack on doping : prevention both by dissuasion and repression . ""
This week the French newspaper Le Monde published a doping control document relating to Armstrong 's positive test for a corticosteroid during his first Tour win in 1999 .
Armstrong , who has been stripped of his seven Tour titles and banned from elite sport for life , admitted to Oprah Winfrey last week that he used a back - dated prescription to avoid sanctions for doping .
However , Le Monde 's evidence suggested the UCI should have disqualified Armstrong anyway for breaching its rules requiring declarations of therapeutic use of substances ."

2013-01-24,"Two California men have sued Lance Armstrong and his publishers for fraud and false advertising , claiming that the cyclist 's best - selling memoirs , which are billed as non - fiction , were revealed to be filled with lies when he confessed last week to systematic doping .
The class - action complaint was filed in federal court in Sacramento , California on Tuesday , five days after Armstrong ended years of vehement denial and admitted in a televised interview with Oprah Winfrey that he had cheated his way to a record seven Tour de France titles through the use of banned , performance - enhancing drugs .

2013-01-24,"These are febrile days at the International Cycling Union , which has been lurching from crisis to crisis since the US Anti Doping Agency ( Usada ) published its Reasoned Decision into Lance Armstrong 's doping case .
The UCI 's independent commission into the Armstrong affair has its first session on Friday , an extraordinary meeting in which it is to decide whether to include a process of truth and reconciliation during its inquiry .
That sounds relatively innocuous , but it could prove a tipping point .
The World Anti Doping Agency ( Wada ) and Usada have called for such a process â€ “ stating that they will not participate in the commission 's work if it does not happen â€ “ but the UCI has opposed it , on the ground that the commission 's remit does not reach that far .
It is hard to see the commission members backtracking over truth and reconciliation , and that would leave the UCI in a cleft stick : it can not suspend the commission , and it will suffer a major loss of face .
"" I ca n't see how the UCI can even let it get to a public hearing after the commission has made their position so clear and Lance Armstrong has said he would be the first through the door if there was a truth and reconciliation commission , "" said Jaimie Fuller , the Australian businessman behind the Change Cycling Now pressure group .
"" Politically their position is untenable if they fight that . ""
The Guardian understands that negotiation has been going on this week around the issue , which could explain why the commission put back the date for the meeting from Tuesday .
All bets are currently off , with speculation that either the former president Hein Verbruggen or his successor , Pat McQuaid , may resign .
The British Cycling representative on the UCI 's management committee , Brian Cookson , has been touted as a possible replacement for McQuaid , but Cookson was quick this week to make it clear that he is supportive of the Irishman , and that he wishes the governing body to remain united .
Most worryingly for the UCI , its old enemy Dick Pound resurfaced to hint that cycling might be "" rested "" from the Olympic Games if the governing body did not shape up .
Pound has a lengthy history of dispute with the UCI , Verbruggen and McQuaid , since his days at Wada , when they fell out bitterly over the handling of an early Armstrong scandal : the alleged discovery of EPO in samples from the 1999 Tour de France , when tested retroactively .
The ICU commissioned a report from a Dutch specialist , Emile Vrijman , who said the findings were unclear and did not amount to an anti - doping infraction .
The report was lambasted by Wada , and the UCI subsequently sued Pound over his comments about the UCI and doping .
A legal settlement was reached in December 2009 .
Being beleaguered has been the UCI 's default position since Verbruggen created the organisation in 1991 .
It has faced constant criticism over the years for decisions as varied as the angle of the saddle on professional cyclists ' bikes and the position of women 's racing in the sport .
It is an organisation that is constantly on the defensive , the more so because it is opaque in its proceedings , with constant questions over its accountability .
It was criticised in Usada 's Reasoned Decision over its unwillingness to recognise the US agency 's jurisdiction over Armstrong , it was forced to drop a libel suit against the Irish anti - doping campaigner Paul Kimmage , who sued the UCI in return , and questions have been raised over the allegation made by Floyd Landis that it covered up a positive test for Armstrong in the 2001 Tour of Switzerland , which it denies .
The allegations were all the more acute because in 2002 and 2005 the body received donations of $ 125,000 ( Â£79,000 ) from Armstrong .
In his interview with Oprah Winfrey , the American stated that the two things were not connected , but said the UCI had solicited the donation .
Wada 's director general , David Howman , however , said Armstrong 's financial donation to UCI was inappropriate and the matter needed to be clarified .
Verbruggen has been forced to break cover .
He has admitted some of his financial affairs were handled by the a firm run by Thom Weisl , who was at the head of Armstrong 's US Postal Service team , although he said there had been no wrongdoing ; and he was forced to explain the UCI 's policy of holding meetings over anti - doping with individual cyclists who presented suspicious values in blood tests .
The meetings with cyclists on the "" red list "" were explained at the time to be a deterrent , something Verbruggen repeated this week .
While the departure of the UCI 's head of communications , Enrico Carpani , this week looked like a simple career choice â€ “ given the current shenanigans , the calmer waters of Swiss television must look attractive â€ “ a little more could be read into the fact that McQuaid was replaced on a key IOC commission evaluating bids for the 2020 Games .
McQuaid stated he was "" too busy "" to do the job , but at best it pointed to cycling becoming more isolated from the wider Olympic movement as it seeks to regain its lost credibility . ""
The truth will set you free , "" said Oprah Winfrey as she closed her interview with Armstrong , but the question now is precisely what the search for the truth about cycling will unleash ."

2013-01-25,"Cycling 's beleaguered governing body has promised to hold a truth and reconciliation process in the wake of the Lance Armstrong affair but was accused by its own independent commission of agreeing to it only in order to kick scrutiny of its own failings "" into the long grass "" .
The independent commission , set up last year after the United States Anti - Doping Agency banned Armstrong for life and stripped him of his seven Tour de France titles amid claims of complicity by the governing body , said it had not received a single document from the UCI .
The Usada report contained allegations from former riders that a positive test from Armstrong at the 2001 Tour of Switzerland had been covered up by the UCI in return for $ 125,000 in donations made by the Texan in 2002 and 2005 .
The UCI admits receiving the donations and acknowledges that Armstrong was warned of a "" suspect "" test result but denies there was any link .
At a procedural hearing in London Guy Morpuss QC , the commission 's counsel , said that it had come up against a "" code of silence "" in trying to gather documents and witness statements and that it would be unable to gather evidence without an amnesty for those who confess .
"" It just amazes me that we have had absolutely no documents whatsoever , "" said the former Paralympian Baroness Tanni Grey‑Thompson .
The UCI said the commission should be disbanded immediately , arguing that now it had decided on a wide - ranging truth and reconciliation process in conjunction with Wada , its work should be subsumed into that to avoid duplication of resources .
"" We 're not the bad guys here .
We have a finite amount of money .
We are not like the football body with a limitless amount of money , "" said the UCI counsel , Ian Mill QC .
Pat McQuaid , who has been UCI president since 2005 and is up for re - election in September , said that any amnesty process would include current and former riders .
Armstrong has said he would be "" first through the door "" of any such process . ""
We have decided that the ' truth and reconciliation ' process is the best way that we can examine the culture of doping in cycling in the past and can clear the air so that cycling can move forward , "" said McQuaid .
He would not be drawn on how long it might take to set up , saying the terms would have to be agreed with Wada , which would have to change its code and part - fund the process .
He said he would speak to the Wada director general , David Howman , over the weekend and submit a proposal on Monday .
The commission chair , Sir Philip Otton , said agreement with Wada was still some way off and adjourned the hearing until Thursday .
In the meantime the commission will examine 16 lever arch files of evidence that the UCI has now agreed to hand over .
Amid some tempestuous exchanges , and after Otton had accused the UCI of attempting to kick the allegations against them "" into the long grass "" , Mill told the three - person commission : "" We 're not trying to kill this inquiry , we set you up . ""
"" Now you want to knock us down , "" replied Otton , before withdrawing the comment .
Otton said it was "" blindingly obvious "" that there was immense public interest in determining why and how Armstrong 's US Postal Service team was able to engage in systematic doping without detection or sanction .
Otton drew a distinction between the allegations contained in the Usada report and the wider truth and reconciliation commission that the UCI has now agreed to in the face of pressure from Wada and Usada .
"" We have always thought truth and reconciliation and an amnesty was in the best interests of cycling , "" he said .
"" We have gone on public record as saying that .
But the Usada criticisms in their recent report are an entirely different and separate issue altogether .
That is why this commission was set up by the UCI at their expense and to their timetable . """
2013-01-25,"Victoria Azarenka probably has as many friends in Melbourne this weekend as Lance Armstrong has kept in the past week
but she is here to win the Australian Open , not a popularity contest .
No matter how poor were her judgment and manners in the semi - final against Sloane Stephens , she is in the mood to deliver .
Whether her allegedly bruised body has healed we will discover in the final against Li Na on Saturday .
Azarenka is not quite as angry as she was in an interview 18 months ago when , responding to criticism for another act of gamesmanship , she said : "" Screw them , I am what I am . ""
But neither is she a shattered shell .
She has survived what was a mugging of a kid , in the tennis sense , by stretching the rules to the limit with a nine - minute medical timeout after being broken when serving for the match .
She came back apparently no longer feeling like she was "" going to have a heart attack "" because of a blocked rib .
Stephens had been lulled and Azarenka got the win .
Trying to hustle the 19-year - old American out of her first grand slam semi - final might well have had its origins in genuine stress but the timing was nakedly opportunistic .
Stephens 's coach , David Nainkin , called it "" cheating within the rules "" and , "" unsportsmanlike "" .
Azarenka has tried to clear the air but does not admit culpability . ""
All I can do is try to give my best .
What I can control is come to you guys and tell my side of the story .
I ca n't control what you will write or what people will think , because that is out of my hands .
"" I 'm here sitting honestly , it 's what I wanted to do , to clear the air .
I can see [ it through ] the public eye
, I can see [ it through ] the journalist 's eye
but I know my own thing –
that is why I 'm here to explain , to drop it and to be open .
I hope we can move on for the final .
"" It 's not going to cause any problems because it was not intentional .
I think [ Stephens ] did n't take it personal , and that is great for her .
I think she is terrific girl [
they share the same agent ] .
I 'm going to send a message just to make sure that we are OK
but I know we are fine
and that is it . ""
So that train would appear to have left town .
The final , meanwhile , presents the defending champion ( whose problematic ribs are healing , apparently ) with a tougher and more seasoned adversary in Li , who thrilled Melbourne when she reached the final here two years ago to inspire hope that China would react deliriously to the arrival of a standard bearer with hope of winning a grand slam .
Not quite .
She broke through definitively in Paris and we await the next wave of players from China with keen anticipation .
Li would not be drawn into criticising Azarenka .
"" I 'm not her , "" she said , "" so I did n't know the truth .
I mean , also I was n't on the court to see , so I could n't say anything . ""
In a quick and wholly unscientific trawl of opinion beyond the locker room , as the throng filled Melbourne Park on a cooler but not unpleasant day , it was obvious sentiment will not be with the Belarusian .
Li is their darling , anyway , a quirky and talented individual whose tennis is grounded in hard work and growing belief .
"" Got ta be the Chinese girl , mate , "" said one spectator .
"" Azarenka totally got it wrong . ""
But she may totally get it right on the court .
While she has betrayed vulnerability here in the past – succumbing to the heat and being carried from the court on a stretcher – on her day , she is capable of the most rugged and nagging tennis .
Her strength is in her muscle but her tennis brain is acute too .
The suspicion is that the controversy has galvanised her .
She holds their title but not – for the moment – the affection of Australians .
So she must show them that the real Azarenka is a champion not a cheat .
She has already secured the world No1 ranking , so her self - esteem will be intact and victory would put her alongside Serena and Venus Williams , Maria Sharapova and Svetlana Kuznetsova as the only active players with two or more grand slam titles .
Those numbers and the title matter more to her than opprobrium that will be forgotten soon enough ."
2013-01-27,"The head of the World Anti - Doping Agency has called on Spanish authorities to ensure the names of athletes across all sports linked to the 2006 Operation Puerto doping scandal are revealed , as notorious doctor Eufemiano Fuentes and five others involved finally take the stand in Madrid .
In the wake of the Lance Armstrong affair and the light it shone on the dark heart of cycling 's professional peloton , other sports could be implicated in similar practices and the use of the range of substances now familiar to all those who followed the Texan 's fall from grace .
Seven years after dramatic raids on laboratories , offices and apartments in Madrid , Zaragoza and El Escorial brought forward , in the words of Armstrong 's former team - mate Tyler Hamilton , a "" treasure trove "" of evidence that "" astonished the world "" , the case will reach court on Monday .
The Puerto case implicated more than 50 cyclists including Alberto Contador , Ivan Basso , Jan Ullrich and Alejandro Valverde in the use of performance - enhancing substances or practices .
Valverde is the only Spanish rider who has been punished based on Puerto evidence – he was banned for two years in 2010 .
The German cyclist Ullrich chose retirement in the face of the police discoveries and Italian cyclist Basso 's implication led to a two - year ban .
But it has long been claimed that among the blood bags seized by Spanish police , destined to be injected back into athletes from whom it had been removed in order to boost their red blood cell count , there were some relating to athletes in other sports including football and tennis .
Bags were labelled with codes , some based on nicknames and others the names of riders ' dogs .
Basso was Birillo , Jörg Jaksche of Germany was Bella .
Even now the police say they have been unable to determine who all the nicknames relate to .
Fuentes used a series of codewords for his clandestine network of doping activities : he would refer to meetings for a transfusion as "" meeting for coffee "" , the bags of blood were called "" orange juice "" and the freezer where they were stored was dubbed "" Siberia "" .
In 2008 the UCI president Pat McQuaid said after a meeting with the police and the then Spanish sports minister that he had been told Fuentes also had clients from "" football , athletics , swimming and tennis "" .
Jesús Manzano , a former cyclist turned whistleblower who is key to the case , has alleged that football players , track and field athletes and rowers were also paying Fuentes for blood transfusions and other performance enhancing drugs and practices .
He also said Spanish police had found blood count readings for footballers in the doctor 's apartments .
The prosecutor in charge of the trial , Eduardo Esteban , last week told the German broadcaster ARD that the Spanish police had handed over all the information they had .
But he added that in the report , the only athletes named were those it was clearly able to identify , "" meaning cyclists "" .
The Wada director - general , David Howman , is determined that all evidence relating to the case , which could link a whole host of other athletes to the doping ring , should be handed over to the agency , which is a party in the case and has fought hard to bring it to court .
"" It 's not just other cases in cycling but in a range of sports .
The whole purpose of the exercise , and the reason we 've been so resolute in pursuing this to court , has been to find out who those athletes are .
We need to know what those sports are and who those athletes are so the information can be handed over to agencies who can do something about it , "" Howman said .
"" Every possible block has been put in the way .
We want people to share that information through Interpol or some other means so that everyone can benefit from it .
We were told it was n't just one sport .
But we 've never been given the follow - up data .
This has so far proved to be a very unfair caricature of one sport , where there were others involved , "" he told the Guardian .
Because doping was not illegal in Spain at the time , the six defendants are being tried under public health laws on the basis that they endangered the health of the athletes .
They are expected to argue that they used the best technology and facilities available .
There are concerns that the trial will be limited to cycling alone , amid fears that some information could be suppressed , although there is nothing to stop other names coming out from the 35 witnesses who will appear .
The state prosecutors ' office said that sporting sanctions could follow .
"" If one of the defendants says that , for example , he injected a certain athlete , then Spain 's anti - doping agency or a sports federation could open an investigation to see if they could be subject to a ban , "" Esteban said last week .
The six defendants include doctors Eufemiano and Yolanda Fuentes , brother - and - sister suspects at the heart of a complex blood - doping ring that exposed the scale of the problem in European cycling .
Also on trial will be José Luis Merino , another medical doctor ; and Manolo Saiz , former ONCE and Liberty Seguros team sports director , plus Vicente Belda and Ignacio Labarta , both associated with the former Kelme team .
Although no riders will sit in the dock , many have been called to testify as witnesses , including the two - times Tour de France champion Contador , who was banned for two years and stripped of his 2010 title after testing positive for clenbuterol .
He had blamed it on contaminated steak .
From Fuentes 's Madrid office alone , police seized 220 blood bags , 20 bags of plasma , two refrigerators , one freezer , 105 different medications including Prozac , Antivegin , insulin and EPO , and a host of paperwork including invoices , calendars and lists of hotels for the tours of Italy and France .
Manzano , who blew the whistle after suffering health problems he claimed were linked to Fuentes ' practices , is also a party to the case .
But given its chequered history , he said last week that he did not hold out too much hope that the case , scheduled to last until 22 March , would provide the answers that Wada and others are looking for .
"" I do n't have many hopes with the judges having opened and closed the case so many times .
There are 100 bags of blood that nobody knows who they belong to , and many other things , a lot of [ doping ] products .
There are things we will never know . ""
But if he is wrong , and the mystery clients of Fuentes are revealed , the controversy and chaos surrounding the fallout from Armstrong 's case and even cycling 's systemic doping issues could start to seem like small beer ."
2013-01-28,"Newly Oscar - nominated Bradley Cooper is set to star as Lance Armstrong in JJ Abrams 's forthcoming biopic of the shamed cyclist who cheated his way to seven Tour de France titles .
Cooper , who competes for a best actor Academy Award next month for his portrayal of a troubled soul in David O Russell 's Silver Linings Playbook , expressed his interest in the role in an interview with the BBC last week .
"" I think he 's fascinating , "" Cooper said .
"" What a fascinating character . ""
Abrams told US TV show Entertainment Tonight at the Producer 's Guild awards on Saturday in Los Angeles that the pair had discussed the film . ""
He sent me an email and we 've been talking , "" he said .
Abrams recently optioned the forthcoming book Cycle of Lies : The Fall of Lance Armstrong by New York Times reporter Juliet Macur with the intention of turning it into a film , though it is still in the early stages of development .
It is not clear whether Abrams , who last week committed to the new Star Wars movie Episode VII , will direct and there are no casting details .
The project will be put together by studio Paramount and Abrams 's production company Bad Robot .
The BBC said Matt Damon , Jake Gyllenhaal , Michael Fassbender and Christian Bale were among other actors in the frame for the lead role .
The proposed movie is the first to be announced since Armstrong admitted that an extensive programme of blood doping and steroid use played a part in all seven of his consecutive Tour de France victories during an interview with Oprah Winfrey this month .
Macur has covered Armstrong 's career for more than a decade , through his return to cycling after treatment for cancer in 1998 , the championship - winning years of 1999 to 2005 , the allegations of cheating that dogged him throughout the latter stages of his career , and his comeback in 2009 ."
2013-01-29,"The World Anti - Doping Agency has said it is "" dismayed "" by the way cycling 's global governing body has handled the fallout from the Lance Armstrong affair and accused it of being "" deceitful "" and "" arrogant "" .
The escalation of the dispute has made the chances of a wide - ranging truth and reconciliation process , promised by the UCI this week as a replacement for its now disbanded independent commission , to investigate cycling 's widespread doping issues even more remote .
The UCI announced late on Monday evening that it had decided to axe the independent commission it set up to investigate allegations of complicity in Armstrong 's industrial doping programme .
The UCI president , Pat McQuaid , said it would instead co - operate with Wada on a jointly funded and wide - ranging truth and reconciliation process , including a rider amnesty , that would take at least 12 months .
But Wada said it had made no such commitment and accused the UCI of misrepresenting the exchanges between the two organisations . ""
The independent commission established by UCI was intended to review the allegations of complicity of UCI in the Lance Armstrong doping conspiracy as raised by the United States Anti - Doping Agency in its thorough decision , "" said the Wada president , John Fahey . ""
Instead UCI has again chosen to ignore its responsibility to the sport of cycling in completing such an inquiry and has determined to apparently deflect responsibility for the doping problem in its sport to others . ""
The UCI was accused by former team - mates of Armstrong of covering up a positive test at the 2001 Tour of Switzerland in return for donations totalling $ 125,000 , offered in 2002 and 2005 .
The former UCI president Hein Verbruggen has admitted that the donations were accepted and confirmed that Armstrong was warned about "" suspicious "" test results in 2001 and 2002 .
In an interview with the Dutch magazine Vrij Nederland , he even said that Armstrong 's intention may have been to "" bluff his way out "" with the donation .
But he has strongly denied there was any cover - up of a failed test .
Wada and Usada , which pursued Armstrong and amassed the evidence that saw him banned for life after cheating during all seven of his now discredited Tour de France victories , had refused to co - operate with the independent commission process because concerns over remit , timescale and lack of protection for whistleblowers had not been addressed . ""
Instead of any continuing professional dialogue with Wada 's president , UCI has publicly announced by way of a press statement that Wada has agreed to work with it on some form of truth and reconciliation .
This is not only wrong in content and process , but again deceitful .
The fact is that Wada was awaiting a reply to the correspondence when the UCI release was delivered , "" Fahey said .
"" Wada has not and will not consider partaking in any venture with UCI while this unilateral and arrogant attitude continues .
There has been no suggestion made by Wada that it will pay for or contribute to any collaborative effort with UCI into investigating UCI 's long - standing problems with doping in its sport and its alleged complicity . ""
The three - person commission , chaired by Sir Philip Otton and including the former Paralympian Baroness Tanni Grey - Thompson , met in London on Tuesday and said later it was concerned over whether the UCI and Wada would be able to "" agree the scope , timing and structure of the TRC and also whether the truth and reconciliation process is sufficiently advanced to justify the UCI 's termination of this inquiry "" .
It said that despite McQuaid promising full co - operation when the inquiry was set up , "" neither the UCI nor interested stakeholders have provided sufficient co - operation to enable the commission to do its job "" , making its task "" impossible "" .
Following a tense hearing last week , Otton adjourned the commission 's procedural hearing until Thursday .
But the commission said that hearing would not now go ahead .
The members of the commission said they had not been provided with a single document by the UCI and voiced fears their inquiry was being "" kicked into the long grass "" to divert from the UCI 's own failings .
Grey - Thompson said the commission had been frustrated by a number of factors .
"" It was evident early on that the lack of cooperation that the independent commission experienced from key stakeholders would make significant progress difficult and that a wider amnesty was necessary to give cycling a genuine chance for change , "" she said .
"" Having urged the UCI to engage in truth and reconciliation , I am glad that it now publicly acknowledges the need for such action .
However , I do not believe the creation of a truth and reconciliation process in itself answers the concerns that have been raised , especially as the process as it stands is still in its infancy and faces many obstacles before truth and reconciliation can take place . ""
She said it was "" essential "" that that the final process addressed the allegations against the UCI and that it made "" full disclosure of all documentation and evidence to allow the sport to move on and regain its standing and reputation . ""
Fahey paid tribute to the members of the commission , reiterating that its beef was with the UCI and the terms it had set for the inquiry rather than the individuals conducting it . ""
Wada wants to clarify that contrary to what is stated in the UCI press release Wada has never questioned the integrity and independence of the members of the commission , but solely the ability of the commission to work properly under the contract given by UCI to the commission , "" he said .
Campaigners called the UCI 's decision to disband the commission "" a rank and disgraceful manipulation of power "" .
The Change Cycling Now pressure group , which is pushing for Verbruggen and McQuaid to resign , accused the UCI of cynically disbanding the independent commission because it feared it would be overly critical . ""
Change Cycling Now today calls on the general sport of cycling , its national federations and other global stakeholders to enforce the removal of a manipulative and contemptible administration that is content to drag cycling further into disrepute in order to safeguard the positions of its leaders , "" it said .
The CCN founder , Jaimie Fuller , called the UCI 's statement announcing its decision to axe the commission "" an odorous mismash of self - serving misinformation "" .
The UCI later hit back in a furious response , accusing Wada of misrepresenting the communication between the two bodies and publishing letters and emails between UCI president Pat McQuaid and and Wada president John Fahey that it said proved its point .
McQuaid accused his Wada opposite number of a "" personal vendetta "" and a "" crusade against cycling "" .
The under pressure McQuaid accused Fahey of "" blatant and aggressive misrepresentations "" and accused him of saying one thing in public and another in private . ""
The UCI reached out to WADA in a spirit of partnership .
This is about doing what is right for cycling .
This is not the time for showmanship , or political point scoring , "" said McQuaid , as the process threatened to descend into farce .
""
The UCI is perplexed that WADA has now chosen to rebuff and attack the UCI 's willingness to establish a TRC , having just demanded that the UCI establish exactly such a commission . ""
McQuaid said he remained committed to a full truth and reconciliation process and called on Wada to co - operate .
"" I would therefore urge the President of WADA one more time to try to set his personal vendetta and crusade against cycling aside and to support the UCI in doing what is right for cycling .
Our aims are the same : to rid cycling and indeed all sports of the scourge of doping , "" said McQuaid , who is up for re - election in September .
frankly ridiculous that the UCI now suggests it is saving the whole process by organising its own review of itself and suggesting that it is merely complying with the wishes of others , "" he added .
"" Cycling 's future prosperity can only be assured by an administration that cares about the sport rather than itself .
There can surely be no doubt that the president and his senior colleagues must now be removed from office . """
2013-01-29,"Lance Armstrong has been stripped of his Tour de France titles for using performance - enhancing drugs – so should standups lose their comedy awards if they use writers ?
One of our readers , PoorButNotAChav , supplies this week 's most intriguing story , culled from a conversation between Absolute Radio host Frank Skinner and his co - presenters last weekend .
Discussing the disgraced cyclist , Skinnersaid : "" I 've done panel shows where there have been other [ comics ] on as guests , and I 've found out after that they 've had four or five writers .

Skinner 's comments – made , of course , in jest – add to mounting discontent within comedy at the glibness and hyper - competitiveness of TV panel shows .
"" Effectively , these comics are miming to someone else 's jokes , "" Skinner concluded .

A spokesman for People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals said : "" Stingrays are fascinating , gentle sea animals , and they do n't deserve to be slaughtered for a pair of joke shoes that will likely never even be worn . ""
Rolling Stone magazine has named "" the 50 funniest people now "" , and neither Brooke - Taylor nor Connolly make the cut .
Brits are few and far between , in fact , and seemingly selected on the basis of US profile alone : Daniel Kitson at 46 , John Oliver at 26 and Ricky Gervais at 16 are among the lucky few .
Tina Fey , satirist Stephen Colbert and , at the top , the much - hyped Louis CK occupy the medal positions .
Back in Blighty , the funniest people of tomorrow were assessed at last weekend 's prestigious New Act of the Year award .
The winner was Paul F Taylor , sidekick to Edinburgh Comedy award nominee Nick Helm in the double - act Helm and Taylor , and purveyor of "" a mix of offbeat banter , studentish charm and tinges of Harry Hill , "" according to critic Bruce Dessau , reporting on Sunday evening 's event .
A TV future probably beckons , perhaps in sitcoms like The Wrong Mans , in which Dawn French –
it 's just been announced – is to play James Corden 's mum .
Meanwhile , Sky1 's hit comedy Spy is to be remade in the States , the sketch troupe Jigsaw ( Nat Luurtsema , Dan Antopolski and Tom Craine ) have been picked up by Radio 4 and the sitcom Fresh Meat is to be made into a movie .

Controversy of the week Regular Guardian readers will be up to speed with this one already : the BBC 's decision to censor Fawlty Towers has been the talking point of the week .
The episode in question , predictably enough , was The Germans –
but it was n't Basil 's goosestepping
that was deemed likely to cause offence .
For the episode 's broadcast on Sunday 20 January , the Beeb edited out a speech by Fawlty 's regular guest the Major , which referred to "" niggers "" and "" wogs "" .
The cut was made , said a BBC spokesperson , to reflect changing public attitudes , and "" to allow the episode to transmit to a family audience at 7.30pm on BBC2 "" .
Never shy when a chance arises to bash the Beeb , the Daily Mail went big on the story , quoting correspondents to the BBC 's Points of View messageboard who criticised the move .
"" I doubt if anyone but the terminally thin - skinned could be offended by the Major , "" wrote one .
Another complained : "" How sad BBC [ that ] you have finally succumbed and lost the guts to transmit the episode
…
It 's about time you grew up BBC and trusted your audience .
"" The Guardian 's Mark Lawson joined the debate , while our readers offered their opinions – mostly against the cuts – below the line .
Best of our readers ' comments News that BBC1 sitcom Mrs Brown 's Boys – loved by its vast audience , hated by the cultural cognoscenti – is to return for a fourth series inspired heated debate below the line .
Brixtonian52 tried to put things into perspective : If Mrs Brown 's Boys was a Swedish import called Mrs Larsson 's Boys and was shown on BBC4 with subtitles on a Saturday evening at 8.30 before The Killing or Borgen etc , then I am fairly confident most of the ' anti ' people on here would all be falling over themselves saying how wonderful it was .
The came a comment from Mrs Brown 's native Ireland , from a correspondent called festinog , which took some pleasure in most of our readers ' dislike of the show :
Sorry my British cousins , but you owe us for 1,000 years of oppression and a famine .
I feel that dumping this horrible little man on you has gone some way towards evening the score .
Take Enda Kenny off our hands

2013-02-06,"Lance Armstrong is never out of the news for long , lately .
Now , in the wake of his semi - confession to Oprah Winfrey , ABC News is reporting that a high - level official says that Armstrong is still under investigation by federal agents for possible obstruction , witness tampering and intimidation .
And of course , we are still waiting for word on whether the US Department of Justice may join Floyd Landis ' lawsuit against Armstrong and associates over fraud allegations at the US Postal Service squad .
Meanwhile , Armstrong 's attorney , Tim Herman , has told USA Today this week that Armstrong has little expectation of having his life ban being reduced or finding himself eligible to compete in Olympic sports again .
This runs contrary to what we were told was Armstrong 's primary motivation for negotiating with the US Anti - Doping Agency over what he might be willing to say about his history of doping â€ “ even though the best Armstrong could expect would be a reduction from life to an eight - year ban , which means he would be nearly 50 before he could race again in recognised triathlons .
Herman says : "" I read the rule like you do .
An eight - year ban , that would be a lifetime ban [ for Armstrong ] . ""
And yet , Armstrong is competing .
Any and every day he wants to .
On Strava .
If you 're not familiar with Strava , it 's an app that 's become very popular with recreational and sports cyclists ( and also runners ) that enables users to upload all their trips to Strava 's site .
More specifically , it creates an unlimited online community of competitive amateur athletes , many of whom love to "" own "" the fastest time on a particular segment â€ “ especially , the coveted "" King of the Mountains "" ( KOM ) spot on their local climbs .
Enthusiasts go "" Strava - bombing "" in an effort to clock up new personal records and claim those KOMs .
For more on the new Strava culture , read Tom Vanderbilt 's excellent article for Outside Online , "" How Strava is Changing the Way We Ride "" .
It turns out that Armstrong himself has been a busy Strava user since 2011 .
He holds no less than 150 KOMs .
Chief executive Michael Horvath says that it 's not Strava 's job to police its community and ban users .
But the fact that Armstrong has admitted his doping and been stripped of his Tour de France titles has left some in the Strava community distinctly unhappy .
One Strava user blogged : "" In the spirit of ' clean competition ' and following ' laws and rules ' , Strava owes it to its community of clean athletes to adopt a general policy for doping violators , and in the mean time , strip Lance of his ill - deserved KOMs , and ban him from its service .
"" I 'm not a Strava user myself , but many of my bike buddies are .
I ca n't imagine they 'd be too happy if Lance rocked up and took their KOMs .
Of any segment of the American public , this is probably the community that is best - informed , cares most about clean cycling , and feels most betrayed by Armstrong 's cheating .
My guess is that Strava may need to listen more and think again on this issue .
But what do you think ?"
2013-02-06,"Lance Armstrong could face criminal charges following last month 's confessional interview with Oprah Winfrey , according to US media .
The US attorney AndrÃ © Birotte , whose office dropped their two - year investigation into Armstrong last year , had said on Tuesday that there were was no active criminal investigation .
However ABC News quoted an anonymous "" high level "" source who contradicted that view , claiming : "" Birotte does not speak for the federal government as a whole .
Agents are actively investigating Armstrong for obstruction , witness tampering and intimidation . ""
Birotte had told a news conference in Washington : "" We made a decision on that case a little over a year ago . ""
Obviously , we 've been well aware of the statements that have been made by Mr Armstrong in other media reports .
That does not change my view at this time . ""
Last month Armstrong spoke publicly for the first time since his interview with Winfrey , attacking what he called the "" petty bullshit "" around the doping scandal ."
2013-02-07,"The disgraced former Tour de France champion Lance Armstrong remains under active criminal investigation by US federal agents , according to the American broadcaster ABC News .
Although the US attorney for Southern California , AndrÃ © Birotte , said earlier this week that his own criminal inquiry into Armstrong would not be reopened , ABC News said federal investigators were still "" actively investigating Armstrong for obstruction , witness tampering and intimidation "" .
Birotte 's inquiry was suddenly dropped a year ago after he had spent two years looking into allegations of drug distribution , fraud and conspiracy , paving the way for the United States Anti - Doping Agency 's own investigation that led to Armstrong being banned for life and stripped of his seven Tour de France titles .
Asked about the case earlier this week , Birotte said : "" We made a decision on that case , I believe , a little over a year ago .
Obviously we 've been well aware of the statements that have been made by Mr Armstrong and other media reports .
That has not changed my view at this time .
Obviously we 'll consider .
We 'll continue to look at the situation .
But that has n't changed our view as I stand here today . ""
But ABC News reported that high - level sources had told them the criminal investigation was still live under another jurisdiction and that Birotte would not necessarily be aware .
Armstrong has said he would be "" first through the door "" for any truth and reconciliation process set up by cycling 's world governing body but the proposal has become mired in controversy after the UCI scrapped the independent commission it set up to look into the allegations contained in Usada 's original report .
Usada gave Armstrong a deadline of 6 February to co - operate with investigators under oath or lose the opportunity to reduce his lifetime ban .
Armstrong is believed to have said that he is unable to comply with the timescale set down by Usada .
Usada relented and gave him an additional two weeks to co - operate , news agencies have since reported .
Meanwhile a lawyer for Armstrong told USA Today that his client had no intention of repaying the $ 12 m in bonuses that the insurance company SCA Promotions is trying to recover in the wake of his confession that he used performance enhancing substances throughout his career .
The company underwrote bonuses for his 2002 , 2003 and 2004 victories and later attempted to recover the money through the courts .
Armstrong insisted under oath in 2006 that he had never doped .
SCA has said it will return to court to get its money back .
Armstrong 's lawyer , Tim Herman , told the newspaper : "" My only point is no athlete ever , to my understanding , has ever gone back and paid back his compensation .
Not [ New Orleans Saints coach ] Sean Payton or anybody else.""Payton was banned from the NFL for the entire 2012 - 2013 football season for a "" bounty "" programme that paid bonuses for deliberately knocking opponents out of games ."
2013-02-11,"Sports history is full of the Lance Armstrong and Michael Vick types – athletes caught cheating or breaking the law .
They clearly did it and deserve the consequences .
But there are n't many cases as complex as that of Penn State University football legend Joe Paterno .
Paterno coached football for 61 years at Penn State .
He amassed the most wins in NCAA history for a major college coach .
He also had one of the highest graduation rates among football teams and preached integrity .
In many ways , Paterno seemed like the ideal college football coach .
He achieved that demigod - like status , at least in Pennsylvania and among Penn State fans .
People had Coach Paterno posters and shrines in their offices , schools and homes .
But this coaching legend now has a big asterisk next to his name .
Paterno 's defensive coordinator for many years , Jerry Sandusky , was convicted last year of sexually molesting 10 boys , even raping some of them .
The victims ' testimony was horrifying .
Sandusky molested several of the boys in the Penn State football locker room showers .
Other victims described how Sandusky lured them in with tickets to games and trips to Penn State bowl games .
It 's clear Sandusky is a monster .
But what about Paterno ?
No one has settled what Paterno knew about Sandusky 's child sex abuse and when he knew it .
He was never charged of anything – much different from the Armstrongs of the sporting world .
But there can sometimes be a big difference between following the letter of the law and doing what 's right .
In 2001 , one of Paterno 's graduate assistants saw Sandusky molesting a young boy in the Penn State locker room showers .
Paterno told the grand jury that the young coach said , "" It was of a sexual nature "" – yet Paterno waited 24 hours to tell his superiors in the college administration so it would n't "" interfere with their weekends "" .
Then Paterno never followed up .
For years , Sandusky continued to bring boys onto the Penn State campus , and Paterno never did anything .
Last summer , Penn State hired a former FBI director , Louis Freeh , to do another investigation into the scandal .
The report ( pdf ) was much harsher on Paterno , blaming the Sandusky horrors on a "" culture of reverence for the football program "" .
Paterno never got to defend himself .
He passed away on Jan. 22 , 2012 .
His family and many former players have vigorously argued on his behalf .
Over the weekend , the family came out with their own report .
It did n't offer any new evidence , but it reiterated Paterno 's lack of knowledge about the situation and poked holes in the Freeh report analysis .
This debate can go on forever .
Here 's what you really need to know : Paterno himself said , "" I wish I had done more "" the week that Sandusky was arrested and news of the horrors garnered wide media attention .
Paterno knew he was morally wrong .
He followed the letter of the law and reported the incident he heard about to his superiors , but he did n't follow up .
He never asked questions along the way – the times when Sandusky brought young boys along on Bowl games or to various events , the times there were likely whispers .
Worse , he did n't bother to do anything for over a decade after the 2001 incident .
I appreciate the loyalty of Paterno 's family and fans .
But it 's a sad commentary on our society that in the midst of one of the most horrific crimes uncovered against kids in our country , Joe Paterno gets far more mention than the victims .
There was even a large vigil for him last month .
I used to work at the Patriot - News in Harrisburg , Pennsylvania , the newspaper that won the Pulitzer Prize for breaking the Sandusky story .
All year , we received letters to the editor defending Paterno and pointing out the many flaws in the "" Freeh report "" .
We did n't receive nearly as many letters praising the victims for being brave and stepping forward or wanting the university – and beyond – to change .
Over the weekend , social media again was abuzz about Paterno .
As someone tweeed me , @byheatherlong the # freehreport was a joke to begin with .
The paterno 's should have never been put in this situation along with Penn State .
—
Matt ( @Phillyfan4lfe ) February 10 , 2013
Yes , the NCAA overstepped its bounds with all the sanctions against Penn State , and the Freeh report likely blames Paterno too much for a culture that was much wider than one man .
But Paterno deserves the asterisk by his name .
He admitted as much himself .
It 's time for his family , friends , fans and the university to move on .
Or better yet , focus on helping these victims and other victims of sexual abuse .
That 's the real tragedy here ."

2013-02-14,"The sports brand
Nike has an unfortunate history of associating with athletes who attract adverse publicity , and has been criticised for its slow reaction to crises .
However , its advertisement on Oscar Pistorius ' official website that read "" I am the bullet in the chamber "" was removed on Thursday afternoon following the South African 's arrest and subsequent charge for murder .
Lance Armstrong
Despite initially indicating that it would stand by Armstrong , Nike dropped the disgraced cyclist after it emerged that the American had been running , in the words of US Anti - Doping Agency , "" the most sophisticated , professionalised and successful doping programme that sport has ever seen "" .
Initially the company said : "" Lance has stated his innocence and has been unwavering on this position .
Nike plans to continue to support Lance and the Lance Armstrong Foundation , a foundation that Lance created to serve cancer survivors .
"" The company later said that Armstrong had misled them , and dropped him in the face of "" seemingly insurmountable evidence "" .
Tiger Woods
The former world No1 ranked golfer 's career took a spectacular nosedive in November 2009 when revelations about his extra - marital affairs spread like wildfire , causing Woods to take a break from the sport and later apologise live on TV .
A number of sponsors including Accenture , AT&amp;T , Gatorade and General Motors cut their links with Woods , while Gillette suspended his advertisements .
However , Nike , along with Electronic Arts , kept the faith and has recently released a new advert where he appears alongside the current No1 , Rory McIlroy .
Marion Jones Nike did not immediately drop the former American sprinter when she became linked with the Balco drug scandal , but it did not renew her sponsorship contract in 2005 .
Jones later tested positive for the blood - boosting agent EPO and in 2007 admitted lying to federal agents about her use of performance - enhancing drugs , spending six months in prison the following year .
Justin Gatlin Gatlin won the 100 m gold at the 2004 Athens Olympics but later tested positive for testosterone and was banned from athletics for four years .
Nike suspended his contract and severed ties with him .
Michael Vick
The American footballer served 18 months in prison after pleading guilty to bankrolling a dogfighting operation in 2007 .
Once the highest - paid player in the NFL , Nike dropped him the moment he was convicted , later re - signing the quarterback after he was released from prison ."
2013-02-15,"Football has never had a Lance Armstrong moment , in Britain or worldwide , and there are two conflicting ways to view that record of relative cleanliness .
The first , set out robustly this week by the World Anti - Doping Agency 's president , John Fahey , and director - general , David Howman , is that the game 's testing procedures are not rigorous enough .
Fahey argued that Premier League players are tested too infrequently for EPO , the prime performance - enhancing drug injected into the bloodstream , favoured by Armstrong and other cyclists and athletes .
Fahey compared the regime operating in the Premier League unfavourably to the frequent testing now undergone by Major League Baseball players , saying pointedly : "" Team sports players can go their entire career without being tested once . ""
The football authorities ' response was to present , a little indignantly , the opposing view : that the testing regimes fully comply with Wada 's own codes .
In England the Premier League anti - doping programme is run by the governing body , the Football Association .
The FA stresses that its programme , run in conjunction with the UK Anti - Doping agency , tests players randomly , 70 % of the time away from matches , at training sessions or players ' homes , as recommended by Wada .
Players ' urine and blood are both tested , including for EPO , and at the start of this season the FA introduced a blood profiling programme , similar to the biological passport cited with approval by Fahey .
The FA argues it goes further than the Wada code , testing for social and recreational drugs such as cannabis and cocaine "" out of competition "" , rather than solely around match or tournament time .
Last season , the FA 's figures show that 1,278 tests were carried out at all levels of professional football , and FA policy is to test the Premier League more than any other .
There were just four adverse findings , a tiny proportion , similar to the level of breaches found every year since 2007‑08 .
Just one was a performance - enhancing stimulant , methylhexaneamine , for which the Barnet player Mark Marshall received a two - year ban from football ; the other three were positive tests for cannabis out of competition .
Two players received a one - month suspension , the other was suspended for three months , and were not named according to the FA 's policy not to do so for social , rather than performance - enhancing drugs , out of competition .
The FA defends that policy by arguing that the culprits are offered "" appropriate rehabilitation , to allow players to return to the game clean … without being stigmatised for an offence that arose outside of the Wada requirements .
"" In the absence of a proven high - profile drug - cheating footballer , British football 's most infamous drugs ban remains the result not of a test at all , but the failure to take one .
Rio Ferdinand , then just 25 and one year into his Manchester United career , was banned for eight months and fined £ 50,000 in December 2003 after missing a mandatory drugs test three months earlier .
At the time , there was an outcry , with England players rallying to protest against Ferdinand being omitted from the squad to play Turkey in a European Championship qualifier , a row still oddly prominent almost a decade later on the section of the FA 's website explaining its anti - doping policy .
Now , the heightened recognition for the importance of anti - doping , given the scandals which have poisoned other sports , means missing a drug test will be less likely to be viewed as it was then : a minor misdemeanour .
Fifa , whose regulations require compliance with anti - doping from all football associations internationally , and itself carries out the drug - testing in international competitions , was equally insistent that it conducts a responsible anti - drug programme .
Pointing out that Wada itself collated the figures from the tests on footballers , carried out in Wada - registered laboratories , Fifa figures are that in 2011 , the latest annual total compiled , 28,587 blood or urine samples were tested worldwide .
Of these , just 19 , 0.07 % , tested positive for performance - enhancing anabolic and hormonal drugs ( 40 , 0.14 % , tested positive for cannabinoids – social drugs ) .
Fifa said five of the 19 cases were players in the North Korean women 's team , now banned from the 2015 women 's World Cup ; the other 14 disparate players across the continents , including Europe .
Fahey , meeting with Fifa on Thursday , praised "" its progressive and productive collaboration with Wada over the years "" , particularly progress made with biological profiling of drug - tested footballers .
While in Spain the trial of Dr Eufemiano Fuentes has begun to draw football into the alleged doping net , the game is as yet free of a proven major scandal .
Wada suggested this is because the testing is insufficiently rigorous ; football itself countered that it is ."
2013-02-22,"The US Justice Department has joined a lawsuit against Lance Armstrong , in an attempt to recover more than $ 30 m in sponsorship money that the US Postal Service paid to help the disgraced cyclist 's team to compete .
The suit , which alleges that the seven - time Tour de France winner concealed his use of performance - enhancing drugs and defrauded his sponsor , was filed in 2010 by one of Armstrong 's former team - mates , Floyd Landis .
In adding its name to the lawsuit , the Department of Justice said that $ 31 m of taxpayers money was handed over on a "" contractual promise to play fair and abide by the rules "" .
But team riders including Armstrong "" knowingly "" violated the agreement with the US Postal Service ( USPS ) by taking banned substances , according to government lawyers .
It is now seeking damages from Armstrong , his team manager Johan Bruyneel and holding company Tailwind Sports . ""
The Postal Service contract with Tailwind required the team to enter cycling races , wear the Postal Service logo , and follow the rules banning performance enhancing substances â€ “ rules that Lance Armstrong has now admitted he violated , "" Stuart Delery , principal deputy assistant attorney general for the civil division of the Department of Justice , said .
Armstrong 's lawyer , Robert Luskin , said in a statement that negotiations with the government over the lawsuit had fallen apart "" because we disagree about whether the Postal Service was damaged "" .
Lawyers for the Justice Department and Armstrong had been discussing a settlement for some time .
On Friday , the Associated Press quoted a source saying the two sides were "" tens of millions of dollars apart "" on how much Armstrong should repay .
Luskin said that the Postal Service 's own studies "" show that the service benefited tremendously from its sponsorship â€ “ benefits totalling more than $ 100 m . ""
But Ronald Machen , US attorney for the District of Columbia , said that the postal services ' sponsorship was now "" unfairly associated "" with a cheating scandal that has been described as "" the most sophisticated , professionalized , and successful doping program that sport has ever seen "" .
Armstrong admitted to doping last month , in a confessional interview with the chat - show host Oprah Winfrey .
Having already been stripped of his titles and sponsorship deals , the decision to admit doping opened him up to several multi - million dollar lawsuits .
A British newspaper , the Sunday Times , has indicated that it is considering a move to be repaid an undisclosed sum that it was forced to pay in damages after alleging that Armstrong was doping .
A Texan sports marketing firm is also suing to recover funds paid to the cyclist .
The Department of Justice cited the Oprah Winfrey show in its statement on the latest development .
During the interview , Armstrong "" contradicted his earlier denials and admitted that he used banned substances and methods throughout his career , starting in the mid-1990s "" , it said .
As such it was joining the legal action , filed by Landis , under the False Claims Act .
Landis won the 2006 Tour de France for the Phonak team but was subsequently stripped of the title after testing positive for testosterone ."
2013-02-25,
2013-02-28,"Floyd Landis is a former professional racing cyclist .
A one - time mountain - biker from a Pennsylvania Mennonite background
, Landis caught Lance Armstrong 's eye and was recruited to the US Postal Service team .
From 2002 - 2004 , Landis was a key lieutenant , helping Armstrong clinch his 4th , 5th and 6th Tour de France wins .
Later , as team leader of his own Phonak squad , Landis won the 2006 Tour but was disqualified after testing positive for testosterone on his dramatic comeback in the race with a solo win on the penultimate stage .
Landis initially denied doping , and fought his case for several years , partly funded by wealthy donors and public subscription .
He nevertheless lost his case , served a two - year suspension and returned to racing in 2009 , still maintaining his innocence .
Then , in May 2010 , during the Tour of California , Landis dropped his bomb .
In a series of emails to US cycling officials , he not only admitted to doping himself throughout his cycling career , but made a series of detailed allegations about blood - doping and EPO use against Lance Armstrong and team - mates on the USPS team .
It was these revelations , later corroborated by the testimony of other former Armstrong associates such as Tyler Hamilton , that led to a federal investigation and grand jury hearings in 2011 into possible fraud .
Even though the case never went to prosecution , the evidence it unlocked formed the basis for the US Anti - Doping Agency ( Usada ) to compile its own report : the "" Reasoned Decision "" published last year that brought down Armstrong and saw him stripped of his titles .
Landis has kept a low profile since 2010 , saying little publicly since Paul Kimmage 's interview in early 2011 .
This is his first public appearance since then , and it comes â€ “ not coincidentally â€ “ just a week after the US Justice Department announced it was joining Landis ' "" whistleblower "" ( or qui tam )
lawsuit against Armstrong and his business associates in Tailwind Sports , owners of the US Postal Service team .
This move essentially reinstates the federal prosecution that was dropped in 2011 , and considerably increases the chances of Landis ' suit prevailing â€ “ potentially at a cost of tens of millions of dollars to Armstrong and his associates .
Also on the panel is Travis Tygart , chief executive of Usada .
Besides Landis himself , Tygart has proved Armstrong 's nemesis .
Before the Usada investigation , Armstrong had appeared impregnable : not only had he survived the federal probe , but his claim to have never tested positive for banned substances in more than 500 tests ( that number has itself since been called into question ) was widely accepted by the public , by his sponsors and by his beloved Livestrong Foundation .
One by one , as a result of the Usada report , they have abandoned him .
Tygart has also proved a stern critic of cycling 's governing body , the UCI , for failing to cooperate with Usada 's investigation , for dragging its feet over serious anti - doping measures , and for protecting top riders rather than working for a clean sport .
Tygart was recently in negotiations with Armstrong about a full confession ( as opposed to his partial admissions made to Oprah Winfrey ) ; those discussions broke down without resolution .
Jonathan Vaughters is also a former racing cyclist , is currently director of the Garmin - Sharp pro team and was until recently president of the International Association of Professional Cycling Groups ( AIGCP ) .
He , too , was a former team - mate of Armstrong 's in the US Postal squad ( for Armstrong 's first , post - cancer Tour win in 1999 ) .
A long - time advocate of doping - free cycling , Vaughters was among those who gave evidence to the Usada investigation .
In August 2012 , he wrote an op - ed for the New York Times expressing regret for his own doping history as a racer and explaining the damage cheating does to the sport .
Besides the British rider David Millar , Vaughters is probably the most outspoken anti - doping advocate in the pro cycling world .
Professor Thomas Murray serves as the chair of the ethical issues review panel for the World Anti - Doping Agency .
A bioethicist , he was until last year president of the Hastings Center , a US - based nonprofit research institution .
Wada , along with its country affiliates such as Usada , has been at the forefront of anti - doping in sport since its establishment by the IOC in 1999 .
It was Wada that developed , for instance , the first reliable test for the blood - doping agent EPO , in time for the 2000 Sydney Olympics .
In cycling , Wada 's anti - doping efforts have been significantly hampered by obstruction and jurisdictional issues with the UCI : Wada 's former president , Richard Pound , has been harshly critical of pro cycling 's governance and anti - doping efforts .
The "" Spinning Our Wheels "" panel discussion will be chaired by Jacob S Hacker , who is Stanley B Resor professor of political science at Yale University , director of Institutions for Social and Policy Studies and
co - author with Paul Pierson of Winner - Take - All Politics :
How Washington Made the Rich Richer and Turned its Back on the Middle Class ( 2010 ) .

2013-04-08,"When the world tuned in to watch Oprah interview Lance Armstrong last year , talkshow host Jimmy Fallon landed the scoop everyone had been waiting for : the testimony of Armstrong 's closest accomplice – his bike .
"" I did notice he was riding me really fast … especially uphill , "" the racing cycle confessed when asked the crucial question on Late Night with Jimmy Fallon , "" did he know his rider was taking performance enhancing drugs ? "" .
The audience cackled ; Fallon barely kept a straight face , and the producers of his popular talk show probably knew they were n't going to be able to keep hold of his silliness and charm for much longer .
And so , to plenty of noise in the US last week , 38-year - old Fallon was announced as the replacement for Jay Leno , the talk show veteran who will step down next year after 22 years on the frontline of late night US television .

2013-04-24,"The 33-page court document filed by the US Department of Justice , which has joined the "" whistleblower suit "" of Floyd Landis against Lance Armstrong and associates , raises for the first time the possibility that Armstrong 's former wife , Kristin , may be called as a witness in the trial .
Kristin Armstrong , who was married to the cyclist from 1998 to 2003 and who is the mother of his three eldest children , has until now made no public statement about her former husband and his life ban for doping .
The court documents contain testimony from Landis that on two separate occasions â€ “ in St Moritz , Switzerland , in 2002 and in Gerona , Spain , in 2003 â€ “ Kristin Armstrong witnessed Lance Armstrong supply doping products to Landis .
The Justice Department and Landis are suing Armstrong and his business partners in Tailwind Sports , the company that ran the US Postal Service Team from 1999 to 2004 , for millions of dollars in damages .
The lawsuit alleges that the US Postal Service was defrauded of at least $ 40 m in sponsorship because Armstrong and his co - defendants were running a systematic doping programme in violation of their agreements with the USPS .
Kristin Armstrong was mentioned in the US Anti - Doping Agency "" reasoned decision "" , published last year , as having knowledge of her husband 's use of performance - enhancing drugs , but she has maintained her silence .
The couple met in 1997 while he was still being treated for testicular cancer .
They married in 1998 and remained so for his first four Tour de France victories , though they had separated by the time of his fifth .
According to the Justice Department 's court deposition , shortly before the 2002 Tour de France , Landis paid a visit to the apartment where the Armstrongs were staying in Switzerland . ""
Mr Armstrong gave him [ Landis ] a package of 2.5ml testosterone patches in front of Mr Armstrong 's wife at the time , Kirsten [ sic ] Armstrong . ""
The following year , before the 2003 Tour of Spain , Landis went to see Armstrong at his family home in Gerona .
There , "" [ he ] happened to encounter Mr Armstrong along with his wife and children in the entryway of the building .
Mr Armstrong then handed Mr Landis a box of EPO in full view of his then wife and three children . ""
The inclusion of these two episodes in the court filing suggests that the Justice Department intends to subpoena Kristin Armstrong to appear as a witness under oath .
US courts do recognise "" spousal privilege "" , and Kristin Armstrong may invoke this to avoid responding to questions about any conversation she may have had with her then husband during the time they were married .
However , legal experts the Guardian has consulted said that this privilege applies only to communications between husband and wife ; it can not be invoked to cover events Kristin Armstrong is alleged to have witnessed .
That opens up the intriguing scenario that Kristin Armstrong will be obliged to testify against her former husband .
The case is also likely to have repercussions for cycle sport 's governing body in the United States , USA Cycling .
One of the defendants , the investment banker and Armstrong 's long - time financial backer Thomas Weisel , provided major financial aid to the organisation in the early 2000s and allegedly helped install his friends and associates Steve Johnson and Jim Ochowicz in key roles .
The suit alleges that "" these conflicts of interest and overlapping relationships â€ ¦ helped make it possible for the USPS team to carry on the extensive program of systematically doping team athletes "" .
The deposition also contains allegations from Landis that will be embarrassing for Trek Bikes , which sponsored the USPS team and continued to sponsor Lance Armstrong personally until he was stripped of his titles in 2012 .
Another Tailwind executive , Livestrong director and defendant in the case Bart Knaggs , is alleged by Landis to have been involved in a scheme that involved selling off team bikes , supplied by Trek , to create a slush fund to pay for the USPS team 's doping programme .
Almost all cycling sponsorship agreements include clauses that make systematic doping a breach of contract ."
2013-04-27,"Tim Kerrison , the Australian coach behind Bradley Wiggins 's Tour de France and Olympic triumphs of 2012 , has speculated that one reason for Team Sky 's success may be that they have been able to jump into a "" knowledge gap "" that has been left in cycling as teams focused on the expertise and logistics of doping at the expense of coaching and rider development .
"" I believe that we know a lot more than we did even 12 months ago , "" Kerrison said , referring to the revelations about Lance Armstrong and US Postal Service in the USADA report of last October . ""
In the previous era of cycling , I guess the teams did a cost - benefit analysis and the best way to invest their limited amount of resource for some teams was to invest in doctors and doping programmes , and coaching suffered .
That 's left a window of opportunity for us .
Quite uniquely , in this sport the development of coaching systems has been retarded by the effects of the last decade .
"" In his three years in cycling , Kerrison , a former swimming coach at the Queensland Academy of Sport , said he has been "" massively "" surprised by what he has found in terms of coaching , or the lack of it . ""
It 's still a shock how unstructured a lot of other riders and teams are .
Swimmers very rarely do anything without a coach , rowing a bit more , but in cycling a huge amount of training is done without a coach .
The concept of coaching seems to be hit and miss : some teams have a coach ; some teams leave their riders to their own devices ; in some the directeurs sportifs oversee what they do between races
but we know it 's hard for them . ""
Kerrison says he believes Sky are the only professional team that offers dedicated one - to - one coaching to all its riders
– they have four full - time coaches at present – and notes that other teams are looking to the British squad , whether it be warming down after stages , or sending whole detachments to train at altitude in Tenerife .
"" Everyone is now following our lead in things like warm - downs ; more and more teams have coaching staff .
I genuinely hope it 's the start of a new era in cycling . """
2013-05-01,"Doctors and others involved in the doping scandal centred on the US cyclist Lance Armstrong are the subject of a fresh criminal investigation in Spain , according to anti - doping officials in the country .
A court investigation has been opened by a magistrate in the eastern province of Alicante , where some of the events outlined in an extensive public report on the Armstrong case by the US Anti - Doping Agency took place . ""
Both the investigating magistrate and a prosecutor agree with the agency that there is evidence that a crime may have been committed , "" said Ana MuÃ±oz , head of the national anti - doping agency in Spain â€
“ which is involved in the storm over the light sentencing given on Tuesday to one of sport 's most notorious doping doctors , the Spaniard Eufemiano Fuentes .
MuÃ±oz refused to name those under investigation , but said her agency had passed on details from the American report into doping by the seven - times Tour de France winner to Spain 's attorney general 's office , which had sent them to prosecutors in Alicante and other provinces where alleged doping crimes took place . ""
What we did was to analyse the witness statements of various sportsmen in relation to doping practices carried out in Spain â€ ¦ and practices that saw , in some cases , Spaniards take part , "" she said .
"" These Spaniards are identified by name , and are two doctors and a coach . ""
The Spanish doctors mentioned in the report , known as the "" Reasoned Decision "" , are Luis GarcÃ­a del Moral and Pedro Celaya .
The coach JosÃ © "" Pepe "" MartÃ­ was also named .
Both GarcÃ­a del Moral and MartÃ­ are from Valencia , a neighbouring province of Alicante .
The Guardian was unable to ascertain if they were under investigation by the court there .
The report also mentions Alicante on several occasions , as Armstrong 's US Postal Service team trained there in 2001 .
Among those mentioned as being present at the training camp were Dr Michele Ferrari , a sports doctor with a reputation for administering performance - enhancing drugs like EPO and growth hormones .
Ferrari has been quoted as declaring that EPO was not dangerous .
The same doctor was present in the north - eastern Spanish city of Girona , where Armstrong reportedly bullied team - mates such as Christian Vande Velde into using his services .
It was not clear whether a court in Girona would also be looking into the allegations .
Doping was not illegal in Spain at the time , so the only charges that might eventually be laid would be for public health crimes .
Even with the overwhelming amount of evidence presented against Fuentes , he was only given a one - year sentence on Tuesday .
His doctor sister Yolanda and two coaches were declared innocent , although MuÃ±oz said Spain 's anti - doping agency would appeal ."
2013-05-02,"They start the Giro d'Italia on Saturday having moved into a new dimension over the past 12 months , with a major Tour leader who went from near - miss to confirmed winner in 2012 .
Not Team Sky and Bradley Wiggins , but their rivals at the American squad Garmin , who travelled to Naples in confident mood and with the defending champion Ryder Hesjedal , a former mountain bike racer from British Columbia .
The Canadian 's win at the Giro last year came from left field , but it was a breakthrough moment for Garmin , founded in 2008 by Lance Armstrong 's former team - mate Jonathan Vaughters and the Scot David Millar .
The team had regularly posted riders in the top 10 of major Tours –
Hesjedal among them , with his sixth in the 2010 Tour de France – but needed to get to the top of the podium .
Given their philosophy from the start has been founded on anti - doping , it was also a breakthrough for the entire sport .
Millar , for one , is in bullish mood , although he will arrive at the Giro only on Friday after leaving his departure until the last minute as his wife , Nicole , is expecting their second child .
Pointing to Hesjedal 's dominant form in the Liège - Bastogne - Liège Classic a couple of weeks ago , where the Canadian set up his team - mate , Daniel Martin , for the win , Millar says it is "" realistic "" that Hesjedal could defend his title .
As for last year 's win : "" That should earn us a bit of respect , but there is responsibility that comes with it .
Usually we just go in and see how it unfolds , but here we need to be more switched on , Tour de France style .
"" The team 's other Briton , the directeur sportif Charly Wegelius , has extensive experience of the Giro from his racing days in Italy and says Garmin can not repeat the feat of last year , when Hesjedal was unfancied – known as a consistently strong racer , but not a big winner – until he emerged in the final week .
Tactically , it was , Wegelius says : "" A one - trick wonder . ""
This year Hesjedal will be a marked man , and although he says he knows how to repeat his win of last year , he concedes the enhanced quality of the 2013 field , including both Wiggins and Italy 's best stage racer Vincenzo Nibali , means : "" I could conceivably ride better than I did last year and still not win the race . ""
Ironically , Garmin will start the Giro without their biggest star of the spring , the young Irishman Daniel Martin , who won the Tour of Catalonia and the Liège - Bastogne - Liège .
Wegelius would have liked to see him in the race – particularly in view of the fact that it will start in Ireland next year – but Martin 's spring was planned without the Giro so his schedule was heavy even without the Italian race , while he suffers from allergies that might have affected his performance in Italy .
The conventional view is that Garmin are the polar opposite of Sky – chilled out and fun , while Sky stress about marginal gains .
The reality is not that simplistic , but the history between the two teams can not be denied – it was at Garmin that Wiggins made the breakthrough as a Tour de France contender in 2009 , and that was followed by an epic struggle between the two teams to secure his signature for 2010 .
Wegelius makes the point that Garmin 's laid - back reputation does not stop them "" racing at 100 % "" .
He adds : "" We race seriously but do n't take ourselves too seriously .
Our skinsuits are as tight as the next guy 's but there is a relaxed atmosphere and that 's our strength .
There is no reason to become investment bankers just because we won the Giro . ""
Garmin 's directeur sportif has no doubts about the capacity of Wiggins , with whom he raced regularly until his retirement in 2011 . ""
He has enough experience from his early years , when he rode the Giro many times
…
he knows the race and the ins and outs of it , "" says Wegelius .
"" It 's a classic Giro route , all weighted to the last week , but compared to the Tour there are lots more ' ambush stages ' –
they do n't look much on paper
but you can suddenly hit a decent climb or small roads .
"" The inclusion of a 56 km time trial in the opening half is , he says , "" a massive ' please - visit - us sign ' from the organisers to Brad . ""
He adds : "" The biggest threat to Brad is how steep the climbs are – they are always going to be a problem for him .
Then there is the issue of time bonuses , which is a new element . ""
The fact that each stage win is worth 20sec off a rider 's overall time will give Nibali in particular a chance to gain time on Wiggins .
Wegelius feels that most teams will look to Sky to keep control of events , given the way they have raced this season and last . ""
Clearly there 's going to be poker played – every team wants to conserve its reserves .
Sky can try to be inventive about controlling the race but if you have the top favourite you need to step up to the plate .
They showed at the Tour they have the power to do it .
It 's their race to lose . """
2013-06-03,"Brian Cookson , the British Cycling president , will on Tuesday announce his intention to run for the top job in world cycling with a vow to restore the sport 's reputation .
Cookson , who has been British Cycling president since 1997 , indicated earlier this year that he was not interested in running for the UCI presidency but it is understood that he has decided to stand in a bid to repair its battered image .
The UCI was implicated in the Lance Armstrong doping scandal by the US Anti - Doping Agency and came under fire from the World Anti - Doping Agency when an independent panel that it established to examine its own alleged complicity was disbanded before it could report .
Cookson will run against Pat McQuaid , who has held the role since 2006 , if the controversial Irish incumbent is able to secure a nomination .
Cookson has already been nominated by British Cycling .
Cycling Ireland was forced to reverse a decision to nominate McQuaid when it emerged protocol had not been followed and will now hold an extraordinary general meeting on the matter .
McQuaid sought to sidestep the row by seeking the nomination of the Swiss Federation but that too is now mired in confusion .
The Swiss board was meeting on Monday night to consider its next move .
Cookson , who helped rescue British Cycling from the brink of insolvency in 1996 before becoming president a year later , has overseen the transformation of the governing body into one that is widely praised for marrying elite - level success with a boost in grassroots participation .
Cycling 's reputation was left badly tarnished by last year 's definitive proof of an endemic doping culture within Armstrong 's US Postal team and other drugs scandals that suggest cheating was widespread in the professional peloton during his era .
McQuaid has claimed the credit for introducing tough new anti - doping measures , but he and his predecessor , Hein Verbruggen , who was in post from 1991 to 2005 and remains an honorary president , have also been accused of not doing enough to stamp out a widespread culture of cheating .
In the most damaging allegations the UCI was accused of covering up a failed dope test at the 2001 Tour of Switzerland in return for sizeable donations from Armstrong .
It has repeatedly denied the claims .
It is understood that Cookson will announce his candidature on Tuesday before publishing a manifesto that will include measures to increase accountability and transparency , and restore the sport 's reputation .
He is believed to have already taken soundings from other federations who have pledged support .
Forty delegates will vote on the presidency in September and Cookson would need the support of at least 23 .
In January , following rumours that he would stand , Cookson said it was "" demanding job "" and that running for the presidency was "" not on my agenda "" .
At the time , he also said he supported McQuaid "" 100 % "" ."
2013-06-22,"Chris Froome believes that cycling 's code of omerta , which sheltered dopers in the peleton for decades , has been broken and that the sport is cleaner than it has been for more than 20 years .
The Team Sky rider , who will be a strong favourite for the Tour de France when it starts on Saturday , insists he has reached the top without resorting to chemical assistance .
But he says he understands why many remain sceptical about the extent of drug use in the sport , especially following Usada 's forensic dissection of Lance Armstrong 's doping last year . ""
Cycling is in probably the best place it has been in the last 20 - 30 years , "" he said .
"" The revelations about Lance have given us the opportunity to show people that the sport has changed . ""
Froome also described as "" really sad "" a suggestion in the recent publication Not Normal ?
â€ “ by the French journalist and former Festina trainer Antoine Vayer â€
“ that there may be suspicions surrounding him .
Vayer analysed the watts generated by 21 riders on iconic mountain stages and concluded that climbs by Marco Pantani and Lance Armstrong had been "" mutant "" , or highly suspicious , while Froome 's effort was merely "" miraculous "" , indicating possible suspicions .
Froome 's response was measured , if exasperated .
"" It is hard not to get angry because it almost feels the better we do our job
the more people think we 're doping , "" he said .
"" There is still a lot of scepticism out there and a lot of fans have been let down .
I sympathise with that .
I am one of those fans .
But the sport has changed .
I know that my results are n't going to be stripped in five , six , seven years ' time . ""
During last year 's Tour Bradley Wiggins was riled by a steady battery of questions about doping .
And Froome is preparing to face a similar grilling .
"" I 'm expecting to have to answer questions about doping , "" he admitted .
"" But personally I 'm really confident the races I 've done building up to the Tour , being able to get the results that I 've got , show that cycling really has changed .
If people are doping it 's not working â€
“
they 're not winning the races any more , that 's for sure .
Froome also believes that the reaction of the peleton to the recent positive tests of French rider Sylvain Georges and the Italians Mauro Santambrogio and Danilo Di Luca showed that times have changed .
"" I was quite happy to see the response , "" said Froome .
"" It is just not accepted any more .
You are not going to have any friends in the bunch if you come back from a two - year doping ban in this day and age .
"" I feel that the omerta has been broken .
Anyone now who does [ drugs ] is not only costing them their career â€
“
it is potentially taking down a whole team of cyclists plus the 50-odd support men around them .
It is clear that those guys were acting on their own .
They are the minority , the absolute minority and it 's great that the tests picked them up . ""
Meanwhile Froome believes that the huge upswell of British cycling fans in recent years will inspire him when the Tour finally begins .
"" I definitely feel like I 'm flying the flag for Britain this year , given the enormous energy and support we have had from last year 's Tour through the Olympics and into this year , it really is mind - blowing , "" he said .
"" It 's great to see how many people are behind us . ""
There 's the sense that we have got a whole nation behind us now .
As opposed to before , when it felt like not too many people really cared what was happening in the Tour de France . """
2013-06-28,"When French newspaper Le Monde , suggested an interview to Lance Armstrong a few months ago , his initial response was "" fuck off "" before realising "" it was a bloody good idea "" .
Perhaps one reason for his change of heart was the opportunity to explain to Le Monde 's readers that winning the Tour de France seven times would have remained a dream without the assistance of a few tricks that he believes are of the trade : doping .
Armstrong 's argument rests on prevalence .
It would be foolish for him to suggest that he would not be the strongest cyclist if none of the 186 cyclists he rode with used doping .
Instead , he is arguing that the odds would be impossibly stacked against him if he were to compete against others without using the same performance enhancers they had .
To test whether the ' winning would be impossible ' claim has any truth , we 've tried to find the facts on how many of the men cycle in the Tour de France with a little extra je ne sais quoi .
1 in 3 test positive
That 's the shocking statistic to emerge from the site cyclisme-dopage.com where they 've collected statistics starting from 1968 .
The year is n't totally arbitrary - an anti - doping law was only passed in France in 1965 .
Though the overall prevalence has varied from 27 % in 2009 to 84 % in 1997 , the average rate of 36 % still appears incredibly high .
The site compiled the numbers by defining ' positive ' as a Tour de France participant who has contravened the anti - doping rules .
These are riders who have tested positive for drugs ( including an observation of a deficiency or haematocrit ) , have acknowledged that they have been doped or have been punished for doing so .
Which leaves one question : what on earth is haematocrit ?
It 's the percentage of red blood cells in the blood , which can be artificially elevated to allow an individual to be physically stronger .
One of the ways that a higher haematocrit allows athletes to perform better is that their bodies can work hard , even at higher altitudes .
So Antoine Vayer a French journalist spent years of research with other contributors to find the difference between mountainous human successes and unbelievable superhuman acts .
The power of 21 cyclists ( literally , watts generated ) on L'Alpe d'Huez was compared to test Lance Armstrong 's claims that his rivals ' performance was ' not normal ' .
They then classified them from ' human ' to ' suspicious ' , ' miraculous ' and ' mutant ' .
The performances they point out as being impossible to achieve without doping include Armstrong - in fact , they include all but one of the 21 riders they looked at .
What 's the verdict on Armstrong then ?
Given that most of his competitors would have used some form of doping , his claim that it would have been impossible to win without doing the same is probably true .
Does that serve as a justification for his actions ?
We 'll leave it to you to decide by posting a comment below .

The ghost of Lance Armstrong 's dope - fuelled achievements has haunted Team Sky and its British Tour de France leader Chris Froome all the way on their trip through the mountains .
Froome 's team manager Dave Brailsford has even offered to hand over all of Team Sky 's data to the authorities to prove that the South African - born Brit is not using drugs .
Meanwhile on the track , the world 's two fastest men over 100 metres this year , Asafa Powell and Tyson Gay , have both taken doping tests that came out positive .
They follow the shaming of Jamaica 's female Olympic champion Shelley - Ann Fraser - Pryce and triple Olympic gold medallist Veronica Campbell - Brown , and cast a further shadow over the successes of sprinters globally .
To see the extent of doping in both sports we have looked at the data since the formation of the World anti - doping authority ( WADA ) in 1999 to see which sport has been hit worst by doping scandals .
Doping : a dangerous cycle Despite accusations of drug - use in the Tour de France having been around since the 1920s , the spokes really came off the wheel in January when seven - time winner Lance Armstrong finally confessed to extensive drug - use throughout his victories .
Indeed , the Tour de France has fared much worse than its fellow grand tours , the Giro D'Italia and the Vuelta D'EspaÃ±a , when it comes to top three finishers who have admitted to doping or been found guilty of doing so .
Over half of the 42 top three finishers in the Tour de France from 1999 to 2012 have been found guilty of doping at some point in their career .
This is relatively unsurprising when you consider that multiple winners Armstrong and Alberto Contador are making up almost half of those drug users .
Only three general classification champions of the Tour de France since 1999 , Carlos Sastre , Cadel Evans and Froome 's fellow Team Sky member Bradley Wiggins , have never been found guilty of doping offences .
This means that a blood - spinning 79 % of tour winners since the late 90s have been dopers .
It would be a tough climb for any sport to top the drug problems of cycling , which is why some have questioned whether it is impossible to win the Tour de France without doping .
Doping endemic to successful sprinting The revelations over the last few weeks that so many top sprinters have tested positive for doping offences have led to perhaps the darkest days for sprinting since the 2002 BALCO scandal .
Shamed sprinter Tyson Gay has lost his lucrative sponsorship deal with Adidas and some inside athletics have called for the punishment for doping offences to be pumped up .
Of the top ten male 100 metre sprinters each year since 1999 , including 2013 so far , just under 40 % have been found guilty of doping offences at some point in their career .
The chart below shows how the layout of the top ten was made up of dopers and non - dopers each year .
In several years the number of dopers in the top ten actually exceeded the number of those who were not doping .
In 2013 so far , four of the top ten sprinters have been found guilty of using performance - enhancing drugs at some point in their career .
Between 2004 and 2007 , the best time each year was run by someone who has been found guilty of doping .
In 2004 , it was American sprinter Justin Gaitlin and then for the next three years Jamaican Asafa Powell continuously run the best time .
The world 's fastest man Usain Bolt has never registered as positive on a drugs test .
His record of 9.58 set at the 2008 Beijing Olympics remains untainted by a drug conviction .
The records do not include sprinters who have subsequently had their times erased because of doping scandals .
However , the frequency of drug usage in the revised statistics shows how much of modern sprinting history is still affected by drug - use .
Everyone is a loser While cycling and sprinting are in the news for these recent revelations , it is worth noting that the use of illegal supplements is not confined to these pursuits .
Take a look at wider athletics and the accusations of widespread doping in Russia , which has been embarrassing sporting authorities in the run up to the country 's hosting of the World Championships later this year .
Even the seemingly clean sport of tennis has been tainted by scandals in the past .
With such a high percentage of sportsmen doping and famed champions continually being revealed as cheats , no sport seems safe from drugs scandals .
It might even be the case that cycling and athletics are disproportionately good at detecting it .

2013-07-30,"Actor Ben Foster looks set to play Lance Armstrong in a biopic of the disgraced cyclist , which will be directed by Stephen Frears , according to the Hollywood Reporter .
Written by regular Danny Boyle collaborator John Hodge , the film would cover the period from Armstrong 's testicular cancer diagnosis in the mid-1990s to the revelations over his use of performance - enhancing drugs .
Foster , a celebrated supporting actor in films such as 3:10 to Yuma , Alphadog and recent Sundance smash
Ai n't Them
Bodies Saints , will step up to a rare lead role if his current negotiations prove fruitful .
Working Title 's version of the story is one of at least three competing projects being put together by Hollywood studios , but appears to be closer to entering production than its competitors .
Bradley Cooper was reported to be in talks to star as the shamed athlete in a version to be produced by JJ Abrams in January .
However , the Oscar nominee later described the rumours as "" nuts "" .
Matt Damon , Jake Gyllenhaal , Michael Fassbender and Christian Bale were among other actors reported to be in the frame for the part .
Armstrong was stripped of his seven consecutive Tour de France titles after the US Anti - Doping Agency published a 1,000-page report on the cyclist 's "" sophisticated , professionalised "" doping programme in October 2012 .
Armstrong , who initially refused to comment on the report , later admitted in a January interview with Oprah Winfrey that blood doping and steroid use played a part in all of his Tour de France wins ."
2013-08-09,"Memoirs are always partly an attempt on the part of the author to portray themselves in the best light , but in the case of Lance Armstrong a group of California book buyers is testing in court whether its acceptable for writers to lie outright .
They are asking for $ 5 m ( Â£3.2 m ) to compensate them for buying books by disgraced cyclist Lance Armstrong which they thought told his true story , when in fact much of what was written later turned out to be mendacious .
The doping scandal that engufled Armstrong prompted John Crace to ask if his books be rebranded as fiction .
Penguin Group , which published
It 's Not About the Bike in 2001 , and Random House , which put out Every Second Counts in 2003 , moved to strike out the US lawsuit , arguing that the books and related marketing materials are not "" commercial speech "" , and are therefore protected under the First Amendment .
They also pointed out that the group of consumers failed to identify specific lies which they relied on when purchasing the books , the American Lawyer reported .
In 2000 , It 's Not About the Bike became a New York Times bestseller .
It is not the first time that US readers have gone after authors and their publishers for allegedly peddling fiction as truth .
Readers in the states of New York , California and Illinois in 2006 won a lawsuit claiming they had been defrauded by author James Frey and his publisher Random House Group in his memoir A Million Little Pieces , resulting in anyone who bought the book before Frey confessed to making some of it up , being able to claim a full refund .
The total settlement was to be no more than $ 2.35 m , to cover the cost of customer refunds , lawyers ' fees for both sides and a donation to charity .
Frey , who was found to have invented or wildly embellished details of his supposedly degenerate lifestyle , sold 3.5mpies of his book after an appearance on hit TV chat show Oprah , later going back on the presenter 's couch to apologise .
Amstrong built up his own personal legend of being a cancer survivor who kept on fighting back to win seven Tours de France , amassing a personal fortune estimated at $ 125 m .
He also took to Oprah 's couch to explain himself : this January , he admitted to cheating , in an interview which opened the door for the readers ' lawsuit .
A complaint was filed on 22 January by Rob Stutzman and Jonathan Wheeler , accusing Armstrong and his publishers of marketing the books as "" true and honest "" works of non - fiction , and saying that they would not have bought It 's Not About the Bike or Every Second Counts had they known the truth .
Armstrong stopped contesting allegations of drug use in August 2012 and in October of that year was stripped of all seven Tour de France victories , receiving a lifetime ban from the International Cycling Union after it accepted the findings of the United States Anti - Doping Agency 's investigation into systematic doping ."
2013-08-27,"More tears this week for poor old Lance Armstrong , for whom it 's not so much about the bike these days as the sizeable and continuing out - of - court settlements .
Drug cheat
Armstrong sued the Sunday Times in 2006 ( for calling him a drug cheat ) and was awarded around $ 470,000 in damages .
The paper counter - sued following Armstrong 's damp - eyed Oprah confession and has now been offered a suitable redress .
Meanwhile , back in the saddle Nicolas Roche of Ireland won the second stage of the Vuelta a EspaÃ±a in a dramatic uphill finish , with the Giro d'Italia winner Vincenzo Nibali taking the overall lead , and , for once , the Team Sky 's yellow machine pretty much nowhere to be seen .
Hats off to New Zealand
When they 're good they 're very good : and even when they 're just so - so they 're too good for Australia .
New Zealand retained their Trans - Tasman rugby bragging rights , winning the Bledisloe Cup for the 10th season in a row by swatting aside Australia 27 - 16 in Sydney , helped by two tries from winger Ben Smith .
"" You 've just got to take your hat off to New Zealand , "" Wallabies captain James Horwill said afterwards , taking his hat off .
Elsewhere in the self - styled Rugby Championship , South Africa came from four points down at half - time to beat Argentina 22 - 17 in the Estadio Malvinas in Mendoza .
Vroom vroom from Vettel Formula
One : a sport where a continental - scale carbon - footprint is transported across the world every fortnight , 25 elite race car drivers line up on the starting grid and two hours later Sebastian Vettel wins .
This week Vettel won the Belgian Grand Prix to take a 46-point lead ahead of Fernando Alonso in the drivers ' championship , otherwise known as the coming - second - behind - Sebastian - Vettel all - comers pursuit .
Alonso was second and Lewis Hamilton , who started on pole , finished third , having been reeled in by Vettel on the first lap .
Wenger defies the critics It has n't taken long : two weeks into the new Premier League season
ArsÃ¨ne Wenger has survived the first managerial crisis , with Arsenal all - but toddling through to the Champions League group stages in midweek at the expense of a horribly meek Fenerbahce .
Over to you , Manuel Pellegrini , whose Manchester City dished up one of the more pungent early season Premier League reverses , losing 3 - 2 to Cardiff City thanks to another barking , panting , pawing howler from Joe Hart .
Elsewhere Wayne Rooney and Gareth Bale remain in gilded transfer limbo with a week left in the summer window , although Bale in particular seems likely this week to bid a fond and affectionate farewell ."

2013-09-07,"The under - fire president of world cycling 's governing body has insisted he did not influence a key decision not to allow the court of arbitration for sport to rule on whether he is eligible to stand for re - election .
Pat McQuaid , under pressure over the UCI 's role in combating doping during the Lance Armstrong era , is facing a challenge from the British Cycling president , Brian Cookson , for the UCI presidency .
USA Cycling , backed by Russia , Canada , Finland and Algeria , last week challenged McQuaid to allow a dispute over the wording of the UCI constitution , that could block him from standing , to be settled by Cas .
After Swiss Cycling followed Irish Cycling in withdrawing its backing for McQuaid , he has been forced to rely on Morocco and Thailand to endorse his nomination .
USA Cycling said CAS should rule on whether that was allowed in order to rescue the credibility of a presidential race that has been watched with reactions varying from "" amusement to outrage , from bewilderment to astonishment "" .
But the UCI executive committee said on Friday that it would not take the issue to Cas .
The Irishman insisted he was not involved in the decision .
"" I was n't part of the decision .
It was the executive committee , "" said McQuaid , who is in Buenos Aires for the International Olympic Committee session .
USA Cycling is believed to be considering its next move but McQuaid , asked whether the UCI had ignored the wishes of its members , said : "" There are 175 federations and some have written to me saying they do n't want to go to arbitration . ""
The dispute over the terms of the nomination process could have far - reaching consequences and McQuaid recently hit back in a letter to the UCI 's members accusing Cookson of trying to engineer "" a coronation and not an election "" .
Cookson has claimed the support of a string of big - name backers who argue that cycling needs a fresh start to re - establish its credibility , amid raised hopes that he stands a reasonable chance of defeating McQuaid in the election .
The increasingly acrimonious contest will be decided in Florence on 27 September ."
2013-09-11,"Lance Armstrong may have proved at least one thing beyond doubt : that there is , in fact , a more infuriating response to criticism than "" Haters gon na hate "" .
That response ? ""
Haters of cancer - victim saviours gon na hate . ""
Over and over , the most notorious cyclist in history has looked his accusers square in the face â€ “ an earnest , brick - jawed hugger of six - year - old leukaemia sufferers â€ “ and said : "" The critics ?
I 'm not doing it for them . ""
After all , why would a cancer survivor use performance - enhancing drugs ?
In hindsight , a lot of reasons suggest themselves ; 125 million of them , you might say , one for each of the dollars Armstrong earned over a starry career in which he survived cancer to "" win "" seven straight Tours de France .
At the time , however , Armstrong 's miracle tale was largely believed .
Not just believed : accepted as gospel , as doctrine for a charity fundraising empire , for a personal fortune and above all for a sport determined at all costs to put the 1990s legacy of drug use behind it .
In the aftermath of the scandal that disgraced Armstrong as a cheat and bully , one of those former believers , film - maker Alex Gibney , gradually realised he was sitting on a goldmine .
He had been commissioned to make what most people expected would be an uplifting documentary about Armstrong 's second comeback , for the 2009 Tour de France .
The famous cyclist , thinking the movie would be a puff piece , gave Gibney unprecedented access .
Gibney filmed Armstrong lounging in hotel rooms , joking with his inner circle , getting upset with surprise drugs tests at his home as his daughters look on .
Armstrong also allowed Gibney to interview Michele Ferrari , his notorious "" doping doctor "" , who admits with a grin to continuing to give Armstrong "" advice "" well past the date Armstrong had supposedly cut off ties . ""
In all their arrogance , Armstrong and his team figured there was nothing to be discovered , "" Gibney told the Toronto international film festival the afternoon after the premiere of his film The Armstrong Lie . ""
So it ended up being a rather extraordinary opportunity to see something that was hiding in plain sight â€ “ but was actually there
, we could find it .
"" What was "" actually there "" remains slightly murky in this nonetheless compelling documentary , which Gibney built from the fragments of his ruined Armstrong - comeback film .
The cyclist himself admits on camera to years of doping ( he could hardly do otherwise ) , and he reveals the tricks of the trade â€ “ including blood transfusions on a tour bus almost literally under the noses of a throng of media and cycling officials .
Armstrong also continues to maintain , however , that his 2009 comeback was clean .
Gibney responds by pointing to new evidence of suspicious blood tests .
But that 's fighting on Armstrong 's territory : plausible deniability by a hyper - competitive personality .
As Gibney narrates , "" Armstrong even tried to dominate my documentary . ""
To Gibney 's credit , this lucid , clear - headed film takes the battle elsewhere : namely , into the arena of smoke and mirrors that was the rise of the Armstrong brand .
Gibney focuses the narrative drama on the 2009 comeback , but also gives plenty of stage time to the whistleblowers , former teammates and journalists whose reputations were damaged by daring to speak out against cycling 's golden boy .
Armstrong himself is cast as the wizard of Oz in a game of hype and intimidation .
As well the unique behind - the - scenes footage and the interview with Ferrari , we get damning evidence of deception in the highest ranks of the UCI .
Armstrong himself admits there were "" hundreds "" of conversations with UCI officials where he was warned his drug tests were "" flying too close to the sun "" .
UCI head Hein Verbruggen comes off particularly badly , as Gibney implies a conspiracy designed to protect the sport 's most wildly lucrative icon .
It 's not just the UCI that appears complicit , either .
As the Livestrong cancer foundation grows , so much emotion comes to be invested in Armstrong 's story â€ “ from sufferers to cycling fans to corporate sponsors to media â€ “ that it seemed at times as though everyone had hitched their wagon to the Texan 's carbon - fibre frame .
Those who went off - piste attracted torrents of abuse .
Gibney 's contributors told the Toronto film festival after the premiere that they refused at first to speak to him out of mistrust .
"" We were inside Armstrong 's bubble , "" Gibney said , "" and everybody outside the bubble was very suspicious of us .
"" Armstrong 's story is less about doping than about divide - and - conquer : it 's a story , Gibney shows , about power .
Gibney 's film also shows that the Tour has always involved drugs of one kind or another , starting with alcohol ; he unearths hilarious old footage of Tour cyclists leaping from their bikes to raid the bars of roadside brasseries .
In the mid-90s context of EPO , the blood - oxygen booster for which a detection test had not yet been developed during Armstrong 's era , it was dope or go home .
Armstrong was simply the best organized , most cunning of the dopers .
Most of those cyclists who chose never to touch the stuff , we simply have n't heard of : they never won a thing .
If The Armstrong Lie does n't quite have the tragic beauty and natural symmetry of the racing documentary Senna , it nevertheless succeeds as a probing look into the mechanics of an epic lie , and because of the emotion at its heart .
And of course the irony is that it also stars a figure of magnetic charisma .
Even when the subject is his own disgrace , Lance Armstrong carries the story .
â€¢ Full Toronto 2013 coverage here"
2013-09-17,"Follow the exchanges between Pat McQuaid and Brian Cookson as the election to lead cycling out of the Lance Armstrong era nears and it would be easy to think that while Cookson has a narrative common to most who challenge the old order – "" Time for a change "" – the incumbent McQuaid lacks a message .
He can appear so often on the defensive , or , occasionally , delivering a heavily weighted attack on his opponent , be it over the chance that a Cookson win will deprive cycling of International Olympic Committee representation , or that Cookson will not commit to the job by living in Switzerland .
The day after we speak , typically , McQuaid is batting off allegations of corruption , nepotism and bribery via leaks from a "" secret dossier "" .
The response is robust : "" Scurrilous , libellous , gangster politics .
"" That 's the McQuaid style .
One on one , down a phoneline from the IOC congress in Buenos Aires , the Irishman is far more measured , but the attack - dog style pokes through every now and again .
The answer to a question about what he might be offering cycling morphs into his central defence against his critics : he is the victim of a plot . ""
A lot of the stuff that 's been said about me has been said as part of a political campaign . ""
McQuaid appears to claim that the two men at the centre of the campaign are Jaimie Fuller , of the Skins clothing company , and Igor Makarov , of the Russian cycling federation .
In this scheme of things , he becomes the defender of cycling democracy against a cabal of outsiders .
"" I do n't mind going to congress .
If it 's Brian who wins I 'll go over , shake his hand and go and find something else to do .
But I think I deserve that right
and there 's people trying to undermine me .
"" Brian has a group of supporters like Makarov , the Russian oligarch who wants to be the power broker in the UCI , and he 's supporting Brian because he knows that I 'll stand up to him .
I feel that if it comes to an election , I have the support . ""
But if McQuaid gets to that election , it will be thanks to a contorted nomination process that looks to the outsider as if the rules are being manipulated , with Ireland and Switzerland refusing to nominate him , and his nomination coming only via a rule change , yet to be endorsed by the congress .
The McQuaid bat is straight when this is put to him : "" That is a fallacy being put out there by Brian and his people , to say that I 'm twisting the rules or getting the rules twisted .
"" I stand for president with a nomination which is valid within the rules .
The proposals to change the rules are proposals that have come about as a result of what federations saw going on in Ireland and Switzerland and they said : ' This is wrong , this should n't be happening .
Outsiders should n't be allowed to interfere with the process . '
This , in essence , is the McQuaid sell : cycling under attack , with himself as the defender of its democratic process .
Question that process , question the man , question his ethics , but that is how he sees it , and that is the thrust of his argument .
Amid all the controversy , why should McQuaid be president again ?
One point he likes to make is that cycling 's IOC representation is dependent on him , but the central thrust of his re - election case is that the core moves against doping have taken place under his aegis , the battle against doping is nearly won , and the process will be completed if he is given another four - year term .
A study at Lausanne University into the hearts and minds of dopers will be the key , he says .
"" In four years ' time I can look back and say I 've changed the culture .
That 's what I want to do . ""
He will , he maintains , ensure a successor is nominated halfway through the four years and a smooth transition will take place .
On other issues , primarily women 's cycling , he stands by his record : the women 's World Cup , gender equality at London 2012 , although he is not in favour of a women 's Tour de France run with the men 's event .
What of the Armstrong questions ?
There will , maintains McQuaid , be an independent audit of all that went on that concerns the UCI and the Texan , if he is elected .
I press him on the detail : it will include , he says , the period right up to the Texan 's final retirement in 2011 , the UCI 's response to the revelation of 2005 that Armstrong had tested positive in the 1999 Tour de France , the donations that Armstrong made to the governing body .
Unprompted , he adds that it will include the question of the alleged positive test in the 2001 Tour of Switzerland .
It will be accompanied by what McQuaid does not like to call a truth and reconciliation process , but it sounds like one , with cyclists testifying confidentially , "" clearing their consciences "" , and receiving reduced sanctions .
It will all happen this autumn , he insists .
But last autumn he said something similar and the UCI 's independent commission was shortlived .
It was , claims McQuaid , torpedoed by the World Anti - Doping Agency .
But whether you or I accept the McQuaid narrative is not the issue .
He knows that the people who matter are the 42 delegates from international cycling federations who will vote on 27 September .
Corruption allegations , Armstrong , a women 's Tour de France : how will they play with an African or Asian delegate ?
I make the point to McQuaid that there is a massive disconnect between the UCI and what I see as its constituency , and he turns the issue back at me with the aplomb of the practised sports politician .
"" There 's 175 federations in the world .
Where you and others are coming from is a narrow perspective of professional cycling in Europe .
Over the last eight years cycling has developed massively in other continents , in Asia it 's booming , South America , Africa the same .
There 's a huge amount of development going on around the world –
those federations have a right to decide who should be their president .
It 's the national federations who bring the cyclists into the sport who have the right to vote and that 's the way it is .
The world is represented in Florence and the world will have its say . ""
And the rest of the cycling world will have to live with its verdict ."
2013-09-28,"Brian Cookson , in his first moves as UCI president , has said that the disgraced Tour de France winner Lance Armstrong might be able to return to the cycling fold if the Texan should choose to divulge all that he knows about past doping activities .
"" I hope that he is going to tell the complete truth , "" said Cookson , "" I have n't spoken with him before but if he wants to help cycling , if he wants to be a witness , there is a place for him .
"" Cookson remains opaque over the extent of a possible amnesty for past cyclists who testify if and when the UCI sets up a full inquiry into doping within the sport .
He has discussed the need for a report process resembling the Mitchell Commission into baseball .
"" It 's not the easiest thing to manage , but it 's something we are going to work on .
This would enable us to close the door on the past , it 's too early to go into detail but it would be good for cycling , "" Cookson said .
The former British Cycling president , who won his acrimonious battle with the incumbent Pat McQuaid to head cycling worldwide , said that his first move on Monday morning would be to talk to the new IOC head , Thomas Bach , and to contact the drugs agency Wada to begin working on the process of dealing with cycling 's past .
To emphasise the change of regime , among the vice - presidents he appointed on Sunday was the first woman to hold the role , Tracey Gaudry of Cycling Australia .
The moment that broke the deadlock in the election process came when Cookson called for a vote ; the move surprised many , but there were indications that it was not entirely spontaneous .
The word in Florence was that Cookson had imagined that the UCI Congress might get bogged down over the question of McQuaid 's controversial multiple nominations , and had something ready up his sleeve for such a situation ."
2013-10-10,"Sheryl Crow saw her then partner Lance Armstrong receive a secret blood transfusion and later told investigators what she saw , according to a new book about the doping conspiracy .
Wheelmen :
Lance Armstrong , the Tour de France and the Greatest Sports Conspiracy
Ever , a new book by Wall Street Journal reporters Reed Albergotti and Vanessa O'Connell , claims that Crow witnessed Armstrong 's illicit activities aboard the cyclist 's private jet on a trip to Belgium in 2004 .
The singer dated the seven - time Tour de France winner after he left his wife Kristin and were briefly engaged but split in 2006 .
The book claims : Rather than try to hide the transfusion from her , Armstrong was completely open about it .
He trusted that Crow would have no desire to tell the press or anyone else about the team 's doping program .
He explained that it was simply part of the sport - that all cyclists were doing the same thing .
Five years after the couple split , Crow was forced to revisit her time with the cyclist when federal investigators launched a criminal probe . ""
Wheelmen "" claims that Crow informed after Food and Drug Administration criminal investigator Jeff Novitzky gave her an agreement which would protect her as a witness from criminal prosecution .
Armstrong escaped criminal charges when a grand jury dropped the case in 2012 but still faces a string of lawsuits .
The Justice Department is suing Armstrong in an effort to retrieve tens of millions of dollars that the US Postal Service paid to the cyclist and his teams .
After years of denial , Armstrong finally confessed to doping at the beginning of this year ."
2013-10-16,"The IT Crowd 's Chris O'Dowd has joined the cast of the as - yet - untitled film about disgraced cyclist Lance Armstrong , to be directed by Stephen Frears .
The film , which will begin shooting on Monday , is set to be the first Armstrong biopic ( not counting documentaries ) to make it into production since the former seven - time Tour de France winner was unmasked as a drug cheat .
Armstrong will be played by Ben Foster , who impressed as injured cop Patrick Wheeler in Ai n't
Them Bodies Saints and as William S Burroughs in beat drama Kill Your Darlings .
O'Dowd is to take the role of Sunday Times reporter David Walsh , who doggedly pursued Armstrong despite repeated denials and legal threats .
The film is based on Walsh 's own book , Seven Deadly Sins : My Pursuit of Lance Armstrong .
Frears ' most recently completed film , Philomena , with Steve Coogan and Judi Dench , is the story of an Irish woman whose child was forcibly removed from her by the nuns , and is shortly to be released in the UK and US .
It is being heavily tipped for a successful awards season run .

2013-11-12,"Would you believe it , here 's Lance Armstrong again .
And again .
Last week an epic four - part interview on the website cyclingnews.com ; this week the BBC World Service .
He is complaining about a "" massive personal loss of wealth "" owing to his drugs ban , claims he was singled out by the US Anti Doping Agency and feels he should get the same punishment as other cyclists who were caught doping .
He is worried that the never - ending attempts to resolve his case have damaged his sport .
Look a little wider , and you sense something that smacks of a media offensive .
Along with the BBC and cyclingnews.com and the Velonation website ( which refused to interview him unless he provided new material that he had denied before ) , I know of several other journalists who have had contact with him .
And that 's just the known knowns .
It seems fair to assume that there must be a few unknown unknowns out there too .
There has to be a reason for Armstrong 's emergence from purdah , and it is n't hard to find .
Now showing , in a cinema near you , The Armstrong Lie , the documentary made by Alex Gibney about the Texan 's comeback in 2009 - 10 .
Coming a little bit later , the Untitled Cycling Project ( Drugs , actually ?
Four syringes and a Bloodbag ? ) from Studio Canal and Working Title , directed by Stephen Frears , starring Ben Foster and Chris O'Dowd and using David Millar as a consultant .
They are not the only film projects out there by any means .
Now in the shops , the book Wheelmen , a more rounded account of Armstrong 's career than David Walsh 's telling of his part in the Texan 's downfall , Seven Deadly Sins ; Wheelmen appears to use sources that â€ “ in the past
at least â€ “ must have been close to the Texan , and paints Armstrong in a far less sympathetic light than his Irish nemesis did .
And it wo n't end soon ; the Armstrong story will be told and retold .
As he complains , other people are profiting from his story .
The multiplicity of films and books add up to this : the narrative has been taken away from Armstrong , and other people are weaving it their way .
This is the polar opposite of how it was during his pomp , when the person who controlled the story was Armstrong , whether it was by permitting access to only selected journalists , by giving lengthy interviews at points where he felt vulnerable so that he could get his message across , by offering â€ “ as Walsh relates â€ “ access in return for more friendly coverage .
Not to mention the bullying and the intimidation .
Since 24 August 2012 , when he dropped his fight against the US Anti - Doping Agency 's charges against him , one of cycling 's most aggressive control freaks has lost the grip he once had on events .
If he is putting himself out there , it is largely because he wants to counter the way the story is developing .
And as he made clear when he gave his first interview to Oprah Winfrey in January , he is desperate to have his life ban reduced .
What he does not seem to get is that it ca n't be done on his terms .
It does n't seem likely that the men in power will take much notice , or at best they are playing hardball .
Last week , the newly elected UCI president , Brian Cookson , made it clear to the Guardian that there is going to be no preferential treatment for Armstrong , and that he is wary of anything that might even look remotely cosy .
The Wada president , John Fahey , will meet Cookson on Wednesday to discuss the UCI 's inquiry into the Armstrong years , and has said it is highly unlikely that the disgraced seven - times Tour winner 's ban will be reduced .
"" There 'd have to be a damn good reason , "" Fahey said .
""
As far as I 'm concerned it 's done and dusted .
Armstrong did what he did .
We all know what that is .
He did not co - operate , he did not defend the charges that Usada put out there last year and he was dealt with in a proper process .
You have to wonder , with time , just how valuable the information is that he may have .
I see it as done and dusted and it would take something close to a miracle to see that changed . ""
The Usada chief executive , Travis Tygart , has also questioned the value of Armstrong 's testimony more than a year after the case against him was made public , and rightly so : the dossier compiled by Tygart and his team was so exhaustive that it is hard to see what Armstrong can add , in terms of the actual doping .
Where he may shed light is on the question of his influence on the way the UCI handled his case over the years but his version of events would only be one side of the story ; if not verified , that would have no value .
So when you read the next Armstrong interview complaining about the length of his ban , bemoaning the loss of his millions and saying he is all too willing to tell all to a truth and reconciliation commission in return for fair treatment , if you feel a twinge of sympathy , it 's probably best to bear in mind that it 's all about the agenda .
As the saying goes : if you see a crocodile in tears , do n't look for your handkerchief ."
2013-11-13,"Lance Armstrong has been urged by the International Cycling Union president , Brian Cookson , to contribute to an independent inquiry into past doping within the sport , particularly regarding allegations over his relationship with the governing body .
The disgraced seven - times Tour de France winner was warned by Cookson , however , that his life ban is unlikely to be reduced .
"" What I am really interested in , I have to say , is the allegations he has apparently made ... about the way in which he was given special treatment by the UCI , "" Cookson said .
"" If that was true , I 'd like to know about it . ""
Armstrong made donations to the UCI totalling $ 125,000 ( Â£78,000 ) between 2002 and 2005 .
The allegations â€ “ strongly denied by the UCI â€ “ that Armstrong claimed he had influence within the governing body , were made by his former team - mates Floyd Landis and Tyler Hamilton .
The head of the US Anti - Doping Agency , Travis Tygart , said last spring that "" Armstrong led us to believe â€ “ during the course of our interaction with him â€ “ that he had evidence of [ the UCI 's ] complicity in this situation "" .
Armstrong stated , though , when interviewed by Oprah Winfrey this January that his donations were "" not in exchange for help "" .
Armstrong , 42 , has claimed that he was unfairly singled out for investigation and that his sanction is a "" death sentence "" whereas others were more leniently treated , but Cookson joined the chorus of international sports figures who have played down the chances of that ban being reduced . ""
He has admitted to cheating to win seven Tours de France , "" Cookson said .
"" Whether other people cheated or not is perhaps irrelevant .
I ca n't see him getting the same sanctions [ as ] people who have previously given evidence . ""
After the World Anti - Doping Agency head , John Fahey , said on Tuesday that it would take "" a miracle "" for Armstrong to get his ban reduced , the International Olympic Committee president , Thomas Bach , expressed similar views on Wednesday .
"" I would not feel comfortable with this [ reducing Armstrong 's ban ] because it is too little , too late .
It was not even a real admission , "" Bach said after addressing delegates at the Wada conference .
He added : "" Trying to bargain a deal there after everything has been proven , and now that he realises he does n't just get off the hook
â€
“
this is not the best way , to lessen a sanction or to be lenient there in any way . ""
Cookson 's comments came after a private meeting with Fahey at the World Conference on Doping in Sport in South Africa , at which the pair began to work out the details of the commission of inquiry .
"" We 've agreed that we will co - operate , "" Cookson said .
"" We will have a commission of inquiry which the UCI will manage and run .
We will agree on the detailed terms and conditions of that over the next few days , hopefully . ""
Although any reduction in Armstrong 's ban would have to come through the US Anti - Doping Agency rather than the UCI , Cookson conceded that there would have to be some trade - off for those who contribute to the inquiry . ""
Some people will come forward and give evidence because they simply want to get it off their chest , "" he said .
"" Others will not want to do that .
So , there has to be some form of incentive and that is one of the things we are working on in the detail with Wada . ""
The commission will be set up before the end of the year and should start work in early 2014 .
Cookson wants the investigation to be completed within a year
but he said he was "" not putting that down as a firm deadline "" .
Details to be worked out include the appointment of commission members and deciding the exact remit .
It appears that the Briton 's election as UCI president has ended the long history of discord between Wada and the UCI â€ “
"" We had some very rocky moments in the past , but I 'll leave the past , "" said Fahey , adding that there is "" a great deal of goodwill "" between the two bodies .
Bridges have clearly been rebuilt with the Usada as well , as it will also be "" an important partner "" in the inquiry , Cookson added .
Additionally , moves have been made towards getting more involvement from the French anti - doping agency , AFLD , to co - operate on drug testing during the Tour de France , with the eventual goal of making anti - doping processes independent of the UCI ."
2013-11-13,
2013-11-18,"The former UCI president Hein Verbruggen could be called before the independent commission investigating cycling 's doping past after the disgraced former Tour de France winner Lance Armstrong directly implicated him in a cover - up of his test for corticosteroids during the 1999 Tour de France .
Armstrong , speaking to the Daily Mail as he prepares the ground for a possible appearance before the commission , and amid debate over whether his lifetime ban should be reduced if he tells all he knows , said that Verbruggen told him and his team to "" come up with something "" .
Verbruggen recently denied any inappropriate behaviour and stated squarely that "" the UCI never protected Armstrong "" .
In an email exchange with the Daily Telegraph on Monday Verbruggen reiterated that he had nothing to hide and was more than happy to be investigated .
He wrote : "" An IC [ independent commission ] has never been a problem for me .
There was nothing to cover up . ""
In a separate text message sent to the Dutch TV channel NOS , he added : "" Since when does one believe Lance Armstrong ? ""
Verbruggen went on to say : "" His [ Armstrong ] story is illogical because it was not a positive / anti - doping offence , in the opinion of the competent authority .
That authority was not the UCI , but the French Ministry .
After allegations a year back of a large - scale complicity at the UCI over doping by Lance Armstrong and his team , we are now back to a cortisone - case from 1999 that was n't even from the UCI . ""
The UCI issued a statement which suggested Verbruggen could be invited to appear before the commission being set up by its new president , Brian Cookson .
The statement read : "" The UCI 's Independent Commission of Inquiry is in the process of being set up and we are in advanced discussions with stakeholders on its terms of reference to allow full investigation of any allegations relating to doping and wrongdoing at the UCI . ""
The commission will invite individuals to provide evidence and we would urge all those involved to come forward and help the commission in its work in the best interests of the sport of cycling . ""
At the time of Armstrong 's positive test cycling was recovering from the Festina doping scandal of 1998 and banning the yellow jersey of the Tour in the 1999 race would have been highly damaging to the sport .
Armstrong stated : "" The real problem was , the sport was on life support .
And Hein just said : ' This is a real problem for me .
This is the knockout punch for our sport , the year after Festina , so we 've got to come up with something . '
So we backdated the prescription . ""
He added : "" What I remember was there being a problem .
I 'm not sure if it was a positive but there were traces found .
I do n't know if it technically crossed the line .
But anyway it did n't matter .
I ca n't remember exactly who was in the room .
But Emma [ O'Reilly , his then masseur ] has a better memory than I do . ""
Asked why he had come up with the fresh claim having previously refused to go into his past allegations that the UCI had colluded in hiding his doping , Armstrong said : "" ' Man , I 'm that busy talking to lawyers and going over things that have happened , I ca n't remember what I have and have n't said .
You spend a day in a room with a team of lawyers .
It 's like 24-hour root canal . ""
The International Olympic Committee said it would await the outcome of the UCI 's inquiry before deciding whether to take any action over Armstrong 's allegations .
"" It is hard to give any credibility to the claims of a cyclist who appears to have misled the world for decades , "" read an IOC statement .
"" That said , the UCI is currently working on plans to investigate the matter more thoroughly and we await proper considered outcomes from this investigation rather than [ act ] on rumour and accusation . ""
Armstrong spoke during a reconciliation with O'Reilly , who was instrumental in revealing the story of the backdated prescription .
O'Reilly recalled the affair in David Walsh 's book of 2007 , From Lance to Landis , stating that the team had been told of the positive test 12 days before it was made public .
The corticosteroid was detected in a sample from 4 July , after the first road race stage of the Tour , when Armstrong was wearing the yellow jersey .
The test was newly instituted that year and found minute traces of the substance triamcinolone
O'Reilly added : "" At one stage , two of the team officials were in the room with Lance .
They were all talking . '
What are we going to do , what are we going to do ?
Let 's keep this quiet , let 's stick together .
Let 's not panic .
Let 's all leave here with the same story . '
There was a real sense that the shit was about to hit the fan and they had to come up with an explanation .
"" It was decided to use a backdated prescription stating that the substance had originated from a skin cream being used by Armstrong to treat a saddle sore .
O'Reilly recalled : "" Later that night there was a mad scramble to get [ the team doctor ] to write the medical prescription . ""
On 22 July1999 , after the Le Monde newspaper revealed the positive test , the UCI issued a statement which read : "" At the request of Lance Armstrong and his team , and because of the exceptional situation created by some media , the UCI wishes to make an exception and confirm that the rider has used Cemalyt cream to cure an allergic dermatitis . ""
Usually , tests which were covered by a prescription remained confidential , but the UCI confirmed that Armstrong had been tested after the prologue on 3 July and that the result had been negative . ""
The rider was again tested on 4 Julyand minimal traces were detected , "" the statement said .
The UCI added that the use of cream was "" authorised by the rules and can not be considered doping practice "" .
There was a contradiction , however : Armstrong had stated earlier in the race that he was using no banned substances under prescription .
At the time , he explained : "" I was asked if I had been given exemption by the [ governing body ] UCI to take banned substances for medical reasons , and I said of course not .
When I think of taking something , I think pills , inhalers , injections , I honestly did not consider skin cream to be taking something . ""
In a now legendary exchange after that day 's stage finish , he asked Le Monde 's journalist : "" Are you calling me a doper or a liar ? ""
Verbruggen retired as the president of the UCI in 2005 , but remains an honorary vice president .
In an open letter to national cycling federations written earlier this month , he stated that : "" I have never been a friend of Lance Armstrong 's or other riders or team managers .
I have never said that Lance Armstrong never doped , I only said , in a way that everyone could understand , that Armstrong had never tested positive . ""
"" The fact that he never tested positive through the UCI or through the French anti - doping authorities , or through USADA or through Wada or through any other organisation , makes a nonsense of any accusations of ' cover - up ' against me .
The UCI never protected Armstrong . ""
Every decision about Armstrong and any other cyclist was taken according to established facts and the scientific means available at that given moment .
The position of the UCI on the traces of cortisone in his samples at the 1999 Tour de France and the dossier relating to his samples in the Tour of Switzerland 2001 have already been clarified . ""
Verbruggen added in the letter : "" I have never acted in an inappropriate manner and my conscience is clear . """
2013-11-18,"Lance Armstrong has come face to face with the whistleblower who first spoke out against the disgraced cyclist 's long - standing drug taking and told her that his attempts to ruin her reputation were "" inexcusable and embarrassing "" .
Armstrong , who admitted in January that he took performance - enhancing drugs during all seven of his Tour de France wins â€ “ of which he has been stripped â€ “ was brought together in Florida with Emma O'Reilly by the Daily Mail .
O'Reilly was a soigneur on the US Postal Team which Armstrong represented when winning his first six Tour titles and it was she who in 2004 spoke out against the American and the systematic doping that he was a fundamental part of .
Armstrong reacted by taking legal action against O'Reilly , who is from Dublin but now runs a physiotherapy clinic in Hale , Cheshire , accused her of being an alcoholic and made other disparaging comments about her which he now admits were lies .
Meeting the 43-year - old for the first time since 2000 , in the presence of the Daily Mail 's chief sports reporter , Matt Lawton , the American said : "" I never expected to see Emma .
I wanted to talk to her .
I felt it was necessary to have a conversation because there were definitely people that got caught up in this story who deserved an apology from me .
When I reached out in January it was to talk .
Emma , I appreciate , was n't ready for that .
But it 's good that we are [ now ] doing this in person . ""
At the time , when I said what I said about her , I was fighting to protect a lot of positions .
But it was inexcusable .
It 's embarrassing .
I was in a conference room , giving a legal deposition , and I had no idea it was going to get out .
But that does n't excuse it .
I guess you should always assume that , in that setting , the whole world will watch it the next day .
It was totally humiliating for Emma .
And if I saw my son do that , there would be a fucking war in our house .
"" Following a separate , private meeting between the pair , O'Reilly told the Mail : "" ' It was a bit stilted because I guess we were two people who had n't talked for a long time , who had more than a bit of history .
But we had a chat about people we knew , about our families .
"" I was thinking , he never actually used the word sorry .
But I was n't looking for an insincere apology .
There are different ways of saying sorry and I felt what he did say was genuine .
Now people might think I 'm under Lance 's spell
but I 'm not .
I was n't when I said what I did about him in 2004
and I 'm not now .
He was a jerk .
He was a bully . ""
But there are wider issues here
and I wanted to address those , too .
That said , I wanted closure with him and today I feel I have it .
This part , for me , is over . ""
Armstrong was banned for life from cycling after the United States Anti - Doping Agency accused him in August 2012 of conducting the "" most sophisticated , professionalised and successful doping programme sport has ever seen "" .
Last month he vowed to testify with "" 100 % transparency and honesty "" at any future inquiry into doping ."

Racehorse Doping Gang by Jamie Reid , a rollicking tale of crooked bookies and nobbled nags â€ “ with a sprinkle of sex and royalty for good measure
â€ “ is the surprise winner of the William Hill Sports Book of the Year for 2013 .
Reid 's story , only the second racing book after Seabiscuit :
The True Story of Three Men and a Racehorse in 2001 to win the award , beat the favourites Seven Deadly Sins : My Pursuit of Lance Armstrong by David Walsh and I Am Zlatan Ibrahimovic by Ibrahimovic and his ghostwriter David Lagercrantz .
Reid â€ “ a racing punter and columnist at the Financial Times â€
“ receives a Â£25,000 cheque , Â£2,500 William Hill bet and a day at the races .
Appropriately he promised to place his bet on "" a nice each - way horse that is talked up by those in the know "" .
Doped tells the true story of Bill Roper , a bookmaker and gambler who attempted to finance his extravagant lifestyle by doping horses â€ “ and how he was brought down after he attempted to nobble a royal horse .
It is written like a thriller and it came as little surprise that Reid confirmed that he had already received several approaches for the film rights . ""
After tonight we 'll have to tell them that they will cost a bit more now , "" he joked .
Reid admitted that he was "" thrilled and delighted to win "" â€ “ but that it came as a little bit of a shock . ""
I wanted to tell a good story , "" he said .
"" I did n't want it to be a dry and esoteric racing book . "" Unless you go to Cheltenham at March or some of the other big races you do n't get those buccaneering characters that you had 50 years ago
and I must admit that is very sad because it is part of the flavour of horse racing , "" he added .
Graham Sharpe , William Hill spokesman and co - founder of the award , said : "" Jamie Reid 's brilliantly constructed book lures the reader into his masterly recreation of late 50s / early 60s England in which social class counted for far more than workplace competence .
Nowhere more so than in the historically class - ridden world of horse racing .
"" This background , generously scattered with sex and drugs and royalty , is the setting for a perfectly researched , paced and plotted unravelling of probably the most shocking , cynical , sustained attempt to dope â€ “ sometimes fatally â€ “ innocent racehorses and endanger jockeys for personal gain . ""
Reid 's book beat a shortlist that also included Ed Hawkins ' account of match - fixing in Indian cricket , Bookie Gambler Fixer Spy ; A Journey to the Heart of Cricket 's Underworld ; David Epstein 's The Sports Gene ; and Daniel James Brown 's The Boys In the Boat :
An Epic True - Life Journey to the Heart of Hitler 's Berlin .
All shortlisted authors received Â£3,000 and a Â£1,000 bet .
Meanwhile the chairman of the judging panel John Gaustad , the co - creator of the award and founder of the former Sportspages bookshop , said that he was "" immensely proud "" that the awards had reached their 25th birthday . ""
When we started out I never envisaged we 'd get this far or the awards would be so successful , "" he said .

2013-12-07,"The encounter between the French ""
Mr Clean "" Christophe Bassons â€ “ a cyclist who famously refused to dope and had no qualms about saying so in public â€
“ and Lance Armstrong in the 1999 Tour de France
was one of the defining elements of the seven - times Tour de France winner 's rise to sporting notoriety , and now the hatchet appears to have been buried after Armstrong met the Frenchman in Paris to offer a formal apology .
The meeting follows a recent encounter between the disgraced seven - times Tour de France winner and his former masseur Emma O'Reilly , who provided early and cogent evidence of his doping , drawing attacks on her reputation from Armstrong which he later admitted were lies .
Both the meetings â€ “ one a splash in the Daily Mail , the other a double page spread in l'Equipe â€ “ are part of a campaign by Armstrong to gain public sympathy as he attempts to earn a reduction in his life ban .
The Bassons episode was in a different register compared with the slurs on O'Reilly , but it raised questions about Armstrong 's attitude to drugs .
The young Frenchman had written an outspoken column in the Parisien newspaper about doping in cycling during the 1999 Tour and Armstrong 's response was to tell him that if he was not happy with cycling , he should leave the race .
Bassons went home a nervous wreck .
"" If my son one day was wearing the yellow jersey and I saw him talking to Bassons the way I did , I would have a long , long conversation with him .
It 's one of the episodes of my life that I regret the most , "" said Armstrong .
Armstrong 's recent activities have been described in a blog on the crankpunk.com website by one of his most persistent critics , Betsy Andreu â€ “ the wife of a former team - mate , and another racer bullied by the Texan â€ “ as "" his reconciliation tour "" .
Andreu added : "" Nothing has changed with Lance .

2013-12-18,"Hein Verbruggen , the former president of world cycling 's governing body , the UCI , has dismissed as "" bullshit "" Lance Armstrong 's claims that he colluded in covering up a positive drug test in 1999 .
The American said last month that Verbruggen , desperate to avoid another controversy for the Tour de France a year after the Festina affair , had not only turned a blind eye when Armstrong explained a positive test for cortisone using a backdated prescription for a saddle sore cream , but had actively encouraged the ruse . ""
The real problem was , the sport was on life support , "" Armstrong told the Daily Mail . ""
And Hein just said : ' This is a real problem for me .
This is the knockout punch for our sport , the year after Festina , so we 've got to come up with something . '
So we backdated the prescription . ""
But in an interview with the Daily Telegraph Verbruggen said : "" It 's a bullshit story and nothing else .
Never , ever would I have had a conversation saying , ' We have to take care of this ' .
"" It may very well be that he or somebody else from the team has given me a call and my first reaction was , ' Shit .
We had this Festina problem and now this . '
But that 's a very long way to concluding we have to do something about it
â€
¦
You will never , ever find any cover - up in the UCI while I was president , and I 'm sure afterwards neither . ""
Verbruggen suggested that Armstrong had been motivated by money when making his claims . ""
Lance Armstrong has his own agenda and that is certainly his own personal interest , whether it is that he wants his sanctions to be reduced or whether he wants money , "" the Dutchman said .
"" Usually , with Lance , there is always an interest also in money .
My interest is the truth . ""
Verbruggen said the stories provoked by Armstrong 's claims had "" caused me a lot of misery "" , and that they would result in his withdrawal from sport .

2014-01-08,"A Swiss international lawyer , a German anti - doping specialist and an Australian who has advised the Afghan government have been named as the three members of the independent commission which will investigate cycling 's doping past in the wake of the Lance Armstrong scandal , including allegations of mismanagement of anti - doping cases by the governing body , the UCI .
Dick Marty of Switzerland will chair the commission , with Ulrich Haas and Peter Nicholson as vice - chairs .
The commission will be named the Cycling Independent Reform Commission and will be expected to complete its work by the end of 2014 .
Setting up the commission was a key element in the manifesto of Brian Cookson , the former British Cycling head who was elected UCI president in late September .
Within hours of taking office , Cookson had sent representatives of the security firm Kroll into the organisation 's offices in Aigle , Switzerland , to secure computers and documents which are now held by Kroll .
Cookson told the Guardian that he can release the material only on the say - so of the commission . ""
The independent commission has already started preparatory work and will soon be given complete access to the files of the UCI and all the electronic data which was copied as soon as I was elected , "" said Cookson in a UCI release .
"" It will also be seeking testimony from people involved in the sport or who have been involved in the past and we are in the final stages of discussions with Wada to agree how best to incentivise people to co - operate with the independent commission . ""
This last â€ “ in essence the question of how to reduce doping sanctions for those who supply information â€
“ is likely to be a particularly thorny issue , particularly with regard to Armstrong , who implied that he has information of interest but that he wants a cut in his life ban .
"" We have agreed a budget for the commission , which the UCI will cover in full , and we have also expressed our wish that its work be concluded this year , "" Cookson said .
"" Other than that , the independent commission based in Lausanne will operate completely independently of the UCI and will organise its work as it chooses .
The commission 's terms of reference will explicitly state that the commission will act autonomously and that its members will not receive any instruction from the UCI . ""
The allegations arising from the Armstrong scandal are what have concerned Cookson most , including as they do his former team - mate Tyler Hamilton 's claim that the UCI "" took care of "" a positive test at the 2001 Tour of Switzerland , and Armstrong 's recent assertion that the former UCI president Hein Verbruggen "" told him to come up with something "" after the Texan 's positive test for cortisone during the 1999 Tour de France .
Verbruggen has denied any irregular conduct , stating emphatically "" the UCI never protected Armstrong "" .
The commission members all have significant experience outside cycling and sport in general , and in the cases of Marty and Nicholson in particular , backgrounds in investigating thorny international issues alongside which doping in cycling seems somewhat trivial .
Marty is the former state prosecutor of the Swiss canton of Ticino , and has worked for the Council of Europe investigating alleged CIA secret prisons and trafficking in human organs in Kosovo .
The background of the former Australian army officer Nicholson includes advising the Afghan government , counter - terrorism in Pakistan and Lebanon plus work for international criminal justice bodies in the Congo , Uganda and the former Yugoslavia where he was an investigator into the Srebrenica massacres .
Haas , a member of the World Anti - Doping Agency code drafting team , has worked regularly as an arbitrator for the Court of Arbitration for Sport , including the two most high - profile recent cases in cycling other than Armstrong 's that resulted in two - year bans for the Spaniards Alberto Contador â€ “ three times a winner of the Tour de France â€ “ and Alejandro Valverde ."
2014-01-18,"Early on in the new documentary film about Lance Armstrong , The Armstrong Lie , there is a montage of his greatest hits .
Any cycling fan will know how this goes : his disdainful glowering at hapless rival Jan Ullrich before powering off into the distance in 2001 ; the time a spectator 's bag snagged his handlebars and he came crashing down on the slopes of Luz Ardiden ; the oven - hot afternoon in 2003 when Joseba Beloki , another of Armstrong 's perennial fall guys , skidded on a patch of melted road tar and the American had to take evasive action by crossing a hayfield and jumping a ditch .
It is a roll of tape so familiar from countless repeats but â€ “ perhaps because it was on the big screen â€ “
I found myself unexpectedly moved by the images .
I started to follow cycling obsessively in the Armstrong era ( 1999 onwards ) and , while I never rooted for him , no one could escape the fact that he was a compelling protagonist , unlike any rider before or since .
Sitting in the dark of the cinema , I was suddenly transported back to Bastille Day in 2003 and a grotty hotel room in the south of France watching that Beloki crash on crackly French television .
The country was wilting in a heatwave and I had drawn all the curtains to avoid glare on the screen ; none of my friends , lying outside by the swimming pool , could fathom why I was spending every afternoon in a gloomy room listening to commentary
I scarcely understood .
But Armstrong unfailingly created these incidents of high drama : his ability to provoke , improvise and antagonise made him irresistible to watch .
That stage of the 2003 Tour de France remains perhaps the most thrilling , heart - racing moments of a life spent following sport .
Of course , I did not know then that Armstrong was doped up to the eyeballs as he bunny - hopped across that field on the road to Gap .
I did not know that Beloki would never fully recover from the horrific injuries he sustained that day ( and that still makes me feel queasy and guilty ) .
I did not know about Motoman , Armstrong 's drug mule .
I did not know about Armstrong 's sustained campaign of bullying and intimidation that prevented his secrets from being made public and often scarred the lives of individuals who dared to cross him .
There are plenty of fresh examples of Armstrong 's manipulative tendencies in The Armstrong Lie , which follows the cyclist 's comeback at the Tour de France in 2009 .
The most petty was his insistence that all his interviews during the race were conducted by his former team - mate Frankie Andreu â€ “ a reporter for the US network Versus â€ “ whose wife Betsy , one of Armstrong 's most persistent accusers , he had disparaged and insulted for years .
Any discussion of Armstrong quickly becomes one of the head , the heart and most other body organs .
Clearly he is morally bankrupt .
He has been stripped of the seven Tour de France titles he won between 1999 and 2005 and that is absolutely as it should be .
He cheated ; he was busted .
But I keep returning to the defiant statement Armstrong made in 2012 :
"" I know who won those seven Tours , my team - mates know who won those seven Tours and everyone I competed against knows who won those seven Tours .
"" We are encouraged to "" forget "" Lance Armstrong â€ “ that was the advice of Pat McQuaid , the UCI president who himself was booted out in disgrace last year .
The problem is that my response to the footage at the beginning of The Armstrong Lie suggests I am not quite ready or able to put a mental asterisk over all his performances just yet .
Alex Gibney , director of The Armstrong Lie , has said about his film : "" It 's about us .
How do we feel about it ?
And how do we reckon with what happened ? ""
For many cycling fans that will be anger and betrayal .
I 've never felt that .
During the Armstrong era , you had to be delusional â€ “ following the busts during the 1998 Tour and the frequent positive tests after that â€ “ to trust that cycling was a clean sport .
Detailed allegations were laid out against Armstrong in David Walsh 's book From Lance to Landis as far back as 2007 .
And those over the age of 12 who are disappointed by the moral failings of any sportsman have only themselves to blame .
Armstrong , who micro - managed everything during his career with considerable skill , appears to be finding retirement somewhat stickier .
It is now a year since Armstrong confessed to doping in his Oprah interview .
That was a disaster and everything he has tried since â€ “ the "" reconciliation "" meetings with his former soigneur Emma O'Reilly , whom he called an alcoholic and a prostitute , and two riders Christophe Bassons and Filippo Simeoni â€ “ has looked stageâ€‘managed and unconvincing .
There is a lingering suspicion , raised again in The Armstrong Lie , that the full story of his comeback races remains to be heard .
So far Armstrong has denied using performance - enhancers in the 2009 and 2010 Tours .
It is depressing and it is damning
but I can not pretend the Armstrong era did not happen â€ “ or that he is not the most exciting cyclist I have ever seen .
Purists are expected to lionise competitors from previous generations : Coppi , Merckx or ideally someone more obscure such as Luis OcaÃ±a or Franco Balmamion .
But here was a rider whose achievements on the bike were just as outsized and mythical as any that I had read about .
And I watched them with my own eyes .
I expect many will disagree but for me Armstrong is right on one point :
I know who won those seven Tours .
The Armstrong Lie is out on 31 January .
Tim Lewis 's book on the Rwandan cycling team , Land of Second Chances , is out now"
2014-01-22,"David Walsh , the award - winning chief sports writer at the Sunday Times , is to give the annual Hugh Cudlipp lecture on Monday ( 27 January ) .
It was Walsh who exposed the doping scandal that centred on the champion cyclist Lance Armstrong .
So , naturally enough , the title of his lecture will be "" My fight with Lance Armstrong : lessons for journalism . ""
Walsh is one of the most decorated of sports reporters , being named sportswriter of the year on four occasions in Ireland and three times in the UK . ""
David , like his biblical namesake , has been tireless in his battle against the Goliath of corruption in sport , "" says Paul Charman , head of special media projects at the London College of Communication ( LCC ) , which is hosting the lecture .
"" So the Cudlipp Trust and LCC , together with our new sponsors , the Daily Mirror , are delighted that David Walsh has agreed to be our eleventh annual lecturer . ""
Past speakers at the event , held in memory of the late Lord ( Hugh )
Cudlipp , include Jon Snow , Lord Grade , Paul Dacre , Andrew Marr and Alastair Campbell .
At the lecture , the winner of the latest Â£2,000
Hugh Cudlipp award for student journalism , which is also sponsored by the Mirror , will be announced .
But admission to the lecture , to be held in the LCC 's main lecture theatre , is strictly by invitation only .
It starts at 7 pm ( doors open 6.30pm ) .

2014-01-28,""" I am not an investigative journalist ...
I wish I was an investigative journalist ...
I do n't have the talent to be a sports reporter ... ""
David Walsh , the multi award - winning journalist , was not indulging in false modesty .
He was simply being honest , the character trait that has shone through all he has achieved in his career .
His confession about his supposed journalistic weaknesses was made last night while giving the Hugh Cudlipp annual lecture .
It was unlike any lecture that has gone before and it riveted the audience at the London College of Communication ( LCC ) .
Walsh , the Sunday Times 's chief sportswriter , told the story of his dogged pursuit of the cheating champion cyclist Lance Armstrong with clarity and wit .
Example of the latter : "" I am a bit of a lawyer 's nightmare because I have a conviction but no evidence . ""
That conviction - call it a hunch or an intuition - occurred in 1999 and was based on Walsh 's inside knowledge of professional cycling .
A young French rider , Christophe Bassons , had written a column for the newspaper Le Parisien in which he suggested that Tour de France riders were taking drugs .
Walsh , who had already had doubts about Armstrong 's astonishing post - cancer performances , noted how Armstrong treated Bassons .
He pulled him up during one of the Tour stages and told him he had no right to be a professional cyclist and what he was writing was bad for cycling . ""
If Armstrong was anti - doping , Christophe Bassons would have been his friend not his enemy , "" said Walsh .
"" Why bully him ? ""
It confirmed his suspicion that Armstrong , who went on to win that 1999 Tour , was a drug - taker .
It was the beginning of a 13-year journalistic odyssey .
In 2001 , he confirmed a connection between Armstrong and an Italian doctor , Michele Ferrari , who was under investigation for supplying performance - enhancing drugs to cyclists .
Walsh discovered that Armstrong 's name was in hotel registers in the town where Ferrari lived .
He wrote about it .
Nothing happened to Armstrong , but in the following years whistle - blowers came forward to provide him with more evidence , notably Armstrong 's masseuse , Emma O'Reilly .
Her accusations were the centrepiece of Walsh 's book , L.A. Confidential , written along with French sports journalist Pierre Ballester in 2004 .
Armstrong , who went on denying taking drugs , dismissed the accusations and then sued the Sunday Times over a related article , leading to the paper paying out Â£1 m in a libel settlement .
But Walsh , who found few friends and supporters among the rest of the journalistic cycling fraternity , would not let go .
He obtained more evidence from one of Armstrong 's former teammates , Frankie Andreu , and his wife Betsy .
He knew Armstrong was lying .
It was n't until June 2012 that Walsh was finally vindicated when the United States Anti - Doping Agency ( USADA ) banned Armstrong from competitive cycling for life for doping offences and said he had been engaged in "" the most sophisticated , professionalised and successful doping program that sport has ever seen . ""
In January 2013 , Armstrong appeared on the Oprah Winfrey show and admitted that he had taken drugs during every one of his seven Tour de France victories .
Walsh , who told the LCC audience several times that he refused to fall into the trap of so many sports journalists - being "" a fan with a typewriter "" - drew lessons from his experience : "" A good story is always worth pursuing "" ... "" if you 're right , good people will come out to help you "" ...
"" it 's ok to swim against the tide "" ... and Britain 's libel laws "" are seriously deficient - they have zero interest in the truth "" .
He said that he never worried about being unpopular with his peers . ""
A good story is always worth pursuing , "" he said , "" no matter how difficult pursuing it might be . ""
After Walsh 's speech , the Daily Mirror editor , Lloyd Embley , called him "" an example and inspiration to us all . ""
The Hugh Cudlipp lecture , founded in 2005 to commemorate the former Mirror group editorial director , was sponsored by the Daily Mirror .
At the conclusion , Jim Norton was named as the winner of the Hugh Cudlipp award for student journalism 2014 for an article in the Scottish edition of the Daily Mail ."
2014-02-11,"There is a possibility of a reduction in sanctions for Lance Armstrong and others who testify to the Cycling Independent Reform Commission .
The commission was set up by the UCI President , Brian Cookson , to look into the history of doping within the sport , including allegations that the governing body may have been involved in letting Armstrong off the hook over positive drugs tests .
The terms of reference of the commission were made public on Tuesday , and its chairman , David Marty , said that because the commission has the power to issue sanctions against doping offenders , those who admit doping to the commission within this year "" will benefit from a considerable reduction in sanctions "" .
He added : "" We can go as far as issuing a zero ban , but in this case we would have to validate this with the UCI and Wada . ""
The commission will , Marty said , have "" considerable flexibility in moderating sanctions depending on [ a person 's ] willingness to talk and the interest of the information they give . ""
Critically for Armstrong â€ “ and others
â€ “ there is another power , he said , for a reduction in sanctions for persons "" who admit a violation [ of anti - doping rules ] and are already the object of a sanction "" .
The commission has issued an email address through which those who wish to give evidence can contact them , but Marty would not rule out approaching key individuals .
The commission itself can not reduce a ban but can recommend to anti - doping bodies which have issued one that it be reduced .
There is also some flexibility over negotiation before a formal delivery of evidence to the commission . ""
There will not be individual negotiation with individual people beforehand , "" was the line from Cookson , but at their joint press conference Marty countered this by saying that confidential meetings for "" preliminary discussions "" could be held with those wishing to come forward .
It is possible to envisage a process in which Armstrong meets Marty , or more likely the Australian Peter Nicholson , the only full - time member of the three - man commission .
The discussions would be confidential â€ “ Marty said twice that if nothing results from such meetings "" it will be as if they never happened
"" â€ “ and Armstrong could state what he knows and whether it justifies a recommendation for a reduction in his life ban .
Marty said "" it seems obvious "" that the former UCI presidents Pat McQuaid and Hein Verbruggen would "" have an interest in meeting the commission , and that interest is shared by the commission . ""
Verbruggen and McQuaid were at the head of the UCI between 1998 - 2013 , which is the period â€ “ beginning with the Festina scandal , ending with the Usada report into Armstrong 's doping â€ “ in which the commission is particularly concerned .
The 3 m Swiss Franc commission will sit until the end of this year , although there is a possibility for that to be extended by four months under exceptional circumstances .
Cookson and Marty were keen to emphasise that it is a one - off opportunity for those within the cycling community with knowledge of doping to come forward .
The commission does not have the power to summon individuals , but "" we can invite somebody and if they do n't show up and are a UCI licence holder we can indicate that to the UCI because all licence holders are obliged to collaborate , "" said the chairman .
"" It is a window of opportunity for everyone to come forward and tell the truth under certain conditions , "" said Cookson .
"" That will only apply in the period that the commission operates . ""
The danger for those who do not come forward is that they will be named by others â€ “ if they are current riders or managers and the evidence comes out after the end of the commission process , that would probably count against them .
The commission will also have the power to pass on evidence that might result in a criminal trial to the relevant authorities ."
2014-03-20,"The man credited with exposing Lance Armstrong as a drug cheat has warned world cycling 's governing body that it is running out of time to overhaul the sport in the wake of successive doping crises .
Travis Tygart , the United States Anti - Doping Agency chief executive whose investigation placed Armstrong at the centre of the "" most sophisticated , professionalised and successful doping programme that sport has ever seen "" , said the UCI needed to accelerate its Cycling Independent Reform Commission if faith in the sport was to be restored .
"" Time is of the essence , "" he said .
"" We have been pounding this issue in the press , in front of the EU , in front of the French senate , the German parliament , that now is the time to take and fulfil the promise that the UCI leadership made , to take decisive and transparent action . ""
In my opinion another day ca n't go by until it is put in place in proper fashion and this process starts . ""
Since Armstrong was banned for life in August 2012 , Brian Cookson has replaced the under - fire Pat McQuaid as president of the UCI and set up the CIRC , which will also examine the role of the governing body in fostering a culture of doping .
The independent three - person panel has published its terms of reference and promised to report by the end of January next year .
Riders and others involved in the sport , including coaches and team directors , have been promised reduced sanctions if they agree to co - operate .
Tygart said there were 37 redacted names in the original Armstrong judgment that it was in talks with the CIRC about handing over and said the names would become public if doping charges were eventually brought . ""
Just because you change the top the dirty system does n't necessarily change and when you 've got potentially doctors , team owners
â€ “
I 'm speculating on the evidence that we saw , on the co - conspirators that we charged and the evidence we obtained , "" added Tygart .
"" When you 've doped in the past with success , particularly as a doctor , team owner and coach , director , and you 've never been exposed , the likelihood that you are going to continue that practice of doping and not getting caught is huge . ""
Martin Gibbs , the UCI director general who was appointed shortly after Cookson became president in September last year , said that the independent commission , headed by the Swiss politician Dick Marty , should be judged on results .
"" We must not pretend it 's already fixed .
We are acutely aware we have to make a difference now in key areas with the independent commission , "" he said .
"" We are a sport that has had an omerta about doping . ""
Tygart , who revealed that Usada had been in talks with Armstrong as recently as November about being involved with the process , said the Texan 's refusal to co - operate need not undermine the CIRC .
"" Most of the material and information that he has has already been brought out .
I think it is unfortunate that he chose not to co - operate .
Everyone deserves a second chance , "" said Tygart , speaking at the Tackling Doping in Sport conference at Wembley Stadium .
"" From a reputational and a rehabilitation standpoint I hope that he comes in and helps clean up to the extent that his information is still valuable for that . "" From a reputational stand point it would absolutely be the best thing for him . ""
Tygart said that he believed Armstrong became part of a "" sophisticated scheme to defraud "" by American business interests that may have found another way to flourish had the Texan not emerged as its standard - bearer . ""
This was a sophisticated scheme to defraud , they raised a lot of money , had incredible cash flow , and all based on victories in a sport and an incredible story , "" Tygart added .
"" But I 'm also not convinced it was just limited to an Armstrong story , I think American enterprise decided to come over and capitalise financially on the Tour de France in the US . """
2014-04-17,
2014-04-20,"David Walsh , the multi - award - winning journalist responsible for exposing champion cyclist Lance Armstrong as a drug - taker , is bubbling with excitement .
He is about to see a preview of the movie depicting the scandal , which will give him the rare , if daunting , experience of watching someone portray him on screen .
The film , directed by Stephen Frears and as yet without a title , stars Ben Foster as Armstrong with the Irish actor Chris O'Dowd playing Walsh .
It is based on his book , Seven Deadly Sins : My Pursuit of Lance Armstrong , which was published last year .
Walsh is most enthused , however , about Dustin Hoffman having a small part .
"" I love that , "" he says , "" because he was in All The President 's Men . ""
That ranks as one of the best movies ever made about reporters struggling to tell the truth in the face of widespread scepticism , Walsh 's own experience .
Although he would not dare to compare himself to Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein , it is not stretching matters to do so .
He spent 13 frustrating years trying to tell the truth about the man considered to be one of the world 's greatest sporting heroes .
Armstrong was feted for winning the Tour de France seven times , among other achievements , and was lionised for his victories on returning to cycling after surviving cancer and founding an international cancer charity , now known as the Livestrong Foundation .
By the time Armstrong returned from illness to win the 1999 tour , Walsh already knew he was guilty of doping .
In fact , he says , "" it was all a drug - addled circus and journalists who also knew that were part of the fraud , reporting on the cyclists as if they were heroes when they knew they were not "" .
He recalls phoning his Sunday Times sports editor , Alex Butler , to tell him that Armstrong had won by using drugs . ""
Alex said , ' oh no ' because he was dreading the reaction from readers , "" says Walsh , who was n't able to do much more than raise suspicions at the time .
"" I suffered vitriol from people for that piece .
One wrote to say , ' you have the worst cancer of all â€ “ cancer of the spirit . '
That really penetrated my exterior wall . ""
Butler prevailed on him to obtain evidence and the modest Walsh , who always stresses that he is a sportswriter and not an investigative journalist , says he had no idea how to go about the task .
In fact , as he recounts the way in which he pursued the story , following up clues , building the confidence of contacts and hunting down more sources , it amounts to an object lesson in investigative journalism .
Meanwhile , most of the other journalists who covered cycling â€ “ scathingly referred to as "" fans with typewriters "" â€ “ looked away . ""
That played into my hands , "" says Walsh , "" because they preferred to pass on witnesses and whistleblowers to me . ""
In 2001 , Walsh confirmed a crucial connection between Armstrong and an Italian doctor , Michele Ferrari , who was under investigation for supplying performance - enhancing drugs to cyclists .
His big breakthrough was in persuading Armstrong 's masseuse , Emma O'Reilly , to tell what she knew .
Her accusations were the centrepiece of Walsh 's book , L.A. Confidential , written with a French sports journalist , Pierre Ballester , in 2004 .
Though the book was published in France , it fell foul of English libel laws .
Instead , Walsh wrote an 11,000-word treatment of it for the Sunday Times , an episode that says a great deal about his strength of character .
The Sunday Times 's lawyers advised that it was impossible to publish .
"" It was explosive stuff , "" recalls the paper 's then deputy sports editor , Alan English .
"" The lawyers said the risk was too great . ""
Walsh protested that it was all true , prompting the lawyer , Alistair Brett , to respond with that well - known legal catch-22 : "" The greater the truth , the greater the libel . ""
Once he realised that the paper would not use his piece , Walsh resigned .
"" It was incredibly sad .
I was so upset . ""
English says : "" He was so distraught .
He felt he had let down his sources and thought it was the only honourable course of action .
He is so determined and principled . ""
It says much for how highly they regarded Walsh that Butler , English and the paper 's then editor , John Witherow , agreed a compromise .
English rewrote Walsh 's article , subbing it down to 2,200 words , and then persuaded his friend and colleague to rescind his resignation .
Yet despite the article being given a legal OK , Armstrong sued successfully for libel , costing the paper more than Â£1 m in damages and costs ( the Sunday Times and Walsh reached a "" mutually acceptable "" but confidential settlement in August 2013 with the by now disgraced cyclist ) .
Back then , says Walsh , "" journalists would dismiss me , saying ' David , you 've produced only circumstantial evidence . '
So I kept asking them , ' what 's the difference between circumstantial and direct evidence ? '
"" In May 2010 , he was trekking in the Himalayas when he received a call from Butler in London .
One of Armstrong 's former teammates , Floyd Landis , had admitted to doping and accused Armstrong of the same .
Walsh took six hours to reach an internet cafe .
"" It was the most enjoyable walk I 've ever made in my life , knowing I was going to write the story I 'd waited six years to tell . ""
Armstrong 's lies began to dissolve from that point on as the journalist revealed more details of the doping conspiracy involving his cycling team .
Walsh admits to having been obsessed during the years when he was prevented from telling the truth .
He remembers an incident in an airport queue when he spotted a man wearing a Livestrong wristband .
"" I went up to him and said , ' do you realise that the guy you 're supporting is a complete fraud ? '
He looked at me as if I was an alien and stepped back in the queue to get away from me . ""
People often talk about me having remarkable perseverance .
But it was easy for me to persist .
I know this comes across as arrogance , and I really do n't want that , but I always knew I was on the side of the truth , so it was n't a challenge to persevere .
It was just natural .
I thought , ' people just have to know this guy is a liar and a fraud . ' ""
Walsh accepted from early on in his journalistic career that telling the truth could prove unpopular .
As a young reporter on the Leitrim Observer in the west of Ireland , he spotted a Gaelic football player committing a violent foul .
He was the only journalist to see it and report it , even though he knew readers â€ “ and the man responsible â€ “ would be upset .
He had dreamt since the age of six of being a sportswriter and has revelled in being able to cover a range of sports : football , golf , rugby , athletics , horse - racing and , of course , cycling .
"" I just hope I never stop being a journalist , "" he says .
"" The sportswriting is fine but journalism is all about that business of comforting the afflicted and afflicting the comfortable .
That 's what we should be doing .
"" It appears that he 's about to become unpopular all over again .
Next week , he reveals , "" I 'll be pursuing a fantastic story of corruption in British sport .
It will appal people and I know it will be incredibly difficult to get into print . ""
He confided some details and I can see why it is likely to prove explosive .
Alex Butler , be prepared ."

2014-05-08,"Sheffield Doc / Fest 2014 will host a new documentary from Martin Scorsese alongside stories of doping cyclists , moon - landing astronauts and the skulduggery of the tabloid newspaper trade .
The documentary festival , now in its 21st year , will feature the first public screening of Scorsese 's A 50 Year Argument , which goes behind the scenes at the New York Review of Books , the venerable journal of literature , culture and politics .
Scorsese 's film joins Alex Holmes 's Stop at Nothing :
The Lance Armstrong Story , in which ex - confidants of the disgraced cyclist spill the beans on the drugs scandal that saw him stripped of his seven Tour de France titles .
In the peloton with Holmes 's film is Adrian McCarthy 's Rough Rider , which also tackles cycling 's need for speed at any cost .
The Last Man on the Moon will also touch down at the festival .
It 's a study of astronaut Eugene Cernan , the last person to stand on the moon 's surface , in the final Apollo mission in 1972 .
Cernan will be in Sheffield , alongside other guests including Grayson Perry , John Pilger and Jon Snow .
Former Daily Star reporter and stand - up comedian Rich Peppiatt will appear with One Rogue Reporter , his attack on the tabloid newspaper industry .
Sheffield Doc / Fest launches on Saturday 7 June with the European premiere of Florian Habicht 's Pulp :
A Film About Life , Death and Supermarkets .
Filmed in and around Sheffield , Habicht 's film mixes shots of Pulp 's 2013 homecoming gig with footage of daily life in Sheffield .
Another musical highlight is Kim Longinotto 's Love is All , which includes a live soundtrack by Richard Hawley .
The film follows previous Sheffield premieres From the Sea to the Land Beyond and The Big Melt in combining BFI archive material ( this time on the theme of love and courtship on screen ) with live performance .
British bands Saint Etienne and Summer Camp will also perform at the festival .
Saint Etienne will be playing the score for How We Used to Live , Paul Kelly 's documentary about vanishing London , while Summer Camp will recreate their soundtrack to Guardian contributor Charlie Lyne 's film essay Beyond Clueless , a treatise on 90s teen movies that premiered at SXSW this year .
The 21st Sheffield Doc / Fest runs from 7 - 12 June 2014 ."
2014-05-17,"Fans of cinema are fast becoming experts on the subject of competitive cycling and its associated doping scandals .
Thus , hot on the wheels of The Armstrong Lie comes this tragic account of the rise and fall of Italian legend Marco Pantani , who could beat anyone on the climbs , but careered downhill after a blood test at the 1999 Giro d'Italia took the sheen off his golden reputation .
While Alex Gibney wrestled entertainingly with slippery Lance Armstrong ( who turns up here in archive , and is branded "" the real wound "" ) , Erskine 's moving documentary must portray its conflicted subject in absentia , with friends and relatives ( his mother is heartbreaking ) reporting his disillusionment with the world of cycling , which he tellingly branded "" a mafia "" .
The film sidesteps any definitive conclusions , and the dramatised reconstructions jar , but you 're left with the impression that the charismatic Pantani was more sinned against than sinning ."
2014-06-13,"Lance Armstrong has been questioned under oath for the first time since he admitted doping in an Oprah Winfrey interview last year .
Armstrong , 42 , was deposed on Thursday in an arbitration case by SCA Promotions , which is looking to recoup $ 12 m tied to bonuses for three of his Tour victories between 2002 and 2004 , Jeffrey Tillotson , a lawyer for SCA , said .
Tillotson declined to comment on details of the deposition .
Armstrong , who was stripped of his seven Tour de France victories and banned from professional cycling in 2012 , was questioned by lawyers for SCA on the same day a federal judge in Washington agreed to put on hold a 23 June deposition of Armstrong by US government lawyers in a whistleblower lawsuit brought by Floyd Landis , his former team - mate .
The judge , Robert Wilkins , said he expects to rule within a week on a request by Armstrong to dismiss the lawsuit .
The Texas Supreme Court last month cleared the way for Armstrongâ€ ™ s deposition in the SCA case when it refused to overrule a trial judge who had allowed SCA to reopen a closed arbitration case against Armstrong .
SCA paid Armstrong $ 7.5 m in an arbitration settlement in 2006 , after he fought an attempt to withhold prize money because of allegations that he had cheated in the 2004 Tour de France .
During those proceedings , Armstrong testified under oath that he had never used performing - enhancing drugs , according to SCA .
Tim Herman , Armstrongâ€ ™ s lawyer , declined to comment on Thursdayâ€ ™ s deposition .
SCA , based in Dallas , sued last year after Armstrong told Winfrey he had cheated in every single Tour de France victory he won .
In November , Armstrong settled a separate case by Acceptance Insurance over $ 3 m in prize money it had paid him the day before he was scheduled to be questioned under oath , Mark Kincaid , a lawyer for the insurance company , said on Thursday .
In the whistleblower case , Wilkins said in November that he was inclined to let at least some of the lawsuit go forward .
The deposition that was set for 23 June could be reset if he allows the case to proceed ."

2014-07-02,"Cyclingâ€ ™ s
lengthy battle with its doping demons has led to the emergence of a surprising variety of personal memoirs , but most have one thing in common : to a greater or lesser extent they are self - serving , with the writer â€ “ be it David Walsh , Lance Armstrong , Tyler Hamilton or Christophe Bassons â€
“ pushing an agenda of their own , either from the view of the campaigner , or the insider seeking to restore his reputation .
Emma Oâ€ ™ Reillyâ€ ™ s account , The Race to Truth , has a different feel to it .
Oâ€ ™
Reilly was the soigneur ( masseuse ) to Armstrong and his US Postal Service team at the start of his domination of the Tour de France and went on to provide evidence of his and the teamâ€ ™ s doping â€ “ although critically , not the smoking gun that came later from his team - mate Floyd Landis .
The difference is that , even when Oâ€ ™ Reilly was within Armstrongâ€ ™ s inner circle , as a woman in a manâ€ ™ s world and a soigneur who did not buy into the doping culture she was still an outsider .
But having built a life within that world , she was a reluctant witness , as I well remember having spoken to her at the time of her original testimony .
The picture that emerges through Oâ€ ™ Reilly and her ghostwriter Shannon Kyle is a chaotic one .
The professional cycling world is not as shiny as it seems to outsiders â€ “
the tale of the grumpy mechanic who dislikes the riders doing â€œnumber twosâ€ � in his camper vanâ€ ™ s toilet might be the pick here
â€ “ and the labour of a soigneur is â€œ24/7 , exhausting and freneticâ€ � , although the traditional role of the â€œcarerâ€ � â€ “ massage , elementary first aid and counselling â€ “ clearly appeal .
As the only female soigneur in cycling ( not quite the first , but the only one in the 1990s ) there is the inevitable everyday sexism .
â€œItâ€
™ s changed now and I hope Iâ€ ™ ve helped be part of that change ,
â€ � she tells the Guardian .
â€œI only ever got into it because it was a role I enjoyed , I loved the work , the excitement , the travel .
I was treated more like a little sister by all the lads on the team .
Yet I felt I was like their big sister .
I was feeding them , massaging them , cleaning them up after they crashed , making sure they had clean clothes so it was a quite a caring relationship we had .
â€œOn a personal level the advantage of being the only woman was that I didnâ€ ™ t have to room share .
I could go to my nice quiet room at night.â€ �
Still more chaotic is the legal fallout from the interview she gave to Walsh in 2003 , which formed the central element in his and Pierre Ballesterâ€ ™ s book LA Confidential , the beginning of the lengthy process ending in Armstrongâ€ ™ s unveiling by the US Anti - Doping Agency .
The picture is one of constant legal wrangling , in which she was â€œtrapped by egos on all sides : Lance , David , the lawyers , all trying to outsmart , argue against , influence and control each other while I was stuck in the middle of it .
It was insaneâ€
� .
The pressure contributed to the break - up of her marriage and of a second long - term relationship .
It is hard not to be moved by the depiction of her former boyfriend Mike Carlisle simultaneously attempting to support his partner as the multiple writs flew in and Armstrong defamed her as an alcoholic sleepabout , while also trying to cope with the debilitation of progressive multiple sclerosis .
Ironically , given Walshâ€ ™ s depiction of himself as the white knight in the battle against the demon king Armstrong , the journalist comes out of her story poorly ; Oâ€ ™ Reilly ended up feeling that she had turned into a pawn in his campaign .
She writes of Walsh : â€œHeâ€ ™ d hung me out to dry â€ “ but worse than that , the publisher had even openly warned him of the impact this would have on my life and had recommended proper support .
Something I feel
I never got.â€ �
When Walsh later refers to the initial interview he did with her as â€œhis Christmasâ€ � , Oâ€ ™ Reilly rolls her eyes and thinks :
â€œYes
David , your Christmas was at my expense.â€ �
Of all the depictions of Armstrong over the years
, this is the most empathetic , unrelenting in its depiction of the doping monster , yet ultimately it is also forgiving .
He is nicknamed â€œCotton Pickerâ€ � ; she loves his politically incorrect sense of humour .
â€œMy relationship with Lance was and still is a human one , â€ � says Oâ€ ™ Reilly .
â€œLance became a friend who happened to be a rider , we both looked out for each other on the road .
We would spend up to 18 hours a day together for up to a few weeks , that creates a deep bond .
So throughout the bad times I tried to remember his good side .
â€œI donâ€ ™ t know if Iâ€ ™ d have been able to cope if I focused on the negative attacks .
I also tried to remember that the reason I spoke out was bigger than Lance ever was ; people were dying and lives were being destroyed .
Now
itâ€ ™ s nice again between Lance and I
, we speak regularly and
itâ€ ™ s gone back to how easy it used to be between us.â€ �
They were reconciled at the end of last year ; the foreword to the book is written by Armstrong himself , the ultimate twist in the tale perhaps .
â€œThe legal stuff and its impact is I feel only now being lifted , â€ � says Oâ€ ™ Reilly .
â€œI knew in my heart of hearts that I had done the right thing morally , but I felt I deserved some punishment for breaking the omertÃ .
â€œThe relief when Lance admitted on Oprah that I had been telling the truth was like a physical release .
I never knew until then just how much it had affected me.â€

The Race to Truth , Blowing The Whistle on Lance Armstrong and Cyclingâ€

Doping Culture :
My Story by Emma Oâ€ ™ Reilly , is published by Transworld Books , price Â£16.99"
2014-07-04,"When the Usada announced that it had stripped Lance Armstrong of his seven Tour de France titles , my response was one of relief .
In developing Pedal Pusher , our play about the dark years of the Tour de France around the millennium , I had become increasingly convinced that Armstrong â€ “ along with the other high profile professional cyclists of his era
â€ “ had used illegal drugs to improve his performances .
How was it that a relatively unknown kid from Texas was beating the whole of the EPO ( recombinant erythropoietin ) generation ?
Was it simply that Armstrong trained harder than the others ?
Or was it that somehow through recovering from cancer Armstrong had developed physiological and psychological advantages that placed him head and shoulders above the rest ?
Drugs have always been part of professional cycling , and the culture that expected cyclists to do whatever it took to maximise their performance existed long before Lance Armstrong .
The question of who doped and who didnâ€ ™ t was , to a certain degree , immaterial .
The real issue was the systematic doping of riders by team doctors , and expectation and bullying of team leaders .
This meant that the only way aspiring young riders could realistically compete at a high level was to take drugs .
The only way to stay clean was not to race .
There are many reasons why Armstrong should be vilified .
But perhaps it is time for us to step back and see Armstrong both for the fraud that he was , and also as cyclingâ€ ™ s most high profile drugs victim .
Maybe in the end he got what he deserved , but there are many others who used the same techniques and broke identical rules who were caught and received lesser penalties .
While it was always a personal decision whether or not to dope â€ “ and there were many cyclists who rode clean or chose not to race rather than take the drug â€ “ we have to judge Armstrong in the context of the culture that dominated the sport .
But in the end , Armstrong rode faster than any of his rivals , and won the worldâ€ ™ s most famous bicycle race seven times in a row .
The questions of how he won so decisively are not answered by his EPO use alone .
He was the very best of a bad bunch .
Many people now characterise him as one of the sporting worldâ€ ™ s greatest cheats , but those who do should consider the words of Armstrongâ€ ™ s closest rival Jan Ullrich .
Several months after Armstrong confessed publicly to Oprah Winfrey , and the secret that had been long suspected was suddenly front page news , Ullrich finally admitted to using EPO throughout his career .
â€œIn my view you can only call it cheating on my part when it is clear that I have gained an unfair advantage , â€ � Ullrich said .
â€œThat was not the case .
All I wanted was everyone to have the same chances of winning.â€ �
Perhaps most telling is the fact that when Armstrong was stripped of his Tour de France victories , the race organisers chose not to award the winners titles to any of his rivals .
How far would they have needed to go down the race standings to find a rider who was clean , given that so many of the top riders were using performance enhancing substances .
His years on the bike may have been characterised by fraud and lies , but in the end the only unremarkable thing about Armstrongâ€ ™ s otherwise remarkable career was that he took drugs .
Roland Smith is co - artistic director of Theatre Delicatessen and creator of critically acclaimed play , Pedal Pusher ; the true story of Lance Armstrong , Marco Pantani and Jan Ullrichâ€ ™ s battle to become champion of the Tour de France which is showing until Sunday 7 July at the University of Sheffieldâ€ ™ s outdoor arts space , Furnace Park"
2014-07-04,"Each of the Tour de Franceâ€ ™ s visits to Britain presents an amusing snapshot in time .
Seven years ago , at Ken Livingstoneâ€ ™ s
London Grand DÃ
© part , Bradley Wiggins was a track specialist , Mark Cavendish had only just ended his spell as a â€œfat bankerâ€ � and Chris Froome was riding under-23 races while based at the Union Cycliste
Internationaleâ€ ™ s centre in Aigle , Switzerland .
Team Sky was a gleam in the unknighted Dave Brailsfordâ€ ™ s eye , Lance Armstrong was still a seven - times winner of the race , and the sport was trying to heave itself painfully out of the anti - doping morass after Floyd Landisâ€ ™ s positive test .
The one - day visit in 1974 , when the Tour sped glumly up and down the Plymouth bypass , sits firmly in the Cinderella era .
To push the metaphor further , 1994 , when the Tour spent two days in the south in front of massive , enthusiastic crowds , can be seen as the point when cycling received its invite to the ball â€ “ a pointer to what could be achieved , with the public appetite obvious but untapped , and Chris Boardman beginning the career that would be a key factor in the arrival in 1997 of Lottery funding ( the fairy godmother , if you will ) .
That in turn would kick off the sequence of events that gave us a raft of Olympic gold medals and , ultimately , two Tour wins .
The year 2007 was when the glass slipper fitted and this week , the fairytale transformation from ashes to riches looks to be complete .
That can be measured in all kinds of ways , rippling out from the Tour start here â€ “ an entire county ( and many of its sheep ) clad in yellow â€ “ and across the British cycling pond : vast crowds at Wednesday nightâ€ ™ s town - centre races in Otley , with an amusing little echo of last yearâ€ ™ s Orica team bus debacle at the Tour when a fire engine failed to make it under the finish gantry , and an explosion of events two - wheeled across the entire country .
Plus a sustained expansion in the number of televised events on the domestic cycling calendar and a boom in wider participation further down the ladder , not to mention public debate about whether Sir Bradley Wiggins should be riding with Froome at Sky .
As David Millar put it recently
â€ “ and how he will be missed here
â€ “ the question when a man with a farmerâ€ ™
s
tan and shaved legs says he is a pro cyclist is no longer
â€œand
what do you actually do for a living?â€ � but â€œwhat team do you ride for?â€ � Welcome to the mainstream , Cinderella .
On paper , this Tour is a three - way fight : Chris Froome versus Alberto Contador with Vincenzo Nibali waiting to pounce should either or both falter .
Each has different qualities and stems from a different cycling tradition .
The Kenyan - born Froome is the slightly awkward Anglo - Saxon newcomer at the 111-year - old party , with the clinical expertise and dynamism of Team Sky behind him , while Contador and Nibali are just the latest in the lines of cycling stock that produced Miguel Indurain , Pedro Delgado , Felice Gimondi and Fausto Coppi .
â€œAlberto rides a different style of race than Chris , â€ � said the Australian Richie Porte this week .
â€œChris watches the power [ output ] , whereas Alberto takes the race on .
Chris takes the race on too and is not afraid to attack , but his efforts are a bit more gauged .
He knows what sort of power output he can hold for an amount of time .
Alberto races more on feel .
He is very aggressive.â€
�
Porteâ€ ™ s verdict is that â€œthere is no denying that Alberto is far stronger than he was last year .
We will really have our hands fullâ€ � .
Team Sky face some serious questions , on and off the road .
The Wiggins victory of 2012 was the consummate example of their controlling style , while last year they benefited from Contadorâ€ ™ s lack of zip and Nibaliâ€ ™ s preference for an attempt on the Giro instead .
This year , though , they will be everyoneâ€ ™ s target .
Lurking in the background is Brailsfordâ€ ™ s controversial decision to leave his fellow knight of the realm Wiggins at home , which is a simple quit or bust .
If Froome wins , it will have been the right call .
If Froome falls off and Sky are left leaderless , or if Froome loses through lack of support , Brailsfordâ€ ™ s unwillingness to attempt to unite the pair on the road will be seen as a rare blot on his escutcheon .
Skyâ€ ™ s issues do not end there .
Last year , they got their message across poorly in the face of the doping questions â€ “ most of them based simplistically and unfairly on the premise that riding strongly in itself is suspicious â€ “ and 12 months on the decision to race Froome at the Tour de Romandie with a therapeutic use exemption for a corticosteroid will be thrown back at them .
In one sense that is unfair , because no one knows what TUEs other teams are riding with or have ridden with , but the peril of taking occupancy of the high moral ground , while failing to be consistent with it , is that you can become an easy target .
The three leading personalities have been given a perfect stage for the battle between the structured machine that is Sky and the more anarchically minded Contador and Nibali .
Since 2007 , when he took over at the helm from the conservative Jean - Marie Leblanc , the race organiser Christian Prudhomme has had two goals : to keep the race visually attractive for television and to ensure that there are few quiet points in the 22-stage soap opera .
This yearâ€ ™ s route is his most radical yet and it is mouthwatering from day oneâ€ ™ s passage over the scenic glories of Buttertubs and Grinton Moor .
Sundayâ€ ™ s second stage into Sheffield is possibly the toughest leg so early in the race since 1977 with a sawtooth profile that would have been unimaginable for a first - weekend stage a few years back .
Prudhomme has taken the race back to the cobbles of northern France , which have always served up drama and controversy in the race , but they are beefed up compared to their last appearance in 2010 .
The second weekendâ€ ™ s racing in Vosges â€ “ if we include the Mondayâ€ ™ s stage to La Planche des Belles Filles â€
“ is the toughest passage through that mountain race the Tour has ever known , the organiser believes .
The Alps are pared down , the Pyrenees beefed up , and as the ultimate twist , the 2014 Tour resembles the 2011 race , won by Cadel Evans , in having just one solo time trial , on the penultimate day .
â€œItâ€ ™ s going to be really interesting tactically given that weâ€ ™ ve got the time trial right on stage
20,â€ � said Froome in the buildup .
â€œIn theory I donâ€ ™ t need to be out there making the racing that early on.â€ � Nibali , Contador â€ “ and outsiders such as the world champion Rui Costa and the American hope
Andrew Talansky â€
“ know they will have to dislodge Froome and Sky , and the joy of this yearâ€ ™
s course is that they might just have the roads on which to achieve it .
An early time trial â€ “ such as last yearâ€ ™ s at Mont Saint - Michel â€ “ can kill suspense .
The 2011 event , on the other hand , remained right in the balance until the penultimate day and saw constant twists in the plot in the final few days .
It also saw a Frenchman , Thomas Voeckler , finish well up the standings after a long spell in the yellow jersey , and sceptics might claim that Prudhomme has made this route with one eye on the lack of any Frenchmen capable of competing with the best against the watch .
Thatâ€ ™ s not all they have been looking at in France ; without a Tour winner for 28 years now , there is more than a little interest , and some envy , chez nos amis franÃ§ais in the fairytale transformation in things two - wheeled on this side of the Channel ."
2014-12-19,"Lance Armstrong , who was accused of being the ringleader of the most sophisticated doping programme cycling had ever seen , has revealed he would be left heartbroken if he ever cheated at golf .
A keen golfer with a handicap of 10 , Armstrong admits to playing 250 rounds a year but whereas not playing by the rules in cycling led to him being stripped of his seven Tour de France titles , the thought of doing so on the golf course does not bear thinking about .
In an interview with Golf Digest , Armstrong said : â€œYou might consider me the last guy to have anything to say about cheating , but golf is different .
I love adhering to a code of honour that we in cycling didnâ€ ™ t have .
â€œIf
I moved my ball in the rough and got caught , I wouldnâ€ ™ t just regret it , Iâ€ ™ d be heartbroken forever .
When I think about reform in cycling , I think about golf.â€ �"
2015-01-16,"1 ) Lance Armstrong apologises to Oprah To err is human , to forgive is divine : athlete messes up , then fronts up before the media to express contrition and ask for mercy .
In a world where even the most nimble feet are often made from metaphorical clay , the public apology has long been a sporting staple .
Many are utterly sincere , others not so much .
Some are forced , quite a few are unnecessary .
Then thereâ€ ™ s the vague non - apology , where â€ “ through gritted teeth
â€ “ a sportsman or woman who clearly feels theyâ€ ™
ve done little wrong apologises to anyone â€œifâ€ �
they were offended .
One of many , a personal favourite came in 2013 from cyclist Peter Sagan , who famously issued one notable classic of the genre , when after publicly goosing podium girl Maja Leye in the wake of the Tour of Flanders , he tweeted that it â€œwas not my intention to disrespect women today on the podium .
Just a joke , sorry if someone was disturbed about it.â€ � Splendid .
Mastering the mea culpa can be tricky and for all his drug - assisted success as a cyclist , Saganâ€ ™ s
one - time colleague Lance Armstrong has yet to get the hang of it .
Having been railroaded into admitting his guilt and role as ringleader in the most sophisticated drugs operation in cycling history , the disgraced seven - times Tour de France winner agreed to prostrate himself before his public in an eagerly anticipated and pre - recorded televised interview with noted cycling enthusiast and take - no - prisoners interrogator Oprah Winfrey .
Weâ€ ™
ve all seen it by now .
Finally owning up to having cheated his way to victory in a lengthy exchange that prompted almost as many new questions as answers , the Texan looked uncharacteristically uncomfortable as he confessed to much , if not all of the skulduggery that had enabled him to pedal his way to glory in Paris on all seven occasions , while steadfastly refusing to implicate any of those who had helped him along the way .
His battle against cancer and good works for charity were mentioned regularly , while in keeping with his persona as the bully he admitted to being , it was notable that at times , despite his best efforts , Armstrong just couldnâ€ ™ t stop himself sneering and smirking his way through an apology that occasionally seemed heartfelt , but more often than not suggested he was really sorry for himself , his dwindling bank balance and his rotten luck in getting caught .
2 ) Phil Taylor apologises to Raymond van Barneveld For all his undisputed excellence and indefatigability as a sportsman
, 16-times world darts champion Phil Taylor can sometimes be difficult to admire .
Occasionally more spiky in victory than other players are in defeat , his occasional habit of patronising opponents and interviewers can be wearing , although it should be noted that he could scarcely have been more magnanimous in defeat during his press conference following his most recent World Championship reverse at the hands of Gary Anderson .
It was in stark contrast to his reaction at the end of his semi - final victory over Raymond van Barneveld in the same competition late in 2012 .
Having hit double 16 to win the match and put an end to a thrilling comeback by his close friend and rival , Taylor was suitably delighted and celebrated in front of a crowd that had rowed in behind the Dutchman as he clawed his way back into the match from 5 - 1 down to make it 5 - 4 .
As Barney took his hand to shake it , Taylor was happy to accept the congratulations , but his pleasure turned to indignation and then outright irritation as Barney continued shaking , yanking him backwards as he refused to let go of his hand , before throwing a congratulatory arm around his shoulder .
Ducking out of the embrace , Taylor proceeded to tell Barney to â€œfuck offâ€ � , then subjected his vanquished and clearly bewildered opponent to another torrent of abuse as they left the stage .
Another conciliatory gesture from Barney was rejected and Taylor walked off alone , effing and jeffing as Barney was restrained from following him by match officials .
It was all quite baffling .
The following morning , Taylor couldnâ€ ™ t have been more contrite .
â€œWell , Iâ€ ™ m a bit gutted about what happened at the end , obviously , â€ � he said in an interview with Sky Sports News .
â€œTrying to put the record straight , Raymond is a big lad .
I donâ€
™ t feel too well and he just hurt me a bit when he was squeezing me hand and pulling me around the neck .
I reacted wrongly , it was disgraceful really
and I can only apologise for that .
Obviously it will never happen again .
He just hurt me a bit
so I told him â€˜stop
itâ€ ™
and I swore at him â€ ¦
ugh.â€ �
At this point Taylor rubbed his face , in a bid to hide his shame , his obvious embarrassment evident for all to see .
â€œIâ€ ™ ve spoken to Raymond this morning and Iâ€ ™ m gutted , obviously , â€ � he continued .
â€œItâ€
™ s playing on my mind ,
itâ€ ™ s upset a lot of people
â€
¦
I donâ€
™ t know what to do about it really .
At the minute I could just walk away tomorrow night and just retire â€ ¦ go out on top really .
Iâ€ ™ m
a bit disillusioned about everything at the minute .
Obviously I donâ€ ™ t feel very well
so really I need a break .
To be honest I donâ€ ™ t care about the darts at the minute .
I know Iâ€ ™ m in the final
but I donâ€
™ t feel excited , I donâ€
™ t feel chuffed about being in the final â€ ¦ I feel very , very down at the minute.â€ � Taylor emerged from his slough of despair to beat Michael van Gerwen 7 - 4 in the following dayâ€ ™ s final , his 16th and most recent victory in a tournament
he shows no sign of abandoning .
Having been one of just a handful of players to offer Van Barneveld support when he was the victim of a Dutch blackmailer in 2010 , Taylor was not about to be cut loose by his old pal .
â€œWe go back a long way , and I donâ€
™ t want to spoil many years of friendship over a split - second reaction after a tense world championship semi - final , â€ � said Barney , who claimed to be mystified by what it was exactly he had done to send Taylor into such a bizarre tantrum .
3 )
Eric Cantona apologises to an imaginary prostitute Following the tsunami of moral outrage prompted by his assault on Crystal Palace fan Matthew Simmons in January 1995 , Eric Cantona didnâ€ ™ t so much have the book thrown at him as the entire contents of the British Library .
As well as being convicted of assault and receiving a two - week jail sentence that was later overturned and reduced ( or increased , depending on your point of view ) to 120 hoursâ€ ™ community service , the French striker was stripped of the French captaincy and handed a four - month ban and Â£20,000 fine by his club at the behest of the Football Association .
Inevitably , he was also summoned to a hearing at the headquarters of the FA , whose chairman Graham Kelly described an attack many fans found genuinely hilarious as â€œa stain on our gameâ€ � .
Truth be told , Cantona didnâ€
™ t do himself too many favours , as the then FA chief executive David Davies would later recall in his memoirs .
Standing before FA blazers Geoff Thompson , Ian Stott and Gordon McKeag , the normally recalcitrant player appeared to be on his best behaviour and his exercise in contrition was going well .
It began with an apology to the commission , then apologies to Manchester United , his lawyer Maurice Watkins and boss Alex Ferguson .
So far , so humble .
â€œI like to apologise to my team - mates .
I want to apologise to the FA , â€ � he continued , showing what appeared to be genuine remorse .
And finally ?
According to Davies , Cantona finished up by saying : â€œAnd I would like to apologise to the prostitute who shared my bed last night.â€ �
To the sound of jaws hitting the floor and the great surprise of nobody , his ban was doubled and he was fined an extra Â£10,000 .

Joey Porter apologises to everyone except Kellen Winslow Following a midweek win over the Cleveland Browns in December 2006 , Pittsburgh Steelers linebacker Joey Porter found himself in hot water after ridiculing the vanquished side and subjecting their tight end Kellen Winslow to some off - colour homophobic abuse .
In a post - game interview , Porter labelled his opponent a â€œfagâ€ � , adding that Winslow had â€œtried to dap me up [ shake hands ] before the game .
Heâ€ ™ s soft though , I donâ€ ™ t pay attention to him.â€ � Porterâ€ ™
s
outburst was not over the Cleveland
manâ€ ™ s
attempted friendly greeting before the game , but in response to what he perceived to be a late hit on a team - mate perpetrated during proceedings , which seemed a bit rich coming from a man who , three years later while playing for the Miami Dolphins , would be voted the joint - second dirtiest defensive player in the league by 296 of his peers .
â€œIt was late , â€ � said Porter of the tackle .
â€œThatâ€
™ s what fags do .
Heâ€ ™ s soft .
He wanna be tough but heâ€ ™ s really soft .
He tried to give me a handshake before the game .
Heâ€ ™ s not my friend .
He donâ€
™ t know me .
What you trying to shake my hand for ?
He talks too much and he hadnâ€ ™ t done nothing .
He threw a cheap shot .
Heâ€
™ s weak .
Heâ€ ™ s for real weak .
Heâ€ ™ s soft .
He might want to play receiver because he donâ€ ™ t want to play tight end .
Heâ€
™ s not gon na block anybody.â€
�
The following week , Porter issued an apology â€ ¦ of sorts .
In a classic of the non - apology apology genre , he said sorry to anybody who had been offended by his remarks , explaining that he had only meant to insult the player at whom they had been aimed .
â€œYou know , that was probably a poor choice of words ,
â€ � he said .
â€œSo if I offended anybody , I apologise for that â€
¦
I donâ€
™ t know â€
¦
I guess because how we used that word freely , me growing up using that word , I didnâ€ ™ t think anything of it .
Like I said , I apologise to anyone I may have offended .
I didnâ€
™ t mean to offend anybody but
Kellen Winslow.â€ �
So thatâ€ ™ s alright , then , although if nothing else you canâ€ ™ t help but admire the manâ€ ™
s candour .
The NFL were less impressed and fined Porter $ 10,000 for what they called â€œvulgar , inexcusable statementsâ€ � .
Three months earlier , Porter had been forced to issue a more sincere and unreserved apology , when two of his dogs â€ “ a pit bull and a mastiff â€ “ escaped from his garden and killed a miniature horse at a neighbouring property .
â€œI have reached out to the owners of the horse and will do whatever I can to help them get through this very unfortunate situation , â€ � he said .
It was an unfortunate situation he was forced to help another neighbour â€œget
throughâ€ � while playing for the Arizona Cardinals in 2011 .
On this occasion , according to the Bakersfield Californian , four of his dogs savaged and killed a luckless hound .

Andrew Flintoff apologises to England cricket fans Andrew Flintoff seems to have spent much of his cricket career apologising for assorted indiscretions , even if his occasional forays into the world of amiable , often drink - fuelled buffoonery have served only to further endear him to those who like their sporting heroes served up with generous dollops of human failing .
Just this week , the former England all - rounder tweeted an apology to viewers of Ten Sport TV in Australia , after a stump microphone caught him castigating himself in the strongest possible terms after missing a shot while batting for the Brisbane Heat in the Big Bash .
Like many of the likable all - rounderâ€ ™ s gaffes , it was no big deal , but in a world where taking offence appears to have become a popular pastime , itâ€ ™ s probably better to be safe than sorry .
Flintoffâ€ ™ s most famous apology came in 2007 , when after a night on the lash with some team - mates in St Lucia in the wake of a Cricket World Cup defeat at the hands of New Zealand , he decided it would be a good idea to join Ian Botham for a nightcap .
Flintoff was walking along the beach at the time and believed the Sky Sports pundit to be attending a soiree on an unspecified boat moored further out at sea .
â€œI thought : â€˜I canâ€ ™ t swim â€ ¦ that would be dangerous ,
â€ ™
so I was going to get a kayak , â€ � Flintoff would later tell Piers Morgan in an episode of Life Stories .
â€œI
couldnâ€ ™ t find the oars , so I dragged this pedalo into the water .
The next morning I woke up ,
I was on my bed and â€ ¦
still wet and â€
¦ sand between my toes.â€ � Oops .
Reports vary on what exactly happened between the moment Flintoff dragged his vessel into the water and woke up in his hotel room , not least because there seems to be a very good chance he doesnâ€ ™ t actually remember .
While he insists he never actually set sail , the general consensus appears to be that at some point he fell out or off of it and had to be rescued and helped ashore .
Whatever happened , the metaphorical fallout was spectacular : the still bedraggled Flintoff was summoned to the hotel room of England coach Duncan Fletcher , stripped of the England vice - captaincy , dropped for Englandâ€ ™ s next game and subsequently forced to explain himself to members of a press pack who almost certainly couldnâ€ ™ t believe their luck .
â€œIâ€
™ m embarrassed and ashamed , â€ � announced a chastened Flintoff , who looked genuinely contrite .
â€œIt shouldnâ€ ™ t have happened .
Thereâ€ ™ s no secret
we had a few drinks on Friday .
Itâ€ ™ s been documented in the press what happened afterwards with a little bit of poetic licence .
There was water involved and a pedalo as well .
But I donâ€ ™ t want to go into detail .
I donâ€
™ t think my life was in danger.â€ �
During his long walk of shame across the hotel lobby into the press conference , Flintoff admitted that he was unable to make eye contact with England fans â€œwho were only months previously cheering my name and high - fiving meâ€ �
but were now â€œshaking their headsâ€ � .
A few minutes later , on the return journey , the same supporters greeted him with loud applause .

Tiger Woods apologises to a hand - picked audience When it emerged in 2010 that Tiger Woods had spent years philandering with a bevy of cocktail waitresses , porn stars and assorted other cliches behind the back of his wife Elin Nordegren , the golfer laid low for a couple of months before attempting to pitch his way out of the bunker of shame in which heâ€ ™ d found himself with his sand wedge of regret .
In front of a carefully hand - picked gathering made up of sympathetic press , friends , business associates and his mother , among others , the golfer proceeded to apologise for everything while admitting very little in a televised mea culpa that lasted almost 10 minutes and pointedly referenced his many good works for charity before concluding with one of his all - too - regular broadsides at the media for bothering his family .
Quite why Woods felt the need to apologise to so many people for something that was absolutely none of their concern remains unclear , although he did offer a clue .
â€œAs
Elin pointed out to me , my real apology to her will not come in the form of words , â€ � he said .
He wasnâ€ ™ t wrong ; it came in the form of a divorce settlement estimated in some quarters to be as much as $ 750 m ."
2015-01-16,"I once struggled up Mont Ventoux during a sportive and joked to the rider overtaking me that if the road got any steeper I could at least climb off and walk .
Judging from his expression , I might as well have told him his wife was having an affair with Lance Armstrong .
The implication was obvious â€ “ if I got off and walked , Iâ€ ™ d be guilty of the ultimate cycling heresy .
When I got home , the first question I was asked â€ “ by cyclists and non - cyclists alike â€
“
was had I made it all the way to the top without walking .
As if by walking for maybe just a few hundred metres of the 21 km climb , Iâ€ ™ d have rendered my achievement null and void .
Iâ€ ™ ve never understood this mentality .
Faced with the choice of running out of gears on a steepening slope â€ “ with the risk of grinding to a complete standstill and toppling sideways to the ground â€ “ or simply walking up the steep bit and remounting when the gradient eases , surely itâ€ ™ s a no brainer ?
After all , walking isnâ€ ™ t as unethical as taking a tow , being pushed or jumping in a taxi .
You are still progressing under your own steam , but using a different set of leg muscles .
And ironically , with some of the latest , ultra - low gearing thatâ€ ™ s now available for sportive riders , you wouldnâ€ ™ t necessarily be moving any more slowly than they are .
You could even argue that , compared with a cyclist using such performance - enhancing , technical trickery as a triple chain ring and dinner plate - sized , 34-tooth sprocket , your achievement was purer .
Yet despite this , one rider I know who got off and walked during his first ever group ride felt so humiliated he has never been on a group ride since .
So why is it frowned upon by so many ?
According to Chris Balfour , who runs training camps in the Pyrenees , the problem is partly to do with road cyclingâ€ ™ s recent and rapid transition from an egalitarian , inclusive sport to â€œthe new golfâ€ � , where phoney etiquette and cosmetic detail is everything .
He says : Some of the snobbery and sneering which exists towards riders using â€˜granny gearsâ€ ™ or who occasionally walk is really quite divisive and disappointing .
We should celebrate [ cyclingâ€ ™ s ] â€˜everymanâ€ ™ appeal , not slide to the worst of golfing â€˜etiquetteâ€ ™ where newer and less able players are excluded or mocked behind their back in the clubhouse bar for â€˜having the wrong swingâ€ ™ or â€˜wearing the wrong gearâ€ ™ .
And anyway , surely getting off and walking is acceptable if even professional riders sometimes do it ?
Some of the biggest names in the professional peloton were memorably reduced to doing exactly that during the Tirreno - Adriatico stage race two years ago .
Roger Hammond , Britainâ€ ™ s highest ever finisher in the toughest one - day race on the calendar , Paris - Roubaix , and now manager of pro team Madison Genesis , was forced to dismount and walk up the steep and slippery Koppenberg during the 2009 Tour of Flanders .
His advice to anyone thinking of doing the same is :
Itâ€ ™ s
nothing to be ashamed of and not a failure , weâ€ ™ ve all been there .
Try your best to avoid it though : preparation is the key , make sure you study the profiles of your proposed route and adjust your gearing to suit before you start .
Always take into account fatigue and bad weather .
Itâ€ ™ s always better to ride if you can .
Chris Boardman , Olympic gold medalist , multiple Tour de France prologue winner and British Cyclingâ€ ™ s policy advisor , is even more encouraging : Failure is a subjective term : is it a fail if you have to get off and walk up a hill ?
Or a win because youâ€ ™ ve bitten off more than you can chew and are doing it anyway ?
I tend to lean heavily towards the latter .
Some of the biggest technology improvements in bikes in recent years have been around gears .
With 11 speed cassettes and three rings at the front , itâ€ ™ s possible to carry gears that will let you ride slower than walking if necessary with virtually no weight penalty .
Having to walk just means , a ) you learned something about bikes , or b ) you are pushing yourself to do something challenging .
Either way , in my book , thatâ€ ™ s a win .
As for my own experience on the slopes of Ventoux , I eventually made it to the top under my own steam .
Whether I walked any of it or not , should that really matter ?"
2015-01-22,"Greg LeMond has rejected calls for Lance Armstrongâ€ ™ s life ban to be reduced , saying : â€œIf thereâ€ ™ s anybody who deserves a ban , itâ€ ™ s
this guy.â€ �
LeMond told a news conference in Adelaide , where he is attending the Tour
Down Under cycling race
, that Armstrongâ€ ™ s doping activities â€œtook a good 10 years out of my lifeâ€ � .
He said the seven - times Tour de France winner was punished not just for doping but for the way he treated people who accused him before he finally admitted his guilt .
â€œI believe everyone deserves a second chance but
itâ€ ™ s like he was positive one time , admitted it and said he was sorry .
Itâ€ ™ s repeated cover - ups .
Thereâ€ ™ s nothing like it in the history of cycling.â€
� LeMond , the 1986 , 1989 and 1990 Tour champion , fell out with Armstrong when he began raising doubts about whether his compatriot was racing clean .
Armstrong eventually admitted to doping in an interview on the Oprah Winfrey Show in 2013 .
â€œWe had a decent relationship , but since 2001 weâ€ ™ ve not had any relationship .
Iâ€ ™ m not one that holds a grudge but Iâ€ ™ m also realistic with who Iâ€ ™ m dealing with and heâ€ ™ s not really shown any remorse for what heâ€ ™ s done , â€ � LeMond said .
â€œThatâ€ ™ s not about doping but about what heâ€ ™ s done to peopleâ€ ™ s lives , destroyed them .
He took a good 10 years out of my life.â€ �
Armstrong was stripped of his seven Tour de France titles and banned for life by the UCI , the sportâ€ ™ s governing body , in 2012 after the US Anti - Doping Agency accused him in its â€œreasoned decisionâ€ � of running â€œthe most sophisticated , professionalised and successful doping programme that sport has ever seenâ€ � while at US Postal Service .
â€œIf anyone deserves a life ban â€ ¦
Ben Johnson got a life ban in 1988 and relative to that he wasnâ€ ™ t involved in the conspiracy to cover up stuff .
I donâ€
™ t think thereâ€ ™ s ever been a cyclist who has ever been involved in that level of deception .
Itâ€ ™ s unfortunate , â€ � LeMond said .
Asked if Armstrongâ€ ™ s ban should be reduced , LeMond said :
â€œWhatâ€ ™ s the point , so he can race amateur races ?
He can do his own races .
If thereâ€ ™ s anyone who deserved a ban itâ€ ™ s this guy .
Otherwise whatâ€ ™ s the point in rules?â€ �
LeMond also accused Armstrong of trying to force him out of the sport , saying : â€œCycling was my life and it was a major attempt to make sure that I was excluded from it .
Even from the Tour de France at one point .
â€œThatâ€ ™ s pretty hard when you have one guy really focused on eliminating you .
It was very stressful but itâ€ ™ s really the way he treated me , and I and donâ€ ™ t like being threatened or bullied , so I was willing to risk everything.â€ �"
2015-01-22,"Only 10 days after Sir Dave Brailsford revealed his vision for the next five years at Team Sky an unwelcome spectre from the past cropped up again when the teamâ€ ™ s former doctor Geert Leinders was given a life ban by anti - doping agencies for a hefty string of infringements relating to the period before he joined Sky .
There have never been any allegations of improper practice relating to Leindersâ€ ™ s spell at Sky in 2011 and 2012 , but the 42-page arbitration ruling on the doctorâ€ ™ s time at the Dutch Rabobank team from 2002 - 09 was detailed and damning .
The case was based principally on the testimony of two former Rabobank riders , the Dane Michael Rasmussen and Levi Leipheimer of the US , who revealed Leindersâ€ ™ s role in doping when questioned by the US anti - doping agency in connection with Lance Armstrong in 2012 .
Leipheimer and Rasmussen received reduced bans for co - operation with the inquiring agencies , Usada and the Danish and Dutch equivalents .
Testimony from four unnamed cyclists at Rabobank was also cited .
Leinders , who had been a board member at the Rabobank team as well as their doctor , was charged by Usada and the others in 2013 with possession , trafficking and administering banned substances including the blood - booster erythropoietin , testosterone , insulin , DHEA and corticosteroids ; with administering blood transfusions , and with covering up anti - doping violations .
An arbitration hearing took place in August 2014 at which the doctor , who denied the claims , was not present .
Commenting on the decision , Usadaâ€ ™ s chief executive , Travis Tygart , said : â€œIt shocks the conscience that a board member and team doctor would abuse his trusted position by overseeing and participating in this type of dangerous and fraudulent activity .
As we said from the beginning of our cycling investigation , ridding those in the system who attempt to justify doping as a means to an end is the only way to truly clean up cycling for current and future generations of athletes.â€ �
Rasmussen â€ “ who was thrown off the Tour de France in 2007 because of disparities in the information he gave over his whereabouts for out - of - competition testing â€
“ claimed that Leinders assisted him with blood transfusions during the 2004 and 2005 Tours de France and the 2007 Giro dâ€ ™ Italia , that Leinders wrote false medical certificates to enable him to use cortisone , and that the doctor helped him dope with insulin .
Leipheimer said that Leinders had helped him dope with EPO at the 2002 and 2003 Tours de France .
Both athletes alleged that Leinders had recommended they attempt blood transfusions using the blood of family members .
Leinders worked for Sky on a consultancy basis in 2011 and 2012 , having been hired in October 2010 , after the team amended its publicly stated policy of not recruiting doctors with experience of professional cycling in an attempt to make a clean break with cyclingâ€ ™ s doping past .
The policy was rethought , Sir Dave Brailsford later explained , after the death from a blood infection of a team carer , Txema GonzÃ¡lez , during that yearâ€ ™ s Vuelta .
Leinders was given a contract for up to 80 daysâ€ ™ work for Sky after being interviewed by the teamâ€ ™ s head of medical , the psychiatrist Dr Steve Peters .
He put in 67 days at the team in 2011 .
In 2012 he worked for Sky for 44 days before a former director at Rabobank told the press there had been a doping programme at Rabobank and Leinders had been part of it .
Sky mounted an internal inquiry to assess Leinders and the doctorâ€ ™ s contract at Sky was not renewed at the end of the year .
â€œWe welcome this decision which relates to Dr Leindersâ€ ™ time at Rabobank ,
â€ �
a Team Sky spokesman told the website cyclingnews.com .
â€œAs is well known Dr Leinders did work at Team Sky on a freelance basis for a short period .
â€œAlthough nothing improper happened during his time at Team Sky we have acknowledged many times that it was a mistake to hire him .
We would never have done so had we had any suspicions or knowledge of his past
and we have reviewed our recruitment processes and checks as a result.â€ �"
2015-01-26,"More than two years since Lance Armstrongâ€ ™ s television interview with Oprah Winfrey , the disgraced seven - times Tour de France winner has said that , if he were in the same position as he was 20 years ago , he would again dope to win bike races .
In reply to the BBC sports editor , Dan Roan , Armstrong said : â€œMy answer is not a popular answer .
If I was racing in 2015 , no , I wouldnâ€ ™ t do it again , because I donâ€ ™ t think you have to .
If you take me back to 1995 , when it was completely and totally pervasive , Iâ€ ™ d probably do it again .
People donâ€ ™ t like to hear that .
When I made the decision â€ “ when my team - mates made that decision , when the whole peloton made that decision â€ “ it was a bad decision and an imperfect time .
But it happened.â€ �
Interviewed as part of a BBC documentary to be shown later this week , Armstrong did , however , offer something that began to resemble an apology for his misdeeds , although it came with the same defence that he has offered since the end of 2012 â€ “ that his doping was a generational phenomenon .
â€œIf
I go back to 1995 â€ “ and some started earlier , some a little later , but
letâ€ ™ s take that as ground zero
â€
“ I think weâ€ ™ re all sorry .
And do you know what weâ€
™ re sorry for ?
Weâ€
™ re sorry that we were put in that place .
None of us wanted to be in that place .
We all would have loved to have competed man on man , bread , water , naturally clean , whatever you want to call it .
â€œWeâ€ ™ re sorry
, weâ€ ™ re sorry that we were put in a place and we looked around as desperate kids and thought : â€˜God , Iâ€ ™ ve got to go back to Plano [ his birthplace in Texas ] and maybe go back to school , or get a job , or work in a bike shop or work in a factory.â€ ™ â€ �
Armstrong added that , while he would not row back on his decision to begin doping in 1995 , he would change the way he behaved to those who stood up to him , such as the whistleblower Emma Oâ€ ™ Reilly , his fellow cyclist Filippo Simeoni and the writer David Walsh .
â€œI would want to change the man that did those things , maybe not the decision but the way he acted , the way he treated other people.â€ �
With the Cycling Independent Reform Commission on the sportâ€ ™ s doping past due to report next month , the Texan confirmed that he has met with its members , on two occasions : â€œThey have asked me not to go into details , but everybody knows I have met with them , so that is not a secret .
I think
itâ€ ™ s safe for me to say that whatever questions they asked , I told .
â€œA lot of it is out there .
So I donâ€
™ t know if thereâ€ ™ s a whole lot out there left , but I was totally honest , and I was totally transparent.â€ �"
2015-01-28,"Oh , how glorious it would be if musicians would think before they spring their bright ideas on the world .
If maybe they realised that having a platform doesnâ€ ™ t mean it has to be used .
The latest offender is Tim Commerford , the former bassist of Rage Against the Machine and Audioslave , whose new group Future User have released a song called Mountain Lion , featuring a spoken word interlude ( and video appearance ) from one of Commerfordâ€ ™ s friends .
That friend happens to be Lance Armstrong .
The song , the rock site Blabbermouth says , â€œis about the [ US ] governmentâ€ ™ s attempts to use the controversy surrounding performance - enhancing drugs as a distraction from their own global sinsâ€ � .
Armstrongâ€ ™ s role is a voice message in which he tells a steroid - injecting skateboarder : â€œYou better step the fuck off me , motherfucker .
Seven oâ€ ™ clock here in Aspen , Colorado ,
Iâ€ ™ ve been training like a motherfucker .
So fit , so yoked , so technically astute â€ “ you could never hang .
Step the fuck off .
Lance.â€ �
Commerford told Rolling Stone : â€œThe amount of attention given to PEDs is incredible , especially when you consider the amount of drugs â€ “ recreational , illegal and pharmaceutical â€ “ that America supports and profits
from.â€
�
He also spoke about his friendship with Armstrong â€ “ â€œan awesome person and , as far as Iâ€ ™ m concerned , a punk rockerâ€ � â€ “ with whom he â€œtrash talksâ€ � about their cycling rivalry .
You want to put your friend in your video ?
Thatâ€ ™ s fine .
No oneâ€ ™ s stopping you .
But there are a couple of things Commerford needs to be set straight about .
First , Lance Armstrong was not brought down as a result of a US government conspiracy to draw attention away from its failures .
In fact , a great many brave people had been trying to draw attention to doping in cycling for years , and Armstrong â€ “
that â€œawesome
personâ€
�
â€ “ had systematically bullied them , lied to them , sued them .
The US government , surprisingly , was not at the forefront of this campaign against cheating in sport .
Only in 2010 , 11 years after Armstrong had told the rider Christophe Bassons to leave the sport instead of â€œmaking accusations [ about drug use ] that arenâ€ ™ t good for cyclingâ€ � did the US Justice Department begin a federal investigation to see if crimes had been committed , followed a year later by the US Anti Doping Authority pursuing the allegations against Armstrong .
As he has admitted , if he hadnâ€ ™ t himself returned to cycling in 2009 , he would have got away with it .
Second , Commerford is raising a straw man with his point about the usage of other kinds of drugs .
Plenty of attention is given to the issue of over - prescription of big pharma products , and there has been no shortage of publicity about illegal drugs , but the debates around them are completely different conversations .
Most importantly , PEDs have one very specific purpose : to cheat others .
Thatâ€ ™ s why sports fans get angry about athletes taking them .
Itâ€ ™ s not necessarily that theyâ€ ™ re anti - drugs , is that theyâ€ ™ re anti - drugs that distort the nature of sporting competition .
You might find many sports fans who would even take the position that PEDs should be made legal , and that all athletes should take what they want as long as theyâ€ ™ re prepared to suffer the long - term health consequences .
What they donâ€
™ t like is some people playing dirty and some people playing clean .
Itâ€ ™ s called cheating , and it destroys what sport is meant to be about .
Thereâ€ ™ s also the issue of Armstrongâ€ ™ s increasingly bizarre public stance on his years of lying , cheating and bullying .
Two years after he apologised for his actions on
Oprah Winfreyâ€ ™ s TV show , he has told the BBC â€ “ in an interview to be broadcast on Thursday â€ “ he thought
heâ€ ™ d been punished too much , that he wasnâ€ ™ t a ringleader or a bully , and that if you took him back to 1995 heâ€ ™ d dope all over again .
Tie that in with this video and its beginning to look like Armstrong doesnâ€ ™ t realise
heâ€ ™ s done anything wrong .
Tim Commerford , of course , is not alone in offering support to people who absolutely donâ€ ™ t deserve it .
Take Primal Scream and their unedifying habit at the start of this century of dedicating songs to the Serbian warlord Arkan , who carried out unimaginable crimes of ethnic cleansing during the Bosnian war .
And thereâ€ ™ s an argument to be made that part of the very gaiety of rockâ€ ™ nâ€ ™ roll
comes from people spouting their mouth off idiotically about things they really donâ€ ™ t have a great grasp of .
No one wants their musicians to sound like focus grouped politicians , insisting that plans for the second album are very much on track and that they have listened to the public and are committed to delivering an album of sensible music to the hard working families of Britain .
But in this case , Iâ€ ™ m not absolutely convinced Commerford is stupid .
I think
thereâ€
™ s a large element of him being willing to do absolutely anything to draw attention to his music ( a previous video featured John McEnroe being waterboarded ) .
But I also suspect he genuinely thinks the same way as Armstrong , that sportâ€ ™ s most notorious cheat has been done over in the name of something that doesnâ€
™ t matter â€ “ if he didnâ€ ™ t , itâ€ ™ s hard to believe heâ€ ™ d use him in the video .
And thatâ€ ™ s not stupid ; itâ€ ™ s wrongheaded ."
2015-02-04,"Lance Armstrong has been caught lying .
Again .
He got his girlfriend to take the blame for a car accident that was his fault .
Why do some people seem to habitually lie ?
What follows is just a theory , Iâ€ ™ m not saying itâ€ ™ s fact , but it is the narrative I use to make sense of lying .
Unless you are on the autistic spectrum and donâ€ ™ t know how , everybody lies ; it is partly how we all get along .
If a dear friend asks my opinion of his art while at the opening of the exhibition and I really find it plodding and ugly , I will point to one that is less horrible than the others and say , I like that one the best .
Now , that may be lying , so shoot me if I shouldnâ€ ™ t do it .
A lie can be like a temporary bit of tape you put across a relationship for a second or two .
You might be asked : â€œDo you mind making supper tonight?â€
�
And you might reply â€œNo , Iâ€ ™
ll do itâ€
� , just to take the stress off the other person , even if a part of you does mind .
Even when Iâ€ ™ m chatting about the weather , I probably unconsciously really mean , Iâ€ ™ m friendly
and I want contact with you .
So if you want to be pedantic about it , you could even see the exchanging of pleasantries as lying .
As humans , part of our basic biology is a need to bond and form attachments with other humans .
The best way of doing this is usually to be as congruent as possible .
Take babies .
Babies donâ€
™ t lie , a baby just is and the parents or earliest caregivers respond to the baby and meet their needs .
However , what if the baby was only responded to if it behaved a certain way ?
Then it would have to hide the parts of itself that didnâ€ ™ t seem acceptable and exaggerate the parts that were .
This type of adaptation is an innate survival skill .
What if , in fact , what the caregiver gave the baby the most positive attention for was when it was â€œthe bestâ€ � ?
It might feel as though it was a unique deity , somehow the normal rules wouldnâ€ ™ t apply to it because itâ€ ™ s so special and it has to stay special , it has to be the best , because if itâ€ ™ s not the best no one would care for it .
Now , itâ€ ™ s not as though this belief system is known on a conscious level , but I believe it is felt by those who think they are above the rules and norms of society .
And lying is a strong weapon to maintain the illusion of being special .
You can also be trained to lie by being punished for telling the truth .
Did you eat the last chocolate ?
Yes .
That was very selfish .
Oh , the humiliation that could have been avoided by saying â€œit wasnâ€ ™ t meâ€ � .
And so the punished child learns to lie , which can become a habit .
It can seem like a strategy that works , at least at first .
Habits can become addictions .
There is a thrill in deceiving others
â€ “
it underlines your superiority as you managed to fool them .
And you might get hooked on that thrill .
But , like all addictions , it can go wrong as it traps and entangles you .
Most of us develop adaptations to fit in and to thrive in our first environments and when the landscape changes , sometimes we hang on to old strategies that no longer work for us .
But the trouble is those adaptations are the only ways we know how to be and we are not even aware of them .
Armstrong may be an unsympathetic character and heâ€ ™ s difficult to like , but what if he has been trained to be that way and doesnâ€ ™ t know how to change ?
After all , perhaps it is working well for him ."
2015-03-09,"A damning report published on Monday shows how cyclingâ€ ™ s world governing body , the UCI , colluded with Lance Armstrong from 1999 to 2009 to circumvent accusations he doped and to cement his status as the pre - eminent personality in the sport .
The report reads : â€œThere are numerous examples that prove Lance Armstrong benefited from a preferential status afforded by the UCI leadership â€ ¦ UCI did not actively seek to corroborate whether allegations of doping against Lance Armstrong were well - founded [ but ] fell back to a defensive position as if every attack against Lance Armstrong was an attack against cycling and the UCI leadership â€ ¦ there was a tacit exchange of favours between the UCI leadership and Lance Armstrong , and they presented a common front.â€ �
The tone was set at the episode in the 1999 Tour de France when Armstrongâ€ ™ s doctors provided a backdated prescription for cortisone after he tested positive for the drug .
â€œThe UCI failed to apply its own rules â€ ¦ which constituted a serious breach of its obligations â€ ¦ to govern the sport correctly , â€ � states the report .
Among the other main points in the report are : â€¢ Doubts about the current health of the peloton after â€œthe commission did not hear from anyone credible in the sport who would give cycling a clean bill of healthâ€ � â€¢ Fears that â€œdoping in amateur cycling is becoming endemicâ€ � â€¢ Worries that â€œbiological passportsâ€ � are enabling riders to dope better The report , by the Union Cycliste Internationalâ€ ™ s Independent Commission for Reform in Cycling , concludes the governing body bent its own rules , as it adds : â€œDirect contact was initiated between high - level UCI officials and the Armstrong entourage , during which the latter was advised to produce a medical certificate
â€
¦ when a medical certificate was produced â€ ¦
it should have been obvious to UCI that [ it ] â€ ¦ was backdated and solely provided to justify a posteriori the traces of triamcinolone found in the riderâ€ ™ s urine .
Therefore , disciplinary proceedings should have been opened.â€ �
It continues : â€œHis doctor issued a certificate where not only was the date wrong but also what it attested .
The CIRC considers that it was a case of a false medical certificate and therefore the case should have been reported to the criminal authorities.â€
�
The CIRC was set up soon after the arrival of Brian Cookson as the head of the UCI in September 2013 .
It was made up of the Swiss politician Dick Marty , the anti - doping specialist Ulrich Haas and the former Australian military man Peter Nicholson , who were given a brief of looking into the sportâ€ ™ s doping past , and in particular allegations that the UCIâ€ ™ s relationship with Armstrong was corrupt .
Those who have been interviewed include Armstrong himself , the former UCI presidents Hein Verbruggen and Pat McQuaid , and current team heads Bjarne Riis and Alexander Vinokourov .
The 1999 race , billed as the â€œTour of Renewalâ€ � following a doping scandal involving the Festina team the previous year , marked the first of the Americanâ€ ™ s seven Tour wins and in retrospect was a missed opportunity by the UCI to nip the Armstrong drugs saga in the bud .
Damagingly , the report infers that the 1999 cortisone episode was common practice , as the UCI â€œappeared to have a policy of accepting backdated prescriptions and to be lenient in applying the rules on therapeutic use exemptions [ TUEs ] .
The practice was justified by arguing that , from a health perspective , it made little difference whether the prescription was provided before or after testing .
Prescriptions were seen by riders as a means of covering up positive tests results.â€ � TUEs allow riders to use prescribed prohibited substances for the treatment of legitimate medical conditions .
Letting Armstrong off the hook in 1999 was only the beginning and proved doubly damning for the UCI when allegations of EPO use by Armstrong surfaced in later testimony to the US Anti - Doping Agency from his former colleagues Tyler Hamilton and Floyd Landis .
Armstrong was tested five times during the 2001 Tour of Switzerland and the samples analysed at a laboratory in Lausanne .
According to the report , â€œthe laboratory made the following comment : â€˜strong suspicion of the presence of recombinant erythropoietinâ€ ™ â€ � though it declared the samples negative .
The report adds : â€œSeveral sources indicated that Lance Armstrong and his entourage were informed by the UCI of these suspect test results shortly after receipt of the results by the laboratory .
Through the 2000s , as Armstrong became ever more successful and famous , and as doping allegations piled up , â€œthe suspicions of doping were sufficient to justify target testing Lance Armstrong by all competent agencies .
UCI should have â€ ¦ been circumspect in its relations with the athlete .
However , the CIRC considers that former [ UCI ] presidents actually initiated a special relationship with Lance Armstrong and failed to establish a more distant relationship
â€ ¦
Special consideration was allowed for Lance Armstrong and , to return the favour , Lance Armstrong was used in UCIâ€ ™ s battles against various third parties on different fronts.â€ �
The report adds that Armstrong assisted the UCI president Hein Verbruggen in his dispute with the World Anti - Doping Agency head Dick Pound in 2004
â€ “ an open letter from Verbruggen to Pound in January 2004 was drafted by Verbruggen and Armstrongâ€ ™ s agent â€ “ and that the UCI â€œworked with the riderâ€ ™ s
lawyersâ€ � during his legal cases against the Sunday Times and its journalist David Walsh and the insurance company SCA , â€œobtaining statements
and/or affidavitsâ€ � â€ ¦ â€œand to respond to accusations of doping and defend the effectiveness of UCIâ€
™ s anti - doping policy.â€ �
Armstrong issued a statement in response to CIRCâ€ ™ s findings in which he apologised for his actions .
â€œI am grateful to CIRC for seeking the truth and allowing me to assist in that search , â€ � it read .
â€œI am deeply sorry for many things I have done .
However , it is my hope that revealing the truth will lead to a bright , dope - free future for the sport I love , and will allow all young riders emerging from small towns throughout the world in years to come to chase their dreams without having to face the lose - lose choices that so many of my friends , team - mates and opponents faced .
I hope that all riders who competed and doped can feel free to come forward and help the tonic of truth heal this great sport.â€ �
Last month Armstrong was ordered to pay $ 10 m ( Â£6.5 m ) in his dispute with SCA for an â€œunparalleled pageant of international perjury , fraud and conspiracyâ€ � that covered up his use of performance - enhancing drugs .
The reportâ€ ™ s conclusion is the UCIâ€ ™ s relationship with Armstrong could not be described as corrupt .
However , CIRC concluded the UCI â€œdid not act prudentlyâ€ � in soliciting and accepting financial donations from Armstrong , particularly because he was suspected of doping .
In 2002 Armstrong had donated $ 25,000 towards the UCIâ€ ™ s costs for drug testing and in 2007 a further $ 100,000 towards a drug - testing machine .
In 2008 Verbruggen requested a further Â£100,000 towards drug - testing costs but the report found â€œno evidence to prove that Lance Armstrong complied with this requestâ€ � .
A particularly damaging passage of the report covers events after an inquiry by lâ€ ™ Equipe in 2005 alleged the blood booster erythropoietin had been found when Armstrongâ€ ™ s urine samples from the 1999 Tour had been tested for research purposes .
The UCI commissioned an independent report from the Dutch anti - doping consultant Emile Vrijman , which cleared Armstrong of wrongdoing .
CIRC revealed the UCI president , Pat McQuaid , instructed Vrijman to restrict his inquiries to the â€œformal irregularitiesâ€
� , which led to lâ€ ™ Equipe getting data enabling it to conclude its inquiry .
CIRC concludes : â€œUCI specifically excluded from Emile Vrijmanâ€ ™ s mandate an examination of the EPO test â€ ¦ UCIâ€ ™ s primary concern was not to examine the veracity of the allegations and the consequences thereof but to restrict the inquiry from the outset to procedural issuesâ€ � .
Still more damning is the fact Armstrongâ€ ™ s lawyer Mark Levinstein was involved in drafting the report .
Levinstein , CIRC says , â€œinserted substantial amounts of text â€ ¦ to make [ the interim report ] more critical of Wada and criticising in detail the credibility of the [ French doping agency]â€ ™ s methods and procedures , citing numerous alleged deficienciesâ€ � .
Further mark - ups of the report went to Verbruggen , then vice - president of the UCI , and he â€œthen proceeded to draft an executive summary of the report for which he received extensive input from Mark Levinsteinâ€ � .
CIRC states : â€œUCI , together with the Armstrong team , became directly and heavily involved in the drafting of the Vrijman report â€ ¦
The main goal was to ensure the report reflected UCIâ€ ™ s and Lance Armstrongâ€ ™ s personal conclusions .
The significant participation of UCI and Armstrongâ€ ™ s team was never publicly acknowledged , and was consistently denied by Hein Verbruggen.â€ �
There were other instances of collusion , notably when Armstrong returned to racing in 2009 .
The UCI bent its rule that an athlete had to be in the anti - doping pool for six months before competing in order to allow him to ride the Tour
Down Under in Australia .
â€œUCI failed to apply its own rules , â€ �
states CIRC , â€œâ€ ¦ sending the message rules applied differently to some athletes.â€ �
There was , says CIRC , no direct evidence that a change of heart over the matter by McQuaid was down to Armstrongâ€ ™ s decision to ride the Tour of Ireland
â€ “ run by McQuaidâ€ ™ s brother Darach , and facing financial issues â€ “ but â€œdocuments show a temporal link â€ ¦ in the morning Pat McQuaid told UCI staff he had decided to let Lance Armstrong participate in the Tour
Down Under , and that same evening
Lance Armstrong told McQuaid that he had decided to participate in the Tour of Irelandâ€ � .
According to the report : â€œMr Armstrong agreed to ride in the Tour of Ireland for free.â€ � Armstrongâ€ ™ s attorney Elliot Peters added in statement : â€œLance Armstrong co - operated fully with CIRC .
He met in person for two full days with CIRC senior investigators , including Peter Nicholson and Ulrich Haas , answered every question they asked without any restrictions , agreed to meet again if they wanted , and provided all documents requested to which he had access .
â€œLanceâ€ ™ s sole interest in doing so was to facilitate the emergence of the truth about cycling .
While Lance has borne the brunt of anti - doping enforcement efforts and attendant negative publicity ( and consequences ) , the truth is that the sport he encountered in Europe in the 1990s was a cesspool where doctors , coaches and riders participated daily in doping and covering up doping .
â€œYoung riders on elite teams competing in Europe faced a simple choice : dope and lie about it or accept that you could not compete clean .
We applaud CIRC for taking a courageous and unvarnished look at the truth .
In the rush to vilify Lance , many of the other equally culpable participants have been allowed to escape scrutiny , much less sanction , and many of the anti - doping â€œenforcersâ€ � have chosen to grandstand at Lanceâ€ ™ s expense rather than truly search for the truth.â€

2015-03-09,"The course of cycling through this decade and well into the next is likely to be dictated by two weighty documents and two key dates : the Usada â€œReasoned decisionâ€ � into Lance Armstrong and the US Postal Service team on 10 October 2012 , and the UCIâ€ ™ s Independent Commission on Reform in Cycling , which reported on 8 March 2015 .
The CIRC report will not provide the end to the Armstrong saga but if Usada was the end of the beginning , this is surely the beginning of the end of that story , with various bits to be tied up , primarily the future of the former UCI president , Hein Verbruggen , for whom the 228 pages should have made extremely uncomfortable reading , backed up by Mondayâ€ ™ s condemnation from his successor Brian Cookson .
If Usadaâ€ ™ s brief regarding the Armstrong era can be summed up as â€œWhat happened?â€ � the CIRC mandate was â€ “ primarily
â€ “ concerned with the obvious follow - up question : â€œHow was it allowed to happen?â€ �
Its findings regarding the Armstrong years are devastating .
Covering up a positive test for a corticosteroid at the 1999 Tour was only the beginning , a prime example of the first misdeed that sets in progress a chain of further malpractice , culminating in the drafting of what should have been the key report into Armstrongâ€ ™ s misdemeanours by members of his legal team .
There were persistent suspicions that the UCI was too close to Armstrong , that it felt he was too big to fall , most notably from 2005 when details of the donations he had made to the governing body went public .
Memorably , the then president Pat McQuaid had this to say when I put it to him in August 2005 that there might be a conflict of interest between the governing body accepting cash from its most famous rider while being responsible for looking into his potential doping : â€œCertain people might perceive it as [ a conflict of interest ] but intelligent people wouldnâ€ ™ t.â€ �
The â€œintelligent peopleâ€ � at the commission fortunately thought otherwise .
The first key outcome of the CIRC report is what it says about cyclingâ€ ™ s willingness to move forward having laid its past bare .
For an international sports governing body to subject its recent conduct to such close scrutiny is rare indeed , with only the International Olympic Committeeâ€ ™ s Salt Lake inquiry bearing comparison .
The commission makes the point â€ “ on page 211 - that sports governing bodies across the board need to be better monitored by the governments that host them .
The prime lesson of the CIRC report is the longâ€‘term damage that can be done to a sport if power is concentrated in the hands of a single individual and at the same time scrutiny and accountability are limited : other sports federations should take note â€ “ and be worried .
Very worried .
However , for all the impeccable forensic analysis of the UCIâ€ ™ s conduct during the Armstrong years and the relentless exposure of the constant need it felt to put the commercial interests of the sport â€ “ these were identical to Armstrongâ€ ™ s interests â€ “ above its integrity , the CIRC report is far from perfect .
The respecting of anonymous sources is a worthy principle but it raises issues of its own .
The dramatic , sweeping statements the CIRC makes about the health of amateur cycling , Masterâ€ ™ s cycling and professional cycling today make for impressive headlines .
However , having competed frequently as an amateur for 30 years , including at Masterâ€ ™ s level , they do not tally with the picture I have of those sides of the sport in the UK .
Doping does not seem endemic in those areas to me : if it is being claimed that I am completely wrong , and that it is indeed endemic , surely I have a right to know on whose say
- so ?
Similarly , if professional cyclists are being told that their side of cycling is up to 90 % doped , they have that right as well .
If anonymity is respected , we can only hope that the findings are based on witness evidence from watertight sources who have absolutely nothing to gain personally from claiming that doping is widespread currently within cycling .
On that note , all credit to David Millar for raising the point that if CIRC has a potential weakness , it lies in the small number of actual cyclists to have contributed testimony â€ “ 15 % â€ “ from the CIRC analysis â€ “ of a total of 175 interviewees equals 26 or so .
Chris Froome is the only currently active cyclist willing to both testify and go public about it , for which he should take immense credit .
A large proportion of the 16 riders / former riders listed as sources have been found guilty of doping .
So how strong in the report are the voices of clean cyclists who are currently racing ?
Is there a risk that the picture of professional cycling in the report has been painted by such people as Alexander Vinokourov , Riccardo RiccÃ² and Tyler Hamilton , whose integrity is very much open to question ?
The headlines matter because , as Millar rightly points out , they will affect hearts and minds within cycling and outside .
They should not obscure a broader issue , though : the commission comes up trumps on one key point , which is that any future assault on doping has to be based on openness and accountability , on which there can be no compromise .
The CIRC report also does show that progress has been achieved and how that has happened â€ “ tighter targeting , the inception of the Athlete Biological Passport , better out - of - competition testing , a culture change in some teams â€ “ and its suggestions offer a definite course for the future .
To achieve that future , however , the UCI will have to take all cyclists with it
â€ “ and therein lies the biggest challenge Cookson will now face ."
2015-03-09,"Lance Armstrong â€˜On numerous occasions Lance Armstrong was asked by UCI to send letters of support or gifts or to meet people suffering from cancer whom they knew .
Personal favours were also asked such as requests for Nike watches for the family members of a former UCI president.â€ ™
The report said â€˜the CIRC considers that certain former presidents actually initiated a special relationship with Lance Armstrong and failed to establish a more distant relationship , which would have been more prudent given his status as an athlete and because of the suspicions of doping that persistedâ€ ™ .
Poor leadership â€˜[UCI ] communication strategy was primarily to divert public opinion from the idea of responsibility for the doping problem lying with UCI .
Doping was portrayed by UCI leadership as the faulty and surprising behaviour of a few individuals , but not as endemic group behaviour or as a structural problem within its sport.â€ ™ Inadequate policies â€˜Not only did UCI leadership publicly disregard the magnitude of the problem , but the policies put in place to combat doping were inadequate .
Credit should be given to the UCI insofar as it was at the forefront of anti - doping in introducing new testing techniques .
There was no satisfactory commitment to push the fight against doping beyond the limits of health protection.â€ ™ Witch hunt â€˜One would have expected that at least when the EPO - test was developed [ in 2000 ] , that UCI would have used all its efforts and resources to close the existing 10-year gap from the time EPO found its way into the peloton as quickly as possible â€
¦
However , this was not the case
â€
¦
There was little effort to be a step ahead of the dopers , rethink or assess the effectiveness of the Anti - Doping Program , change the testing strategy or to take riders by surprise in order to catch them out .
Going after the cheaters was perceived as a witch - hunt that would be detrimental to the image of cycling.â€ ™ Poor testing procedures â€˜Announcing sample collections , notifying riders and leaving them unattended gave riders the opportunity to adapt and to evade testing positive through medical supervision , whilst at the same time giving the impression to the public that cycling was trying to address the doping problem .
Once doping became visible in form of a rider testing positive the case was , if possible ( eg . through admittance of obviously back - dated prescriptions ) managed away.â€ ™ Surprise element Up until 2006 - 2007 the aim of In Competition Tests was at least partially undermined by a number of deficiencies in the testing process .
When unannounced ICT were performed , they often lacked a surprise element enabling the athletes to â€˜prepareâ€ ™ for sample collection â€ ¦ UCI would routinely perform unannounced ICT in the evenings and not in the morning
â€ ¦ the athletes had comfort that after a certain hour â€ ¦ they would no longer be tested â€ ¦ when the Doping Control Officers wanted to perform an unannounced test on an athlete at the hotel where the athlete was staying , the DCO would first have to contact team personnel
â€
¦
This enabled the teams to warn the riders of the upcoming test â€ ¦ the degree of co - operation of the various teams varied considerably .
While some would have a list available that showed in which rooms their riders were staying , other teams would not , thus , obliging the DCOs to perform a time - consuming search.â€ ™ Riders warned â€˜Documents
â€ ¦ show that in particular , [ former head of UCI anti - doping unit ]
Lon Schattenberg advised the teams of newly implemented detection methods .
Furthermore , [ he ] would inform the teams also on the detection window â€ ¦ this practice of UCI of warning riders had an impact on the efficacy of the tests.â€ ™
No effective testing â€˜One of the reasons that was given by a large number of interviewees for why Lance Armstrong never produced [ a positive test ] for EPO was that there was no effective out - of - competition testing at the time
â€ ¦ shortly after the new EPO test was introduced
[ riders knew ] how to manage their EPO treatment in the out - of - competition period in order to be â€œcleanâ€ � at the races .
They were helped of course by the information policy of Lon Schattenberg [ see above].â€ ™ Lack of targeting â€˜The testing strategy
â€ ¦ was for the large part a routine operation ( urine tests after the race , blood tests before the race in the morning ) and frequently lacked targeting â€ ¦
This was the case even though practice had shown that when modifying the routine , riders would return positive results .
When , for example , it was suggested during the Giro in 1999 that they carry out the health test on riders , in a break from usual practice according to the ranking of the riders , Marco Pantani was caught with an elevated haematocrit level .
Interestingly , this incident was â€ ¦ not considered to be a success because they caught someone
â€
¦
Accordingly , this strategy was not used again.â€ ™
Some success â€ “ but not for UCI â€˜In 2008
the tests at the Tour were undertaken without the involvement of UCI and for the first time a new testing method was used without prior notice to the riders , which resulted in many additional [ positive tests].â€ ™"
2015-03-11,"Once Lance Armstrong had eventually owned up to doing what everyone in cycling knew he was doing â€ “ even if proving it was difficult
â€ “
a big opportunity opened up for the sport , just as it had after the notorious Festina Tour of 1998 turned the Tour de France into a dopeâ€‘addled travesty .
The result is this weekâ€ ™ s Cycling Independent Reform Commissionâ€ ™ s report , which has exposed the full extent of the collusion between Armstrong and the sportâ€ ™ s governing body .
Brian Cookson , the UCI president , is to be congratulated , both on commissioning the report and publishing it in full ; a most positive first step .
Ever since 2003 , when I contacted Drug Free Sport , the forerunner to UK Anti - Doping , with an account of my first year in the distorted circus that was professional cycling , I have realised that the commitment to catch those stealing othersâ€ ™ livelihoods always fell woefully short of my expectations .
With that in mind , I met the CIRC determined to do my duty but resigned to the probability that I was wasting my time .
I came away from the meeting very impressed with how deeply the CIRC representatives understood the multifaceted and interlocking nature of the drug problem in cycling and how committed they were to obtaining and recording the evidence .
When I retired two years ago , I condemned the futile efforts of the antiâ€‘doping programmes present throughout my 10 years in the sport as being fought by the wrong people , with the wrong tools in the wrong way .
It gives me no pleasure to see CIRC record that riders were paying the anti - doping officers an â€œanti - doping taxâ€ � to avoid testing or positive results to overcome out - of - competition testing .
There is much to admire in the CIRC report .
Its terms of reference were never designed to flush out hitherto unknown dopers but it does score highly in its forensic analysis of cyclingâ€ ™ s governance .
In this it is scathing .
It is obvious that the leadership of the UCI did not always execute its responsibilities competently ; so the spotlight falls on the past presidents Hein Verbruggen and Pat McQuaid .
Both saved their most vigorous efforts for the pursuit of people they believed had â€œdefamed the UCI and its presidentsâ€ � .
The journalist Paul Kimmage , who has done so much to blow the whistle on the sport , was the main target and Verbruggen and McQuaid spent much of their membershipâ€ ™ s money attempting to sue him .
Now , when it is laid bare that the supposedly independent Vrijman report of 2006 â€ “ into allegations that samples taken from Lance Armstrong during the 1999 Tour de France had tested positive for EPO â€ “ was in fact constructed with help from Armstrongâ€ ™ s own legal team , it calls into question the most basic level of ethical morality .
Cookson has asked Verbruggen to resign as honorary life president .
The sport I love was brought into disrepute .
With all the lurid tales of blood transfusions , doping and corruption , sponsors fled womenâ€ ™ s cycling .
When I joined we had two , two - week Grand Tours .
Last year
the womenâ€ ™ s peloton was given a single day event at the menâ€ ™ s Tour .
â€œInauguralâ€
�
the uninformed called it .
Others more knowledgeable wept that the efforts of so many were brought to nothing by the immoral actions of the greedy and the failure of management .
If a past president could spend membersâ€ ™ money chasing journalists through the courts , it is time for the current president to remove him and leave the record corrected .
And Cookson can do more .
Perhaps the most disturbing grey area in cycling is the use of therapeutic use exemptions ( TUEs ) â€ “ under which riders are permitted to use otherwise banned substances for medical reasons .
The CIRC report is damning of the UCI for not following its own procedure in respect of TUEs , particularly in relation to those granted to Armstrong in 1999 and to Laurent Brochard when winning the world championship in 1997 .
The report rightly identifies an endemic problem with riders and teams systematically abusing the TUE system .
There is clear guidance from the World Anti - Doping Agency on how TUEs can be approved by a committee .
At the 2014 Tour de Romandie , Chris Froome and Sky received approval from the UCI for the use of a powerful corticosteroid when Froome complained of chest problems after the prologue stage .
That permission was granted by the UCIâ€ ™ s scientific adviser Dr Mario Zorzoli , later suspended by the governing body after unrelated doping allegations .
Despite suggestions that correct procedures had not been followed , Wada later declared itself satisfied and its code does allow for exceptional circumstances mid - race .
However Chris Froome , despite being so ill as to make it important that he took the medication ( 40 mg per day of the oral corticosteroid prednisolone ) during the race , won it ahead of over 100 elite athletes .
I donâ€
™ t think it is at all right that Chris should have the race and prize money taken off him retrospectively but Cookson needs to issue a very clear message : he should be apologising to the rest of the riders for failing them .
That TUE application should not have been approved ; Froome and Sky should have had a clear choice of either riding without corticosteroids or pulling out of the race .
I never found I could be anywhere near the front of a long race when I was ill .
Verbruggen and McQuaid stand accused of favouring Armstrong ; Cookson should not be in a position that leaves him open to accusations of favouring a Sky rider , the Sky team of which Cookson was a founding board member .
On the wider issue of doping , Wada needs some effective legislation passed that criminalises athletic doping and the provisioning of this criminal activity , with cross - border reach .
There are still many countries where it is not an offence to be in possession of performance - enhancing drugs , so the authorities are restricted to catching the thieves at competitions or via rare out - of - competition testing .
As we saw with Armstrong , even when the testers turned up on his doorstep , the sanction for refusing to be tested was so irrelevant it incentivised him to refuse .
Intelligence needs to be used far more effectively to target suspicious athletes .
I have shared with authorities , many years ago , and several times since , my first - hand information about a member of staff who told me they were supplying another rider .
That person still works in the sport ; I donâ€ ™ t think anything has ever been done to target them or the riders who work with that person .
The anti - doping authorities need to recruit staff who are far more determined .
Currently the crooks are out there stealing , time and time again .
The whereabouts system can be easily fooled and is not fit for purpose .
It is pleasing to see that the CIRC report identifies that riders are also circumventing the blood passport .
The final step I recommend is for retrospective testing and a longer statute of limitations to secure sanctions .
There will always be new drugs , such as the weight - loss drug Aicar , which enables riders to shed up to 7 kg and yet still maintain their power output .
Obviously , it takes time to develop tests for these but it needs to be agreed that retrospective testing can secure sanctions .
The report gives a damning verdict on how the last time the window was open , it was slammed shut and firmly bolted , by those in charge .
I wish Brian Cookson well with making sure that , 16 years later , this new opportunity is not lost .

2015-03-27,"I have no idea whether Pete Rose had put money on the game I watched him play for the Cincinnati Reds against the Chicago Cubs at Wrigley Field one afternoon in the summer of 1985 .
Cincinnati won , and it was Roseâ€ ™ s habit only to bet on his team to win .
But professional baseball players are not allowed to bet .
Once exposed to the world , that habit became his downfall .
Rose should have been granted a coveted place in baseballâ€ ™ s hall of fame many years ago .
His career total of 4,256 hits is the highest in the history of the sport , and he is a three - time World Series winner .
He was also aggressive and abrasive
â€ “
his nickname was â€œCharlie Hustleâ€ �
â€ “ and once served a 30-day suspension for shoving an umpire .
Then came the charges that would demolish his claim to a formal position among baseballâ€ ™ s immortals .
To bet on , rather than against , the success of your own team might seem harmless enough , very different from a jockey placing money on his mount to finish out of the placings or even Dennis Lillee and Rodney Marsh , tempted by ridiculous odds , putting a few quid on their own team to lose an Ashes Test at Headingley in 1981 .
What harm could it do to bet on your own success ?
But since Rose was then acting as the Redsâ€ ™ player - manager , it could be said that a wager on his own team might somehow have influenced and distorted his decisions .
And in 1989 the investigations into his activities led to a settlement in which , as the reports put it , he â€œvoluntarily accepted a permanent place on baseballâ€ ™ s ineligible listâ€ � .
In other words , he was handed a lifetime ban without the ignominy of having the evidence aired in public .
Rose denied the charges .
He was still denying them when he â€œvoluntarilyâ€ � accepted the ban .
He denied them right up until 2004 , when he confessed in a book written after a meeting with the baseball commissioner had failed to get the ban lifted .
A decade beyond his belated admission of guilt , his supporters are again trying to remove the ban in order to render him eligible for entry into the hall of fame , whose members are elected by baseball writers .
Opinions are split between those who feel the judgment should be upheld and others who think that the crimes of Rose , now 73 , were not remotely as heinous as those of players whose prodigious individual feats owed much to steroids .
Life bans in sport are tricky things .
Exemplary punishment serves the valuable function of showing young players very clearly where the boundaries lie .
To restore Roseâ€ ™ s standing might send out a message that while gambling on matches might be wrong , it can be forgiven and forgotten .
Others feel that such a sanction can offend against natural justice and precludes the possibility of redemption .
Lance Armstrong , banned for life three years ago , claims that others committed similar crimes without comparable consequences .
He fails to understand that he was punished not just for doping and lying about it but for bringing vast amounts of disastrous publicity to the whole of cycling .
The way he bullied the rest of the peloton and tried to ruin whistleblowersâ€ ™ lives also qualified him for harsher treatment .
Armstrong made himself the face of his sport and was happy to profit from it .
But the way he did it meant that when he was unmasked , after his defence had finally disintegrated under assault from dogged investigators , the nature of the punishment had to be made to match the unique enormity of the offence .
His seven Tour de France victories are no longer in the record book , although the seven framed yellow jerseys still adorning the walls of his den indicate a reluctance to accept the meaning of justice meted out to him .
Now he , too , like Rose , is trying to find a way back .
And discovering that the front door is locked , he is going round the back in an effort to rebuild the kind of profile that would give him leverage as something more than a convicted cheat .
â€œLance Armstrong always has an agenda , â€ �
Brian Cookson , the president of the UCI , observed recently when talking about the Americanâ€ ™ s testimony to the members of the Cycling Independent Reform Commission .
Yes , Armstrong would reply , and that agenda includes adding to the half a billion dollars he raised for cancer charities when he was still a member of respectable society .
In recent days Cookson has been taking the awkward step of criticising the decision of Geoff Thomas , the former England footballer and another cancer survivor , to invite Armstrong to join him at this yearâ€ ™ s Tour de France .
The plan is for them to ride two or three stages together on the day before the arrival of the race itself , in aid of leukaemia research .
Thomasâ€ ™ s fight against the disease , which struck soon after his retirement , was inspired by Armstrongâ€ ™ s account of his own battle in the best - selling and award - winning book Itâ€
™ s Not About the Bike .
He will ride all 21 stages of the Tour â€ “ as he did in 2005 , two years after his diagnosis â€ “ with the aim of raising Â£1 m .
The publicity surrounding Armstrongâ€ ™ s participation , he calculates , will raise the profile of the attempt .
It already has , by horrifying those who believe the last thing cycling needs is Armstrong exploiting the Tour yet again , this time on a ride to rehabilitation .
They are unimpressed by the claim that every pound raised means more and better drugs to cure cancer .
For Armstrong , they feel , the charity work is simply a means to an end , which is his return to acceptability â€ “ and thus , perhaps , an end to the legal actions that threaten to drain his bank account .
Cancer , which in his heyday won him the ear of presidents , prime ministers and CEOs , is his last trump card .
Were he sincere about making amends , he could follow the example of the politician John Profumo , who responded to disgrace and ejection from public life half a century ago by devoting his life to doing good works among the needy , far from the worldâ€ ™ s gaze .
Humility brought redemption .
But if humility were programmed into Lance Armstrongâ€ ™ s DNA , he would not have been Lance Armstrong in the first place .
The same is probably true for Pete Rose .
These were two great athletes who broke the rules in order to enrich themselves .
However much they needed their punishment , the world needs it more , as an example to others .
And they will just have to live with it ."
2015-04-05,"Sir Bradley Wiggins has admitted to mixed feelings about his success , claiming media scrutiny following his 2012 Tour de France win left him hating cycling , and that losing his title was â€œa monkey off my backâ€ � .
â€œI still look back and think : â€˜How did I win the Tour , going day to day under that pressure?â€ ™ â€ �
Wiggins said in an interview with cyclingtips.com .
â€œThat period afterwards , just hating being the winner of the Tour de France , hating cycling , hating the media for asking me questions about Lance Armstrong .
Hating Lance Armstrong for giving Oprah that interview .
And being the winner of the Tour in that period , having to answer all the questions.â€ �
Wiggins added that his â€œmiserableâ€ � 2013 Giro dâ€ ™ Italia , a Grand Tour he had set out to win but then had to withdraw from because of illness and injury , and his subsequent absence from the Tour de France , had left him â€œjust being so unhappy with it allâ€
� .
Wiggins missed out on the opportunity to defend his title because of the injuries which derailed his 2013 Giro dâ€ ™ Italia bid , but team - mate Chris Froome had been widely expected to be named as Team Skyâ€ ™ s leader for the Tour even if Wiggins had taken part .
Froome went on to win the 2013 Tour but Wiggins now sees this series of events as a blessing in disguise .
â€œOnce that mantle had gone , that monkey [ was ] off my back and someone else took it on , then it was quite nice , â€ � Wiggins said .
Wiggins added that stepping away from the spotlight , taking part in one - day Classics and winning the Tour of California has helped him to rediscover his love for the sport .
He will stand down from his Team Sky role after Paris - Roubaix , moving across to his own eponymous team , before starting preparations for the 2016 Olympics .
Wiggins suggested winning the one - day race would mean more to him than his Tour de France victory .
â€œIt would be probably be more enjoyable , because it is one day , it is over in six hours .
I donâ€
™ t recall ever being at a Roubaix where there is a big doping story
and it has overshadowed the race slightly .
It tends to be about the racing.â€ �
Wiggins was in action in the Tour of Flanders on Sunday where he was one of a number of riders to hit the deck when he crashed in the middle of the peloton while trying to negotiate a tight left - hand turn .
Although he needed a spare bike , Wiggins was able to continue but other riders suffered worse with the New Zealander Jesse Sergent , who was part of a seven - man breakaway group , suffering what was feared to be a fractured collarbone after being hit by a service car as it tried to overtake him .
Incredibly , there was another incident involving a support car later on which saw SÃ © bastien Chavanel also knocked off his bike and out of the race .
The Frenchman was hit by his team car after it had been rear - ended by another vehicle .
The race was won by Norwayâ€ ™ s Alexander Kristoff , who saw off the Dutchman Niki Terpstra in a two - man sprint following the Etixx - Quick Step riderâ€
™ s attack 25 km from the finish of the 264.2 km slog from Bruges .
Wigginsâ€ ™ s
Sky team - mate Geraint Thomas , who was among the race favourites , was unable to follow the decisive move and ended up 14th .

2015-05-18,"1 ) Bradley Wiggins on Desert Island Discs Bradley
Wigginsâ€ ™ recent talk of â€œhating being the winner of the Tour de France , hating cycling , hating the media for asking me questions about Lance Armstrong and hating Lance Armstrong for giving Oprah that interviewâ€ � may have been delivered in a spirit of refreshing honesty but , when itâ€ ™ s recast as a headline , it can make him sound surly and ungrateful .
Thankfully , Wigginsâ€ ™ personality is given room to breathe in this 45-minute Desert Island Discs episode , and he is an absolute joy .
The programme has a habit of throwing up personal and original interviews that would be missed by specialist journalists â€ “ try Jack Dee , Nick Clegg , Tony Adams or Daniel Kahneman for starters â€ “ and a lot of the credit for that has to go to Kirsty Young , whose lack of sporting expertise benefits her hugely when speaking to Wiggins .
Most people donâ€ ™ t care for the particulars of cycling ; they want to know where Wiggins found his talent and drive , why he has dedicated so much of his time to his craft , how his career has affected the rest of his life and why he struggled to process his monumental success .
A sports journalist might have been too interested in the pursuit of details to ask the deceptively simple questions that Young delivers and Wiggins responds to so frankly .
Wiggins does not baulk at any of her enquiries and he needs no invitation to explore his own weaknesses .
He speaks fluently about his childhood , his complex relationship with fame , fatherhood and knighthood , and his â€œweirdnessâ€ � .
Itâ€ ™ s a wonderful piece of radio .
If youâ€ ™ re a fan of Wiggins , youâ€ ™ ll love this , and if youâ€ ™ re not a fan , you will be by the end of the show .
Itâ€ ™ s also a must - listen for all Chas and Dave fans .

6 ) Is England falling out of love with cricket ?
The cricket sage that is Jon Hotten has been mulling over Englandâ€ ™ s relationship with the sport .
At the minute , that bond is weathering an ebb rather than enjoying the flow but , as Jon argues , the connection between cricket and the green land on which it was first played is ingrained deeply : I can offer only anecdotal evidence of its health , but I have played hundreds of matches against thousands of people since I was 11 years old , and apart from the natural passing of time , it feels the same as it ever did .
Amateur captains are still filling teams at the last minute ( one of my team - mates , who skippers his own occasional side , is not averse to approaching strangers in supermarkets a few hours before the game if heâ€ ™ s desperate enough , and sometimes it works too ) but even on lazy Sundays we face many a hard - hitting young batter and hot - headed opening bowler .
They attack the game madly .
The single biggest change I have seen since I started playing is in how hard the ball is hit .
Young guys just want to smack it , far and often .

Turton finished second in Division One , which would be enough to earn their promotion , but their ground is not fit for the higher league and any new building work had to be complete by 31 March to make them eligible for a promotion .
The clubâ€ ™ s chairman , Peter Gray , insists they have the funds to do the work but could not have carried it out during the season as it would have led to games being called off .
The club and league are currently involved in a standoff , but the tide of public opinion seems to be swaying with the Turton .

Hereâ€ ™ s their case : Turton FC won promotion by finishing second in Division One of West Lancs League .
The League committee have decided not to allow them promotion and not relegated anyone as they say the ground improvements should have been done by 31st March .
The club have secured Â£87,000 of funding and all improvements that will achieve step 7 criteria will be done before the start of the season .
The club feel that the hard work and success achieved is being ignored and a bit of flexibility and support from the league was all that was needed .

Where Roy Keane and Bobby Moore intersect If you havenâ€ ™ t read
Roy Keaneâ€ ™ s latest autobiography or
Matt Dickinsonâ€ ™ s book about Bobby Moore , fret not .
Seamus Oâ€ ™ Mahony of the Dublin Review of Books is here to explain what you missed .
Oâ€ ™
Mahony provides a wonderful , scything summary of Keaneâ€ ™ e book in the first section of this essay .
He spends 3,000 words describing Keaneâ€ ™ s book , cutting down its author with winning sarcasm throughout .
The approach works perfectly ; those of us who bothered to read the book should have waited for Oâ€ ™ Mahonyâ€ ™ s review , which cuts out the context we knew already and distills the writing to the four things Keane does best : contradictions , put - downs , humour and anger .
When it comes to Moore , Oâ€
™ Mahony does not roll out the red carpet of forgiveness that usually buttresses the sporting heroes of yesteryear .
Instead , he tells a rather sad story about a man who was more bland than most of us would like to admit .
The inscription on the giant statue of Moore that stands outside Wembey reads â€œImmaculate footballer .
Imperial defender .
Immortal hero of 1966 .
First Englishman to raise the World Cup aloft .
Favourite son of Londonâ€ ™ s
East End .
Finest legend of West Ham United .
National Treasure .
Master of Wembley .
Lord of the game .
Captain extraordinary .
Gentleman of all time.â€ �
But , when all the patriotic bluster is stripped away , Moore was really a quiet , unconfrontational and detached man who finished his career playing in the Danish Third Division , squandered a lot of his money in failed businesses and ended up offering anodyne punditry on the radio .
The game was only good to him for so long and the same may yet be said for Keane , who admitted in his book that nothing he will ever do again come close to the experiences he enjoyed as a younger man .
Keane and Moore are proper football men , but their books have not inspired in Oâ€ ™ Mahony a great deal of confidence in the sport : Children are constantly told that playing competitive sports builds character and teaches valuable life lesions .
I wonder .
Many great athletes are one - trick ponies ( or hedgehogs , to use Isaiah Berlinâ€ ™ s classification ) , and the character traits that made them successful in professional sport are often a handicap in retirement .
Bobby Mooreâ€ ™ s calmness and air of detachment served him well at Wembley in 1966 , but during the wet Sunday afternoons of the rest of his life this reserve gave an impression of a Chauncey Gardner - like emptiness .
Roy Keaneâ€ ™ s anger was , as he freely admits , a â€œuseful toolâ€
� during his years as a midfield enforcer , but it often backfired on him during his managerial career .

2015-06-11,"He is not impressed with the UCI Brian Cookson â€œYou guys can decide if he [ Cookson ] has done a good job â€ ¦ plenty of people would argue heâ€ ™ s laid down on a lot of things .
Whether itâ€ ™ s expedited TUEs [ therapeutic use exemptions ] , Astana , Cookson is not very good at taking people down.â€ �
Seasoned Armstrong watchers will appreciate the distancing devices â€ “ â€œplenty of peopleâ€ � and â€œyou guys can decideâ€ � .
Armstrongâ€ ™ s
real motivation here is not whether Cookson has done a better job than his predecessors Pat McQuaid and Hein Verbruggen , both lambasted in the CIRC report for their close relations with the Texan , but rather that Cookson publicly voiced his opposition to Armstrong riding the Tour de France route a day before the race with the cancer campaigner and former footballer Geoff Thomas .
This is back to the Armstrong of old , denigrating those who criticise him or dare to stand in his way .
One would like to think he had become a more humble person but on this evidence he has not .
He feels nothing has changed in cycling since he was there Armstrong states : â€œI absolutely donâ€ ™ t think [ cycling ] is in a better place.â€
�
Perhaps he does not remember how cycling was when he was in his pomp , and just after .
Cycling is far from being pure â€ “ and may never be â€ “ and there are still doubts that should be voiced , but certain things have clearly changed .
Needles are outlawed .
A host of top riders post - Armstrong have been caught and banned .
The biological passport has given cycling a human face .
There has been a massive and very public culture change in the way many teams engage with the doping issue .
The UCI has put unprecedented pressure on one of the biggest teams , Astana , over doping .
Indeed , you could now argue that the question for a rider is not â€œwhy not dope?â€ � but â€œwhy take on the trouble?â€ �
Armstrong has at least been consistent on this : he says what he did was necessary and the sport can not be redeemed .
Until he publicly gets his head around the fact that cycling has moved on â€ “ and has done so without him
â€ “ everything he says should be given the Mandy Rice - Davies response : â€œWell , he would say that , wouldnâ€ ™ t he?â€ �
He wants reintegration into the cancer community With Armstrong and Livestrong , as time went on , it was always hard to define the area where his devotion to the cancer community melded into the propaganda that built him into an American hero and the same problem exists around the ride with Thomas .
The worth of the cause can not be denied but the extent to which Armstrong is using it to rebuild his profile and as a platform to campaign for his reintegration into the sport has to be questioned .
He is fearing financial ruin as the $ 100 m lawsuit drags on The true financial victims of the Armstrong era â€ “ of cyclingâ€ ™ s blood doping culture of the 1990s and 2000s as a whole â€ “ were the riders who made the decision not to dope , or not to do so as intensely as their peers , and whose careers suffered immeasurably as a result .
One rider from back then â€ “ who was clean himself but got by through winning what he could â€ “ pointed to a team - mate who opted not to dope and ended up as a taxi driver .
In that context , as Armstrong vents his concerns from a holiday home in Colorado , sympathy should be tempered .
He is adamant that he won seven Tours â€œIf
I didnâ€
™ t win them , then who did ?
If you ask all the people who [ rode ] , they will tell you who won .
Thatâ€ ™ s the most important part.â€ �
Here Armstrong has a point of a kind , but itâ€ ™ s not one that has anything to do with him personally .
It arises simply because of the confusion that exists in the record books .
There is no adequate explanation why Bjarne Riis â€ “ who confessed to doping with EPO en route to victory in the 1996 Tour â€ “ is listed as a Tour winner , while Floyd Landis and Armstrong have been expunged .
What the confusion does is permit Armstrong to claim he has been victimised , which suits the script he is attempting to write for himself : everyone did it ; I have been singled out for unfair treatment .
But not everyone did dope in cycling between 1998 and 2010 , and of the many who did dope , not all did so with the intensity and public aggression that marked Armstrong .
Doping is a shades of grey issue , but Armstrong has never done nuance .
He feels he is treated like Lord Voldemort â€œIâ€ ™ m that guy everybody wants to pretend never lived .
But it happened , everything happened .
We know what happened .
Now itâ€ ™ s swung so far the other way
â€ ¦ whoâ€ ™ s that character in Harry Potter
they canâ€ ™ t talk about ?
Voldemort ?
Itâ€ ™ s like that on every level .
If you watch the Tour on American TV , if you read about it , itâ€ ™ s as if you canâ€ ™ t
mention him.â€
�
We are back to Armstrongâ€ ™ s need to portray himself as a victim , which goes back to his explanation for his doping : everyone did it , I had no option .
Amusingly , Armstrong was actually nicknamed the â€œDark Lordâ€ � among journalists at one point because his control freakery meant that , as per JK Rowling , â€œThe Dark Lord always knows.â€ � One key point about Voldemort is that he never quite understands the human qualities that set Harry Potter apart .
Perhaps we should now add :
â€œThe Dark Lord never learns.â€ �"
2015-06-11,"Disgraced cyclist Lance Armstrong has compared himself to the Harry Potter character Voldemort , and spoken of his fears of financial ruin in the $ 100 m whistleblower case launched by his former US Postal teamâ€‘mate Floyd Landis .
Armstrong also attacked the UCI president Brian Cooksonâ€ ™ s criticism of him as he prepares to go ahead with a controversial charity ride of the Tour de France route .
Armstrong was stripped of his seven Tour de France titles and banned for life nearly three years ago for doping offences , which he denied until January 2013 when he confessed wrongdoing in an interview with Oprah Winfrey .
Earlier this year , Armstrong told the BBC he would cheat again if he had the chance , but added he thought he should be forgiven , and he reiterated that stance in interviews with the Daily Mail and Daily Telegraph .
He likened his treatment to that of the fictional Voldemort , who derives fear from the magic community in JK Rowlingâ€ ™ s novels to the extent that hardly any character dares utter his name .
â€œIâ€ ™ m that character in Harry Potter
they canâ€ ™ t talk about ,
â€ � he said .
â€œVoldemort ?
Itâ€ ™ s as if you canâ€ ™ t mention him .
Iâ€ ™ m the one everybody wants to pretend never lived .
But that will not be the case for ever because it canâ€ ™ t be the case forever .
That wonâ€ ™ t work , people arenâ€ ™ t stupid .
I mean , I tried to make it right with every one of those people
â€
¦
I can only do so much.â€
�
Asked about the federal court case pending against him , Armstrong told his interviewers : â€œThe whistleblower case is a $ 100 m case .
We would not be sitting at this table any more .
We wouldnâ€ ™ t be sitting in this home any more .
We wouldnâ€ ™ t be sitting in any home .
I donâ€
™ t have $ 100 m .
He added , though , that he â€œlikesâ€ � his case .
â€œIn a whistleblower case you have to show real tangible harm .
The Postal Service commissioned studies in 2004 that showed it made $ 100 m .
There were years when it was making upwards of $ 20 m a year in new business , before we had even started to race .
So when you start to add all these things up , here is the question : â€˜Where are the damages?â€ ™ â€ �
He insisted he will tell all .
â€œCertainly in my depositions and hearings in the trial for the federal case , at this point in my life , Iâ€ ™ m not lying , Iâ€ ™ m not going to jail .
Iâ€ ™ m not leaving what I got going on .
And they would .
If they found out I had lied , they would absolutely move for that .
They would love it , love it.â€ �
Armstrong also took aim at cyclingâ€ ™ s world governing body head Cookson , who branded the Texan
â€œcompletely disrespectfulâ€ � for looking to ride the Tour de France route this summer for charity .
Cookson suggested Armstrong â€ � would be well - advised not to take partâ€ � in the former England footballer Geoff Thomasâ€ ™ s charity fundraising mission .
Thomas has convinced Armstrong to take part in his charity event , riding the Tour route one day ahead of the professional peloton .
Cookson said the UCI has no authority to stop Armstrongâ€ ™ s bid , but urged the American to think again .
Armstrong said : â€œI mean , I donâ€ ™ t know Brian Cookson .
I donâ€
™ t know what his vision is for the sport .
I donâ€
™ t know if he is even able to form a vision .
But I do know that me and Geoff riding in France is the least of his problems .
If he is making public comments â€ “ and this is as strong as Iâ€ ™ ll go â€ “
he needs to be talking about other things because this sport is not in a good place for a variety of reasons .
A lot of it has to do â€ “ perhaps some would say â€ “ with me .
But he doesnâ€ ™ t need to worry about this.â€ �
And as he prepares to ride in France again , Armstrong is resolute that he will not get a frosty reception .
â€œPeople think I have this bitter relationship with the country , with its people , â€ � he said .
â€œI like going there .
I love France â€
¦ I could be wrong , Iâ€ ™ ve been wrong plenty in my life , but Iâ€ ™ ve been to France since all this happened and if you walk into a cafe or a restaurant or walk down the street that [ negativity ] is not the reaction I get .
God forbid the reaction is positive .
What happens then?â€ �"
2015-06-19,"When Mo Farah belatedly issued a passionate statement on Friday in an attempt to claw back some of the damage his reputation has incurred this week , the reaction on social media was telling .
While many of those commenting underneath his statement on Facebook were clearly fans , urging him to fight on against what they saw as damaging slurs , the wider public reaction on Twitter emphasised the scale of the challenge facing the Farah camp and those close to it .
His exhortation that he had taken hundreds of drug tests and never failed one was met with weary references to Lance Armstrong .
The cynicism on show from a sporting public let down one too many times by their heroes was almost the polar opposite of the mood of giddy optimism that reverberated around the Olympic Stadium and the nation as a whole in the summer of 2012 .
Rewind to August of that year
and it was one of the biggest months in the life of not only Usain Bolt and Farah but also of their agent Ricky Simms and his burgeoning company Pace Sports Management .
As Bolt stood atop the podium doing Farahâ€ ™ s â€œmobotâ€ � and the British double Olympic champion struck the Jamaican dancehall stance that has become the trademark of one of the biggest sporting stars of his generation , it confirmed the London Games as a triumph for all three in not only sporting but commercial terms .
Farahâ€ ™ s wife , Tania , who had been with Mo since they were at school and exerts a strong hold over his career off the track , was entitled to feel a swell of pride too as she walked the track with their family .
Alberto Salazar , the coach with the golden touch who had taken Farahâ€ ™ s career to the next level since he joined his Project Oregon team , exuded satisfaction as he chalked up a golden double and his training partner Galen Rupp , the American now at the centre of doping allegations that he and Salazar strenuously deny , picked up a silver in the 10,000 m .
And for the UK Athletics executives looking down from among the 80,000 crowd , Farahâ€ ™ s golds were vital .
Even with them they failed to hit the medal targets set before the Games , but they provided the vital magic moments prayed for by everyone from UKA to London 2012 chairman , Lord Coe ( another man now wearing multiple hats , including chair of the British Olympic Association , Nike advisor , IAAF presidential candidate and avowed friend of Salazar , amid the fallout from this mess ) .
Three years on Farah finds himself engaged in a very different battle â€ “ not for medals but for the trust of the public â€ “ and pulled in every direction by the competing advice and priorities of all four .
While Salazar has gone to ground , unfairly or not increasing suspicion with every day he stays silent and prepares his defence against the claims by the BBCâ€ ™ s Panorama , Farah has appeared to have been left twisting in the wind .
After initially bolting from Birmingham and returning to Oregon to â€œseek
answersâ€ � from Salazar , he is now in the south of France preparing for his return to the track in Monaco next month .
Simms , who handles other members of the Nike - sponsored Project Oregon team including Rupp , can not help but have been conflicted .
In all there are at least five athletes on Paceâ€ ™ s books who currently train with Salazar or have been linked with the project â€ “ Mary Cain , Matthew Centrowitz , Shannon Rowbury , Jordan Hasay and Rupp among them .
It is Simms , hands - on with his charges even as the sums they can attract in the form of sponsorship and appearance fees has soared , who appears to have been advising Farah to stay silent until Salazar has said his piece .
But every day that has gone by since that initial Panorama was broadcast has made Farah appear less sure of his ground .
That impression only intensified in the wake of this weekâ€ ™ s revelation that he missed two tests within one 18-month window during the run - up to London 2012 .
The amateurish video that then emerged of Simms trying to prove to UK Anti - Doping that Farah could not hear his doorbell when testers came to call in 2011 will not do wonders for his reputation .
Farahâ€ ™ s loyalties to Simms , Salazar and , of course , Tania run deep .
It was Simms who acted as coach , mentor and agent at various points in Farahâ€ ™ s development from callow prospect to late - flowering world beater , in 2006 famously moving him into a house in Teddington with some of his Kenyan charges .
According to Farah folklore it was the moment he realised he had to get serious if he was to challenge the best .
â€œMo has seen that their life is running , sleeping , running , â€ � said Simms at the time , before also playing a pivotal role in the decision to move to Oregon and join Salazar in 2011 before the Games .
Pace now has more than 50 clients listed on its website but Simms prides himself on maintaining his hands - on approach .
His priority is his athletes to the exclusion of all else but that can sometimes appear to blind him to the fact that , in Bolt and Farah in particular , he now has two names that transcend their sport and , particularly in the wake of London 2012 , have become fair game for the front half of the newspapers as well as the back .
A series of avoidable missteps dulled the golden post-2012 glow : the six - figure fee that Farah took home for running half of the London marathon in 2013 , which could have been mitigated by simply taking the full amount the following year ; the spat with the Daily Mail over a story about his family ; the Twitter rows with fellow athletes ; that bizarre episode where he refused to reveal the names of his newborn twins but then unveiled them in an exclusive interview with a celebrity magazine .
All those incidents drew on a well of goodwill that had once seemed inexhaustible and now leave Simms in a tricky position as he attempts to reconcile responsibilities to Farah , to Rupp , to Project Oregon and to his business .
He is not the only one conflicted .
As noted several times in the past fortnight , UK Athletics â€ “ which is currently conducting a review of its relationship with Salazar â€ “ has its own questions to answer too .
The one thing that is clear at the end of a week that leaves more questions than answers for Farah , despite his belated and welcome statement , is that all of this could have been handled so much better from the start .
And that the next six months will define the way that Farah is remembered by a generation for whom his immortality once seemed inviolable ."
2015-06-25,"Ploughing through those 11,700 plus words in Alberto Salazarâ€ ™ s dense , detailed , seemingly methodical rebuttal of the doping allegations piling up at his door itâ€ ™ s impossible not to read it as an opening return of fire that is going to result in multiple casualties and could yet ruin reputations and empty bank accounts .
Given the extent to which the Nike Oregon Project ( NOP ) and Salazar are deeply intertwined , it is also impossible not to feel the hand of the American sportswear giant directing traffic behind the scenes .
And if there is one organisation with the resources to fight a messy , lengthy legal battle it is the $ 16bn behemoth that has found itself embroiled of late in a rolling series of controversies of various hues â€ “ Tiger Woods into Lance Armstrong into the Brazilian FA into Justin Gatlin .
And on .
As Salazar released his two - part open letter on the NOP website , the sportswear brand that has bankrolled his money - no - object attempt to take on the world of endurance running put out its own co - ordinated statement .
It is three weeks since the BBCâ€ ™ s Panorama and the ProPublica website in the US first made their claims against Salazar and his protege Galen Rupp , the London 2012 silver medallist who is Mo Farahâ€ ™ s training partner .
After three weeks spent silently plotting and gathering evidence , Salazar went on the attack accusing the BBC and ProPublica of a â€œremarkable display of irresponsible journalismâ€ � .
With both organisations standing by their claims , underpinned by testimony from a list of witnesses now approaching 20 , and the BBC in particular launching a strong defence of its journalism , it is a dispute that looks to be heading for the law courts , most probably in the US .
Almost as soon as Salazar had released his statement â€ “ complete with its defiant Taylor Swift ( or Adidas ) channelling â€œlet the haters
hateâ€ � coda - his accusers were already challenging it with their own new assertions and evidence .
So Salazar painted Steve Magness , one of the key whistleblowers , as an embittered ex - employee who was sacked .
Magness responded with a signed document showing the contract had been terminated by mutual agreement .
The Cuba - born coach pointed to a 2011 Runners World interview in which Magness raised no objection to his methods .
Magness said he was still employed by Nike at the time and afraid to speak out .
Salazarâ€ ™
s statement can either underpin suspicion or absolve it , depending on your starting position .
Viewed cynically , it answers some charges in detail that were not made and skirts over others that were .
Some passages are supported by detailed documentary and supplementary evidence , others are not .
Even its mix of corporate legalese and occasional impassioned personal invective can feel a bit too carefully crafted â€ “ as though pored over for weeks by lawyers and PR consultants .
There are unavoidable , and for Salazar unhelpful , echoes of Armstrong in the mix of aggression and frenzied detail â€ “ from Ruppâ€ ™ s
â€œShawshank Redemptionâ€ � description of the method of getting legal medicine through customs hidden inside a paperback to a physician called Dr Thing â€ “ that underpins the statement .
Yet for his supporters , the lengthy rebuttal will be seen as exactly what his accusers have been asking for .
If you are Mo Farah , with a world championship looming and an Olympics next summer , it is likely to more than provide the â€œanswersâ€ �
he says he has been seeking since the original broadcast plunged him into a PR nightmare .
As the likes of Steve Cram have rallied around , he will also feel he has the support of his peers .
So the most likely outcome of the ongoing UK Athletics review â€ “ expected to report by August ahead of the world championships â€ “ is that it will cut its formal ties with Salazar while making no judgment as to the validity of the allegations against him , perhaps citing the unwelcome distraction that the arrangement has become as the Rio Olympics loom .
Meanwhile , if Farah retains Salazar as his coach he will do so in the knowledge that he is taking a long - term risk with his reputation and legacy if the claims are later proved .
As an aside , it was notable that Chris Froome ( or his PR handlers ) chose to come clean about his own missed tests â€ “ presumably so they could be disclosed on his terms rather than by the press .
If one byproduct of the latest sorry saga to sully the reputation of athletics is more transparency on testing then that would at least be one small positive .
Now that the fuse has been lit by the BBC and ProPublica claims , this affair is likely to be a slow burning one that could yet result in multiple casualties .
Meanwhile , confirmation that Usada - and its determined chief executive
Travis Tygart - are continuing to investigate is just another sign that none of this is going away and another inevitable echo of the Armstrong affair .
As claim and counter - claim mount up over the specifics , nor should it stop broader questions being asked about the training culture within American colleges or a prevailing performance methodology that praises â€œmarginal gainsâ€ � , secrecy and the appliance of science in a game that virtually encourages the rules to be bent until they break .
As both sides dig in , exchanges of fire are likely to continue .
In the meantime , Farah faces perhaps the biggest call of his career - stick or twist .
The Oregon Project webstore features Farah and Rupp staring defiantly at the lens , clad in the teamâ€ ™ s regulation all black regalia .
If they stick with Salazar , as they appear increasingly likely to do , they will have to stare down plenty more besides over the coming months and years ."

2015-07-11,"Not surprisingly Lance Armstrongâ€ ™ s trips to France spawn controversy .
In 2006 when the Texan returned to the Tour de France after just under a yearâ€ ™ s absence , the seven - times winner â€ “ which he still was back then , prior to his life ban for doping â€ “ was greeted with a headline in the tabloid France - Soir which read :
â€œWelcome in France Trouduc ,
â€ � the use of the slang abbreviation for trou du cul being a reference to the Texanâ€ ™ s comment that the French national football team had â€œall tested positive for being arseholesâ€ � .
It remains to be seen what sort of a welcome Armstrong receives this week when he is back on the Tourâ€ ™
s roads , riding the route of stages 13 and 14 of the race with the former England football international Geoff Thomas as part of his â€œLe Tour â€
“ one day ahead
challengeâ€ � , in which Thomas and a group of 10 amateur cyclists are aiming to complete the race route riding 24 hours ahead of the peloton , in aid of the charity Cure Leukaemia .
It should be a warm welcome as this is a worthy venture , which aims to raise Â£1 m for the blood cancer charity , but Armstrongâ€ ™ s
presence has already caused unease .
In March , when his participation was announced , the news led the president of the Union Cycliste Internationale , Brian Cookson , to warn : â€œFrankly I think thatâ€ ™ s completely inappropriate and disrespectful to the Tour , disrespectful to the current riders and disrespectful to the UCI and the anti - doping community .
I think Lance would be well - advised not to take part.â€ �
Given his combative nature , Armstrong responded by questioning the strength of Cooksonâ€ ™ s leadership of the governing body .
â€œIt will make a bit of a stir but I donâ€ ™ t have the impression that people are talking about it much just yet , â€ � was the view of Philippe Bouvet , a senior cycling journalist at the newspaper Lâ€ ™ Equipe , who reported on Armstrongâ€ ™ s years in the peloton .
â€œIf Armstrong is not at the Tour , thatâ€ ™ s a sign of his complete failure .
He won seven Tours but heâ€ ™ s not welcome at the race and
thatâ€ ™ s failure.â€ �
For Bouvet , this underlines that Armstrong is on the margins but the writer feels he has been there for some time .
â€œIt depends on what use he is making of the venture but
heâ€ ™ s already pillaged the Tour enough .
He canâ€ ™ t be prevented from doing it .
I remember when he had stopped back in 2006 , I was at Alpe dâ€ ™ Huez and saw him riding up in a group of cyclists .
I found it pathetic â€ “ he had won seven Tours and already he couldnâ€ ™ t come on the Tour.â€ �
The prospect of Armstrongâ€ ™ s return to France , if not exactly to its Tour , has clearly raised the profile of Thomasâ€ ™ s charity , which can only be a good thing .
It reflects Armstrongâ€ ™ s current status within the sport : umbilically joined to it yet apart from it ; impossible to ignore yet bound to court controversy .
Given the way he exploited his cancer charity Livestrong as a shield against accusations of doping , any link with any charitable venture now raises the suspicion that Armstrong is not doing the charity ride for purely altruistic reasons .
Such is the toxic nature of his legacy .
The problem this week is this : if Armstrong is applauded along the way â€ “ given the rideâ€ ™ s charitable venture , all the participants should be â€ “ he will , perhaps , cite the cheers and handclaps as evidence that he is a redeemed character who has served his time in the wilderness .
Yet the visit raises an uncomfortable question : why , when other former notorious dopers are welcome at the Tour â€ “ Richard Virenque being a case in point â€ “ should Armstrong remain on the outside , and for how long ?
This is a question the former Tour winner raises repeatedly perhaps without understanding that labouring a point can be counter - productive .
The answer is a messy one : with human nature being what it is , with the nature of each case being so different , there is no one - size - fits - all formula for post - doping redemption .
But forgiveness usually comes when the offended party chooses to offer it , and it is prompted by contrition rather than confrontation ."
2015-07-13,"The Italian veteran Ivan Basso , a two - times Giro dâ€ ™ Italia winner and once a great rival of Lance Armstrong , has announced that he has cancer in his left testicle and that he will be withdrawing from the Tour de France .
A visibly shaken Basso said he felt pain in his left testicle after a crash in stage five and a medical check later revealed the cancer .
â€œUnfortunately I have a bad announcement .
I have a small cancer in my left testicle , so you can understand that I have to go back to Italy .
We discovered this just two hours ago , â€ � he said .
The departure of Basso , who will return home to Italy for further tests , is a blow both personally and professionally to the Tinkoff Saxo Bank team leader , Alberto Contador .
The Spaniard , his voice cracking with emotion , put his arm around Basso and said the news was â€œhard for meâ€ � .
He said he had ridden approximately 120 of 180 days with Basso this season in training .
Contador said he would do his best to honour Basso by winning the Tour : â€œYou can be sure that we will fight for the yellow [ jersey ] to bring him the yellow in Paris.â€ � The Tinkoff Saxo Bank team then cut short its news conference on the raceâ€ ™ s rest day Monday , saying that it was no time to be talking about the race after the news about Basso ."
2015-07-15,"Geraint Thomas has said that he and his fellow Tour de France riders are still â€œpaying the priceâ€ � for Lance Armstrongâ€ ™ s misdeeds as his Team Sky leader , Chris Froome , was again put on the defensive with the release of new video material on Wednesday .
The video , which claims to be a synthesis of the yellow jersey holderâ€ ™ s heart rate and power data , emerged as the Tour braces itself for the return of Armstrong to French roads .
The disgraced seven - times winner is riding a charity event with the former England footballer Geoff Thomas on routes used by the race later this week .
It was another Thomas , Geraint , who first weighed in on the Armstrong controversy on Wednesday .
The fifth - placed rider said he and his competitors were still â€œpaying the price for what [ Lance ] has done anyway .
I couldnâ€ ™ t care less what heâ€ ™ s doing to be honest .
He has done enough harm .
But whatever , we are just in our own little world here having a laugh and doing what weâ€ ™ re doing and Lance and all them can do what they want.â€
�
After holding on to the leaderâ€ ™ s yellow jersey through the second Pyrenean stage , Froome responded to the Armstrong question with his usual courtesy .
â€œWe
definitely donâ€ ™ t see it as him being back at the Tour , â€ � underlined Froome .
â€œHeâ€ ™ s not on the start line with us or anything like that .
Youâ€ ™ ve got to look at what heâ€ ™ s doing , which is Geoff Thomasâ€ ™ s cause to raise money for blood cancer research .
As Iâ€ ™ ve said earlier I support his cause , itâ€ ™ s a cause thatâ€ ™ s very close to my heart .
I wish Geoff Thomas and the guys all the best in raising as much money as they can .
But about Lance heâ€ ™ s not on the line with us ,
weâ€ ™ re not going to see him , itâ€ ™ s
a non - event for us.â€ �
Armstrong himself accepted that his legacy still tarnished the Tour .
â€œI know what itâ€ ™ s like for a guy like Chris to be in the middle of a Tour to deal with the constant questions which of course he is , â€ � said the American on Wednesday .
â€œAnd to be fair and to be honest to him a lot of that is my fault.â€ �
That followed the release of Team Skyâ€ ™ s hacked videos , with the campaigner behind them , Antoine Vayer , stating that the team should put all such material in the public domain .
Froome had said that he was contemplating undergoing independent physiological testing in order to prove that he is not using banned performance enhancing drugs or practices , but that appears to be only in the putative phase at best .
â€œCertainly Iâ€ ™ m open - minded to potentially doing some physiological testing at some point after the Tour , at whatever point suits , â€ � said the Tour leader .
â€œThere would be some interesting things that come out of it and maybe as a team we might even learn something from it .
â€œIâ€ ™ ve certainly got no plans of just releasing data out into the public .
You can see the effects of the supposed leaked file that went out there .
Thatâ€ ™ s done no one any good .
It doesnâ€ ™ t prove one thing or another thing .
Thatâ€ ™ s pointless .
â€œIf we find an independent expert in the field who can analyse the data from a physiological point of view , then , yes , sure , I might be open minded to doing that with someone.â€ � Another possible solution was offered by the Sky principal , Dave Brailsford , who feels that the questions are detracting from a dominant performance by his team .
Brailsford told French television that he felt the UCI could move to extend the biological passport â€ “ which uses blood and urine analysis on a confidential basis over lengthy periods â€ “ to include data from ridersâ€ ™ power cranks which all teams could be obliged to provide as part of the programme ."
2015-07-16,"In a supermarket car park 80 miles from the finish of Thursdayâ€ ™ s
Tour de France stage something stirred from the Tourâ€
™ s past :
a bus , a horde of reporters and television cameras , a Texan drawl .
Lance Armstrong had returned to French roads , to ride the â€œOne Day Aheadâ€ � challenge with the former England footballer Geoff Thomas , who hopes to raise Â£1 m for CureLeukaemia .
Armstrong is accompanying Thomas and a group of amateur cyclists riding the stages of the Tour from Muret to Rodez and Rodez to Mende 24 hours ahead of the Tour de France peloton ; the ride began on Thursday in the less - than - romantic surroundings of the Leader - Price car park in the little town of Vernet , just to the south of Toulouse and not far from the start of Fridayâ€ ™ s stage 13 .
In a crush of reporters , Armstrong was asked whether he believed the Tour de France was now clean .
â€œHow can I answer that question?â€ � he replied .
â€œI am not a specialist.â€
�
Although there was a media throng to greet him , just like in the good old , bad old days when he doped his way to seven Tour de France wins , Armstrongâ€ ™ s presence has not been universally welcomed .
Brian Cookson , the head of cyclingâ€ ™ s governing body , the UCI , got his response in early when the ride was announced in the spring , saying : â€œIt is undesirable , I think it is disrespectful .
I think there are plenty of ways of raising money for charity that Lance could do.â€
�
The response this week from French media and team managers has been similarly negative although the head of the race , Christian Prudhomme , pointed out that â€œone day before the Tour , the road is open to anyoneâ€ � .
Tour cyclists such as Geraint Thomas and the race leader , Chris Froome , have expressed their reservations .
On Thursday , the Europcar team manager Jean - RenÃ © Bernaudeau , a long - time proponent of clean cycling , said he did not like Armstrongâ€ ™ s return .
â€œHe embodies what will remain the Armstrong generation and he has come back .
I donâ€ ™ t like that at all.â€ �
His view was echoed by Vincent Lavenu , the head of the Ag2R team , who said : â€œWe know what the Armstrong years led to .
We know what they gave in terms of polemic , media and legal sagas .
Heâ€
™ s come back to the Tour but the news is not where he is .
His trip is not the best news for our sport.â€ �
Armstrong told the website cyclingnews.com : â€œI understand peopleâ€ ™ s reactions .
I understand there are still some hurt feelings and thatâ€ ™ s a process Iâ€ ™ ll walk through for a long , long time.â€ �
As might have been expected Armstrong used the occasion to make the point that he feels he has been unfairly excluded from the Tour , when other former drug - takers such as Richard Virenque are prominent working for media and sponsors .
â€œTheyâ€ ™ re all here
â€ “ why am I not welcome ?
Because Iâ€ ™ m a doper ?
If that were the rule , the caravan would almost be empty .
I donâ€
™ t mean the riders in this Tour but in the press room , the commentary boxes , team cars .
No disrespect to those guys .
We all rode in an unfortunate era .
But if youâ€ ™ re going to apply a standard it has to be universal.â€ �
With exquisite timing Armstrongâ€ ™ s arrival coincided with the embarrassing revelation that Team Sky have a former soigneur from his US Postal team on their payroll , albeit in the innocuous role of warehouse manager at their base in Belgium .
There is no hint that the Belgian Peter Vebeken â€ “ who also worked as a soigneur , or â€œcarerâ€ � , at Sky in 2012 and 2013
â€ “ has been involved in wrongdoing , and Sky are adamant he met their ethical criteria .
But the fact that he worked at US Postal on a freelance basis in 1999 is a reminder that cyclingâ€ ™ s past is all but impossible to escape ."
2015-07-17,"Ivan Basso left the Tour de France this week for emergency surgery to remove a small testicular tumour , detected after he felt persistent discomfort following a crash on the fifth day of the race .
He is 37 now , and it is a few years since he slipped back from the summit to become a kind of superâ€‘domestique , this year in the service of Alberto Contador .
Mention of Basso always evokes the memory of the easy elegance with which he accelerated away from his pursuers on the steepest climbs during his wins in the Giro dâ€ ™ Italia in 2006 and 2010 .
In between those victories , following an investigation into his links with the notorious Doctor Eufemiano Fuentes , he admitted â€œattempting to dopeâ€ � and served a two - year ban from competition .
Those apparently effortless stage wins are examples of what Chris Boardman meant when he said , a long time ago : â€œIf something looks too good to be true , it probably is.â€
�
The ambivalent feelings aroused by the Italian riderâ€ ™ s feats parallel those towards others of his era who cheated their way to victories and the spoils that came from them , essentially depriving rivals of glory and material reward .
The media scrum surrounding Lance Armstrong this week provided a much more explicit reminder of the clouds that still hang over cycling .
The disgraced Texanâ€ ™ s arrival in France to pedal a couple of stages with Geoff Thomasâ€ ™ s cancer - charity ride was never going to be ignored .
For those with pages and screen - time to fill , this was too good a story â€ “ even though it was really no story at all .
But , like the tale about the Team Sky warehouse manager who worked as a soigneur for Armstrongâ€ ™ s team for about five minutes in 1999 , it was something to add to the peripheral narrative of the 2015 Tour , thereby helping to move the stories about the performance of Chris Froome and his Sky team - mates further towards what some people no doubt hope will become , sooner or later , a critical mass .
What Froome did on Tuesday , soaring clear of his chief rivals on the long , tough climb to La Pierre - Saint - Martin , was inescapably reminiscent of rides such as those of Basso .
As the Sky leader burned off first Vincenzo Nibali , then Alberto Contador , and finally the usually adhesive Nairo Quintana , he managed to dismay two sets of people : those who had hoped to see a real race , and those who view such displays of blatant superiority with suspicion .
Richie Porteâ€ ™ s cruise past Quintana in the final kilometre , an attack intended to deprive the Colombian of bonus seconds , served only to confirm the disquiet .
In the post - Armstrong era , any display of superiority is viewed with scepticism .
And the doubts about Froome quickly found their voices , many of them only too keen to find ammunition for an assault on the widely disliked Sky and their riders .
Some of the accusers , still nursing resentments over the way the old guard of dopers â€ “ the generation of Armstrong and Basso , and their managers and facilitators â€ “ were finally exposed , are keen to uncover proof that Skyâ€ ™ s zeroâ€‘tolerance policy is no more than a sham , and that nothing has really changed .
They would see this as a retrospective justification of their own behaviour , opening a possible door back into polite society .
That is what Armstrong , in a slightly subtler way , is trying to achieve .
â€œClearly Froome / Porte / Sky are very strong ,
â€ �
he told his 3.85 million Twitter followers this week .
â€œToo strong to be clean ?
Donâ€ ™ t ask me .
I have no clue.â€ �
Charged with making unjustified insinuations , he responded : â€œIâ€ ™ m not accusing anyone .
In fact , quite the opposite .
Iâ€ ™ m not interested ( nor do I have the credibility ) to opine there.â€ �
But he didnâ€ ™ t mind putting the thought out there , disingenuous to the end .
It can hardly be said too often that there are good reasons why Armstrong is treated as a pariah , rather than Basso or the many other top riders tagged for doping in recent years .
He is a special case : not just the biggest liar of them all but the one who set himself up as the spokesman for fabricated denial over a 10-year period , and who coldly sought to destroy the careers of those attempting to expose his wrongdoing .
And also , of course , the biggest beneficiary .
Armstrong now goes to considerable trouble to make his peace with those whose lives he once tried to ruin , saying sorry in a carefully publicised show of contrition .
But that is no reason to welcome him back into a world where the damage he did is still so much in evidence , or to permit him to repolish his image through a return to the charity work that he once used as a shield with which to deflect unwelcome investigation .
He is even careful to apologise to Froome , who is forced to ride through the fallout of cyclingâ€ ™ s disgrace .
It is as much Armstrongâ€ ™ s fault as anyoneâ€ ™ s that Froome now has to endure the unauthorised revelation of his personal performance data , acquired by questionable means and unverified by the sort of scrutiny that would be required in any court of law .
Two years ago the man who exposed that information to the world , the former Festina trainer Antoine Vayer , used a newspaper article to compare Froome with Armstrong and Marco Pantani , two men who went up hills unusually fast thanks in part to the abuse of illegal substances .
Does Vayer have an agenda when it comes to Froome ?
Maybe not .
Perhaps he just sees himself as a guardian of cyclingâ€ ™ s morality .
And possibly this is the logical way to go , compelling the teams to divulge all the data from their ridersâ€ ™ power meters and heart monitors in the belief that until everything is available for inspection , cycling will not emerge from its dark tunnel .
Team Sky , being so data - oriented , could easily comply with that requirement , although it would not sit easily with their culture of finding performance gains in areas overlooked by their rivals .
And the result would not ,
letâ€ ™ s face it , be very compelling to anyone beyond the community of obsessives who measure human value in watts per kilogram .
Unless there is something more than circumstantial evidence to the contrary , it might be best to accept the phenomenal nature of Froomeâ€ ™ s performances .
That would not stop some of us quietly hoping that the coming alpine stages will see Skyâ€ ™ s suffocating dominance , with its reliance on power meters , challenged on the road rather than in the court of innuendo .
Meanwhile , Basso is apparently recovering well from his operation in a Milan hospital .
At least everyone can be happy about that ."
2015-07-25,"Of the six Tours since Team Sky first appeared at la Grande Boucle in 2010
they have won three overall with two riders , Sir Bradley Wiggins and Chris Froome , and taken 12 stages , a record which is beginning to bear comparison with some of the best - known teams in cycling history such as Bernard Hinaultâ€ ™ s Renault and Miguel Indurainâ€ ™ s and
Pedro Delgadoâ€ ™ s Reynolds - Banesto .
Looking purely at the Tour de France , Sky have dominated the post - Lance Armstrong era , even if they have yet to win a major one - day classic .
It is a far cry from the spring day in 2009 when Dave Brailsford â€ “ pre - knighthood â€ “ summoned the press to the Lanesborough hotel to announce his intention of winning the Tour with a British cyclist within five years , and of doing it â€œcleanâ€ � .
In those six years Sky have variously been the object of envy , curiosity and â€ “ at times â€ “ derision .
Their largely black kit , machine - like riding style and a perceived disregard for the traditions of cycling have turned them into cyclingâ€ ™ s Marmite team
â€ “ loved or loathed , with little in between .
But what can not be denied is Skyâ€ ™ s success .
Brailsford made much of two things that he wanted to bring from the track â€œmedal factoryâ€ � : a belief in coaching and in â€œmarginal gainsâ€ � .
It could be legitimately suggested that Wigginsâ€ ™ s success â€ “ and that of Froome in subsequent years â€ “ came down to the exploitation of a â€œknowledge gapâ€ � in the sport .
Teams had failed to invest in coaching back - up but concentrated their resources on sophisticated doping programmes ; in the wake of the UCIâ€ ™ s introduction of the no - needle rule , there were stories of riders sitting on team buses at a total loss after stages without a drip to help them recover .
Sky , coming to the sport with a clean slate , could simply get on with coaching their riders .
The core of Wigginsâ€ ™ s initial success was data put together by the former swimming coach Tim Kerrison â€ “ now
Skyâ€ ™ s
head of athlete performance â€ “ during the 2010 and 2011 Tours , to calculate the power
outputs his riders needed to win the race .
In 2012 he unveiled a graph with two lines showing power output levels against the time they need to be sustained : one line represented what was needed to win the Tour ; a second line portrayed what Wiggins , or other Sky Tour riders , could achieve relative to what they needed to do .
The goal was to get the two lines as closely matched as possible .
â€œYou can see from this team how much you can get by investing relatively small amounts in coaching .
The gains are disproportionate , â€ � Kerrison said in 2013 .
Sky have continued that philosophy , continuing to invest in coaching support â€ “ the employment of the British coach Simon Jones last year being a case in point â€ “ and in marginal gains such as a new super - aerodynamic Pinarello bike last year ; a new machine for cobbles this season .
There are other keys to Skyâ€ ™ s success .
They enjoy a resource level which is at the highest end of the spectrum and enables them to buy mature talent to support the likes of Froome .
Last yearâ€ ™ s signings , Nicolas Roche , Wout Poels and Leopold KÃ¶nig are not in the stratospheric league but are well up cyclingâ€ ™ s pay scale .
They have enjoyed the resources of the British Cycling Olympic Team â€ “ riders and back - up such as physios and staff â€ “ and at times have seemed to be recruiting the best from Manchester without regard for the long - term effect on the structure that originally bred the team .
As for â€œdoing it cleanâ€ � ,
the core of that was a zero - tolerance policy on employing staff and riders with doping records .
But the trust that Sky initially enjoyedon the anti - doping front evaporated rapidly when , in 2012 , it was revealed that they had gone against their original plan to hire only doctors from outside cycling , and had unobtrusively employed the former Rabobank medic Geert Leinders .
That the appointment at the end of 2010 coincided with an upturn in their fortunes certainly did not help matters and the questioning began when Bradley Wiggins dominated the time trials in the 2012 Tour , with Froome the strongest rider in the mountains .
For all of the questioning , no evidence of doping within Sky has been produced .
There are other explanations that can be put forward for their continuing success .
The men at its head â€ “ Brailsford , Kerrison , the British coach Rod Ellingworth â€ “ are constantly reappraising what they do and how they do it , most recently after last yearâ€ ™
s failure in the Tour , after which the coaching side was beefed up still further and the management structure tweaked .
That defeat , with Froome crashing out and the team failing to rally round , was probably key in this yearâ€ ™ s success .
â€œThere was a two - year period when we won a lot and itâ€ ™ s hard to identify what to change when you are winning , â€ � said Kerrison .
â€œItâ€
™ s a matter of making sure we still pay attention to all those details.â€ � Ellingworth puts it another way : â€œIt was a matter of everyone getting back on their game .
You need a good kick in the teeth every now and again.â€ �"
2015-08-14,"You might notice something familiar about the poster for Stephen Frearsâ€ ™ s upcoming Lance Armstrong biopic The Program .
To the left of Ben Fosterâ€ ™ s face are the words â€œCHAMPION HERO LEGEND CHEAT ,
â€ � and while this effectively articulates what makes the disgraced cyclist such a compelling figure ,
the inspiration for the tag line is instantly recognisable .
Like so many other efforts from recent years , The Program arguably owes a debt to the most surprisingly influential movie poster of the past decade : Facebook co - founder Mark Zuckerberg was likewise represented on the poster for 2010â€ ™ s The Social Network as â€œPUNK PROPHET GENIUS BILLIONAIRE TRAITOR.â€ �
The Social Network poster was the work of Neil Kellerhouse , the go - to graphic designer for Steven Soderbergh and David Fincher , noted for his minimalist technique and unconventional use of type .
Although The Social Network didnâ€ ™ t invent the GOOD THING GOOD THING BAD THING tag line format â€ “ examples can be seen in the promotional materials for Abel Ferreraâ€
™ s
original Bad Lieutenant ( â€œGAMBLER THIEF JUNKIE KILLER COPâ€ � ) or 24 Hour Party People ( â€œGENIUS POET
TWATâ€ �
) â€ “ Kellerhouseâ€ ™ s striking design rippled throughout the increasingly homogeneous world of movie posters .
It is a world , incidentally , where the disembodied heads of movie stars float menacingly over landscapes for no particular reason .
Expanding on the work he did for Casey Affleckâ€ ™ s mockumentary Iâ€ ™ m
Still Here , Kellerhouse placed type directly on top of Jesse Eisenbergâ€ ™ s face in two main designs , including the terrific YOU DONâ€ ™ T GET TO 500 MILLION FRIENDS WITHOUT MAKING A FEW ENEMIES .
This bold but austere approach was a great match for Fincherâ€ ™ s film and also complemented the trailer , which was similarly innovative and much imitated .
Following the promotional campaignâ€ ™ s visibility and popularity , the lots - of - words - over - the - protagonistâ€ ™ s - face design became commonplace : within a year , the concept popped up everywhere : The Kingâ€ ™ s Speech , Thor , Salt , Morning Glory , The Adjustment Bureau , The Imitation Game .
Even Kellerhouse himself went back to the same well with the Criterion Collection reissue of The Man
Who Fell to Earth .
As a consequence of its success , The Social Networkâ€ ™ s once - impressive poster design is now as much of a cliche as blue and orange colour schemes or romantic leads standing back - to - back .
It wearily joins other posters of dubious influence , from The Truman Show ( photo mosaics ) to Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind ( missing eyes ) to For Your Eyes Only ( splayed legs framing the protagonist , sexism ) .
This journey from marvel to bore in less than half a decade demonstrates that movie posters are ultimately little different from the features theyâ€ ™ re trying so very hard to promote : someone comes up with an original , well - executed idea , others attempt to replicate the formula with diminishing returns , someone else decides to reject the idea in favour of trying something new , and we start all over again .
As depressing patterns of behaviour go , itâ€ ™ s strangely encouraging ."
2015-08-20,"Just do it , cyclist Lance Armstrong told a teenage Kieran Hodgson , in a daydream , halfway through the Holme Valley Mountain Bike Challenge , a decade ago .
And now Hodgsonâ€ ™ s just done it , with an absolute gem of a narrative comedy show about teenage cycling , sullied dreams and migrating from the north .
It pins its tongue - in - cheek coming - of - age tale to the arc of Armstrongâ€ ™ s rise and fall , as doping revelations leave a nasty smear over the Texanâ€ ™ s heroic aura .
And yet , his power to motivate still flickers :
heâ€ ™ s inspired this imperishable comedy set , after all , and if that doesnâ€ ™ t quite atone for all the lying , cheating and bullying , it makes a decent start .
The show is a companion piece to Hodgsonâ€ ™ s 2014 offering , about a school French exchange trip .
Both animate the landscape of Hodgsonâ€ ™ s youth ; both cast him as a bookish , butter - wouldnâ€ ™ t - melt adolescent as grownup life looms .
In both , too , he flits zippily between a wide range of instantly vivid characters â€ “ including , in this case , a nerdy cycling coach ( â€œOn your marks , get set , and
letâ€ ™ s have a bit of a safety
noticeâ€ � ) , the bumptious ex - public schoolers he meets at uni , and the Look North broadcaster Harry Gration , improvising ineptly on camera when Yorkshire welcomes the Tour de France .
More character actor than leading man , Hodgson parlays meekness into major appeal here .
Heâ€ ™ s a delight to watch , and every line of his script is wired for laughter .
Among the standout set - pieces , a TV promo for Yorkshire fuses northern cliches and ad - world idiocy into blissful daftness , and a NoÃ«l Coward - ish serenade , wooing Hodgson to the delights of the south of England , is an instant classic .
If you choose to look beyond the constant fun , the show is also beautifully attuned to the bittersweetness of leaving oneâ€ ™ s home , friends and certainties behind .
But pre - eminently , this is about laughs â€ “
and there are loads of them .

2015-08-21,"When people hear that you live in Girona
they say : â€œOh , thatâ€ ™ s where Lance Armstrong lived.â€ �
Yeah !
So what ?
He wasnâ€ ™ t the first pro - cyclist to move here .
You can come here and avoid the herd , if you want , but the herd is here for good reasons : the climate , the routes , the training .
And having them here means that when you arrive you can ask : â€œWhat do I need to do to settle in?â€
�
And they can help .
Itâ€ ™
s hard to pick the best ride around Girona â€
“
there are so many .
But my favourite one heads west out of town towards Sant Gregori and then further out to the Vall de LlÃ
© mena in the Pyrenees .
If youâ€ ™ re up for a long ride , do a loop through Olot and Banyoles and then back to Girona .
In the colder months , before tourists flock in , the coast roads are a must .
Itâ€ ™ s an amazing coastline , with a lovely undulating road .
Iâ€ ™
d advise checking out my Girona rides on Strava ( strava.com ) , which is a website and app that allows athletes to track their rides and runs .
This will help you to find the smaller hidden roads I use ; the big roads are beautiful but itâ€ ™ s the small roads that take it to another level .
Itâ€ ™ s so vibrant here .
There is always something happening and itâ€ ™ s usually communal .
Thereâ€ ™ s the St Narcissusâ€ ™ fair and festival in October , Mardi Gras in February and a film festival in September .
I immediately felt that spirit and sense of community that seems lacking in many other places .
There is a lovely winding road that takes you up to the hilltop Santuari dels Angels , the chapel where Salvador Dali got married .
Itâ€ ™ s about 15 km east of Girona .
The views are fantastic and , at the top of the hill , youâ€ ™ re rewarded with a great little cafe , too .
The building I live in feels like a castle .
My home is near the PlaÃ§a del Vi in the old town ( Barri Vell ) , so my front door is a massive , thick wooden thing .
Girona has city walls , narrow alleyways , and cobblestones .
For me , coming from Namibia where there are no castles , itâ€ ™ s amazing .
The coffee at La Fabrica Girona is expensive but itâ€ ™ s so good that once youâ€ ™ ve had it all other coffees are ruined for you .
The shop was set up by cyclist Christian Meier , who rides for the Orica - GreenEDGE team .
If youâ€ ™ re into cycling and youâ€ ™ re heading to Girona , you go to La Fabrica â€ “
thatâ€
™ s where youâ€ ™ re going to get the best route advice â€ “ and youâ€ ™ re also likely to meet people going for a ride .
I love the place , itâ€ ™ s still young and new but because a Catalan food critic wrote a great review of it ,
itâ€ ™ s also become popular with locals and food fans .
Girona has so many stunning restaurants and every night you seem to find yet another amazing one , but a definite standout is Draps .
All its dishes are sharing plates , the best one being a big bowl called la paperina ( â‚¬15 ) .
Itâ€ ™ s made of filo pastry filled with foie gras , lettuce and a mixture of fruits .
I had tapas for the first time at a place called Zanpanzar ( Carrer de Cort - Reial 12 ) in the middle of the old town .
Having lived in Bellinzona , in Switzerland , I knew about the Italian aperitivo but tapas were completely new to me .
A glass of red wine and tapas is great if youâ€ ™ ve been walking around the city all day .
Actually , even better than a glass of red â€ ¦ go for a vermouth at a spot called El Vermutet Can Gombau .
To me , that feels local .
A great thing to do is just walk into the old town and get yourself lost .
Itâ€ ™ s a warren of steps and little roads .
Itâ€ ™ s big enough that you can become disoriented but small enough that you donâ€ ™ t have to worry about it .
On one side of the old town is the Onyar river .
A walk across the Pont de Pedra can take ages because you get stuck staring down into the river .
There are two churches that can act as reference points , if you need them : the Basilica of Sant Felix is the cityâ€ ™ s cathedral , while the Sant Pere de Galligants is an abbey that also houses the Catalonia archaeological museum .
Thereâ€ ™ s an expression my friends use that I love : â€œYouâ€ ™ ve been Spained!â€ �
Partly itâ€ ™ s a way of describing the relaxed lifestyle , but itâ€ ™ s also about how sometimes if you want something and itâ€ ™ s not how they do it here , it just wonâ€ ™ t happen .
Administration works at its own speed , people like their siestas , the shops close .
Then the restaurants donâ€ ™ t open until 8 pm .
Itâ€ ™ s just the way things are .
Youâ€ ™ re away from the hustle and bustle here .
Accept it .

2015-09-10,"When Ben Foster admits to using performance - enhancing drugs in preparation for his latest film , he says it so casually that it takes a moment to register the confession .
â€œI
donâ€ ™ t want to talk about the names of the drugs I took , â€ � he explains , sitting across from me in blue jeans and white shirt in a Paris hotel suite .
â€œEven discussing it feels tricky because it isnâ€ ™ t something Iâ€ ™ d recommend to fellow actors .
These are very serious chemicals and they affect your body in real ways .
For my own investigation it was important for me privately to understand it .
And they work.â€
�
Foster â€ “ who is 34 , with short , blond hair that stands upright , an incipient beard and moustache , and
the belligerent handsomeness of Kirk Douglas â€ “ has long been renowned as an actor for whom merely going the extra mile would be just plain lazy .
During the filming of Lone Survivor , he ate handfuls of dirt to get an idea of the hardship endured by Navy Seals under fire from the Taliban .
He used glaucoma eyedrops to dilate his pupils when playing a crystal meth addict in Alpha Dog .
His role as a homeless , disabled veteran in Rampart was scarcely more than a cameo , yet he still spent time beforehand living rough on the streets of Los Angeles .
( â€œI was pissing my pants like everyone else there , â€ � he recalls . )
So it makes sense that , having been cast as American cyclist Lance Armstrong in Stephen Frearsâ€ ™ s new film
The Program , he might choose to dabble in the performance - enhancing drugs that the athlete used to propel himself to seven consecutive Tour de France titles .
But if itâ€ ™ s acceptable to take drugs for The Program , I ask , why not use crystal meth for Alpha Dog ?
â€œItâ€ ™ s a good question , â€ � he replies .
â€œIn all transparency , I rolled with those guys on Alpha Dog and I bought their drugs but you have to ask yourself how far you can go and still come back .
I had been losing friends to crystal meth .
The proximity to it was enough that I didnâ€ ™ t need to take that door.â€ �
Foster remarked last year that he â€œlost his fucking
marblesâ€ � while making The Program .
â€œThereâ€ ™ s a fallout , â€ � he tells me .
â€œDoping affects your mind .
It doesnâ€ ™ t make you feel high .
There are behaviours when youâ€ ™ ve got those chemicals running through your body that serve you on the bike but
which , when youâ€ ™ re not â€
¦
â€ �
He shakes his head .
â€œIâ€ ™ ve only just recovered physically .
Iâ€ ™ m only now getting my levels back.â€
�
I ask how the â€œfalloutâ€ � manifested .
â€œI donâ€ ™ t know how to separate the chemical influence from the psychological attachment I had to the character .
If itâ€ ™ s working , it keeps you up at night .
This is losing your marbles , right ?
Theyâ€ ™ re definitely rolling around .
Theyâ€ ™ re under the couch but theyâ€ ™ re retrievable.â€ �
Have there been times on other movies when he feared they might not be ?
â€œOh
, I donâ€
™ t wanna talk about those , â€ � he says , looking away bashfully .
The actor knew very little about Armstrong when Frears first approached him to play the part .
â€œI knew he started Livestrong , â€ � he says , referring to the charity that Armstrong established in 1997 in the wake of his own recovery from testicular cancer .
â€œI knew he was the greatest at one point .
I knew he was considered a liar.â€ �
Prior to immersing himself in a punishing training regime and spending time on the USA Pro Challenge tour in Colorado , he had no preconceptions .
â€œI was a really clean knife.â€ �
Fosterâ€ ™ s take on Armstrong , who declined his request for a meeting , is complicated .
â€œOn one hand , heâ€ ™ s a lying doper who tricked the world .
On the other , heâ€ ™ s a young man who faced cancer .
It changes you .
And when you go to war it changes you .
Thatâ€ ™ s what Lance did
â€ “
he went to war with his body .
That shifts your consciousness .
â€œHe started training within a culture that was doping : youâ€ ™ d have to go down 18 riders to find a clean one .
He survives death , the story catches fire and he recognises that .
â€œHeâ€ ™ s a smart man .
He says , â€˜I can do some good with this.â€ ™
He raised half a billion for cancer research .
We just donâ€ ™ t like him because he was Jesus Christ on a bicycle .
Weâ€
™ re mad he came back from the dead , saved the sick and then turned out to be full of shit .
And weâ€ ™ re punishing him because he didnâ€ ™ t apologise in the way
weâ€ ™ d like .
Americans love a good apology .
He wouldnâ€ ™ t do that.â€ � Mimicry wasnâ€ ™ t on the cards for Foster .
â€œThe word Iâ€ ™ m leaning toward is â€˜infectedâ€ ™ .
I tried to infect myself with him .
Get him into my system.â€ �
Thatâ€ ™ s apt given the disease imagery in the movie :
at one point , Armstrong describes the accusations about his doping as â€œmalignant cellsâ€ � trying to colonise him .
â€œIt was important to get his gait , his riding style .
I talked to people who had the aerodynamics of his body on a computer system so I could get the hump in the back , the heels slightly out .
Itâ€ ™ s almost a duck pedal .
Itâ€ ™ s not a delicate ride .
Itâ€ ™ s violent , which is also why heâ€ ™ s such an exciting rider .
Itâ€ ™ s like he wants to break the bike.â€ � A cautious admiration emerges when Foster discusses Armstrong .
â€œBelief and will got him through , not dope , â€ � he insists .
â€œDope certainly helped .
Had he not been doping he wouldnâ€ ™ t have won .
But his greatest attribute is his ability to believe heâ€ ™ s a winner.â€ �
He makes the connection to his own profession before I can .
â€œThat righteousness , that self - belief , could be considered akin to acting .
The best acting .
Itâ€ ™ s not lying ,
itâ€ ™ s belief.â€ �
Foster would know .
No one does authenticity quite like him .
Plucked out of his Iowa upbringing at the age of 14 , his first regular acting job was on the Disney series Flash Forward .
There was a muscularity and thoroughness to the television performances that followedâ€”as Eli , an exuberant high - school kid with learning difficulties in Judd Apatowâ€ ™ s Freaks and Geeks , or Russell , the bisexual art student in Six Feet Under .
This spilled over into cinema .
As a sadistic cowboy in 3:10 to Yuma or an Iraq war veteran bringing bad news to soldiersâ€ ™ families in The Messenger , a certain intensity was to be expected .
But regardless of whether the work is highbrow ( Kill Your Darlings ) or low ( X - Men : The Last Stand ) , he gives it his all .
Thereâ€
™ s no reason to expect anything different from him in the upcoming video game adaptation Warcraft .
â€œI get to play a motherfucking wizard!â€ � he exclaims .
â€œWalking in what is ostensibly a dress , with a staff , a wig and press - on nails , presents different challenges to riding a bicycle .
Especially when youâ€ ™ re trying to open a Coke.â€ �
The director Oren Moverman worked with Foster on The Messenger and Rampart before forming the production company Third Mind Pictures with him .
â€œI first became aware of Benâ€ ™ s work in 3:10 to Yuma , â€ � he tells me .
â€œWhen he appeared on screen , my immediate reaction was : â€˜Who in the world is that?â€ ™
He had an energy and ferociousness that immediately made me curious .
When we were casting The Messenger , Ben had a meeting with our producer who called me right after to tell me I have to meet this guy .
He said : â€˜Look into his eyes .
Itâ€ ™ s all there .
Iâ€ ™ ve never met anyone like him.â€ ™
As soon as we sat across from each other , I knew this was not only an extraordinary man and an extraordinary actor , but a guy who will teach me about directing .
He was the real deal .
Still is.â€
�
Though this remains true , Foster has observed in himself a change of attitude .
He measures out his explanation like grains of sand : â€œIâ€ ™ m learning not to hold on so tightly to my solitude.â€ �
As a young man , he says , he got caught up in suffering for his art .
â€œItâ€ ™ s not an economical way to work .
A driver would call it â€˜white - knucklingâ€ ™ .
If youâ€ ™ re holding on to the wheel so tightly , itâ€ ™ s gon na lock up your driving .
Releasing myself from trying to control everything has been part of growing up .
If I saw someone treating me the way I treated myself in my twenties , Iâ€ ™ d kick his ass!â€
�
No wonder he doesnâ€ ™ t get offered the comedy roles he professes to crave .
â€œMy heroes were always Looney Toons , Robin Williams , the Three Stooges .
I think everything I do is kinda funny .
I think
Iâ€ ™ m sort of ridiculous .
I bothered Judd quite a bit after Freaks and Geeks :
â€˜Let me play with you guys again .
Come on , I wanna laugh!â€ ™
He was , like : â€˜Nah , youâ€ ™ re fine doing your serious work.â€ ™
What can I do?â€
�
He puts his recent transformation down to age .
â€œItâ€
™ s really nice seeing the old - timers smile .
Iâ€ ™
d love to have more of that .
Iâ€ ™ m not going to beat this life .
Itâ€ ™ s gon na get me in the end .
So accepting that is a real freedom , and finding a joy in working that I havenâ€ ™ t allowed myself before .
I always thought you had to bang your head against a wall or stay up all night long .
The work is much closer to the surface now .
Itâ€ ™ s easier to access and also to let go after a movie .
Itâ€ ™ s a gentler landing.â€ �
That said , he sometimes finds old ghosts returning to him unexpectedly .
In London last year to appear on stage opposite Gillian Anderson in A Streetcar Named Desire ( a production that will be revived in New York next March ) , he found that William Burroughs , whom he played in Kill Your Darlings , kept surfacing in his thoughts .
â€œIâ€
™ m doing the laundry and suddenly there he is and Iâ€ ™ m talking to myself in his voice.â€ �
In all likelihood , then , he could have Lance Armstrong popping up in a few yearsâ€ ™ time
while heâ€ ™ s pushing a supermarket trolley .
He narrows his eyes and wags an accusatory finger at me .
â€œTalk about marbles .
Youâ€ ™ re pushing me in the direction of a complete multiple personality disorder here , arenâ€ ™ t you ?
Thatâ€ ™ s
where weâ€ ™ re going , right ?
â€˜Ladies and gentlemen
, I give you â€ ¦ Crazypants Foster!â€ ™ â€ �
The Program has its world premiere on Sunday at the Toronto International Film Festival .
It opens on 16 October ."
2015-09-13,"Two years ago , Alex Gibney premiered The Armstrong Lie in Toronto .
It was a documentary about Lance Armstrongâ€ ™ s fall from grace , itself precipitated by his cuckoo comeback Tour in 2009 , aged 37 .
The film invited anyone whoâ€ ™ d invested in Armstrongâ€ ™ s fiction to look into his eyes and try to assess his level of sociopathy .
Off the chain ?
Or more of a four ?
Yet somehow answers remained out of reach .
It was a strange , baggy , unresolved movie .
Gibneyâ€ ™ s own sense of betrayal blocked the bigger picture .
Plus , of course , you can eyeball someone all you like , but you still wonâ€ ™ t be able to actually tell what theyâ€ ™ re thinking .
Step in fiction .
Stephen Frearsâ€ ™ s movie isnâ€ ™ t a straight remake of the documentary whose territory it shares , as is the case for an unusual number of Tiff titles this year .
Itâ€ ™ s an adaptation of David Walshâ€ ™ s doping exposÃ © , for which the Sunday Times journalist was , at the time , hauled over the coals .
But unlike , say , Truth - a movie of Mary Mapesâ€ ™ s memoir about being dumped by CBS for a story she , too , struggled to prove - it doesnâ€ ™ t waste energy on endless vindication .
Rather , it grants you access to those moments that fact can not .
It lets you see what Armstrong so brilliantly hid : the injections and the back - stabs , the bullying and the blood bags , the creeping belief in his own lies .
And itâ€ ™ s this rationalisation that somehow makes such a singular story relatable .
Ben Foster plays Armstrong : a rare case of the actor being less attractive than the subject .
He does it brilliantly : pumping himself up into a coiled muscle of rage which exhibits as swagger .
Yes , heâ€ ™ s affected by that near - fatal testicular tumour at 21 , but he starts out as a nasty piece of work , too , simply getting worse as his success seems to necessitate .
His pusher is Michele Ferrari ( Guillaume Canet ) , an Italian physician genuinely excited by the chemistry , his foil is Walsh ( Chris Oâ€ ™ Dowd , very good and guileless ) , who worries at his heels , to no - oneâ€ ™ s ease .
We watch as the journalist is shunned by the rest of the reporting pack after confronting Armstrong .
How his colleagues side with the celeb , star - struck and self - interested , despite knowing heâ€ ™ s suspect .
Such dishonour is nicely counterpointed with the comradeship between cyclists , even clean rivals keeping silent .
Except , of course , for Floyd Landis , who finally spills on his own use of EPO after heâ€ ™ s caught , and then on everyone elseâ€ ™ s after Armstrong daftly shuns him as soiled goods .
As Landis , Jesse Plemons leaves a distinct impression , and the script serves him well .
The story of the Mormon hung out to dry was not something Gibneyâ€ ™ s film got round to .
The Program is flawed .
There are frequent flashbacks to events already seen which contradict Armstrongâ€ ™ s narrative â€ “ just in case
we hadnâ€
™ t twigged he was fibbing .
Music cues can feel a bit on - the - button (
â€˜Everybody Knowsâ€ ™ over the end credits , when everybody knows ) , and Dustin Hoffmanâ€ ™ s splashy cameo distracts .
But itâ€ ™ s a fluid and nippy telling of a tale that still seems strangely urgent .
Superfluous details never slow things down ( Armstrong meets and marries his wife in 30 seconds flat ; she then disappears ) .
And Frears finally decides to be merciless about his subject , happy to allow the audience to abandon sympathy .
Where his film excels is in examining how it feels to be unable to accept defeat , even when you know victory was ill - gained .
And in pulling no punches in pointing the finger at us , the gullible public , dumbly unable to reject an irresistible narrative .
The clues were there all along , The Program reminds us .
We just dug in our heels and presumed innocence , even though we knew it was too good to be true , despite having heard him tell us â€œweâ€ ™ re all the own authors of our own life
storyâ€ �
and we should â€œgo out there and write the best damn story you canâ€

The best place to hide is right out in front , in plain sight , in yellow ."

There is an artist who will transform your worn - out shoes into art , like Rumpelstiltskin spinning gold from straw .
Dotted around the gallery are sculptures that double as donation boxes for the relief of student debt â€ “ dig deep .
The performance artist Linder has choreographed a post - surrealist ballet .
There are working weaving machines , a pseudo - scientific contraption that supposedly imitates the enormous energy consumption of a Bitcoin factory ( weâ€ ™ ll return to that tall story ) and Stuart Whipps , the artist showing the Mini â€ “ one of the few made at Longridge in 1979 , a year of strikes under Thatcher â€ “ promises to reverse history by gradually transforming the wreck back into a gleaming vehicle to be driven again at the showâ€ ™
s end .
A more political Rumpelstiltskin .
The curators , in their catalogue , say their selection of new and old work and a few special commissions dwells on the object â€œat a time of increasing convergence between the real and the virtualâ€ � .
This goes two ways in the show .
On the one hand there are some conspicuously , not to say effortfully handcrafted works â€ “ huge knotted rugs ; hangings stitched out of leather scraps that look uncannily like Paul Klee watercolours ; outsize relief panels by that wildboy ceramicist Jesse Wine that play on the substance of Morandiâ€ ™ s china vessels , as well as the texture of his still lifes .
On the other hand , much of the work centres on artificial intelligence , virtual reality and electronics .
Lawrence Abu Hamdanâ€
™ s
A Convention of Tiny Movements considers ( and depicts , in wall - size photographs ) all sorts of innocent objects , from tissues to crisp packets , which can be transformed into listening devices for surveillance .
Melanie Gilliganâ€ ™ s droll sequence of short films , The Common Sense , features a futuristic invention known as The Patch that can transmit emotions directly from person to person , resulting in some grotesque forms of barter and blackmail .
And the Bitcoin â€œfactoryâ€ � in Yuri
Pattisonâ€ ™ s installation , which apparently runs continuous calculations verifying online peer - to - peer payments , is streamed live into the gallery on a computer feed from China .
Pattison wants to make the virtual processes real in our mindâ€ ™ s eye ; his film presents a place , his contraption proposes the metaphor of mining .
So far so fascinating â€ “ in theory .
But there is a high proportion of glum and dreary art to behold in real life .
Whippsâ€ ™ s work in progress may be exemplary in its moral purpose ( heâ€ ™ s involving several ex - Longbridge workers ) but the car itself looks like any other totalled wreck .
Spoonerâ€ ™ s internet dross is just as it sounds .
And Pattisonâ€ ™ s computer feed is strictly for the nerds .
Some of the 42 artists selected for this edition are very well established â€ “ Ryan Gander , Hayley Tompkins , Ciara Phillips .
Lynette Yiadom - Boakye has just closed a solo show of portraits at the Serpentine Gallery ; Jessica Warboys has a solo show of sea - roiled canvases at Tate St Ives next year .
Laure Prouvost won the Turner prize in 2013 .
Although her audiovisual interplay between an e - cigarette and a slab of butter is not without its humour , itâ€ ™ s hardly her most riveting work .
The British Art Show is always a risky venture ; the curators can select artists at the height of their gifts , but still these stars may present nothing interesting at all , whereas younger artists will suddenly shine .
Rachel Macleanâ€ ™ s glitzy po - mo films hadnâ€
™ t impressed much in the past , but her latest work , Feed Me , with its hideous cast of bestial men and half - human creatures got up in kidsâ€ ™ clothes and smiley badges , is an unforgettable satire on the commercialisation of childhood , with sinister sexual undertones
â€ “ coruscatingly creepy and astute .
Nothing much could or should be deduced about the state of art from the BAS , which is inevitably a jumble that scarcely coheres .
Although this one appears low on visual excitement compared to the last , it is high on moving images , with new films by John Akomfrah and Trevor Mathison , James Richards ( a particularly beautiful use of reversed negatives ) and Bedwyr Williams , whose self - portrait as an archaeological relic observing the antics of contemporary Cambridge society through the objects in the Fitzwilliam Museum is gloriously comic , wild and inventive .
â€¢ British Art Show 8 is at Leeds Art Gallery until 10 January 2016 .
Then touring to various venues in Edinburgh ( 13 February to 8 May )
Norwich ( 24 June to 4 September ) and Southampton ( 8 Octâ€“14 Jan 2017 ) ."
2015-10-12,"Youâ€ ™ d have a job imagining anyone less like Lance Armstrong than the comedian Kieran Hodgson .
The Tour de France - conquering , cancer - defying drugs cheat was will - to - power in human form ; the mild - mannered comic has already accepted , aged only 27 ,
that he canâ€
™ t be the comedian he wants to be , because â€œI donâ€ ™ t think I have the convictionâ€ � .
Armstrong recognised no obstacle to his ambitions â€ “ not morality , not the law .
Hodgson , by contrast , has quietly decommissioned his dream of playing Doctor
Who , because : â€œI fear I have this curse of looking a bit like David Tennant , and that may scupper things.â€ �
And yet , it was
Lance Armstrongâ€ ™ s
story â€ “ or at least , a homespun Yorkshire take on it
â€ “ that bagged this gentle young joker
an Edinburgh Comedy award nomination this summer .
And it was Armstrong who ( according to the show ) inspired teenage Hodgson to pursue a life in comedy .
Is that true
I ask him when we meet in the calm after the fringe storm .
â€œIn my shows , â€ � he says , â€œthe personal stuff about me has to be true
, otherwise I would feel fraudulent doing it.â€
�
But fraudulence is the Armstrong modus operandi as Hodgsonâ€ ™ s show â€ “ which plays fabulous games with truth and fiction
â€ “ acknowledges .
Sure enough , the comic confesses , his supposed obsession with Lance was â€œa bit exaggerated .
He was one of several heroes .
But prime mover for all my major decisions in life ?
Thatâ€ ™ s not the case.â€
�
Maybe , according to the opposites - attract principle , Armstrongâ€ ™ s mendacity was what attracted Hodgson : the comedian seems appalled at the thought that he might be duping people .
After 2014â€ ™ s French Exchange , Lance was the second of his â€œnorthern coming - of - age storiesâ€ �
: multi - character plays showcasing
Hodgsonâ€ ™ s terrific array of voices and provincial characters , and in which our hostâ€ ™ s dweeby adolescent self stumbles towards maturity .
Lance , which traces Hodgsonâ€ ™ s teenage love of cycling , via Armstrongâ€ ™ s disgrace , all the way to Yorkshireâ€ ™ s very own Tour de France in 2014 â€
“ is jam - packed with laugh - lines , without sacrificing the poignancy of a tale whose hero migrates south , leaving friends and his old identity behind .
But when invited to reflect on its success , all Hodgson remembers is â€œwaking up every day in Edinburgh dreading I was going to get found outâ€ � .
The problem , he says , is that : â€œIâ€ ™ ve done enough things that arenâ€ ™ t good to feel that if I do something good , Iâ€ ™ ve just been lucky .
Itâ€ ™ s not necessarily down to skill.â€ �
Believe me , the success of Lance is abundantly down to Hodgsonâ€ ™ s skills .
But letâ€ ™ s examine the counter - argument .
A childhood Blackadder fan who decided aged seven on a career in comedy , Hodgson is already a veteran of nine Edinburgh fringes , after taking up comedy at Oxford University .
He was a member of short - lived sketch trio Kieran and the Joes , whose principles of high quality control he proudly maintains .
â€œThe philosophy was very much that a half - laugh was worse than no laugh at all .
It should either appeal to everyone , or you get rid of it.â€ �
Imagine the frustration , then , when his first solo show â€ “ featuring 22 characters but nothing whatsoever of Hodgson himself â€ “ flopped .
â€œIâ€ ™ d always done well at school , â€ � says Hodgson .
â€œI was used to being good at things .
So the idea that I was quantifiably not good at something really annoyed me.â€ �
By 2013 , he was in a hole .
â€œI needed to work out : what is it that I do?â€ �
He knew what he couldnâ€ ™ t do : â€œIâ€ ™ m reconciled to the fact that Iâ€ ™ m never going to be a niche comic , â€ � he tells me .
â€œIâ€
™ m not sufficiently interesting.â€
�
His heroes are Chris Morris and The League of Gentlemen , and the peers he most admires are likewise â€œdoing things that are very left - of - centre .
But I lack the courage to go through that fire .
I want to be loved too much.â€ � Hodgson credits fellow comic Ben Target for helping him traverse that career crossroads two years ago .
â€œHe said , â€˜You are interesting enough , there is something distinctive about you .
Donâ€ ™ t be afraid of putting something of yourself into a show.â€ ™ â€ � Cue French Exchange , whose conceit â€ “ an autobiographical rites - of - passage story , introduced , narrated and performed by Hodgson â€ “ was retained for Lance .
Hodgson questions how much mileage is left in the format ( â€œthereâ€ ™ s only so many coming - of - age stories you can tellâ€ � ) , but is already dredging his life story for next yearâ€ ™ s show .
â€œItâ€ ™ ll be about Mahler , â€ � he promises .
â€œMusicâ€ ™ s the next one .
Iâ€ ™ m just working through my hobbies.â€ �
In the meantime , heâ€ ™ s just finished filming a one - off drama about the making of Dadâ€ ™ s
Army , in which he plays Ian ( Private Pike ) Lavender .
Buoyed by Lanceâ€ ™ s success , heâ€
™ s starting to fantasise about â€œa TV project over which I have total controlâ€ � .
Heâ€
™ s also been invited to bring Lance to the Civic Hall in his native Holmfirth .
â€œIâ€ ™
d love to be doing gigs around the country with my show ,
â€ � he says , delighted that the possibility is now a likelihood .
â€œI never saw myself in live comedy for the long haul .
I thought it would be a gateway , then Iâ€ ™ d disappear into acting .
But now , â€ � he says , â€œIâ€ ™ m intrigued to see how far I can take it.â€

Lance is at Soho theatre , London , 13 - 17 October ( 020 - 7478 0100 ) , and at the Invisible Dot , London , 2 - 14 November ( 020 - 7424 8918 ) ."
2015-10-15,"This workmanlike biopic of disgraced doper and Tour de France cycling champ Lance Armstrong features a very good lead performance from Ben Foster .
He conjures up Armstrongâ€ ™ s pop - eyed fanaticism in the cause of winning , and his knack of never giving a straight answer .
Itâ€ ™ s an interesting film to set alongside Alex Gibneyâ€ ™ s 2013 documentary
The Armstrong Lie , which was compromised by a certain complicity with its subject , though Gibney just about extricated himself midway through filming when the truth about Armstrong became known .
This movie at least has its story straight .
It is adapted by John Hodge from the book by Sunday Times investigative reporter David Walsh ( here played by Chris Oâ€ ™ Dowd ) , who battled from the outset to uncover the truth about Armstrong .
In a conventional underdog sports movie â€ “ the kind that Armstrong probably had in mind for himself â€ “ his cancer diagnosis would occur later in the running time and more would be made of his entirely genuine ordeal .
Here , the cancer occurs early on , and the emphasis is on his beady - eyed determination to push it to one side and carry on to glory , using the banned drugs that he was quite sure all his competitors were using anyway : only he would use better drugs and conceal them better .
Itâ€ ™ s a watchable piece of work , but doesnâ€ ™ t quite do justice to the subtle wriggling and squirming and sheer denial that characterised Armstrongâ€ ™ s downfall ."
2015-10-18,"The BBFC description says â€œstrong language , use of performance enhancing drugsâ€ � â€ “ a description that could apply both to the film and its real - life subject .
Ben Foster is scarily convincing as Lance Armstrong , the cancer survivor who became a record - breaking Tour de France winner thanks to a unique blend of charismatic determination and biochemical enhancement .
Like Stephen Frearsâ€ ™ s award - winning Philomena , this casts a comedian in a straight role as the journalist who leads us through the story , and upon whose writings the script is based .
Chris Oâ€ ™ Dowd is Sunday Times reporter David Walsh , whose exposÃ © of Armstrongâ€ ™ s systematic doping provoked an aggressive lawsuit .
Seasoned pros Frears and screenwriter John Hodge handle the sharp corners of the story with aplomb , although thereâ€ ™ s little here that wasnâ€ ™ t covered in Alex Gibneyâ€ ™ s superior 2013 documentary The Armstrong Lie .
As with Robert Zemeckisâ€ ™ s current release
The Walk ( which follows in the footsteps of James Marshâ€
™ s Man on Wire )
, the documentary is arguably both more dramatic and more truthful , although Zemeckisâ€ ™ s film does feature an existence - justifying wire - walking set piece .
Thereâ€ ™ s nothing to match
that here , cinematographer Danny Cohenâ€ ™ s urgent bike footage playing second fiddle to the behind - the - scenes action in the hospital rooms , training centres , and mobile blood transfusion units where the dirty deeds were done ."
2015-11-08,"â€œThe bicycle is a great good , â€ � said Samuel Beckett , the cycling enthusiast who also wrote some plays , â€œbut it can turn nasty , if ill - employed.â€ �
Well yes indeed .
Bikes can be vehicles for ET or Lance Armstrong .
They played a part in the emancipation of women and of people who couldnâ€ ™ t afford horses or cars .
They can be emblems of right - thinking , environmentally friendly city government or the weapons of self - righteous , passive - aggressive machismo .
John Major , citing Orwell on Englishness , spoke of â€œold maids bicycling to holy communion through the morning mistâ€ � ; Alfred Jarry , in his 1902 novella Supermale , imagined a man who followed a 10,000-mile cycle race against a locomotive by having sex 82 times in 24 hours , with fatal consequences for at least one of his partners .
Like a steam engine or a gun , the bicycle is one of those machines that seems to have existed forever , to have been an eternal idea waiting to be found rather than the outcome of various Victorian gents proceeding through trial and error .
It is something to do with their basic simplicity , the way they are extensions of and reflections of the body , also the way they are a bit like horses and a bit like skeletons .
Steam engines are obsolete and guns can be nasty , which leaves bicycles in a special position .
They are archetypes on to which people project their hopes for society , for cities and for the environment .
In Britain they have a role as bastions of pride in industry and sport , making bikes and riding them fast being two things the country or , rather , certain people within the country currently do well .
At least some of these attributes might explain why it will soon be possible to see a lot of bicycles on display in two of Londonâ€ ™ s major institutions .
Ai Weiweiâ€ ™ s bike - rich show at the Royal Academy is already on .
Cycle Revolution , the Design Museumâ€ ™ s last exhibition before it relocates next year to the former Commonwealth Institute in Kensington , opens in 10 daysâ€ ™ time .
Cycle Revolution will divide cyclists into four â€œtribesâ€ �
â€ “ â€œhigh performersâ€ � , â€œthrill - seekersâ€ � , â€œurban ridersâ€
� and â€œcargo bikersâ€
�
â€ “ with associated exhibits and the voices of â€œadvocatesâ€ � for each category .
Chris Hoy will speak for high performers , and the Team GB Olympic bike , essential to his and othersâ€ ™ success , will be put on a plinth .
The Lotus 108 , on which Chris Boardman started the UKâ€ ™ s modern Olympic success by winning a gold medal in 1992 , will be shown .
The BMX racer Shanaze Reade will represent thrill - seekers .
The urban riders section will include the rival giants of British small - wheeled , folding - bike manufacture , Moulton and Brompton .
Under â€œcargo bikersâ€
� you will find Porterlight Bicycles , whose founder , Lawrence Brand , gave up a career in the City to realise his idea of a freight bike , which he also tested by riding from Bucharest to the Chinese border .
The exhibition will show urban projects such as the mayor of Londonâ€ ™ s superhighways and â€œmini Hollandsâ€ � , which are cycle - friendly town centres .
There will be the more speculative Thames Deckway project , which at an estimated cost of Â£600 m would put cycle tracks on pontoons in the Thames .
This sounds a bit pricey and its designs still look crude and underdeveloped .
It needs to address rather obvious practical questions ( given that the Thames is very much not a straight line , how good a transport route can it be ?
How exactly do you get on and off the deckway ? ) , but it has the advantage over other things - on - water fantasies that , if it did actually work , it would serve a clear purpose .
There will also be possible bikes of the future , most of them with a sustainable theme , in plywood , bamboo or solid ash , or foldable , packable or dismantlable , or 3D - printed .
It is a feature of bikes that , while the basic form is hard to reinvent , immense ingenuity can go into the composition of its basic parts .
The degree of current reinvention sets them apart from cars , which have remained fundamentally similar for years now , apart from progressive upgrades in their efficiency .
This property , of inviting multiple variations within a simple theme , is not unlike the infinite expression that can be found in the familiar , relatively few elements of human physiognomy and dress .
It allows bicycles to be invested with subtle increments of meaning , aspiration and status .
To spend thousands on a custom - made bicycle , as is increasingly popular , is not necessarily just about comfort and pleasure , but also about a sublimated form of display .
To invest design energy in renewable materials is praiseworthy but , given that bicycles
donâ€ ™ t weigh much compared to other industrial objects , which might therefore benefit more from such an approach , you wonder if part of the attraction is not in the symbolic power of a bike .
It might be more useful to make an articulated lorry more sustainable , but it wouldnâ€ ™ t look so cool .
For bicycles are messengers .
Picasso recognised that they carry meaning when he made a saddle and handlebars into a bullâ€ ™ s head , and Duchamp ( in his case , non - meaning ) when he put a bicycle wheel in an art gallery .
Now they are emissaries of hopefulness , healthiness , humanity , social spirit and benign technology .
When a city is held up as model of enlightened management , from BogotÃ ¡ to Copenhagen , you can be sure that bicycles wonâ€ ™ t be far away .
When Boris Johnson wants to set himself apart from the run of charmless , uncaring Tories , he wields a bike .
If Ambrogio Lorenzetti were painting his allegory of good government today , or if Plato were writing The Republic , there would be pedals in them .
It can get absurd and simplistic .
The obsession with cycle lanes can obscure the fact that other things , such as good housing and well - made public spaces , make a good city .
A panglossian belief in the blamelessness of bikes ignores their sublimated aggression , which can then surface in various forms of rage .
A cycling crowd might , as it passes through a city , carry the pious aura of a procession of monks , but to taxi drivers and pedestrians it can look more like a horde of Huns .
But for all that the bike is , as Beckett said , more good than bad .
It is also , for an invention nearly two centuries old , remarkably good at representing the beliefs and values of the present .
â€¢ Cycle Revolution is at the Design Museum , London SE1 from 18 November to 30 June"
2016-01-06,"The former Rabobank rider Michael Boogerd has been banned from cycling for two years for historical doping offences .
The Dutchman confessed to having used the banned blood booster EPO , cortisone and blood transfusions in an interview in 2013 .
â€œThe period I used banned substances was from 1997 to 2007 , the end of my career , â€ � said Boogerd , who was an official with the Dutch second - tier team Roompot Oranje last season and has also worked as a commentator .
Boogerd , 43 , was a specialist in the one - day classics who won the Amstel Gold race in 1999 , edging Lance Armstrong into second place , and had two stage wins in the Tour de France .
The sportâ€ ™ s
governing body , the UCI , said in a statement : â€œMichael Boogerd has been sanctioned with a two yearsâ€ ™ ineligibility for the anti - doping rule violations he committed during his cycling career .
The ban is effective until 21 December 2017.â€ �"
2016-06-27,"A fortnight of unprecedented sporting intensity starts here for France , with the knockout phase of Euro 2016 coinciding with the buildup to the Tour , and its opening nine days .
The last time French minds were split between the football and the Tour was 2000 , in what now seems like a different world : it was the heyday of Zinedine Zidane and company , Lance Armstrong was beginning the second year of his dominant if ultimately provisional reign and terrorism was largely a dark memory , anything but a threat to the worldâ€ ™ s greatest cycle race .
The Tour , famously , has always gone ahead apart from in the darkest years of world war , no matter what the national background , most notably when the government insisted that amidst the uprising of 1968 there should be no question of shelving it for a year , so important was the need to demonstrate that life in France was still on a normal footing .
That context will be foremost in most minds in the next four weeks as France continues with the state of emergency declared after the attacks of last November ; the Tour will take place under a level of security cover unprecedented in its 113-year history .
On the road , the obvious starting point is whether Chris Froome can join the exalted ranks of three - times Tour winners , a rare status with only Philippe Thys ( 1913 - 14 , 1920 ) , Louison Bobet ( 1953 - 55 ) and Greg LeMond ( 1986 , 1989 - 90 ) behind the five - times victors Anquetil , Merckx , Hinault and Indurain .
The Kenyan - born , Monaco - domiciled Briton was surprisingly close to letting the race lead slip in the latter stages of his second career win last year and Team Sky have rarely looked the consistently dominant machine of the past throughout 2016 , so on paper Froome has to be vulnerable in what could prove a unique clash of two generations .
Last yearâ€ ™ s runner - up , Nairo Quintana , has enjoyed a buildup as smooth
as Froomeâ€ ™ s â€ “ the Colombian won his last race , the Route du Sud , as coolly as Froome won his , the DauphinÃ © LibÃ
©
rÃ
©
â€ “ and with his leadership status in the Movistar squad apparently unchallenged , he should start as the race favourite simply because , the law of physical progression being what it is
, he is visibly getting stronger year on year .
The generational battle pits the men who have dominated the Tour since 2007 , led by Alberto Contador , Froome , and the Italian Vincenzo Nibali , against their obvious successors : Quintana , Franceâ€ ™ s Thibaut Pinot , perhaps the Australian Richie Porte or the American Tejay van Garderen , and certainly the Italian Fabio Aru , with a potential subplot being that Nibali and Aru wear the same jersey , the turquoise of Astana .
Nominally Aru is the leader , Nibali having won the Giro dâ€ ™ Italia back in May , but relations between the two Italians are known to be tense at best , and they will be constantly scrutinised for the slightest hint of strain .
There is obvious potential there for a repeat of the fratricidal battle between Froome and his former leader Bradley Wiggins , not to mention the epic of 30 years ago between Hinault and LeMond ; if Nibali were to get a sniff of the fabled double of the Tour and the Giro dâ€ ™ Italia , would he be able to resist ?
To add to the uncertainty , this is a different kind of Tour , with a route that offers conventional challenges such as Mont Ventoux alongside relative novelties such as a short mountain time trial , a brutal day out in the Jura , and a potential pitfall as early as day twoâ€ ™ s uphill finish in Cherbourg .
That the final challenge is a technical , terrifying descent from an Alpine pass , rather than the usual mountain top or flat time trial , seems utterly typical of a crazily varied course .
Another sense in which 2000 seems a world away is that back then , the home challenge was nonexistent ; in the era now referred to as â€œtwo - speed cyclingâ€ � , the light of French hopes barely flickered in the dark time where most Tour contenders manipulated their blood as casually as antifreeze is topped up in a car , but more often .
This year is different : last yearâ€ ™ s third finisher , Pinot , has developed time trialling skill , and two other talented climbers , Warren Barguil and Romain Bardet , have progressed seamlessly enough to suggest that one day between the three of them they can end the hiatus , currently 31 years , since France last won the Tour .
There is even a new generation of French sprinters â€ “ Nacer Bouhanni , Arnaud DÃ
© mare and Bryan Coquard â€
“ who have broken through this season and will all target stage wins .
This should be one of the more open Tours for years , which could turn to the home
menâ€ ™
s
advantage
although in many eyes it may be too early for any of them to carry the maillot jaune into Paris .
Each will carry the weight of a nation on his shoulders , because if ever there was a time when France desperately needs heroes and role models to emerge , with a little romance and drama along the way , it is now .
â€¢
This article was amended on 1 July 2016 to include Philippe Thys in a list of riders to have won the Tour de France three times ."
2016-06-29,"There could be worse summers for Welsh sportsmen to conquer France and following the grand run of Chris Colemanâ€ ™ s men
Geraint Thomas will be ready to take over .
As they were last year , Thomas and his Cardiff colleague Luke Rowe will be
Chris Froomeâ€ ™ s wingmen at the Tour de France , but with a subtle difference : this July is Thomasâ€ ™ s first chance in seven Tours to see precisely what he can achieve .
It is , astonishingly , nine years since Thomas made his Tour debut as a chubby - cheeked 21-year - old , in the days when Lance Armstrong was a recent memory .
His Tour career has included spells in the white jersey of best young rider and a memorable battle to finish the 2013 race with a fractured pelvis , but it was only in 2015 that it became clear the 2012 Olympic gold medallist might be capable of a serious challenge for the overall standings .
Last year , Thomas maintained a high overall placing through the Pyrenees and deep into the Alps , holding third overall before fading at the end .
That was enough to persuade the management at Team Sky that he should be given more freedom in 2016 , provided that his needs could be made to fit alongside Froomeâ€ ™ s challenge for a third overall title in four years .
Team Sky have unhappy memories of the last time they started a Tour with two leaders â€ “ the tense 2012 race won by Bradley Wiggins from Froome with a fair bit of acrimony along the way â€ “ but Thomas is crystal clear about the brief for the next four weeks .
â€œItâ€ ™ s about doing a good job for Froome and holding on for an individual result for myself .
I will have a bit of a free role .
Chris is well up for it , he knows when it comes down to it Iâ€ ™ ve always done the job for him , and
heâ€ ™ s keen for me to get a bit of personal glory , a personal result
even if itâ€ ™ s only a top 10 [ overall].â€ �
The differences this year for Thomas are relatively subtle but could have major implications .
First up , he has been given a certain amount of personal freedom to target major stage races .
The results have been mixed , beginning with a narrow victory in Paris - Nice â€ “ a race he used to rush home from school to watch on TV â€
“ after an epic final stage battle against Alberto Contador .
That was counterbalanced by a struggle in the Tour of Switzerland last week , where he faded horribly on the final mountain stage , suffering in the cold and wet conditions , to finish 17th overall .
The biggest change , however , will be in his approach to the Tour .
In previous years , he has been one of the riders delegated with keeping Froome out of trouble on the early flat stages , after which he would switch seamlessly to a mountain domestiqueâ€ ™ s role , setting the pace on the climbs until Froome made his moves .
That versatility promised much but the volume of work he had to get through meant that he was always likely to fade eventually .
This year , however , Thomas will have license to ride more economically early on .
â€œIn the first week I wonâ€ ™ t have to do as much , I will be able to save so much more energy .
I will be able to think about myself more , protect myself .
You never know quite how itâ€ ™ s going to work though .
I might feel better or I might not be as high up as last year.â€ �
He will then look to play the same mountain role as in 2015 ; as he notes , â€œwhen you get to a point in the mountains where there are only four , five or six guys left and you are one of them , you are going to get into the overall standings anyway.â€
� Focusing on the Tour has meant moving away from the spring Classics , which were previously his other priority , but there are upsides to stage racing .
â€œYou get more chances .
There are more stage races in the season rather than just three weeks for the Classics .
In a stage race you can have bad luck or make a mistake and itâ€ ™ s not the end of the race .
You have more opportunities.â€ �
In â€œfour or five yearsâ€ � , at the end of his career , he may return to those one - day events .
At the end of 2015 , Thomas signed a one - year contract extension at Sky , with an option for a second , which means much depends on the next few weeks .
â€œItâ€ ™ s a matter of keeping my options open .
If this year goes well , next year I might be better going somewhere else to look for an even better result.â€
�
Another possibility , he says , is that he may target races other than the Tour :
â€œdepending how the Tour goes , Iâ€ ™ d like to try the Giro and the Vuelta .
I think you can perform in both in the same year ; if you are as good at the Vuelta as at the Tour you will always have a chance because a lot of guys are off form by then.â€
�
As for the immediate challenge , he is certain this yearâ€ ™
s
Tour will bring surprises .
â€œThere is more climbing all round and a mountain time trial which is something they havenâ€ ™ t had in the Tour since I turned professional .
â€œThe last four days are super - tough ; a lot can change then .
You could be two minutes down going into the last rest day and still win.â€ �"
2016-07-02,"This weekend the Norman island of Le Mont - Saint - Michel hosts the Grand DÃ
© part of the 103rd Tour De France .
Defending British champion Chris Froome hopes to become the eighth cyclist to win the general classification ( GC ) prize for a third time ( excluding Lance Armstrong whose seven wins have been nullified after he admitted to doping ) .
There is a passing - the - torch flavour to the list of repeat winners .
Bernard Hinault won five times in eight years between 1978 and 1985 .
He almost did it again in 1986 , nearly pipping teammate Greg LeMond to the post .
American LeMond , the first cyclist from an English - speaking country to win the GC , eventually triumphed , and would do so again in 1989 and 1990 .
His run was ended in 1991 by the imperious Spaniard Miguel Indurain , who would go on to complete his own five - year winning streak .
Froome is the bookiesâ€ ™ choice and has already said he prefers the course to the route he won on last year .
However , he is not the only man vying for a third GC trophy with Spanish veteran Alberto Contador also in the running to build on his 2007 and 2009 wins ."
2016-07-14,"Mont Ventoux is often described as a mountain with a personality and a particularly malevolent one at that , so the bizarre Bastille Day finish at Chalet Reynard seemed somehow in character for a mountain which has ended dreams , careers and lives when the Tour de France has scaled its heights .
The sight of the yellow jersey , Chris Froome , running up Mont Ventoux without his bike was surreal , on a par with the episode at Gap in 2003 when Lance Armstrong was forced to take a short cut across a field to avoid a crash and ran back on to the road with his bike on his shoulder , cyclocross style .
The chaos on the road was followed by confusion among race officials over the yellow jersey and it all stemmed from the latest in a long series of incidents in which spectators and race vehicles have affected the race , sometimes to far more dangerous effect â€ “ the gendarme wielding a camera who brought down the bunch sprint at ArmentiÃ¨res in 1994 and the television car that took out Johnny Hoogerland and Juan - Antonio Flecha in 2011 , to mention only two .
The background issues are complex : a sport held on open roads that is uniquely vulnerable to outside interference , where over succeeding years more and more fans have taken to running as close to the riders as they can , ignoring constant pleas to keep clear , as recently as last Saturday from Froome himself .
For years there have been complaints the Tour is getting too big for its own good â€ “ and that of the men who risk their lives to race it
â€ “ and this will merely accentuate the debate .
Similarly , the scale of the caravan of motorbikes and cars is a continuing problem , which has caused other more serious accidents in other events this year ; but the specific issue on the Ventoux was that the motorbikes had nowhere to go because of the weight of fans pressing on to the road .
Similar scenes are witnessed each year , if not quite as extreme as this , and in that sense this was an accident waiting to happen .
â€œThere were so many motorbikes in the way , it wasnâ€ ™ t safe , â€ � said the Frenchman Romain Bardet .
â€œYou had to brake when you were attacking .
We need to have a long conversation about security here .
It was unacceptable , what happened today.â€
�
The bizarre sequence of events obscured the sporting picture .
In the context of the Tourâ€ ™ s three weeks this was not the conclusive result it might have proved had the finish been held adjacent to the observatory six kilometres higher up the mountain .
The stage ended at the treeline to spare the riders being exposed to the dangerously strong winds on the bare upper slopes .
Froome attacked in the final kilometres yet was unable to show the same strength he had displayed here in 2013 , but all his rivals looked little better .
When the race leader , Richie Porte and Bauke Mollema collided with the television motorbike , the trio had pulled clear of the remains of the main group , but not decisively so .
Mollema finished 19 seconds ahead of Nairo Quintana , Adam Yates and company , so Froome was credited with his time , as was the Australian , meaning the overall standings barely changed before Fridayâ€ ™ s time - trial stage westwards into the ArdÃ¨che .
The only major casualty was the Irishman Daniel Martin , who slipped off the pace seven kilometres from the finish and dropped from third to ninth overall .
A few minutes ahead of Froome and company , the stage win was contested by the remains of a 13-rider escape which included a handful of Frenchmen looking for a prestigious win on the FÃªte Nationale , but the home men froze and the surreal finish became a Belgian story , as the French term a bizarre event in which their neighbours are involved .
The final two survivors were Thomas De Gendt of the Lotto team and Serge Pauwels from Mark Cavendishâ€
™ s
Dimension Data , and it was De Gendt who showed the greater strength in the final metres .
To rub salt in wounded national pride , he relieved Thibaut Pinot of the King of the Mountains jersey .
As predicted , the wind played its part well before the foot of the mountain was reached .
The Etixx team did much of the damage , pulling a 40-rider group two minutes clear of the rest of the peloton , with the aim of eliminating Fabio Aru of Italy and Warren Barguil of France , two possible rivals to Martin for a high overall placing .
The Italian struggled with mechanical issues all day but was finally saved when a crash involving Simon Gerrans of Orica - Bike Exchange and Team Skyâ€ ™ s Ian Stannard caused the front group to slow down at Froomeâ€ ™ s prompting .
As on Wednesday , the constant effort and cumulative fatigue played its part in the final showdown and , ironically in view of earlier events , it was Martin who lost time on the mountain .
The Ventoux stage was the first of two consecutive days that will help to define whether Froome is likely to win his third Tour , and who , if anyone , may challenge him ; the second is Fridayâ€ ™ s 37.5 km time trial finishing at La Caverne du Pont dâ€ ™ Arc .
The course includes two hills and a lengthy stretch along a plateau , where the north wind â€ “ forecast to blow at 30kph â€ “ could make this even harder than expected .
Froome said he expected to gauge his effort on the Ventoux so he would have some strength left in his legs for stage 13 but he would never have expected them to have to do quite what he asked of them in the final kilometre of stage 12 ."

2016-09-23,"The controversy around Sir Bradley Wigginsâ€ ™ s use of a banned corticosteroid before three major stage races deepened on Friday night when his former team doctor at the Garmin team , Prentice Steffen , questioned the practice in an interview with the BBCâ€ ™ s Newsnight programme .
Both Wiggins and his team at the time , Team Sky , have stated that he was given injections of triamcinolone acetate to treat a legitimate medical condition and that no anti - doping rules were broken .
Steffen was the team doctor at Garmin in 2009 when Wiggins made his breakthrough performance at the Tour de France , finishing fourth overall and subsequently being upgraded to third after Lance Armstrong was found guilty of doping .
At that time Wiggins had therapeutic use exemptions permitting the use of an asthma inhaler containing salbutamol , a practice that has since been made legal .
Steffen told Newsnight : â€œI was surprised to see that there were TUEs documented for intramuscular triamcinolone just before three major events.â€ � The TUEs , leaked through the hacking website Fancy Bears on 15 September , were issued shortly before the 2011 and 2012 Tours de France â€ “ the latter an event that Wiggins won â€ “ and the 2013 Giro dâ€ ™ Italia , where he abandoned .
â€œYou do have to think it is kind of coincidental that a big dose of intramuscular long - acting corticosteroids would be needed at that exact time before the most important race of the season , â€ � said Steffen .
â€œI would certainly say now it does not look good , it doesnâ€
™ t look right from a health or a sporting perspective.â€ �
Steffen worked at the US Postal Service team in the mid-1990s , before Lance Armstrong joined them , and subsequently spoke out against the team and Armstrong over doping .
Speaking to Newsnight he called upon cyclingâ€ ™
s
governing body , the UCI , to act over TUEs , adding :
â€œI would say that Bradley is probably at the bottom of the list to be held personally responsible .
â€œI think his doctor and his team , to make the decision to apply for that TUE , is questionable and then I think for the UCI or UK cycling or Wada to sign off on that application , all things considered that is the end point where the TUE committee should have looked at that and said , no , this is not acceptable
so we are not going to approve
it.â€
�
Team Sky said at the time of the leaks â€ “ which confirmed that Chris Froome had TUEs in 2013 and 2014 to take tablets containing the corticosteroid prednisolone â€ “ that â€œapplications for TUEs have all been managed and recorded in line with the processes put in place by the governing bodies.â€ �
A statement on behalf of Wiggins following the leaks read : â€œEveryone knows Brad suffers from asthma , his medical treatment is British Cycling and International Cycling Union approved and like all Team GB athletes he follows Wada regulations to the letter.â€ �
Amidst details of Wigginsâ€ ™ s treatment and the development of the allergy
, the TUE application forms leaked by Fancy Bears stated that the 2012 Tour winnerâ€ ™ s TUEs were issued to treat â€œlife long allergy to pollen nasal congestion / rhinorrhoea , known allergy to grass pollen , sneezing throat irritation , wheezing leading to dysnopnoea eye watering runny nose.â€
�
Newsnight also spoke to the Dane Michael Rasmussen , who has confessed to using a variety of banned drugs during his career plus practices such as blood doping .
Asked to comment on Wigginsâ€ ™ s TUEs , Rasmussen said : â€œJust looking at the drugs and looking at the dates of the injections it looks very much like something that could have happened 10 years ago when I was riding for general classification in the Tour de France .
If you look solely at the pattern of TUEs , this looks very suspicious .
Itâ€ ™ s something that I would do ,
that I did.â€
�
During his time at the Dutch Rabobank team , Rasmussen worked with Geert Leinders , a Belgian doctor who went on to work at Team Sky on a freelance basis in 2011 and 2012 after the team had dropped an initial policy of not hiring medics with a background in professional cycling .
Both Team Sky and Wigginsâ€ ™ s spokespeople have stated categorically the riderâ€ ™ s TUEs were not requested by Dr Leinders .
Wigginsâ€ ™ s representatives did not respond to questions from Newsnight , Asked to describe the effects of using triamcinolone â€ “ which is widely used to treat inflammation of various kinds â€ “ both Rasmussen and another self - confessed drug - taker , the Briton David Millar , agreed that it was a potent performance - enhancing substance .
Describing the effect of using Kenacort â€ “ one of the names under which triamcinolone is sold â€ “ and calling for it to be banned , Millar said , â€œit was the only [ drug ] you took and three days later you looked different .
Itâ€ ™ s quite scary because itâ€ ™ s catabolic
so itâ€ ™ s eating into you .
It felt destructive .
It felt powerful.â€ �"
2017-03-09,"1996 was the year the Spice Girls broke , the â€œUnabomberâ€ � was arrested , 35 people were massacred at Port Arthur in Tasmania , Lance Armstrong got cancer and John Howard defeated Paul Keating to become Australiaâ€ ™ s 25th Prime Minister .
It was also the year a little girl named JonBenÃ
© t Ramsey was found dead in her family home on Boxing Day , in the picturesque American town of Boulder , Colorado .
Reported kidnapped then discovered brutally killed , the case was one of the first to be swallowed whole by the burgeoning 24-hour news cycle , accelerating daily due to cable TV , newly - minted home internet access , and a tabloid media baying for fresh blood after the sensational OJ Simpson case .
With a six - year - old pageant queen at its core , and a family more willing to talk to media than police , it was the case that changed everything :
David Lynchâ€ ™ s Twin Peaks manifested in real life .
Australian filmmaker Kitty Green was 12 .
She spent hours watching the bizarre true crime case unfurl into public obsession .
â€œIt was our summer holidays , but [ in America ] it was Christmas , â€ �
she tells me at Berlinale , where her innovative â€œdocumentary hybridâ€ � Casting JonBenÃ © t recently screened .
â€œSo we had the whole month of January [ free ] .
And we would just watch TV in the morning and see it all play out.â€ �
The story left its mark , and stuck .
But why ?
â€œItâ€
™ s been 20 years since it happened and yet itâ€ ™ s still on the front cover of the tabloid magazines , â€ � Green says .
â€œI was fascinated by the cultural obsession , and why we canâ€ ™ t let that story go .
I really think itâ€ ™ s a family story , something we can all relate to.â€ � Greenâ€ ™ s formative films had garnered praise at high profile festivals , including feature documentary Ukraine
Is Not A Brothel ( 2013 ) and
The Face of Ukraine : Casting Oksana Baiul â€ “ the short film which became a blueprint for Casting JonBenÃ
© tâ€
™ s powerful â€œcasting call confessionalâ€ � format .
As the 20th anniversary of the case loomed , Green decided to try to make a film about it .
With the help of two indie film heavy - hitters â€ “ producers Scott Macaulay ( Gummo ) and James Schamus ( Brokeback Mountain )
â€
“
it became a reality .
Casting JonBenÃ
© t is no midday movie .
Nor is it a click - bait , quasi - forensic ratings - grabber tainted by the compromise of primetime TV .
Instead , it is a deeply inventive , deeply complex look at a tragedy that struck a community .
Green and crew recorded 300 hours of footage in Boulder over a 15-month period , editing on the fly .
Seventy - five amateur / semi - professional actors from the local community â€ “ all touched by the case in some way â€ “ made audition tapes for a supposed docudrama , some scenes of which were shot and interwoven into the final film .
Eager to please â€ “ and to play the various roles â€ “ they all share what they thought happened .
The team elicits both riveting performances and interviews : funny , sad , emotional and , at times , shocking .
Embracing the artifice of theatre , the intimacy of camera - confessional and the stylisation of drama , the film cannily and courageously uses meta - narrative to subvert both audience expectations and documentary form .
A multiplicity of voices and viewpoints are heard .
At heart itâ€ ™ s a provocative and empathetic meditation on cinema , human tragedy , collective memory and how we each relate to grief , pain and loss .
In effect , the film looks back at us .
Archival footage of the Ramsey family is distinctly absent .
â€œThe familyâ€ ™
s suffering is inconceivable ,
â€ �
Green explains .
â€œYouâ€ ™ ll find 20 bad JonBenÃ
© t Ramsey movies [ that have been ] made over the years .
â€œThe aim was not to exploit JonBenÃ
© t Ramsey any further , but to close the book on her .
We decided to stay away from the real family and just concentrate on the community around it [ the case].â€ � Since world premiering at Sundance , Casting JonBenÃ © t has been followed by five - star reviews â€ “ plus some reservations around how â€œin on the final filmâ€ � the actors were .
â€œIt was a collaborative project , â€ �
Green says definitively .
â€œFrom the beginning
I told them a lot about exactly what I envisioned the film to be , and was very up front â€ “ that it was going to be a very constructed film , from their casting tapes and the re - enactments . â€œIn some ways it felt like a community theatre pieceâ€ ¦ an ensemble piece .
Weâ€ ™ re all in it together , which was really beautiful .
Like we were all involved in â€˜the experimentâ€ ™ , which is what we labeled it .
â€œSo it was this kind of evolving project
and we were all just trying things out and taking risks , which was really incredible .
I think everyone felt like they were part of â€˜somethingâ€ ™
.â€ �
Sometimes it takes a great work of art to remind us of the humanity inside a tragic , unfathomable event .

â€œA lot of people have come up to me and said that for the first time they can empathise with the family , â€ � says Green .
â€œNot because they thought they were â€˜guiltyâ€ ™ or â€˜innocentâ€ ™ , but just because [ the film ] humanised the tragedy in some way.â€ � â€œRather than it just being a whodunnit , it became about a loss of life , which was really important to me.â€ � â€¢ Casting JonBenÃ

2017-05-27,"My friend Adam sent me to Austin , Texas , with a task : â€œCan you get Lance Armstrong to sign my US Postal Service jersey?â€ �
Itâ€ ™ s like asking someone going to Newcastle if they can persuade Gazza to autograph an old Magpies shirt .
Austin is a big place .
Almost a million people live there .
Itâ€ ™ s true the seven - time Tour de France winner ( since disqualified ) is one of them , but would I be able to track him down ?
Armstrongâ€ ™ s bike shop seemed a good place to start .
Iâ€ ™
d heard he spends a lot of time hanging around Mellow Johnnyâ€ ™ s ( imagine â€œmaillot jauneâ€ � said in a Texan drawl ) , a paradise for those cyclists who donâ€ ™ t mind their dollars going towards Armstrongâ€ ™ s legal fund .
We decided to join one of the shopâ€ ™ s weekly club rides , plumping for the misleadingly titled Middle of the Road ride , only to find ourselves chasing down a 50-strong peloton as it left Austinâ€ ™ s suburbs .
I was glad Iâ€ ™ d borrowed a carbon - framed Trek Emonda S5 , which comes equipped with a decent Shimano 105 groupset and 50/34 T compact crank , more than adequate for the moderate Texan hills .
My rental was the 2015 womenâ€ ™ s edition , in a 50 cm frame , but the set - up looks pretty much the same on the 2017 models .
Trek severed its marketing deal with Armstrong after the whole blood - transfusions - and - EPO thing .
Iâ€ ™ ve always had a soft spot for the brand .
My first proper adult road bike was a Â£500 aluminium Trek .
I rode it all the way from London to Landâ€ ™ s
End , and then some tosspot stole it from Hackney Road when I got back .
The Emonda was much lighter and very responsive .
The brakes were good ; important when youâ€ ™ re in a bunch of riders you donâ€ ™ t know .
One of the joys of riding in such a huge group is that , if you stay in the middle , you donâ€ ™ t have to heed the stop signs that plague American cities .
â€œRollinâ€ ™ , rollinâ€ ™ , rollinâ€ ™

the ride leader yelled as our spandex swarm buzzed through each junction out to the Veloway , a 5 km closed - road loop in the cityâ€ ™ s south - west fringes .
It wasnâ€ ™ t even 20 miles there , but I was cooked on arrival , sitting out one of three loops to catch my breath .
For this I can not blame the bike but the heroic quantities of tortilla and carnitas
Iâ€ ™ d been inhaling that week .
We arrived back at Mellow Johnnyâ€ ™ s to pick up Adamâ€ ™ s

2017-06-20,"Brian Cookson launched an impassioned defence of his record as the president of the UCI , cyclingâ€ ™ s world governing body , after criticism from Lance Armstrong , who called for an end to the Britonâ€ ™ s time in charge .
Cookson will face a tougher than anticipated battle to be re - elected after David Lappartient , the vice - president , announced he is standing in opposition .
The 65-year - old did not expect to face a challenge , particularly from Lappartient , but Armstrong has given the Frenchman his backing .
The disgraced American , who was stripped of his seven Tour de France titles after doping , responded to the surprise announcement by tweeting : â€œABC (
Anybody But Cookson).â€ �
Reacting to Lappartientâ€ ™ s move , Cookson , who is bidding for a second term as the president in Septemberâ€ ™ s election , suggested he had the stomach for a fight .
He said : â€œI strongly believe my record of restoring integrity and credibility to the UCI , and developing cycling over the past four years , together with my plans for a final four - year term as president , will be judged favourably by the cycling family at the UCI congress in Bergen in September .
â€œI note that so far David Lappartient has not set out very much detail in his plan or any vision he may have beyond his well - known personal ambition for the role .
I look forward to debating what matters for the future of cycling over the coming months.â€
� Cookson was elected for a first term as the president in September 2013 after 16 years as the head of British Cycling .
A report into the culture of British Cycling found deep - seated problems had existed during his tenure , leading some to cast doubt on his suitability to lead the UCI .
Damian Collins MP , the chair of the culture , media and sport select committee , called for Cookson to be â€œdethronedâ€ � .
UK Sport , the funding body , contributed Â£77,000 to Cooksonâ€ ™ s election bid in 2013 but will not provide any monetary contribution to his re - election campaign , although they have pledged to lend expertise .
Lappartient said : â€œI have always voiced my concerns on the various challenges I have witnessed at UCI , and as a vice - president of the organisation , I have been made aware of a number of issues that must be urgently addressed if cycling is to remain a credible sport.â€ �
The 44-year - old added : â€œIt is crucial we have at UCI a president with a real leadership , who is truly engaged and with a clear vision for cycling.â€ �"
2017-06-22,"Hein Verbruggen , who has died aged 75 from leukaemia , was a former head of the Union Cycliste Internationale ( UCI ) , cyclingâ€ ™ s world governing body , and a divisive figure accused of kickbacks and complicity in doping .
A member of the International Olympic Committee ( IOC )
, the Dutchman was a modernising force who dragged the sport into the 21st century , but he ended up at the heart of the two greatest doping scandals the sport has known : the Festina blood doping bust of 1998 and Lance Armstrongâ€ ™ s fall from grace in 2012 .
Born in Helmond in the Netherlands , Verbruggen studied economics and marketing at Nyenrode Business University , and became involved with cycling in 1970 as a marketing manager for Mars , when he persuaded the confectionery company to sponsor Belgiumâ€ ™ s top team , Flandria , for two years .
By 1984 he was president of the body that oversaw professional cycling , the FÃ
© dÃ
© ration Internationale du Cycliste Professionel , and in 1991 he became head of the UCI , which governs both professional and amateur cycling , and which expanded immensely under his tenure .
Through the 1980s , professional cycling had ceased to be a parochial European sport , and Verbruggen drove the process of internationalisation further through the 1990s .
His first brainchild , the World Cup , united major one - day events â€ “ usually known as Classics â€ “ in a season - long series , but foundered because artificially created one - day races in â€œnewâ€ � cycling countries such as Britain and Canada could not match traditional Classics in terms of kudos , as far as riders and the media were concerned .
Verbruggenâ€ ™ s greatest achievement came after the fall of the Berlin Wall , when competing for cash became acceptable in the former Soviet bloc .
That enabled him to unite cyclingâ€ ™ s professional arm with the amateur ranks , which had been dominated by the eastern European nations .
It became possible for professionals such as the five - times Tour de France winner Miguel Indurain to ride in the Olympic Games , beginning in 1996 .
Verbruggenâ€ ™ s career in the IOC began there .
It culminated in his appointment to head both the evaluation and coordination commissions for the Beijing Olympics in 2008 .
The elimination of the difference between amateur and professional opened the door for the sportâ€ ™ s further growth worldwide .
At the same time , the world road race championships expanded so that juniors and under-23s shared the same event with leading male and female racers .
In his final year at the UCI he launched the ProTour , restructuring professional cycling from top to bottom ; it has proved controversial but did provide a structure for the sportâ€ ™ s growth .
However , the 1990s also saw the rise of blood doping through the use of the blood booster erythropoietin ( EPO ) .
Verbruggen reacted to early revelations about its use with the introduction of blood testing and the imposition of a 50 % limit on the haematocrit , the percentage of red cells in the blood ( the higher the reading , the more likely it is that EPO has been used ) .
In 1997 he praised the test , which he hoped would be the first step in a new way of combating doping , as a measure that would restrict the damaging effects of doping on health â€ “ a high haematocrit can lead to strokes and thrombosis â€ “ alongside the traditional punitive measures when the limit was exceeded .
The effect was the opposite , however .
Many professionals viewed the introduction of the 50 % limit as condoning the use of EPO , as a guideline to aim for in their doping .
It was a blunt instrument .
There was a small minority of riders whose blood naturally hit the limit and who were stigmatised as dopers ; others who had far lower levels could improve their performance by aiming for the 50 % while remaining â€œlegalâ€ � , as they saw it .
However , it did establish the principle that blood could be taken from cyclists and tested , which has led , in the long term , to actions such as the inroduction of the athlete biological passport .
When the widespread abuse of EPO became evident during the Festina scandal of 1998 , and the Tour de France came close to a halt , Verbruggen disappeared , leaving the race organisers and his vice - president , Daniel Baal , to face the media .
When the Festina case came to trial in 2001 , he appeared in court in Lille as a witness and denied that the haematocrit test had encouraged use of the drug .
However , in 2000 , he took the risk of ensuring that a urine test for EPO was brought in .
His association with Lance Armstrong raised eyebrows , beginning when the UCI cleared Armstrong of doping after a positive test for cortisone during the 1999 race that brought the first of his seven Tour wins .
As accusations against Armstrong grew , Verbruggen consistently defended the American .
Under his tenure , the UCI accepted â‚¬125,000 in donations from Armstrong , using them for anti - doping purposes .
The cycling independent reform commission , set up by the UCI in the wake of Armstrongâ€ ™ s downfall in 2012 , did not spare Verbruggen when it reported in 2015 .
The report concluded that while the relationship between Armstrong and the governing body under Verbruggen was not corrupt , the multiple Tour winner had benefited from preferential treatment , most notably when his legal team assisted the UCI in compiling a key report into positive tests for EPO at the time samples from the 1999 Tour were re - tested in 2005 .
Verbruggen described the report as â€œa caricatureâ€ � , but by then he was used to jumping to his own defence .
He had long been notorious for berating journalists who he felt focused too heavily on the sportâ€ ™ s doping problems , and he was not afraid to resort to litigation .
He won defamation lawsuits against the Festina whistleblower
Willy Voet , the US professional Floyd Landis , whose revelations had brought about Armstrongâ€ ™ s demise , and â€ “ together with his successor as UCI chief
, Pat McQuaid â€ “ the Irish writer Paul Kimmage .
He also had a lengthy feud with Dick Pound when the Canadian was head of the World Anti - Doping Agency , which ended with a case settled out of court .
He is survived by two sons from a marriage that ended in divorce .

2017-06-24,"When a three - times Tour de France winner is on the start line in anything resembling a decent state of fitness , forecasts boil down to a simple statement : one man versus the rest .
Thus it was with Eddy Merckx , Bernard Hinault , Miguel Indurain and Lance Armstrong â€ “ now disgraced , once perennially dominant â€ “
and so it is with Chris Froome , who starts the Tour as the overwhelming favourite , even though he has not yet shown the incisive form of his better years .
There is always speculation that the sheer weight of opposing numbers will one day overcome the counterweight of incumbency but it tends to be wishful thinking .
Each of those contenders has his own priorities and the immense importance of the Tour induces a risk - benefit analysis : the favourites weigh up what they have to lose with what they might have to gain and
all too frequently it is the former that consumes them .
Froomeâ€ ™ s verdict is that â€œthere is a whole handful of guys on the start line with a realistic chance of winningâ€ � .
None punches with the weight of the Team Sky man but there are always reasons to hope that one July will produce a spectacular along the lines of the recent Giro dâ€ ™ Italia , won by Tom Dumoulin in a thrilling finale .
This might be that year : a three - times winner who might not be quite what he was , a finely balanced route that offers something for everyone , and that group of contenders , who may prove a â€œhandfulâ€ � but not in the sense that the defending champion meant .
Richie Porte
The man to beat in Froomeâ€ ™ s eyes .
The 32-year - old Australian has a fine season behind him already , with six wins under his belt including the Tour Down Under and the Tour de Romandie .
He has made the transition from Froomeâ€ ™ s top domestique at Sky to leader at BMC and this year will prove once and for all whether he can go a step further in the Tour .
Porte can time trial , he can climb and his team looks solid , albeit lacking the number of pure mountain specialists that Froome can call on .
Porteâ€ ™ s achilles heel is that he tends to be the victim of events , as in the 2015 Giro , the 2016 Tour or , most recently , the final day in the CritÃ © rium du DauphinÃ
© .
That tendency leads to a simple question : can he emulate his old leader Froome and learn to dictate events on the road at the highest level ?
Nairo Quintana A regular on the Tour podium , with second in 2013 and 2015 and third in 2016 , plus a Giro dâ€ ™ Italia win in 2014 and the Vuelta last year .
The Colombian has enjoyed a strong year , winning Tirreno - Adriatico and taking second to Dumoulin in the Giro .
That record means he will be a factor but Quintana is an enigma .
In a massively mountainous final week of the Giro he was curiously muted , while at the 2015 Tour he had the form to oust Froome in the final week but did not seize his chance .
His Movistar team are strong and skilled and the shortage of time trialling means this Tour will suit him more than any other .
The two toughest days in the Alps should suit him most , too , so he needs to strike there to gain time before the Marseille time trial .
The only question is how much he left on the road in Italy in May.
Alberto Contador
The pistolero is evergreen or long in the tooth depending on how you see it .
Contador has the best all - round record of any Tourman today
â€ “
the Spaniard is one of the six riders to have claimed all three Grand Tours and has won each one at least twice â€ “ but his bid to win the Tour last year stalled badly ; he last visited the podium of a major Tour when he won the Giro in 2015 .
At 34 , if he does have one last Tour win in his legs , it will come from his peerless skill at seeking out and exploiting openings .
That instinct is born of 10 years winning at this level but will it compensate for the advancing years ?
His Trek - Segafredo team is not as strong as Sky or Movistar but that is less of an issue .
If he rides strongly in the first major test , the threeâ€‘col stage to ChambÃ
© ry , all bets are off .
Romain Bardet
In the last two Tours stage wins in the Alps have defined the style of the 26-year - old Frenchman from Brioude : opportunistic and aggressive uphill , skilful when the road goes down .
Equally key , he seems able to cope with the pressure that comes with being a home contender in the Tour .
He finished runner - up to Chris Froome last year when Porte and Quintana faltered , and took the race to the Sky leader on the rain - hit stage to the foot of Mont Blanc .
The question now is whether he can go one better and what that would take .
The scant time trialling in this yearâ€ ™ s
race suits
Bardet and so does the relative lack of set - piece climbing , with only two conventional mountain - top finishes .
His Ag2R team is not at a level with Sky , meaning he needs to arrive in the final week either level - pegging with Froome or in a position to test the favourite .
It is a big ask but it is not impossible .
The best of the rest Thibaut Pinot , Fabio Aru , Esteban Chaves all merit a place on the list of contenders if not headline billing .
Pinot is going into the unknown in racing the Tour after a promising but ultimately frustrating fourth in the Giro .
The Frenchman will fly or die but at least the pressure is off , as he has struggled to carry the weight of home hopeful in the past .
The Italian Aru and Colombian Chaves will find there is a world of difference between tackling the Tour to learn and taking it on to win , but both have strong teams in Astana and Orica - Scott ; Chaves will form an intriguing double act with the promising Briton Simon Yates while Aru has the ageing Jakob Fuglsang of Denmark to act as his foil ."
2017-07-22,"Opinions vary among cycling fans on just how good or bad this yearâ€ ™ s Tour de France has been .
With only two stages left we find ourselves in the welcome situation where the top step of the Paris podium is still up for grabs but many have felt short - changed by a route that has been heavily criticised , not to mention the more unforeseeable early exits of a clutch of the pelotonâ€ ™ s finest through injury or controversial disqualification .
What few who have heard it can contest , however , is that some of the most intelligent , insightful and amusing analysis of this yearâ€ ™ s race has been offered from the back of a converted Winnebago generally parked up somewhere in Colorado .
Thereâ€ ™ s just one small or very big problem : the man delivering these forthright opinions is Lance Armstrong .
Unique among riders in that he has won the Tour de France seven times while never actually winning it at all , Armstrong is the star turn on Stages , a daily podcast he copresents with his friend JB Hager , a former host on the Austin Radio Network .
In each episode , Armstrong reviews one Tour stage and previews the next , while Hager plays the bloke with a passing interest in the peloton , who prods and probes Armstrong for insights and anecdotes informed by nearly 20 years as a professional cyclist .
Described in some quarters as this Tourâ€ ™ s guilty pleasure , one question above all others has been prompted by the success of Stages : is it finally OK to like Armstrong again ?
For many who never had much time for him in the first place , the answer is an unequivocal â€œnoâ€ � .
Itâ€ ™ s old ground but worth re - covering : in recent years , Armstrong was exposed as a liar , a bully and a cheat , was stripped of his titles and revealed to be perhaps one of the biggest frauds in the history of sport .
In an often unforgiving world , his crimes have been deemed more unpardonable than most .
In an interview with the BBC in 2015 , Armstrong described his behaviour over 15 years , particularly his treatment of â€œa dozen or so peopleâ€ � whose characters , reputations and careers he attempted to destroy in a bid to save his own as â€œtotally regrettable and completely inexcusableâ€ � .
Adding that he had apologies accepted by a few of those from whom he sought forgiveness , he conceded he couldnâ€ ™ t keep apologising forever : â€œWe all want to be forgiven .
Thereâ€ ™ s a lot of really , really bad people that want to be forgiven that will never be forgiven
and I might be somewhat in that camp.â€ � Armstrongâ€ ™ s critics
believe he is not sorry for his crimes , only for getting caught .
They cite his not entirely unreasonable view that he was made a scapegoat for a generation of dopers in cycling as further evidence of his lack of remorse .
They may well have a point but in the past Armstrong has conceded that as â€œthe leader of the band for years , the buck stops with meâ€ � .
He has also said â€œas tough as it is , as much headwind as there is sometimes , I just have to forge ahead , do my thing and fit in where I canâ€
� .
That or become a recluse .
Born out of a popular series of podcasts called the Forward , in which Armstrong interviews authors , musicians , movie stars and sportsmen , Stages is his latest attempt to forge ahead , do his thing and fit in wherever he can .
Cynics may have a point when they suggest it is little more than a transparent attempt to find personal redemption and curry public favour , with the $ 100 m lawsuit filed against him by the US government due to begin in November .
Whatever Armstrongâ€ ™ s motivation for his daily dispatches might be , his enthusiasm is abundant and they make for hugely entertaining and informative listening .
In the first one , Armstrong confessed that he had fallen out of love with cycling and lost all interest in the sport which made him , in turn , an all - American hero and then a global pariah .
â€œI spent years doing anything but cycling ; anything but riding a bike ,
â€ � he said .
An injury sustained while running left him in need of â€œan endurance
outletâ€
�
so he pulled on his cleats and threw his leg back over the crossbar .
â€œIt sounds corny but I fell back in love with the bike , â€ �
he said .
It was then he decided to bone up on the current peloton , get his hands on the current Tour book and record Stages .
â€œYou may not always like what you hear on here , â€ � he told his audience .
â€œBut itâ€ ™ s going to be well informed , it will be educated and it will come from experience.â€ �
All three boxes are ticked on a daily basis .
From time to time , it is also very funny .
Whatever your opinion on Armstrong as a disgraced cyclist who makes no attempt to distance himself from his sordid and grubby past he is a rich seam of insights and amusing , often self - deprecating , anecdotes regarding the often shambolic workings of the Tour , from the curious revelation that participating teams are ordered where to stay each night to the excruciating minutiae of what itâ€ ™ s like to ascend a mountain on a narrow road lined with liquored - up cycling fans in fancy dress .
There are those who will say , with some justification , that a shamed athlete who brought so much disgrace on his sport should not be entitled to a platform from which to pontificate about it .
They are entitled to their view but Armstrong is not the only disgraced cyclist to enjoy such a privilege , just the most high profile .
â€œA man with no platform is a lost man , â€ � he said in a recent interview with CNN .
â€œPeople can choose not to listen but Iâ€ ™ m my own boss with this and nobody tells me what to do.â€
�
While much of the feedback on Stages has been positive , plenty of detractors have told him in no uncertain terms what to do with his podcast .
For all his faults , Lance can also choose not to listen ."
2017-08-04,"Few filmmakers have stumbled upon documentary gold in quite as fortuitous a fashion as Bryan Fogel , the man behind this revelatory account of Russiaâ€ ™ s state - sponsored doping program .
Primarily a playwright ( he wrote an off - Broadway comedy called Jewtopia ) , Fogel is also a keen amateur cyclist and , in the wake of the Lance Armstrong scandal , set out to prove just how easy it was to evade cyclingâ€ ™ s creaking testing system by competing chemically enhanced in the same prestigious amateur race that he had struggled in the year before .
The plan was to boost his best time , pass with flying colours through the urine tests required of all competitors and broadcast the results in muckraking documentary form .
To help him perform this grand experiment , Fogel recruited a team of experts , one of whom pointed him in the direction of Grigory Rodchenkov , the eccentric director of Moscowâ€ ™ s Anti - Doping Centre .
And thatâ€ ™ s when things got really interesting .
Rodchenkov threw himself into helping Fogel cheat the system with a level of enthusiasm that probably shouldnâ€ ™ t be expected from the head of an anti - drugs unit , going as far as smuggling Fogelâ€ ™ s urine through airport security .
Even more extraordinarily , Rodchenkov openly admitted on camera that similarly nefarious methods were used to enhance the performances of his home countryâ€ ™ s athletes at the Sochi Winter Olympics , where Russia took home 13 gold medals .
When , a few months later , the World Anti - Doping Association ( Wada ) released a report revealing the full extent of Russian state - sponsored doping and Rodchenkovâ€ ™ s involvement in it , and Fogel received a panicked Skype call from Rodchenkov saying that he feared for his life and was going to flee to the US , Fogelâ€ ™ s gonzo experiment had become a front - row seat to one of the biggest sporting scandals in decades .
The resulting film , Icarus , gamely attempts to lash together this multi - stranded shaggy dog story into something approaching a coherent documentary - cum - conspiracy thriller .
If itâ€ ™ s not entirely successful , you can at least forgive its deficiencies given the access Fogel manages to acquire .
On moving to the US , Rodchenkov morphs into a whisteblower , and his testimony is stunningly detailed , implicating everyone up to and including Vladimir Putin in the doping scandal and suggesting that it is something that has been going on across Russian sports for decades .
Meanwhile , as the documentary progresses , Fogel finds himself becoming a more central figure in the story heâ€
™ s trying to tell .
One remarkable scene sees him , in Rodchenkovâ€ ™ s absence ( due to safety concerns ) , testifying in front of a visibly angry group of Wada employees , suggesting to them that Rodchenkov , who has had to leave his home and family over the scandal , is himself a victim .
Quite whether thatâ€ ™ s the case is questionable .
Certainly its clear that Fogel has been won over by the ebullient Rodchenkov from the pairâ€ ™ s very first meeting over Skype .
You can see why : heâ€ ™ s charismatic , makes for a great subject and is always willing to divulge a bit of devastating inside info to camera .
At the same time though , thereâ€ ™ s an inescapable slipperiness to Rodchenkovâ€
™ s character that makes his testimony slightly hard to swallow .
At points , he exhibits remorse at his actions , lamenting that Russiaâ€ ™ s medal haul at Sochi might have emboldened Putin in his decision to meddle in the Ukraine ; other times he seems mischievously gleeful at his own nefarious deeds .
Fogel doesnâ€ ™ t quite seem to have the critical distance to ascertain what might be the true position .
There are other failings too : at two hours , the film sags a little in the middle and certainly could have done without the clunky conceit in its second half , where Rodchenkovâ€ ™ s testimony is bookended by him reading aloud from Orwellâ€ ™ s 1984 .
But itâ€ ™ s hard to deny the power of Icarusâ€ ™ s message and the remarkable nature of its delivery .
Icarus is now available on Netflix"
