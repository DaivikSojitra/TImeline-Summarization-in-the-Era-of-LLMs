2007-02-16,"The Russian president , Vladimir Putin , last night promoted his close ally Sergei Ivanov to the position of first deputy prime minister in his clearest hint yet that he regards Mr Ivanov as his most likely successor .
Mr Putin elevated Mr Ivanov from the post of defence minister .
The shift puts Mr Ivanov in the same position as Dmitry Medvedev , also seen as a leading contender for the Kremlin 's endorsement in next year 's presidential elections .
In a televised announcement last night Mr Putin praised Mr Ivanov lavishly , saying he "" has fulfilled the tasks he faced as defence minister and fulfilled them successfully "" .
Kremlin analysts said Mr Ivanov was likely to be made prime minister in six months ' time , putting him one step away from the presidency .
Last night 's reshuffle comes amid a sharp deterioration in relations between Russia and the west and follows Mr Putin 's broadside last weekend in Munich against the US , which he accused of seeking to be the sole power centre in a "" world of one master , one sovereign "" .
Mr Ivanov , a former KGB foreign operative who speaks fluent English , supported his boss with a similarly hawkish speech .
His promotion is a sign to the west that Russia does not intend to buckle in future to foreign pressure .
Mr Putin said Anatoly Serdyukov , a little - known tax collection official with no military experience , would take over as defence minister and mastermind an eight - year arms modernisation programme ."
2007-07-05,"Gazprom has promised to spend $ 420bn ( £ 210bn ) by 2030 on building up its gas supply capability and has specifically targeted BP as one of the companies with whom it could arrange "" asset swaps "" .
The ambitious plans were revealed by the chairman , Dmitry Medvedev , before an announcement expected tomorrow that it has bought Natural Gas Shipping Services ( NGSS ) , a supply business in Britain .
His comments could ignite further speculation that the Russian state - controlled energy producer could try to take a half share in TNK - BP or buy British Gas 's parent group , Centrica .
But officials insisted Mr Medvedev was eager to reassure a domestic audience that Gazprom would spend enough to meet its commitments to the local market .
The Gazprom chief argues the business is turning over large quantities of cash and is committed to a heavy level of spending .
"" It is an average of $ 18bn a year .
We have the money and it will be invested , "" he told the Russian business daily Vedomosti in an interview .
Mr Medvedev rebutted criticism that Gazprom was investing too little in production and concentrating too much on taking control of the Sakhalin-2 liquefied natural gas scheme from Shell and buying control of the Kovykta field development in eastern Siberia from BP .
Joint ventures and asset swap deals with foreign partners would help ensure that Gazprom , the world 's largest gas company , can supply the market in full , he argued .
"" Fears that there will be a deficit of gas on the Russian market are groundless .
There is only one gas shortage — for those who want to buy it on the cheap . ""
Gazprom has said it was considering possible swap deals with a number of foreign companies , including BP and Germany 's Eon and BASF , but officials privately played down suggestions that it was in the market for further sizeable acquisitions .
"" There are no such plans at the moment , "" said one source .
There was no comment about its decision , which should be announced tomorrow , that its UK subsidiary , Gazprom Marketing and Trading , has bought NGSS , the supply arm of Cheshire - based Pennine Natural Gas company .
Gazprom purchased the main retail part of Pennine last year , a move that helped the Russian group increase its British revenues by 150 % in the 12 months to December 31 .
Gazprom now has 2,000 UK business customers — including BHS , Caffe Uno and Sunderland Football
Club — and serves 4,000 different locations .
The Russian energy company , which supplies a quarter of Europe 's gas needs , produced 556bn cubic metres of natural gas last year and plans to raise output to 940bcm by 2020 .
It charges its western European customers an average of $ 260 per 1,000 cubic metres of gas and has had a series of disputes with neighbouring states such as Ukraine and Belarus after increasing its prices .
Domestic price caps are gradually being raised and will more than double to $ 125 per 1,000 cubic metres for industrial customers by 2011 .
The Russian parliament on Wednesday passed a controversial law that allows Gazprom to establish its own private armed units to guard its extensive network of facilities from terrorist attack .
One member of the Duma said the move had opened a "" Pandora 's Box "" that could lead to the creation of a private army but supporters say it is right that Gazprom and the oil pipeline monopoly , Transneft , should not have to contract outside security firms .
There is unease that Gazprom , with its 430,000 staff , is a state within a state , given its firm grip on Russian gas exports , its ownership of various media assets and its control of Russia 's third largest bank ."

2007-12-10,"Black Sabbath may not have too many fans with a penchant for sky - blue suits and pink Polo shirts , but the next president of Russia is a devoted follower .
"" I 've loved hard rock since my schooldays , "" Dmitry Medvedev told an interviewer in April , showing off a pair of two metre - high speakers shaped like rockets in his pastel - shaded living room . ""
Today , for example , I can boast that I have the entire collection of Deep Purple . ""
At 42 , the man who is from Monday almost certain to be the next leader of the world 's biggest country is the young , liberal face of the Kremlin and a protege of the president , Vladimir Putin .
Less hawkish than Sergei Ivanov , the former defence minister previously thought of as the frontrunner to take the Kremlin in 2008 , he has cleverly positioned himself as a modernising patriot who refrains from the rhetorical tub - thumping of his rivals from the security structures , the siloviki .
He rejects the term "" sovereign democracy "" , put forward by the Kremlin 's chief ideologist , Vladislav Surkov , but says Russia has a fully functioning civil society ( it does n't ) and must not abandon its traditions .
Medvedev is one of a group of lawyers from Putin 's St Petersburg circle who have uneasy relations with the president 's former KGB colleagues .
As first deputy prime minister responsible for "" national projects "" to revive healthcare , education , housing and agriculture since 2005 , Medvedev has been given acres of television coverage .
His dual role as chairman of the vast Gazprom monopoly puts him at the vanguard of Russia 's revival on the back of high energy prices .
One of his most famous photographs shows the politician frying an omelette for a babushka in a newly gasified village .
Medvedev 's frequent meetings with young families , his casual clothes and his homey interviews ( he practises yoga and likes swimming ) have been carefully crafted to identify him with Russia 's emerging middle class : a new generation that can afford to redecorate their apartment , get broadband internet , buy a decent stereo and go on holiday to Turkey .
Born on September 14 1965 into a family of professors , Medvedev was known as a conscientious student who voluntarily joined Soviet work gangs collecting potatoes on weekends .
He married his school sweetheart , Svetlana , and their son Ilya was born in 1996 .
Moving swiftly through the ranks , he headed Putin 's successful campaign for the presidency in 2000 and later became his deputy chief of staff .
Medvedev 's critics say he is a devoted Putinite with little charisma and no independent powerbase .
As chairman of Gazprom , the huge and opaque state energy giant , he is inextricably linked with the push to squeeze out private businesses and consolidate state control over natural resources , and with the use of raised gas prices to bully unfriendly former Soviet neighbours such as Georgia and Ukraine .
If , as expected , Medvedev takes the presidency with Putin 's blessing next March , analysts say the face of power in Russia will shift to accommodate Putin as some kind of "" national leader "" , or possibly as prime minister in charge of the pro - Kremlin United Russia faction in parliament .
In this scenario , the siloviki would remain loyal to Putin , and be largely under his control .
What seems certain is that Putin and Medvedev are extremely close allies who will have already thrashed out their division of power down to the last detail ."
2007-12-10,"President Vladimir Putin today ended months of speculation over who will succeed him next year by naming Dmitry Medvedev as his favoured candidate to win Russia 's presidential elections .
Putin endorsed Medvedev this afternoon at a meeting with party leaders .
The move virtually guarantees that Medvevev , a first deputy prime minister , will win a landslide victory in the election to be held on March 2 .
"" I have known him very closely for more than 17 years and I completely and fully support this proposal , "" Putin was shown as saying on state - run television at a meeting today with leaders of four parties who said they were backing Medvedev .
Medvedev - who is 42 and a former lawyer from St Petersburg - is regarded as being more liberal and less hawkish towards the west than Sergei Ivanov , Russia 's other first deputy prime minister who was also a frontrunner for the job .
Unlike Putin , Medvedev has no links with Russia 's powerful security services and did not serve in the KGB .
He does , however , have a longstanding friendship with Putin and is one of the president 's closest allies .
Today , analysts said that the appointment of Medvedev - a comparatively weak figure - meant that Putin had not ruled out the possibility of returning to power at some future point .
Sergei Markov , a leading Kremlin analyst , said he expected three people to run the country after next year 's election : Medvedev , the new president ; Putin , who would control Russia 's law enforcement agencies in a new role ; and the prime minister . ""
Medvedev 's ideology is liberal patriotism , "" Markov told the Guardian . ""
He is more liberal than Sergei Ivanov .
He has no experience of working with law enforcement agencies .
They will tend to see Vladimir Putin as their main political chief . ""
He added : "" Medvedev wants Russia to have the same institutions as other European countries .
But he also wants Russia to be independent and to be developed . ""
Under Medvedev 's chairmanship Gazprom , Russia 's state - run natural energy giant , has taken a tough line with neighbouring countries on gas price rises and has negotiated hard with multinational oil companies .
Putin said the wide base of support for Medvedev 's candidacy "" means we have a chance to form a robust administration for the Russian Federation after the March elections ... an administration that will carry out the same policies that have brought us results for the past eight years .
"" Putin 's United Russia party holds a congress next Monday , at which it is expected to formally nominate Medvedev as its candidate in the presidential vote .
Opinion polls have consistently shown that given Putin 's high level of popularity , Russian voters are prepared to back whichever candidate he endorses to replace him .
Russian stocks powered into record territory on news that Putin had thrown his weight behind Medvedev .
One analyst today suggested that Russia was facing an economic crisis next year - for which Medvedev would take the blame .
"" Putin 's plan may well be to return after a year or two once Medvedev has messed up .
But I do n't think he will succeed in this , "" Mikhail Delyagin , a leading economist and director of Moscow 's Institute on Globalisation Problems . told the Guardian .
Asked whether Medvedev was a gifted administrator , Delyagin replied : "" He 's not a high intellect .
But of all the people in Putin 's team he is the most human . ""
The speculation about Putin 's future has included the possibility that he could try to return as president if he stepped down early .
That possibility seemed potentially strengthened by the announcement about Medvedev , said Vladimir Ryzhkov , a prominent liberal politician .
"" The strategy is as follows : Medvedev is a compromise choice because he will allow Putin to keep a free hand .
If Putin wants to gradually leave power , Medvedev guarantees him comfort and security and will continue to listen him , "" he said on Ekho Moskvy radio .
"" If Putin wants to return in two , three years ... Medvedev will be the person who will without a doubt give up the path for him .
"" Medvedev 's candidacy was immediately backed today by the leaders of United Russia - the main pro - presidential party - and Fair Russia , another pro - Kremlin grouping .
Two smaller parties , the Agrarians and Civil Force , were also at the meeting with Putin and supported Medvedev .
Putin has said he will step down next year , in line with a constitutional ban on heads of state serving more than two consecutive terms in office . ""
The choice in favour of Medvedev shows that the president opted to send a signal to the outside world that Russia is not planning to conduct tough confrontational policies , "" said Yevgeny Badovsky of the Institute of Social Systems , a think tank .
"" Medvedev is in a way a more liberal choice , who is not associated with the part of the elite rooted in the security services . """

Fair Russia , a pro - Kremlin grouping , and two smaller parties - the Agrarians and Civil Force , both of which met Putin today , also backed Medvedev ."
2007-12-11,"The world can sigh with relief - Vladimir Putin has delivered a male heir to Russia .
The man in question , Dmitry Medvedev , appears to be strong and healthy with every chance of becoming president in March 2008 .
According to the Levada - Centre polls , 41 % of Russian citizens would vote for whoever is proposed by Putin , and only 12 % would not vote for an "" heir "" in any circumstances .
By the same token as Boris Yeltsin eight years ago , Putin apparently made a decision last minute , hesitating between options until the continuous uncertainty started to unleash fears among Russia 's political class that some "" wildcat "" scenario was in the making .
Like Yeltsin , Putin made his choice known in December after the parliamentary elections when political life goes into hibernation .
The presidential successor was rather theatrically endorsed by four parties and publicly supported by Putin .
As two of the participating parties - Civic Force and the Agrarians - are not represented in the parliament , the Kremlin rather clumsily used this majority / minority mix to present Medvedev as a candidate from the mainstream society .
Dmitry Medvedev won the presidential nomination over Sergei Ivanov , an ex - defence minister and first deputy premier with responsibilities for the security sector .
His candidature was giving rise to fears that he would take Russia in the direction of the Soviet model , distracting resources to matters of state prestige in the defence sphere , and prioritising them over the wellbeing of citizens .
The security sector would again loom large in the political system .
There was speculation that Ivanov 's presidency might signal property redistribution , attempts to consolidate assets in the state 's hands and bring out rule of a close group of cronies .
Medvedev , by contrast , does not inspire much apprehension : most constituencies in Russia would be able to live with him , even if he is not everybody 's preferred choice .
Moreover , Medvedev was responsible for projects in the public sector such as health , education and accessible housing which are much closer to people 's real concerns .
In this sense , Medvedev 's nomination is consistent with the overall message of Putin 's presidency - that the main task for Russia 's leader is to make the life of citizens better and create conditions for ordinary people to be happy .
Putin and Medvedev have a lot in common with each other .
Like his patron , Medvedev is also a lawyer .
He wholly owes his political career to the president to whom he was directly subordinated for most of the 17 years they spent together .
The new successor first worked under Putin in the mayor 's office in St Petersburg , where both men are from .
His boss then took him to Moscow to the White House when he became a member of the government .
After taking the reins of supreme power in the country , Putin vested Medvedev with the most trusted appointments , such as head of the presidential administration or chair of Gazprom 's board .
By virtue of holding the most trusted positions , Medvedev was close to the heart of decision - making and the real process of bargaining between elite groupings .
However , there are differences too .
Medvedev has an image of a well - mannered teacher 's pet from an upper middle - class family and is a bit formal in his public appearances .
His views on "" sovereign democracy "" are noteworthy : he is not in favour of the idea .
"" It would be more appropriate to talk about real democracy or just democracy in conditions of secured state sovereignty .
If definitions are added to ' democracy ' , this leaves a strange taste .
This implies that we speak about some other , unconventional democracy .
Perhaps I have a more formal view on this than my colleagues . ""
Thus , Medvedev may have more inclination to engage with democratic processes and have a modern outlook upon rules of political competition , which Russia 's growing middle class would endorse .
Still , the task at hand would be to demonstrate his toughness .
Medvedev has never dealt with , or had to take responsibility for , a real crisis .
He would have to learn how to appeal to the security ministries and ensure his supremacy .
In this , Putin 's support and mentoring would be indispensable .
The current president would remain influential through early Medvedev 's presidency while the newcomer gets used to the reins of power and creates a consensus among the political and financial elites .
This does not imply that Medvedev would be a handicapped candidate and a placeholder for Putin 's comeback .
There is every reason to believe that a young , energetic and liberal - inclined president - in - the - making would be his own man .
The west may be quite content : whatever the process , the outcome seems so far quite satisfactory ."
2007-12-11,"President Vladimir Putin ended months of speculation yesterday by naming Dmitry Medvedev , a 42-year - old economic liberal , as his preferred candidate to win Russia 's presidential election next year .
The move all but guarantees that Medvedev , a first deputy prime minister , will win overwhelmingly in the poll on March 2 .
"" I have known him very closely for more than 17 years and I completely and fully support this proposal , "" Putin said , during a meeting with leaders from four parties who announced they were all backing Medvedev 's candidacy .
Medvedev , a former St Petersburg lawyer and Black Sabbath enthusiast , is regarded as more liberal and less hawkish towards the west than Sergei Ivanov , Russia 's other first deputy prime minister , who was also a frontrunner for the job .
Putin is expected to retain influence over Russia 's security services , including the military and the Federal Security Bureau or FSB , the successor agency to the KGB , which he headed before becoming president in 2000 .
Unlike Putin , Medvedev has no links with the security services .
The president , who has to step down in May , has made it clear he intends to "" influence "" his successor , and has not ruled out returning to the Kremlin at some point .
"" It 's quite obvious that Medvedev wo n't be the almighty president that Putin used to be , "" said Fyodor Lykyanov , editor in chief of the journal Russia in Foreign Affairs Sergei Markov , a leading Kremlin analyst , said he expected three people to run the country after May : Medvedev , Putin and Viktor Zubkov , the prime minister .
"" Medvedev 's ideology is liberal patriotism , "" Markov told the Guardian . ""
He is more liberal than Ivanov .
He has no experience of working with law enforcement agencies , who will tend to see Putin as their main political chief . ""
Western diplomats were hopeful yesterday that a Medvedev presidency could lead to a rapprochement between Russia and the west , after a year which has seen disagreements over Kosovo , missile defence and the murder of Alexander Litvinenko in London .
Medvedev has no experience of foreign affairs .
A rare speaker of English , his only appearance on the international stage was earlier this year at the annual economic forum in the Swiss ski resort of Davos .
He is largely known abroad through his chairmanship of the state gas giant Gazprom .
Here , he has taken an uncompromising line in negotiations with Russia 's neighbours over gas prices .
Yesterday Putin said Medvedev 's candidacy represented "" an administration that will carry on the same policies that have brought us results for the past eight years "" .
His United Russia party is expected to nominate Medvedev at a party congress on Monday .
After that there are no serious obstacles between him and the presidency .
Nevertheless yesterday 's announcement was a surprise .
Recent speculation had suggested that Putin would endorse either Ivanov or Zubkov . ""
The majority of Russia 's political analysts thought it was going to be Zubkov , "" Lilia Shevtsova , a senior associate at Moscow 's Carnegie centre said .
"" Over the last month Medvedev was nowhere to be seen .
He was sitting in his lonely government office . ""
Asked why Putin had picked him , she said : "" He has proved many times that he is loyal .
But he is n't a silovik ( a member of Russia 's security agencies ) .
"" Several other candidates have said they will contest the presidential election .
They include the veteran communist leader Gennady Zyuganov and Garry Kasparov , the former world chess champion and leader of the opposition coalition , the Other Russia ."
2007-12-11,"Vladimir Putin 's bid to retain power after his term as president expires was bolstered today when his preferred successor , Dmitry Medvedev , said he wanted Putin to become prime minister .
Yesterday , Putin backed Medvedev as his preferred candidate in presidential elections in March .
Today , Medvedev , an economic liberal , returned the favour by suggesting that Putin would become prime minister after the election .
The arrangement would give Putin the platform to return as president at a later date .
Putin is prohibited by law from running for a third consecutive term , but wants to retain a powerful role .
Putin 's endorsement of Medvedev all but guarantees that he will win the presidential election and he is then expected to amend the constitution to increase the prime minister 's powers .
Such a move would be rubberstamped by the new parliament which is dominated by pro - Putin politicians elected earlier this month .
After the March poll , Putin is expected to retain influence over Russia 's security services , including the military and the Federal Security Bureau ( FSB ) , the successor to the KGB , which he headed before becoming president in 2000 .
In a television address , Medvedev said : "" Having expressed my readiness to run for president of Russia , I appeal to [ Putin ] with a request to give his principal agreement to head the Russian government after the election of the new president of our country . ""
Medvedev also said that , after the election , the country must continue to pursue the policies driven by Putin over the past eight years .
"" It is not enough to choose a new president , who can divide up all those responsibilities .
It 's no less important to preserve the capable team formed by the current president , "" he said .
His remarks suggest that he could become a president in name only , with Putin retaining the real power .
Medvedev has a reputation as being more emollient than the spiky Putin .
But he continued Putin 's style of rhetoric in a message to the west in his television address .
"" The world 's attitudes toward Russia has been changed .
They do n't lecture us like schoolchildren .
They respect us and they reckon with us .
Russia has been returned to its overwhelming position in the world community , "" he said .
Medvedev also praised efforts under Putin to restore the country 's armed forces .
"" Our military defence and security have been increased , "" he said .
Medvedev is not considered a Kremlin hardliner , in contrast to the others who had vied for Putin 's endorsement - chiefly his fellow first deputy prime minister , Sergei Ivanov .
Earlier today , Medvedev said he intended to improve Russia 's welfare services .
"" We need to convert the successes that have been achieved in recent years into social and economic programmes , "" he was quoted by Reuters as saying ."

2007-12-11,"We now know almost everything we need to about how Vladimir Putin intends to end his second term as president .
His anointed successo Dmitry Medvedev will take over as president and Putin will return to his old job as prime minister .
Russia will be ruled by two tsars , but there is little doubt which of the two will dominate .
The changes signal continuity and stability , at least in the short term .
In the longer term , it could be a different story .
For Putin to remain in control of both Russia 's foreign and domestic policy as prime minster , there will have to be a clear understanding between him and the new president .
If the constitution remains unchanged , the president is commander - in - chief and has the power to dismiss the government and appoint a new one .
It is the president who usually represents Russia abroad .
As so much of the past eight years of Putinism has been about standing up to the west , it is difficult to imagine Putin forgoing this role .
This is one reason why a substantial shift of powers between the presidency and the prime minister can not be ruled out .
In name , Russia would become a parliamentary republic .
In reality , the source of all power would simply have moved a couple of hundred yards from one office to another .
But the new arrangement has one clear advantage : it gives Putin flexibility .
If things go badly , Medvedev will dutifully take the rap , elections will be called and you - know - who will be back in charge ( the constitution only bans more than two consecutive terms in office ) .
If things go well , Putin could ease himself out of power and into a new life .
Both scenarios are possible .
When a new leader is introduced to Russia and the world , the temptation is to view him through blinkers .
Medvedev is thus regarded as a safer choice than the alternative , Sergei Ivanov , the former defence minister .
The 42-year - old lawyer has no links with the KGB and is not a member of the "" siloviki "" , the group in the Kremlin who represent the interests of the enforcement ministries .
But these judgments are brittle , as are the roles played by Russia 's elite .
When he first emerged on the political stage , Putin was greeted by the west as a safe pair of hands who would carry on the policies of the Yeltsin era , until it turned out that he had no such intention - and rightly so .
What is brushed aside by such sweeping calculations is the state the country is actually in .
Money from the oil and gas boom is still flying out of the country , just as it was in the bad old days of Yeltsin .
Investment in infrastructure and industry is a fraction of what is needed .
Electricity generating stations are being privatised , but the transmission lines are crumbling .
Look at the daily gridlock of traffic in Moscow , and you will today be hard put to spot a Russian car .
Great for the sales of Mercedes and Volvo , but assembling foreign cars does little for the economy .
Russia does not even supply the spare parts .
Nor is the oil or gas industry wonderfully efficient .
Economists in Moscow say that if the price of oil fell to $ 50 a barrel , Russia 's balance of payments would quickly start looking pale and sick .
Yeltsin - like in fact .
There will be no democratic restoration until Russia stands on its own two feet again , in every sense .
The fear of collapse or disintegration or another war in the Caucasus still lingers , despite the energy boom ( or possibly because of it ) .
For the very few , personal wealth - and usually obscene amounts of it - provides the only reliable insulation from the chaos of daily life .
Inflation is running at a healthy gallop , and most people are hard put to afford the rising cost of staple foods , rents , electricity and heating .
And as for buying the right surgeon , official or judge when they need one , forget it .
Law is a service for the rich .
It is a telling fact that while Putin enjoys consistently high levels of public support , no other level of government is trusted .
A former government official told me he reckoned that 35 % of the money for any government contract would disappear through corruption .
Paternalism , nationalism , tsarism are labels that commentators toy with when describing Russia .
But if Russia is nationalist , it has yet to formulate industrial , defence and foreign policies that protect the national interest .
When it begins to do that , the population will stop declining , government will be less corrupt and it will matter much less than it does today , what countries outside Russia do or say about it ."
2007-12-12,"The prospect of Russia moving into a post - Putin era swiftly receded yesterday when his anointed successor Dmitry Medvedev said he wanted Vladimir Putin to become Russia 's prime minister next year once his term as president expires .
In a TV address , Medvedev said Putin should lead the government after Russia 's March 2 presidential elections .
The move means that Putin would continue as Russia 's de facto leader , and sets the stage for his possible return as president in Russia 's next election in 2012 - if not sooner .
"" It is crucial for our country to keep Vladimir Putin in a top position in our executive , "" Medvedev said , a day after winning Putin 's backing as candidate for president .
Medvedev added : "" Expressing my readiness to run as a candidate for president , I ask him [ Putin ] to agree to head the government of Russia after the election of the new president . ""
He went on : "" It is not enough to choose the new president who can divide up all those responsibilities .
It 's no less important to preserve the capable team formed by the current president .
"" The announcement appears to end the mystery about what role Putin will play once his term in office ends .
Under Russia 's constitution he is obliged to step down after two consecutive terms .
There is nothing , however , to stop him coming back .
Putin has already said that he intends to "" influence "" his successor and hinted in October during a congress of his United Russia party that he was considering taking the prime minister 's job .
Yesterday analysts said that there was no doubt that Putin would remain in charge of Russia 's foreign and domestic policy .
He would also exercise decisive influence over the military and security agencies , they said .
Medvedev would play a junior role .
Putin could even represent Russia at G8 summits , together with Medvedev . ""
The country will be run by a tandem , but Putin will be the senior partner , "" said Boris Makarenko , deputy director of Moscow 's Centre for Political Technologies .
He added : "" This is the beginning .
After that there are two scenarios .
Putin can become president again after an interlude .
Or he will eventually reduce his own role in politics and have Medvedev develop into a full - scale leader .
Both ways are open . ""
"" Medvedev wo n't be a mere puppet of Putin , "" said Grigorii V Golosov , a professor in the faculty of political sciences and sociology at St Petersburg 's European University .
"" But the pattern of cooperation between them developed over the past 17 years will continue .
Putin will assume the senior role in the relationship . ""
Others said the invitation to Putin to head the government could just be a ploy to help Medvedev stave off challenges from rival clans and win the election by associating himself closely with the departing president .
"" It seems to me that Putin still has n't decided on his next job , "" said Yevgeny Minchenko , director of the International Institute of Political Analysis .
Under Russia 's existing system it is the president who controls Russia 's nuclear arsenal .
He is also in charge of foreign and domestic policy .
He appoints - and can sack - the prime minister .
Last night it was not clear whether Putin would move to bolster the prime minister 's power following last week 's landslide victory for United Russia , which dominates the State Duma .
Russia 's opposition parties said Medvedev 's offer amounted to an illegitimate power grab by Putin .
They also predicted that the power - sharing deal , with a "" technical "" president , would not work . ""
Having two tsars is very dangerous for the stability of Russia 's political system , "" political analyst Andrey Piontkovsky warned on the website of opposition coalition , The Other Russia .
Despite his reputation as a liberal , Medvedev yesterday struck a decidedly Putin - like tone in remarks on the west . ""
The world 's attitude towards Russia has been changed , "" he said .
"" They do n't lecture us like schoolchildren .
They respect us and they reckon with us .
Russia has been returned to its overwhelming position in the world community . ""
He also praised Putin 's efforts to restore the country 's armed forces after years of post - Soviet neglect and under - funding . ""
Our military defence and security have been increased , "" he declared .
Last night experts said an immediate change in Russia 's outlook was unlikely under Medvedev .
"" My feeling is no radical changes will occur in foreign or domestic policy in the first couple of years after the transfer of power , "" the analyst Boris Makarenko told the Guardian . ""
After that ?
It 's too early to tell .
""
The reshuffle
The news that Vladimir Putin could be Russia 's next prime minister follows two fast - moving days in which the Kremlin has wrongfooted everyone .
On Monday , Putin announced his support for Dmitry Medvedev , below , a relative moderate , to succeed him as president .
While Medvedev had long been a frontrunner , recently his star had seemingly faded .
Instead , speculation suggested Sergei Ivanov , the hawkish former defence minister , or current PM Viktor Zubkov would get the top job .
Putin himself was at the centre of numerous theories .
In the most compelling , Zubkov - who is 66 - would become president and then "" fall ill "" - and stand aside patriotically to let Putin return .
Now it appears Zubkov will have to resign anyway to make way for PM Putin .
Speculation will resume over Putin 's intentions .
Will he come back as president in 2012 ?
Or will he finally retire from Russian politics ?"
2007-12-17,"The United Russia party today voted unanimously to nominate Vladimir Putin 's favoured successor , Dmitry Medvedev , as its candidate in the March 2 presidential election .
Medvedev 's path to the Russian presidency was considered a formality once he had been endorsed by the president .
Earlier , Putin had said he was ready to be prime minister if Medvedev was elected .
While his desire to be prime minister had been widely anticipated , he also - more surprisingly - announced that there would be no change in the powers of the two roles .
Many expected that , with his chosen successor in place , Putin would continue to be the most powerful man in the country in all but name . ""
If the citizens of Russia show trust in Dmitry Medvedev and elect him the new president , I would be ready to continue our joint work as prime minister without changing the distribution of authority between the positions , "" he told the United Russia congress .
Putin had previously said a victory for United Russia in parliamentary elections would give him the "" moral authority "" to ensure his policies were continued .
He also said Medvedev 's candidacy represented "" an administration that will carry on the same policies that have brought us results for the past eight years "" .
Analysts have suggested it is inevitable that , as prime minister , Putin would remain in charge of Russia 's foreign and domestic policy and exercise decisive influence over the military and security agencies .
The prime minister is a significantly less powerful figure than the president in Russia but , on accepting the nomination , Medvedev indicated that Putin would retain a strong influence in the Kremlin .
The president 's chosen successor outlined his priorities , which included strengthening the country 's position in the world and preserving the Russian nation .
"" All this is in Vladimir Putin 's strategy , "" he added .
"" I will be guided by this strategy if I am elected president . ""
But carrying out an idea can only be successful with the participation of its author .
I have no doubt that in the future Vladimir Vladimirovich [ Putin ] will use all his resources , all his influence in Russia and abroad for the benefit of Russia . ""
The 42-year - old Medvedev - who is seen as business - friendly and not hawkish - is expected to be elected overwhelmingly on March 2 following Putin 's endorsement .
The current president has approval ratings of more than 80 % , and his support helped United Russia win more than two - thirds of seats in the lower house of parliament in the December 2 election .
Opponents , however , claimed the vote had been rigged .
Medvedev , a first deputy prime minister , has no experience of foreign affairs .
His only appearance on the international stage was at the annual economic forum in the Swiss ski resort of Davos earlier this year .
He is best known abroad through his chairmanship of the state gas giant , Gazprom , and for taking an uncompromising line in negotiations with Russia 's neighbours over gas prices .
When Medvedev received Putin 's endorsement last week , he quickly proposed that the president become prime minister after the election .
Putin is prohibited by law from running for a third consecutive term as president , but has not ruled out a return to office at a later date ."
2007-12-18,"Vladimir Putin yesterday made it clear that he had no intention of resigning from politics , and said he would accept the job of prime minister next year , if his close ally Dmitry Medvedev became Russia 's next president .
Putin said he would take the helm of Russia 's government when he stepped down as president in May.
Medvedev offered Putin the post last week , a day after Putin endorsed Medvedev as his effective successor .
Speaking in Moscow , Putin paid warm tribute to Medvedev , describing him as a statesman and an excellent administrator .
He also said he was opposed to any redistribution of powers that would enhance the prime minister 's job .
"" If the citizens of Russia show trust in Dmitry Medvedev and elect him the new president , I would be ready to continue our joint work as prime minister , without changing the distribution of authority , "" Putin told a congress of his United Russia party .
His announcement baffled many analysts .
It was generally believed that Medvedev 's offer to Putin last week of the PM 's job was just a tactical ploy designed to bolster Medvedev 's vote and image before next year 's presidential elections .
It was expected that with Putin 's support , and the Kremlin 's huge administrative resources , Medvedev would face little difficulty in winning an overwhelming first - round victory in the March 2 poll ; and at this point Putin would decline the PM 's job .
Now , however , it appears Putin genuinely intends to be PM , in a power - sharing tandem with Medvedev .
Under this arrangement Putin would remain the dominant partner , with 42-year - old Medvedev in a junior role .
Last night , analysts said the strategy was risky , and could cripple Medvedev 's presidency .
With Russia also facing a looming economic crisis and soaring inflation , prime minister Putin could swiftly become the target of popular dissatisfaction , they said .
"" I 'm baffled by this .
I do n't think it 's smart to accept the offer now , "" said Lilia Shevtsova , a senior associate at the Carnegie Centre in Moscow .
"" Rationally , it would be wiser to accept after March 2 .
This tells us about individual and collective insecurity . ""
"" The new regime will have two centres of power .
One will be stronger under Putin .
The other will be weaker under Medvedev .
By taking this step Putin undermines this presidency . ""
At yesterday 's congress , Putin formally proposed Medvedev as United Russia 's candidate for president .
"" We should n't be ashamed or afraid of transferring the key powers of the country , the destiny of Russia , to the hands of such a man , "" he said .
Medvedev responded by confirming the impression that , for the moment , he is little more than Putin 's loyal disciple .
He said his key policies included strengthening Russia 's role in the world , and looking after the old and the young .
"" All this is in Vladimir Putin 's strategy .
I will be guided by this strategy if I am elected president , "" he said .
In a piece of strained choreography , the two men strolled side by side into the cavernous conference hall .
Putin looked exhausted .
Medvedev , in an identical dark suit , seemed merely tired .
Under Russia 's constitution Putin is obliged to step down next year .
Many commentators believe he would like to bow out of politics , but has been forced to carry on in order to preserve his own security and personal wealth .
The Kremlin , meanwhile , was accused of further clamping down on media freedom after a critical reporter was expelled from the country .
Natalaya Morar , a Moldovan citizen , was refused re - entry into Russia on Sunday after returning from a business trip to Israel ."
2007-12-21,"An unprecedented battle is taking place inside the Kremlin in advance of Vladimir Putin 's departure from office , the Guardian has learned , with claims that the president presides over a secret multibillion - dollar fortune .
Rival clans inside the Kremlin are embroiled in a struggle for the control of assets as Putin prepares to transfer power to his hand - picked successor , Dmitry Medvedev , in May , well - placed political observers and other sources have revealed .
At stake are billions of dollars in assets belonging to Russian state - run corporations .
Additionally , details of Putin 's own personal fortune , reportedly hidden in Switzerland and Liechtenstein , are being discussed for the first time .
The claims over the president 's assets surfaced last month when the Russian political expert Stanislav Belkovsky gave an interview to the German newspaper Die Welt .
They have since been repeated in the Washington Post and the Moscow Times , with speculation over the fortune appearing on the internet .
Citing sources inside the president 's administration , Belkovsky claims that after eight years in power Putin has secretly accumulated more than $ 40bn ( £ 20bn ) .
The sum would make him Russia 's - and Europe 's - richest man .
In an interview with the Guardian , Belkovsky repeated his claims that Putin owns vast holdings in three Russian oil and gas companies , concealed behind a "" non - transparent network of offshore trusts "" .
Putin "" effectively "" controls 37 % of the shares of Surgutneftegaz , an oil exploration company and Russia 's third biggest oil producer , worth $ 20bn , he says .
He also owns 4.5 % of Gazprom , and "" at least 75 % "" of Gunvor , a mysterious Swiss - based oil trader , founded by Gennady Timchenko , a friend of the president 's , Belkovsky alleges .
Asked how much Putin was worth , Belkovsky said : "" At least $ 40bn .
Maximum we can not know .
I suspect there are some businesses I know nothing about . ""
He added : "" It may be more .
It may be much more . ""
Putin 's name does n't appear on any shareholders ' register , of course .
There is a non - transparent scheme of successive ownership of offshore companies and funds .
The final point is in Zug [ in Switzerland ] and Liechtenstein .
Vladimir Putin should be the beneficiary owner .
"" Putin has not commented on Belkovsky 's claims .
The Guardian put the allegations to the Kremlin but was told Putin 's chief spokesman , Dmitry Peskov , was not available .
Discussion of Putin 's wealth has previously been taboo .
But the claims have leaked out against the backdrop of a fight inside the Kremlin between a group led by Igor Sechin , Putin 's influential deputy chief of staff , and a "" liberal "" clan that includes Medvedev .
The Sechin group is made up of siloviki - Kremlin officials with security / military backgrounds .
It is said to include Nikolai Patrushev , the head of the Federal Security Service ( FSB ) , Russia 's KGB successor agency , his deputy Alexander Bortnikov , and Putin 's aide Viktor Ivanov .
Those associated with the liberal camp include Roman Abramovich , the Russian oligarch and owner of Chelsea football club who is close to Putin and the Yeltsin family .
Other members are Viktor Cherkesov , the head of the federal drug control service , and Alisher Usmanov , an Uzbek - born billionaire .
Insiders say the struggle has little to do with ideology .
They characterise it as a war between business competitors .
Putin 's decision to endorse as president Medvedev - who has no links with the secret services - dealt a severe blow to the hardline Sechin clan , they add .
Some analysts have said Putin would like to retire but has been forced to carry on to shield Medvedev from siloviki plotting .
Others disagree and say Putin wants to stay in power .
On Monday Putin confirmed he intends next year to become Russia 's prime minister . ""
The siloviki are not at all nice , "" Yulia Latynina , a Russian political commentator said .
Latynina , who hosts a political talkshow on the liberal radio station Ekho Moskvy , was one of the first journalists to draw attention last month to Putin 's reported links with Gunvor .
The company is based in Zug , a picturesque Swiss canton known as a bolthole for publicity - shy international businessmen .
Gunvor has neither a website nor a Moscow office - but in 2007 posted profits of $ 8bn on a turnover of $ 43bn , an astronomic figure , according to industry experts .
Like Putin , its reclusive owner , Timchenko , worked in the KGB 's foreign affairs directorate .
He is said to have met Russia 's president in the late 1980s through KGB circles .
Gunvor , which has its head office in Geneva , failed to comment .
Critics say the wave of renationalisations under Putin has transformed Putin 's associates into multimillionaires .
The dilemma now facing the Kremlin 's elite is how to hang on to its wealth if Putin leaves power , experts say .
Most of its money is located in the west , they add .
The pressing problem is how to protect these funds from any future administration that may seek to reclaim them . ""
There 's no point in having all this money if you ca n't travel to the Maldives or Paris and spend it , "" Elena Panfilova , the director of Transparency International in Russia said .
The first hints of the intra - clan warfare gripping the Kremlin emerged last month , when the FSB arrested General Alexander Bulbov , the deputy head of the federal drug agency , and part of the liberal group .
His arrest saw a surreal standoff , with his bodyguards and FSB agents pointing machine guns at each other .
Earlier this month Russia 's deputy finance minister , Sergei Storchak - another "" liberal "" - was also arrested and charged with embezzling $ 43.4 m .
He is currently in prison .
His boss , Russia 's finance minister , Alexei Kudrin , part of the liberal clan , says he is innocent .
But the liberal group - one of several competing factions inside the Kremlin - has struck back .
Earlier this month Oleg Shvartsman , a previously obscure businessman , gave an interview to Kommersant newspaper claiming he secretly managed the finances of a group of FSB officers .
Their assets were worth £ 1.6bn , he revealed .
The officers were involved in "" velvet reprivatisations "" , Shvartsman , a fund manager , said - in effect forcibly acquiring private companies at below - market value and transforming them into state - owned firms .
These assets were redistributed via offshore companies , he said .
According to Panfilova , the "" randomised "" corruption of the 1990s has given way to the "" systemic and institutionalised corruption "" of the Putin era .
Members of Putin 's cabinet personally control the most important sectors of the economy - oil , gas and defence .
Medvedev is chairman of Gazprom ; Sechin runs Rosneft ; other ministers are chairmen of Russian railways , Aeroflot , a nuclear fuel giant and an energy transport enterprise .
Putin has created a new , more streamlined oligarchy , his critics say .
"" The crown jewels of the country 's wealth have ended up in the hands of Putin 's inner circle , "" Vladimir Rzyhkov - a former independent MP - wrote in Monday 's Moscow Times .
Belkovsky - who published a book about Putin 's finances last year , and who is the director of the National Strategic Institute , a Moscow thinktank - claims he is confident of his assessment of Putin 's hidden wealth .
"" It 's not a secret among the elites , ' he said .
"" But please pay attention that Vladimir Vladimirovich [ Putin ] has never sued me . ""
Belkovsky adds that the west has misunderstood Putin and has been distracted by his "" neo - Soviet "" image .
Putin , Belkovsky claims , is ultimately a "" classic "" businessman who believes money can solve any problem , and whose psychology was shaped by his experiences working in the St Petersburg mayor 's office in Russia 's crime - ridden early 1990s . ""
He is quite sure of this .
A problem that ca n't be resolved with $ 1bn can be resolved with $ 10bn , and if not with $ 10bn then $ 20bn , and so on , "" Belkovsky said .
In an interview on Wednesday with Time magazine , which named Putin its person of the year , the president vehemently denied that those inside the Kremlin were corrupt .
Asked whether "" some of the people closest to you are getting rich "" , Putin said : "" Then you know who and how .
Write to us , to the foreign ministry , if you are so confident .
I presume you know the names , you know the systems and the tools .
"" I can assure you and everyone who would listen to us , watch us and read us , that the reaction would be swift , immediate , [ and ] within the prevailing law . """
2008-01-23,"Russia 's future president , Dmitry Medvedev , yesterday began his election campaign by acknowledging that Russia was in the grip of rampant corruption and what he termed "" legal nihilism "" .
In his first address since being registered as a candidate for Russia 's March presidential election , Medvedev said official corruption had now reached a "" huge scale "" .
He was also critical of widespread disregard for the law .
Medvedev 's unusual comments came as Russia 's election commission moved to disqualify the only democratic challenger in the March 2 poll - the opposition candidate Mikhail Kasyanov .
The commission said it was launching an investigation into signatures collected by Kasyanov 's supporters , claiming that many of them had been forged .
Under Kremlin rules candidates not represented in Russia 's Duma need to collect 2 m signatures .
Yesterday Kasyanov - who served as Russia 's prime minister before falling out with Vladimir Putin in 2004 - described the investigation as political .
He said government agencies had harassed his supporters , forcing them to denounce themselves .
Last month Putin anointed Medvedev , Russia 's first deputy prime minister , as his presidential successor .
Medvedev 's victory in the March election is a foregone conclusion .
Medvedev also suggested that the west had misunderstood Russia .
"" Russia in the future will continue developing as a nation open for dialogue with the international community , "" he said .
Most analysts , however , believe that he is unlikely to change Putin 's hawkish foreign policy , not least because Medvedev has asked Putin to carry on in government .
Both men will then run the country , with Putin the senior partner , observers believe ."
2008-02-07,"They are better known as a bunch of grizzled rockers from Hertfordshire , whose hits including Smoke on the Water have sold millions of records .
But next week the English rock band Deep Purple are to perform their most unlikely gig yet - in front of Russia 's heavy metal grooving future president , Dmitry Medvedev .
The state gas firm Gazprom has booked the band to fly from the UK to Moscow to perform at a special concert celebrating the 15th anniversary of the utility .
The concert is a thank - you to Medvedev , who steps down as Gazprom chairman next month after Russia 's presidential elections .
Medvedev is a devoted DP fan .
A former lawyer from St Petersburg , he also likes Black Sabbath .
Last year he boasted that he had collected all of Deep Purple 's many albums , telling an interviewer : "" I 've loved hard rock since my school days . ""
Next week 's concert takes place inside the Kremlin 's state palace , in a grandiose 1960s Soviet concert hall .
Yesterday Gazprom and the band 's management declined to comment .
But Reuters , citing industry sources , said the concert would be on February 11 , attended by Medvedev and Vladimir Putin .
This is not Medvedev 's first intimate Deep Purple encounter ; he and 70 other political and business figures brought Joe Lynn Turner - who was lead singer for only one album - to Moscow for a concert last year , Russian media reported .
The efforts to play up Medvedev 's heavy - metal credentials are part of a strategy to show that Russia 's future leader is a regular guy .
But most experts believe Medvedev will continue his predecessor 's policies , despite his liberal reputation .
Putin endorsed Medvedev in December as his presidential successor , virtually guaranteeing him a landslide victory in the March 2 vote ."

A lion attacked a 10-year - old boy visiting a circus in eastern China , biting off his arm through the bars of its cage , state media said yesterday .

Park workers managed to pull the boy away , but his left arm had been torn away by the animal , "" the Xinhua news agency reported .

Associated Press in Berlin"
2008-02-27,"Who is running in the election ?
There are four candidates : the deputy prime minister , Dmitry Medvedev , who has Vladimir Putin 's backing ; the Communist stalwart Gennady Zyuganov ; the ultra - nationalist and eternal clown of Russian politics , Vladimir Zhirinovksy ; and Andrei Bogdanov , a curly - locked Freemason and supposedly eager pro - European who commentators say is a Kremlin stooge running to give the impression there is a spectrum of choice .
Mikhail Kasyanov , the former prime minister who became an opponent of Putin , was struck off for allegedly falsifying the list of 2 m signatures needed to secure candidacy .
He claimed this was politically motivated and called for a boycott of the vote .
What has the campaigning been like ?
Limp would the most charitable description .
Medvedev , 42 , has refused to take part in debates between candidates and is officially not campaigning .
In his role as deputy prime minister responsible for infrastructure projects , he is however getting blanket Soviet - style coverage on state television as he tours the country inspecting factories , hospitals and ice rinks .
Zyuganov , 63 , is concentrating on his ageing support base among pensioners and workers .
The incorrigible Zhirinovsky , 61 , appears in brief televised rants and hands out cash to supporters when he is on the road .
Bogdanov , 37 , a complete unknown until the start of the election campaign , features in a political broadcast where he sits morosely over an ice - fishing hole .
Who is going to win ?
The result is a foregone conclusion .
Barring a natural disaster , Medvedev will be the next president of Russia .
He is popular because he is endorsed by Putin , who has consistently enjoyed approval ratings of between 70 % and 80 % since his election in 2000 .
Medvedev also has the Kremlin 's backing and the state media is saturated with propaganda in his favour .
Off the record , Russian election officials say that - as in the parliamentary elections in December - the Kremlin will push hard to ensure a high turnout and a convincing win for Medvedev , as a result of which he is unlikely to get less than 65 % of the vote .
Regional governors , university deans , factory directors in the state sector and other officials are being pressured to ensure their subordinates turn out for Medvedev .
The other candidates do not have a chance , partly because they lack genuine popularity and partly because they can not compete with the crushing power of the state machine .
Zyuganov , who forced a run - off when he scored 32 % in the 1996 presidential election against Boris Yeltsin , has been a fading figure for more than a decade .
Zhirinovksy has his hardcore of supporters but is in no way a threat , and Bogdanov seems to have been deliberately chosen to arouse antipathy .
What will Vladimir Putin do next ?
He will probably become prime minister .
He can not stand in this election because the constitution bars presidents from standing for a third consecutive term .
Around two - thirds of Russians , however , say they would be voting for him if he was a candidate .
Formally , the president of Russia has much greater powers than the prime minister .
He directly controls the armed forces and the security services , while the prime minister is more of a manager , taking care of economic and domestic issues .
However , analysts believe an informal mechanism will be found for the roles to be reversed so Putin stays in charge of the "" power bloc "" made up of the military and security forces , while Medvedev acts as a figurehead who looks after social issues and the economy .
In any case , Putin and Medvedev are very close - the latter owes his career to the former .
What is certain is that Putin will remain a huge figure in Russian politics , and most likely the dominant figure .
What does this election mean for Russia ?
For the average Russian little is likely to change .
The country will continue to be run by a clique of officials surrounding Putin whose mantra is "" stability "" .
Many Russians are happy that they have escaped the dire straits that afflicted the country during the early transition years of the 1990s when the economy went into meltdown .
Corruption is widely seen as an immutable problem that a president is not expected to fix .
Voters often perceive opposition politicians as provocateurs and wreckers who deserve to be suppressed .
Only a serious economic downturn is likely to hurt confidence in the government .
Russia 's foreign policy will probably remain hawkish , despite murmurings that Medvedev is a "" liberal "" star in the Kremlin constellation ."
2008-02-29,"At Dmitry Medvedev 's campaign headquarters there are no mugs , no T - shirts , no signed Medvedev photos .
There is n't even a portrait of the man who this Sunday will be elected Russia 's next president .
Until this week Medvedev had n't even done any campaigning .
He has refused to take part in TV debates or give press conferences .
None of this appears to have harmed his chances : the latest "" official "" opinion polls suggest around 70 % of Russians will vote for the 42-year - old lawyer from St Petersburg .
Medvedev 's galloping lead can be explained by one thing : the Putin factor .
In December Vladimir Putin announced he wanted Medvedev to become Russia 's next president ; Medvedev swiftly offered Putin the job of prime minister .
The Kremlin is now using its mighty resources to make it so .
Russia 's Kremlin - controlled television has run lavish coverage of Medvedev 's daily activities as first deputy prime minister .
While on tour earlier this month in Russia 's frozen east he was shown dancing gallantly with an old lady and munching on a cucumber on a Siberian farm . ""
Tasty , "" Russia 's next president remarked . ""
This is n't really an election .
It is the legitimisation of an appointment procedure , "" Grigorii Golosov , a politics professor at St Petersburg 's European University , said .
"" From this point of view it does n't make any sense to have a campaign .
The issue has already been decided .
This is the message that is being sent to the population . ""
Kremlin spin doctors have cast Medvedev as a representative of Russia 's new and aspiring middle class - a modest , internet - savvy , cosmopolitan leader , who holidays on the Black Sea and likes 70s rock music .
Like his mentor and friend Putin , Medvedev grew up in Leningrad , now St Petersburg .
He spoke lyrically of his ordinary Soviet childhood in the proletarian suburb of Kupchino in an interview with the magazine Itogi .
His parents were university teachers , who did n't have money but were n't starving either .
His teenage dream , he said , was to own Pink Floyd 's The Wall and a pair of Wrangler jeans .
Medvedev and his wife Svetlana met at school ; they have a son , Ilya , born in 1996 .
Medvedev recalled working as a labourer and a snow sweeper while studying for a law PhD at Leningrad State University .
"" I never strived for , or dreamed , that the world would know about me , "" he said .
He met Putin in 1991 when both worked for St Petersburg 's liberal mayor Anatoly Sobchak .
But Medvedev 's real personality is an enigma .
Observers agree that , having survived the shark - pool of Kremlin politics , first as Putin 's campaign manager during the 2000 presidential elections and then as his chief of staff , he is no patsy .
He became first deputy prime minister in 2005 , currently overseeing health , education and agriculture - all of which are in bad shape .
Does Medvedev have an agenda of his own ?
Or is he simply Putin with a smile on his face ?
Most experts believe his platform is substantially the same as Putin 's , with any differences merely stylistic .
This week Medvedev made clear his opposition to Kosovo 's independence .
He recently described the British Council as a "" nest of spies "" .
Boris Makarenko , deputy director of the Centre for Political Technologies , Russia 's oldest political thinktank , said that in time the low - key Medvedev could emerge as a real leader .
"" Personalities of a leader are always an enigma , not just in Russia but also in the US .
If you look at US history there are generals who went on to be lousy presidents and vice versa , "" he said .
Other analysts agreed .
"" I do n't think Medvedev will be a puppet , "" said Golosov .
"" It does seem he has a will and an intellectual capacity .
But whether this will be consequential in any way we have to wait and see .
"" Medvedev 's colleagues in government describe him as loyal , competent and pragmatic .
It was n't his fault that his programme to revive Russia 's infrastructure so far had n't worked . ""
He 's not Harry Potter .
We 're talking about a long - term project to revive Russia 's infrastructure following a decade of non - investment in the 1990s , "" said Dmitry Vyatkin , a United Russia MP .
Some , however , think that Medvedev may turn into a progressive leader who eventually unravels Putinism .
In a speech this month in Krasnoyarsk Medvedev said Russia desperately needed an independent judiciary and a free press - two things conspicuously lacking from the vertically run Putin era .
"" Freedom is better than non - freedom , "" Medvedev said .
It is so far unclear whether Medvedev means any of what he says - or whether his comments are merely a Putin - approved ploy to reassure investors spooked by the current president 's west - bashing .
Is Medvedev a liberal or a hawk ?
Nobody really knows .
Whether he really wants to be president is also not clear .
This month the gas giant Gazprom threw a party for its 15th anniversary .
At one point the rock star Alla Pugacheva began dancing with Medvedev , the company 's chairman . ""
He clearly was n't enjoying himself .
He looked horribly uncomfortable , "" a member of the audience said .
Back at his campaign headquarters , meanwhile , several visiting pensioners say they do n't actually intend to vote for Medvedev , despite the weeks of Kremlin propaganda .
"" I 'm not going to vote for him , "" Tatiana Fedorovna from Kaliningrad says .
"" These days Russia is n't 1/1000th of a democracy . ""

2008-02-29,"Vladimir Putin today urged Russians to vote in Sunday 's presidential election , although the result is almost certain .
In a televised address , the president said all Russians ' votes would be important .
His comments appeared to be an attempt to drawing a line under claims that the contest has been heavily tilted in favour of his chosen successor , the first deputy prime minister , Dmitry Medvedev .
Putin said the electorate 's support would be important to ensure that his successor was "" effective and confident "" .
"" The voice of each of you will be important in the March 2 vote , "" he added .
His address came after the head of the Russian electoral commission admitted that media coverage of the election had been unequal .
Vladimir Churov told the BBC that not all candidates had enjoyed equal access to the media , but said he still believed the coverage had been fair .
Putin 's popularity and the Kremlin 's control over broadcast media are expected to ensure an easy win for the president 's chosen successor .
Critics say TV channels have given too much time to Medvedev who is expected to win by a landslide .
"" That 's a problem not only for our country , but I can agree that not all candidates have an equal number of news items , "" Churov said .
He said he had no regrets that the Organisation for Security and Co - operation in Europe – the main European election monitoring body - had decided not to send an observer to monitor the vote , adding that the world would form its own opinion on the new president 's legitimacy .
The three other candidates in the presidential race are Gennady Zyuganov , a communist , the ultra - nationalist Vladimir Zhirinovsky and Andrei Bogdanov , widely seen as a Kremlin - backed contender .
Two prominent opposition figures , Garry Kasparov , a former world chess champion , and Mikhail Kasyanov , Putin 's first prime minister who later became a critic , have been barred on technicalities .
Putin has said he will take the number two post of prime minister after stepping down as required by the Russian constitution ."
2008-02-29,"The Kremlin is planning to falsify the results of this Sunday 's presidential election in Russia by compelling millions of public sector workers to vote and by fraudulently boosting the official turnout after polls close , the Guardian has learned .
Governors , regional officials , and even headteachers have been instructed to deliver a landslide majority for Dmitry Medvedev - Russia 's first deputy prime minister , whom President Vladimir Putin has endorsed to be his successor .
Officials have been told they need to secure a 68 % to 70 % turnout in this weekend 's poll - with around 72 % casting votes for Medvedev .
However , independent analysts believe the real turnout will be much lower - with between 25 % and 50 % of the electorate taking part .
The Kremlin is planning to bridge the gap by the use of widespread fraud , diplomats and other independent sources have told the Guardian .
Local election officials are preparing to stuff ballot boxes once the polls have closed with unused ballots , they believe , with regional officials also giving inflated tallies to Russia 's central election commission .
Additionally , public sector workers including teachers , students , and doctors have been told to vote on Sunday or risk losing their jobs or university places .
Parents have even been warned at parents ' meetings that if they fail to turn up their children might suffer at school .
Marina Dashenkova , a spokeswoman for the Golos independent poll - monitoring organisation , said complaints to its hotline were following a similar pattern to those during Russia 's rigged parliamentary poll in December .
Forced use of absentee ballots , pressure on state workers and the banned use of state resources to promote Medvedev were the most common complaints , she said .
Renat Suleymanov , secretary of the Communist Party in the Novosibirsk region , said byudzhetniki ( state workers ) in schools , libraries , kindergartens and doctors ' clinics as well as employees of private companies were "" coming under intense pressure from the authorities "" to vote in tightly controlled conditions at their place of work using absentee ballots .
Also in Novosibirsk , opposition websites published a letter from mayoral officials to health service chiefs and doctors , describing how they should monitor and report back on the voting of their subordinates .
In Vladivostok , Vladimir Bespalov , a deputy in the local parliament , said he had acquired a document showing bureaucrats were given an order to ensure a 65 % turnout and a vote of more than 65 % for Medvedev .
The document laid out precise figures to be achieved in certain districts , he told reporters , with some expected to deliver 88 % for the Kremlin candidate . ""
Clearly , we are talking about instructions to bureaucrats who are expected to deliver a victory for Medvedev that corresponds to pre - planned results , "" he said .
"" According to my information , if these figures are not reached then the people responsible can expect punishment right up to being sacked . ""
In Niznhny Novgorod there were reports of students being forced to vote for Medvedev or face being thrown out of dormitories .
Vladimir Primachyok , a campaign official with presidential candidate Gennady Zyuganov , the chief rival to Dmitry Medvedev , claimed students in Irkutsk were being forced to vote under the supervision of college or university officials .
"" Members of the law enforcement structures came to us and said that they had been forced to take absentee ballots and give them in to their heads of departments or the personnel department , "" he added .
"" All of this is a blatant violation of electoral laws . ""
The purpose of the falsification is to boost the legitimacy of 42-year - old Medvedev - who will take over from Putin in May as Russia 's third post - Soviet leader .
Analysts admit that Medvedev would have won the election anyway without Kremlin interference - but on an embarrassingly small turnout .
While a sizeable chunk of the population is happy with Medvedev because they see him as a joint - architect of Russia 's economic revival , analysts say there is widespread voter apathy because his victory is seen as a foregone conclusion .
Western governments now face the dilemma of whether to congratulate Medvedev on his "" victory "" .
Last month the Organisation for Security and Co - Operation in Europe announced it was boycotting Sunday 's poll , after the Kremlin refused to give visas in time to its election monitors .
The Kremlin used similar tactics during December 's parliamentary elections , which the OSCE 's parliamentary assembly described as "" neither free nor fair "" .
Analysts today noted that Russian voters had become increasingly accepting of official vote rigging and no longer regarded it as anything unusual .
"" There 's no independent control .
It 's very easy to do .
In some places they will put in extra ballots .
In other places election officials will give data that just does n't exist , "" Mikhail Delyagin , an economist and the director of Moscow 's Institute on Globalisation Problems , told the Guardian . ""
The only person with a real vote in this country is Vladimir Putin .
He has already made his position known , "" he added .
Asked whether he intended to vote himself on Sunday he replied : "" Do I look like an idiot ? ""
"" No - one needs to be instructed any more .
Everybody knows what to do , "" said the political scientist Stanislav Belkovsky .
"" The technology has been proved over the past four years in Russia .
Once the polls close unused ballot papers are taken , filled in for Medevdev , of course , and thrown into the box .
The boxes are then stamped and re - opened a second later .
Then they start to count .
"" The technology is very easy .
You do n't need to make it complicated .
Every election commission member is personally responsible .
The central election commission also knows it can rely on governors .
They are more interested in protecting their business interests than in democracy in this country . ""
Asked why the Kremlin elite felt the need to fix the presidential poll , Belkovsky said : "" They ca n't be Saddam Hussein or the Chinese leadership .
The idea is to gain legitimacy in the west . ""
One western diplomat told the Guardian that the administration was now involved in a complicated "" numbers game "" - designed to ensure that Medvedev won a clear first round victory in Sunday 's vote , but that his tally did n't exceed the 71 % won by Vladimir Putin 's United Russia party during December 's State Duma elections .
There would be little "" systematic overt rigging "" during Sunday 's voting , the diplomat said .
Instead the figures would be "" massaged "" afterwards during the accounting and tabulation process , he suggested - a common practice across the former Soviet Union . ""
In a country of this size how do you monitor that ?
"" he asked .
The Kremlin has shrugged off accusations that it manipulated last December 's poll - despite the fact that in several areas of Russia , including Chechnya and other parts of the North Caucuses , 99 % of the population were said to have voted for Putin 's United Russia party .
The official turnout in Chechnya was 99.6 % .
Earlier this month Putin hailed the result as "" perfectly objective "" .
This week , however , a leading Soviet dissident wrote an open letter to the outgoing president , eloquently describing elections in contemporary Russia as nothing more than a "" tasteless farce being played out by untalented directors on the entire boundless Russian stage . ""
Sergei Kovalev , a veteran human rights activist who spent seven years in Soviet labour camps , wrote that - "" thanks to Putin 's ' deliberate efforts ' - we once again have no elections - the main criterion for a democracy .
Not even Stalin could have dreamed of the Chechen record . ""
He added : "" It 's entirely redundant to tediously collect up all the electoral commission protocols rewritten in retrospect , or evidence of shenanigans with ballot papers etc - it 's all clear enough anyway ...
The simulation was not for us but for the west you so dislike . ""
Medvedev is competing against three other candidates - the veteran communist leader Gennady Zyuganov , the ultra - nationalist Vladimir Zhironovsky and a fake democrat , Andrey Bogdanov .
The Kremlin has prevented Mikhail Kasyanov , the only genuinely democratic challenger , from taking part in the poll , claiming that signatures on his election petition had been falsified .
The communists have repeatedly complained of overwhelming media bias by Russia 's state - run television , which in the run - up to the poll has lavishly covered Medvedev 's daily activities and his recent tour of the country 's far east .
Until this week , Medvedev has refused to campaign , claiming he has been to busy .
In a televised address today , Putin urged Russians to vote . ""
The voice of each one of you will be important , "" he said , adding that they needed to turn out so that the next president could be "" effective and confident "" .

2008-03-02,"He walks like Putin , talks like Putin and buys the same suits as Putin .
Dmitry Medvedev has undergone an image transplant in advance of the vote .
Kremlin spin doctors , desperate to engineer a huge win for the former lawyer , have pulled out all the stops to transform him into a carbon copy of outgoing Vladimir Putin . '
Their main aim has been to turn him from this soft , cuddly figure into Putin 's tough little brother , ' said Mark Urnov , a former adviser to President Boris Yeltsin and dean of political science at Moscow 's Higher School of Economics .
It has not been an easy task .
At 5 ft 2 in , Medvedev is the same height as Napoleon , leading Russian bloggers to dub him the ' nano - President ' .
Putin is also short , but has a chest rippling with muscles , shown off in recent pictures of him on a Siberian fishing trip .
A journalist in Ekaterinburg told how officials granting accreditation for a visit by Medvedev , 42 , urged photographers to shoot from a low angle so that the future President did not look too small .
Spin doctors have advised him to take a step forward when he is being photographed in a group .
Kremlin PR gurus are working hard to persuade the electorate he is an action hero like Putin , 55 , who loves judo and riding . '
Putin has been extremely popular and the continuity in image is an attempt to persuade the electorate there will be continuity in politics too , ' said Urnov .
The makeover required real effort .
Two years ago the former lawyer , now First Deputy Prime Minister , resembled an ordinary , overfed bureaucrat .
In recent weeks he has started using sharper language , mimicking Putin 's intonation , acquired a cooler haircut and lost weight . '
In different circumstances I would probably have just been idle , but with this routine I was obliged to actively take part in sport , ' he admitted in a recent interview . '
Looking at him and Putin you could think they have exactly the same person taking care of their suits , ' said designer Lidiya Soseliya . '
The younger man has deliberately adopted the dark Hugo Boss suits and tight black sweaters favoured by his mentor , ' she said .
Stylists are acutely aware of the sex appeal factor .
Surveys conducted during the re - election of Putin in 2004 showed 59 per cent of people voting for him were women impressed by his sobriety and macho image .
The new - look Medvedev is also attracting admirers . '
I think he 's cute , he has a kind of sexual energy about him , ' said Anna Petrova , 19 , a law student in Moscow .
Analysts say female voters are also traditionally more inclined to choose conservative candidates who promise stability .
Kremlin sources admit there has been a campaign to remodel Medvedev on Putin 's image of a work - obsessed ascetic who sips green tea instead of vodka ."
2008-03-02,"Dmitry Medvedev was tonight headed for an easy victory in the Russian presidential election , according to exit polls and early partial results .
Medvedev , 42 , the candidate Putin endorsed in December , is likely to win about 70 % of the vote , according to a poll by the All - Russia opinion research centre , VTsIOM .
The closest rival , Communist party chief Gennady Zyuganov trailed with 16.8 % , the exit poll said .
Medvedev 's election will likely allow Putin to retain a measure of power in a nation whose wealth and global voice have grown while democratic freedoms have diminished during his eight years in office .
With ballots from about 15 % of Russia 's electoral precincts counted , Medvedev had 64.5 % , according to the central election commission .
Zyuganov has nearly 20 % , it said .
Soon after polls closed , Zyuganov and another candidate alleged election violations , the ITAR - Tass and Interfax news agencies reported .
Zyuganov said he had a list of 200 alleged vote violations , and nationalist challenger Vladimir Zhirinovsky said he would contest the official vote results in court , the reports said .
Medvedev is expected to formally take over as president in May , and Putin has agreed to be his prime minister .
"" I 'm in a good mood .
Spring is here , "" Medvedev said earlier as he cast his ballot in Moscow , where rain and snow sprinkled slushy streets .
"" The season has changed . """
2008-03-03,"European observers this morning condemned Russia 's presidential election , won overwhelmingly by Dmitry Medvedev , as "" not fair "" and a denial of the "" democratic potential "" of the country 's voters .
In a critical assessment that nonetheless fell short of the tougher statement many had predicted , the Council of Europe 's parliamentary assembly called yesterday 's poll "" more of a plebiscite "" than a proper democratic election .
Medvedev , Vladimir Putin 's chosen successor as president , romped home in the poll .
With almost 99.5 % of the votes counted , Medvedev had gathered 70.2 % support , Russia 's central election commission said .
He will now take over from Putin on May 7 as Russia 's third post - Soviet leader .
Andreas Gross , the chairman of the 22-member delegation of European MPs , said today that although the election result broadly reflected the will of the Russian people it fell short on a number of crucial issues .
"" We believe there was not freedom in these elections , "" Gross said .
"" The results of the presidential elections … are a reflection of the will of an electorate whose democratic potential was , unfortunately , not tapped . ""
Gross said there had been "" uneven access "" to the media during the campaign , a claim already made by Russia 's opposition , which has complained of overwhelming bias towards Medvedev by Kremlin - controlled state television .
He also lamented the absence of independent candidates in the poll .
The Kremlin deliberately excluded Mikhail Kasyanov , the only genuinely democratic challenger , from the race . ""
Candidate registration procedures should be simplified to be more inclusive and less cumbersome for independent candidates , "" Gross said .
Asked by the Guardian whether yesterday 's poll was any better than Russia 's rigged parliamentary elections in December , which European parliamentarians called "" to a large extent free , but not fair "" , Gross said : "" It 's still not free and still not fair . ""
The Council of Europe 's parliamentary assembly was the only western observation mission that monitored yesterday 's poll .
The Organisation for Security and Co - Operation ( OSCE ) boycotted the election after the Kremlin refused to give its observers visas .
The OSCE 's absence was "" deplorable "" , Gross said .
He suggested however , that Medvedev would have won the poll even without the vast administrative resources used by the Kremlin to guarantee the landslide . ""
Even if [ our ] concerns had been addressed , the outcome of the election … would have been the same , "" he argued .
Gross conceded that regional and local officials had compelled many public sector workers to vote for Medvedev or risk losing their jobs .
"" We heard stories from professors and hospital directors that they felt under pressure , "" he said , adding that the delegation had only visited 100 to 200 of Russia 's 96,000 polling stations .
Several European leaders have already telephoned Medvedev - who appeared at a concert in Red Square last night together with Putin - to congratulate him on his victory .
It is not clear whether Gordon Brown will call Medvedev today .
Sources suggest the prime minister is considering offering Medvedev a fresh start in UK - Russian relations .
Speaking to reporters after his appearance alongside Putin , Medvedev hinted at the influence his predecessor would continue to wield in promising a "" direct continuation "" of the outgoing president 's policies .
However , Medvedev stressed , as president he would control foreign policy .
Congratulating Medvedev , Putin said : "" This victory will serve as a guarantee that the course we have chosen , the successful course we have been following over the past eight years , will be continued . """
2008-03-03,"Gordon Brown is poised to draw a line under the long diplomatic row between London and Moscow by telephoning Russia 's president - elect , Dmitry Medvedev , today and offering a fresh start .
Sources say Brown has been deliberating whether to congratulate Medvedev on his victory in yesterday 's Russia 's presidential poll .
Partial results counted last night gave Medvedev a landslide win with 68 % of the vote .
He will take office on May 7 .
Downing Street acknowledged that yesterday 's poll fell well short of international standards , with millions of public sector workers forced to vote , and European observers likely to condemn it as neither free nor fair .
But officials believe Medvedev 's leadership offers an opportunity to move on from what one called the "" more absurd happenings of the recent past "" - the murder of the Russian dissident Alexander Litvinenko , and the row over the British Council . ""
The transition from one head of state to another offers some scope for diplomatic choreography , "" one source said .
"" We can stop bashing each other over the heads with cudgels and focus on where our common interests lie . ""
Another official said of Medvedev : "" We want to be able to say we 're looking forward to working with him ; it 's a new opportunity to engage with Russia .
We do n't want to shut any doors until he 's had a chance to prove himself .
But if there are massively flawed elections , we 'd have to think long and hard about it . '
Britain will not give up its demand for the extradition of Andrei Lugovoi , the former agent suspected of Litvinenko 's murder , officials indicated .
At the same time , they accept that Moscow will continue to demand the extradition from London of Boris Berezovsky .
Brown will meet Medvedev in July for the first time , at the G8 summit in Japan .
Medvedev 's few foreign policy pronouncements so far give few grounds for optimism .
In an interview last month with the magazine Itogi , he described the British Council in Russia as a "" nest of spies "" .
But unlike Vladimir Putin , Medvedev , a 42-year - old former lawyer , was not in the KGB and has no links with Russia 's security services .
In a speech last month , he called for an independent judiciary and a free media , leading some observers to believe he may in time implement a more conciliatory agenda .
Yesterday , David Clark , a former Labour foreign policy adviser , urged Brown to think very carefully before phoning Russia 's new leader .
"" I think there is a danger it could be done cack - handedly .
The government should n't repeat the same mistake , of somehow accepting at face value his [ Medvedev 's ] liberal and reformist credentials , as declared .
I think there is a danger the government will be seen to have backed down , and the Kremlin 's bullying tactics will have paid off .
Pick up the phone and introduce yourself .
But do n't say anything that appears to legitimise the manner of his election , "" he advised .
Britain 's outspoken ambassador in Moscow , Sir Tony Brenton , meanwhile , will leave his post in the autumn .
Pro -
Kremlin youth activists demanded his removal .
Officials concede that there are "" powerful forces "" inside the Kremlin opposed to any reconciliation with Britain .
These forces regard Britain as a useful "" proxy "" for bashing Nato and the European Union .
But they say the government is keen to offer Medvedev a more constructive relationship with London "" if he wants it "" .
Last July , four Russian diplomats were expelled in protest at Moscow 's refusal to extradite Lugovoi .
Moscow then kicked out four British diplomats .
In January the Kremlin closed the British Council 's offices in St Petersburg and Yekaterinburg ."
2008-03-03,"At one point in the count last night , Dmitry Medvedev cautioned well - wishers against prematurely celebrating his election as Russian president , because all the votes had yet to be counted .
In a parody of a democratic election , this display of modesty was surely superfluous .
The 42-year - old lawyer has been acclaimed by more than 70 % of voters .
His election was the easy part to choreograph , but now begins the more intricate section of a pas de deux between the outgoing and incoming president .
Vladimir Putin continues in power in the junior position of prime minister and it will be hard to reverse the roles .
Can anyone imagine President Medvedev publicly upbraiding Putin before the television cameras for a government that underperforms ?
Putin used to wag his finger at his ministers and make extensive speeches to a long table of men , nodding and silently taking notes .
Is it realistic to imagine Putin taking notes from his president ?
So , which of the two should Russia acclaim as its real leader ?
Whom should Gordon Brown phone to congratulate ?
You have to go back some way to when those questions were asked before .
Possibly to October 14 1964 when Nikita Krushchev was on holiday and a group of conspirators appealed to the central committee blaming the ailing and erratic leader for the Soviet Union 's economic failures .
There was more than one conspirator , and in the short period of collective leadership that followed it was unclear who would emerge as the dominant figure .
It could have been Alexei Kosygin , Nikolai Podgorny or man called Leonid Brezhnev .
At the time , western embassies put their money on Podgorny .
He lost the power battle with Brezhnev when he was appointed to the ceremonial position of head of state .
Is Medvedev Russia 's new Podgorny ?
It will be back to the days of Kremlinology .
Those who seize on Medvedev 's liberal utterings do so more out of wish fulfilment than a genuine belief that he represents a new start .
They forget that he is there for a purpose : Putin 's purpose .
Medvedev is a device to allow Putin to stay in power without having to rewrite a constitution forbidding two consecutive terms as president .
The constitution does not prevent Putin from returning for two more terms as president at some future date .
So Medvedev is there to keep the seat warm .
He is also needed as a counterbalance to rival groups of siloviki , or silogarchs , people who represent the political and business interests of the enforcement ministries .
All of which will cramp the new president 's style .
His presidency could well be tested by a disaster or an emergency - like a Kursk , or a Beslan or a fresh outbreak of unrest in the North Caucusus .
If he is seen to fail the test of leadership , rival groups in the Kremlin will be at this throat , and he will become a useful fall - guy .
But even greater danger lies in Medvedev being too successful and becoming his own man .
For then , he will be sucking both limelight and power away from his political master and that is a dangerous thing to do , unless Putin agrees to it first and is planning his early retirement .
There is no indication that he is .
In the short term at least , Medvedev has to steer a middle course between failure and success .
He has to be competently mediocre .
The next six months should be interesting to watch ."
2008-03-03,"Gordon Brown has attempted to soothe fraught relations between London and Moscow by writing to Russia 's president - elect , Dmitry Medvedev , to offer his congratulations .
His spokesman said : "" We will judge the new government on its actions and the result of its actions . ""
But he added today 's letter to Medvedev expressed hopes that Britain and Russian can repair their badly damaged relations .
Relations between the two counties have been badly strained over the Kremlin 's attitude to Britain 's request for the extradition of Andrei Lugovoi , the former KGB agent suspected of poisoning Alexander Litvinenko .
The row led to tit - for - tat expulsion of diplomats , and relations reached a new low in January , when Britain accused Russia of intimidating British Council staff in Russia .
In his letter , Brown stopped short of inviting Medvedev for talks at Downing Street , but told the Russian leader he was looking forward to meeting him for the first time at the G8 summit in July .
"" We have always said that we will look for opportunities to improve our relationship with Russia , and hopefully get Russian cooperation on a number of issues , "" Brown 's spokesman said .
Officials believe Medvedev 's leadership offers an opportunity to move on from what one called the "" more absurd happenings of the recent past "" .
"" The transition from one head of state to another offers some scope for diplomatic choreography , "" one source said .
"" We can stop bashing each other over the heads with cudgels and focus on where our common interests lie . ""
Another official said of Medvedev : "" We want to be able to say we 're looking forward to working with him ; it 's a new opportunity to engage with Russia .
We do n't want to shut any doors until he 's had a chance to prove himself .
But if there are massively flawed elections , we 'd have to think long and hard about it . ""
Britain will not give up its demand for the extradition of Lugovoi .
At the same time , the government accepts that Moscow will continue to demand the extradition from London of Boris Berezovsky .
The European Union gave a mixed reaction to Medvedev 's victory .
"" I am confident that under President Medvedev the Russian Federation and the European Union will consolidate and develop their strategic partnership , "" Commission president , José Manuel Barroso , said .
But he added the partnership should be based "" not only on common interests but also on respect for the values to which we both declared our commitment "" .
The German government highlighted irregularities in the poll .
"" We have said in recent days that without question during the election campaign there were incidents and situations that showed democratic and constitutional principles were not followed throughout , "" said government spokesman Thomas Steg , according to Reuters .
"" The German government has also said many times that it regrets that international election observers could not carry out their responsibilities in the desired way , "" he said .
Medvedev lost no time in acting tough today .
Gazprom , the state - controlled energy giant Medvedev chairs , cut gas supplies to Ukraine in an apparent show of force to neighbours seeking closer ties to the west .
The decision to squeeze may be an early indication that Medvedev intends to continue the course set by his predecessor and mentor , Vladimir Putin , who is to become prime minister ."
2008-03-03,"Russia 's president - elect , Dmitry Medvedev , last night hinted at the formidable power his patron and predecessor , Vladimir Putin , would continue to wield , indicating that the outgoing leader would help to shape a new government and Kremlin line - up , and promising a "" direct continuation "" of his mentor 's policies .
Giving the country a glimpse of the double act that will now hold the reins of power , the two men appeared last night at a triumphal Red Square pop concert , milking Medvedev 's easy election victory in front of a crowd of thousands of cheering supporters , and heralding a seamless transition from Putin 's eight years in office .
At 42 , Medvedev will become the youngest Kremlin head since Stalin .
Last night he looked it , appearing on stage in leather jacket and jeans to thank the voters who gave him the same endorsement that Putin won in 2004 - around 70 % of the votes .
Later , he told reporters enigmatically that "" joint work "" with Putin "" can give the country rather interesting results and become a positive factor in the development of our state "" .
As for forming a government and the all - important Kremlin administration , he said : "" I will work on this jointly with Vladimir Putin , as a future prime minister . ""
But he did add that he , as president , would direct foreign policy , and said his first trip overseas would be to a former Soviet republic .
Putin appeared relaxed beside his hand - picked successor , telling the crowd that the election in which there was a 67 % turnout demonstrated that Russian civil society was becoming "" effective and responsible "" .
But Medvedev 's opponents alleged that the vote was riddled with irregularities .
Gennady Zyuganov , the perennial communist challenger , who was given about 18 % , said he would take his grievances to court .
The communists say multiple ballots were handed to some voters and cite at least two instances of ballot - stuffing .
"" I believe that the country has once again been robbed , "" Zyuganov was quoted by Itar - Tass as saying .
Last week numerous public sector workers including teachers , students and nurses told the Guardian that they had been instructed to vote or face serious consequences .
Many had been asked to take absentee ballots and vote at work .
Medvedev , Russia 's first deputy prime minister , cast his ballot in the Moscow sleet on Sunday morning with his wife Svetlana .
Afterwards he told reporters : "" I feel good .
Spring has come . ""
Putin also voted in Moscow , his wife Lyudmila shielding him from the conditions with a giant black umbrella .
Putin and Medvedev later had lunch together .
The two men were pictured sitting side by side in a rustic Moscow restaurant , drinking cranberry and blueberry juice and tucking into succulent local dishes of muksun ( white fish ) and omul , a tasty fish from Siberia 's Lake Baikal .
Russian opposition activists are today planning to hold rallies in protest at the poll outside election commissions in Moscow and St Petersburg .
The Kremlin barred Mikhail Kasyanov , the only genuinely democratic challenger , from taking part in yesterday 's election .
"" This is a secret service KGB operation to transfer power from one person to another , "" Kasyanov said , according to Reuters .
Last night one analyst said that Medvedev 's presidency would mean a new era for Russian politics , even though Putin has not gone away . ""
In 11 centuries of Russian history it 's never happened that there has been a new tsar and that nothing has changed , "" Boris Makarenko , deputy director of the Centre for Political Technologies in Moscow told the Guardian ."
2008-03-03,"Dmitry Medvedev begins his tenure as president of Russia in very unpromising circumstances .
Far from taking office with a strong and legitimate mandate , the manner of his election confirms Russia 's retreat from open democratic standards .
Opposition candidates were excluded from the ballot paper , there was heavy state - media bias in his favour and the machinery of government was used to campaign on his behalf .
Restrictions placed on international observers were so tight that election monitors from the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe refused to take part .
The new president should strive to rebuild Russia 's international reputation , which has been damaged by recent signs of authoritarian and nationalist policies .
At a minimum , this must include respect for Russia 's international obligations .
The Russian government 's actions against the British Council violate the Vienna conventions , but that is only the most recent example of its disregard for international law .
Russia is clearly not in compliance with the democracy and human - rights obligations of the OSCE and Council of Europe .
It is also violating its legally binding commitments as a signatory of the energy charter treaty by expropriating investments and using gas supplies as an instrument of coercive diplomacy .
Now is the right time for the EU to address this problem head - on .
Russia is currently campaigning to join the World Trade Organisation and the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development .
Russian eligibility should depend on tangible evidence of acceptance of the rigours of rules - based agreements .
The EU should also insert some competition rules in any free - trade agreements with Russia .
It is a test of EU resolve .
Ian Taylor MP Con , Esher and Walton Bruce George MP , Lab , Walsall South Danny Alexander MP , Lib Dem , Inverness , Nairn , Badenoch and Strathspey Timothy Garton Ash ( Comment , February 28 ) urges us to spell out to Moscow the terms of closer western engagement with Russia : more respect for the sovereignty of neighbouring states , for human rights and for the rule of law .
But since Britain has failed to respect Serbia 's sovereignty by colluding in the illegal amputation of part of its territory ( Kosovo ) ; failed to respect human rights by introducing a mass of illiberal anti - terror legislation that includes detention or virtual house arrest for people neither charged with nor convicted of any offence , and permitting UK sovereign territory to be used for illegal rendition flights ; and failed to respect the rule of law by participating in attacks on Yugoslavia ( 1999 ) and Iraq ( 2003 ) without UN authority and in breach of the UN charter , wagging our fingers at Moscow in the way suggested might invite an embarrassing retort .
Brian Barder London"
2008-03-03,"Short of his falling out of an SUV speeding the wrong way down Moscow 's traffic - congested roads , there was never any doubt yesterday that Dmitry Medvedev would be elected Russia 's next president .
The outgoing president , Vladimir Putin , who remains Russia 's most popular politician , picked Medvedev as his successor , and under the current system of media manipulation no challenger had a chance of beating the Kremlin 's choice .
Selecting a man whose surname derives from the Russian word for "" bear "" is unfortunate .
Western Russophobes have long used the animal as a national symbol to portray the country as wild and aggressive , though susceptible to being tamed if you can get an iron ring round its neck .
Russians use the bear symbol themselves .
But , as the west 's relations with Russia deteriorate , headlines about growls and sharp claws are bound to escalate .
The uncertainty centres on what happens once the new man takes power in May.
Will he want to carve out his own policies and , if so , how will they differ from Putin 's ?
There are two theories on each question .
Theory one starts by arguing that Medvedev was selected by Putin under a deal in which the former president would publicly announce his intention to become prime minister and continue playing a major role after leaving the Kremlin .
This means that Medvedev will be the country 's titular and ceremonial boss while power shifts to the government .
Proponents of this version point out that Medvedev differs from Putin in one important particular .
He has no career link to the siloviki - the so - called power men of the security services , army and interior ministry - which means he is bound to be a weak figure , subject to blackmail , pressure and threats if he tries to undo the authoritarianism of the past few years .
This cohabitation of weak president and strong prime minister would continue until 2012 , when Putin can run for the presidency again .
Theory two claims the opposite .
Its supporters note that Russia 's 1993 constitution gives the president the right to sack the prime minister - an article Putin has denied wishing to change .
While Medvedev will not go that far , the argument goes , he is bound to gain status and authority by being the Kremlin 's top man .
Ambition will entice him to want a second term , so even if there are no clashes with Putin in the early months of his presidency he will inevitably seek to distance himself , and even undermine Putin , as time goes on .
If this theory is correct , how will Medvedev change Russia 's course ?
Most analysts believe the answer is "" Not at all "" .
Under Putin Russia has re - established itself as a confident and independent player on the global stage .
Both he and Medvedev see the enlarged EU as divided and divisible .
Why should Medvedev feel a need to fear it or make concessions ?
There are areas of tension , Kosovo being the latest , but they will not lead to a serious collision .
The US is another matter , and Russians across the political spectrum continue to be irritated by the American missile defence system being installed on their borders and the drive to enlarge Nato .
But talk of a new cold war is exaggerated .
More important , Russia feels the unilateral US interventionism of the Bush years is on the way out and that , whoever takes over the White House , American power is on the decline .
So Moscow can afford to stay calm .
Nor will Medvedev change Russia 's system of authoritarian democracy .
He is a manager , not a visionary : a bureaucrat , not an intellectual ; an executive , not an innovator .
The critical mass of Russian society has always been conservative , forcing radical reformers into frustration and dissidence .
The same is true today , sad though it is after the hopes and promise of the Gorbachev years .
But Russia 's chattering class is still enjoying enough wealth and freedom to travel and consume so as not to be concerned about the regime 's clampdown on human rights , opposition parties and NGOs that have political agendas .
The only likelihood of change relates to the economy .
One theory says Medvedev will continue Putin 's drive to reassert state control over the natural - resource monopolies that had fallen into oligarchic hands .
The other says he will look for more private - public partnerships in modernising infrastructure , provided the state decides the priorities .
Analysts have been poring over a speech Medvedev gave in Krasnoyarsk two weeks ago in which he talked of diversifying the economy away from its dependence on energy revenues and appointing independent directors , rather than government officials , to boards of state - owned companies .
But this is tinkering .
Putin would probably have done the same himself .
Reliance on oil and gas exports can not go on for ever , even if prices look set to remain high for some years .
So continuity is the name of the game .
You can call Sunday 's change "" From Putin to Putin "" .
You can dub the new man "" Putvedev "" .
Those who thought western - style liberal democracy had won the cold war did not get it right .
The authoritarian modernisation by way of state - controlled or state - subsidised mega - corporations in an essentially one - party polity , which Japan , South Korea and Indonesia went through some decades ago is now under way in Russia - and , of course , China . j.steele@theguardian.com"
2008-03-04,"If Sunday 's coronation of Dmitry Medvedev as Russian leader heralded a new era in foreign relations , it has not started yet .
Yesterday 's messages from western leaders to the Kremlin were laced with caution .
Britain said it would judge the new Kremlin leadership by its actions .
Germany and France criticised the conduct of Sunday 's election while acknowledging that Medvedev was a popular victor .
José Manuel Barroso , president of the European commission , said pointedly that EU - Russian partnership should be based not only on "" common interests , but on respect for the values to which we both declared our commitment "" - a discreet criticism of Vladimir Putin 's assault on democracy and pluralism .
Hillary Clinton was less diplomatic .
Sunday 's election , she said , marked a milestone in Russia 's "" retreat from democracy "" .
Challenged by the inscrutability of Kremlin politics and chastened by their experience with Putin , European leaders are wary of placing too much hope in Medvedev .
In Putin 's early days western leaders competed for his affections .
Bush , Blair , Berlusconi , Chirac and Schröder all rushed to embrace the former KGB colonel .
That is now seen to have been poor judgment .
"" It would be naive and counter - productive for the EU to rush to hail Russia 's ' new face ' , as most western leaders did when Putin replaced Yeltsin , "" Andrew Wilson , of the European Council on Foreign Relations , said in a policy paper on Medvedev .
Western leaders expect a frosty valedictory session with Putin if , for the first time in seven years , he attends a Nato summit in Romania next month .
The Russians are said to have already booked up to 400 hotel rooms in Bucharest .
The Americans are disenchanted with the Kremlin .
The new leaders in Europe - Brown , Sarkozy , and Merkel - are much more wary of Russia , while Moscow 's attempts to split Europe over Kosovo , missile defence or energy disputes are seen to have backfired .
"" There 's a momentum building , a growing unity in Europe on Russia policy , "" said Fraser Cameron , director of the Brussels - based EU - Russia Centre .
But the EU has struggled to come up with a coherent policy . ""
The Putin era was marked by damaging and widening EU disunity over its relationship with Moscow ... the EU has failed to define and defend a common policy towards a resurgent Russia , "" Wilson wrote ."
2008-03-04,"Russian president Vladimir Putin and his successor Dmitry Medvedev in Red Square in Moscow .
Photograph :
Vladimir Rodionov / EPA Dmitry Medvedev celebrated his victory in the Russian presidential election with a rock concert in Red Square , Moscow .
I have not yet seen transcripts of his speech , but I think I could guess at a few phrases .
Perhaps , "" For those about to rock , we salute you "" ( AC / DC ) , accompained by a devil 's horn salute .
Or maybe , "" You are my people , you are my crowd , this is our music , we love it loud "" ( Kiss ) , followed by a lewd tongue waggle .
President Medvedev is a rocker , a roller , a right out - of - controller .
At least , he is in his publicity materials , boasting of his hard rocking ways to counter his image as a backroom lawyer , author of a textbook on the Civil Code .
Medvedev loves Zep , the Sabs and , especially , Deep Purple .
He announced his candidacy by recounting how he collected the original vinyl copies of every Deep Purple record ; which strikes me as just the kind of nerdy completism one would expect from a backroom lawyer - type .
Medvedev may yet turn Russia into a new Wayne 's World , putting the par - tee into Putin 's United Russia party .
But his fealty to the royalty of British rock was widespread in Russian universities in the 1980s .
My wife is a contemporary , attending Moscow State University at the same time Medvedev was at Leningrad State University .
She recalls the student dorms echoing to rock , especially the holy triumvirate of Led Zeppelin , Deep Purple and Black Sabbath ( though my wife continues to have a soft spot for Nazareth ) .
It is easy to see why Russians love British rock .
Deep Purple are the musos , with keyboard player Jon Lord 's showy references to Russian composer Rimsky - Korsakov .
Black Sabbath are more meaty , or meat - headed , but have the chundering riffs , like the Red Army crossing the Rhine .
Led Zeppelin have a pastoral edge , the perfect accompaniment to a summer evening at the dacha among the silver birches .
Given Russia 's love for this music , could it have affected the course of history ?
Were Gorbachev and his team influenced by the young comrades in the universities ?
Could Ozzie Osbourne , Ian Gillan and Robert Plant have contributed to the end of the Cold War ?
Ozzie 's sharp insight that "" Generals gather in their masses / Just like witches at black masses "" , is a powerful argument for an intercontinental ballistic missile treaty , like the one Gorbachev brokered in Reykjavik with Reagan .
Led Zeppelin 's infectious love of freedom ( "" Baby , I do n't want to leave you /
But when the summer comes around I got ta to ramble "" ) leads inevitably to Glasnost .
What could Deep Purple have contributed ?
Gillan looks a little like a Russian Orthodox Priest , but so do most members of outlaw motorcycle gangs .
Jon Lord 's classically trained fingers may have persuaded Russians that it was possible to embrace the new without abandoning the old .
But I suspect it was middle - period Deep Purple that proved decisive : the Coverdale years .
Once you have heard the double entendres that characterise the songs of David Coverdale , showcased on the album Come Taste the Band , dialectical materialism simply loses its savour ."
2008-03-04,"Dmitry Medvedev , Russia 's president - elect , signalled yesterday that he intends to carry on the same hardline policies towards the west as his hawkish predecessor , Vladimir Putin .
Hours after Medvedev 's landslide victory in Sunday 's presidential election - condemned as neither free nor fair by poll observers - riot police crushed an opposition demonstration in Moscow and allowed pro - Kremlin youth activists to march on the US embassy .
Meanwhile , Russia 's state - owned gas firm Gazprom , which is chaired by Medvedev , reduced supplies to Ukraine by 35 % , claiming that Kiev had failed to pay a £ 300 m bill .
Medvedev , who won more than 70 % of the vote , will formally take over the presidency from Putin in May , but has acquired some powers immediately .
Putin asked him to take charge of meetings of the presidential state council , and suggested the two leaders discuss a cabinet reshuffle .
Putin is likely to become prime minister when Medvedev assumes office .
European observers had decried the vote as unfair and a denial of the "" democratic potential "" of the country 's voters .
Britain , however , set aside misgivings in the hope of repairing relations .
In a congratulatory letter to Medvedev , the prime minister , Gordon Brown , said he looked forward to overcoming the problems dogging the two governments , including the murder of the Russian dissident Alexander Litvinenko in London in 2006 and the closure of British Council offices in St Petersburg and Yekaterinburg .
"" There 's much the United Kingdom and Russia can do together , from impressive economic ties to shared international challenges , "" he wrote .
He conspicuously did not include an invitation to London , saying only that he looked forward to meeting Medvedev at the G8 summit in Japan in July , although there is some doubt whether Putin or Medvedev will attend .
The foreign secretary , David Miliband , said Medvedev had a "" strong mandate "" .
He said his comments did not reflect approval of the elections , but a recognition that Medvedev would probably have won even if the election had been fair .
"" You can obviously draw a distinction between a free and fair election and what happened .
But if we are interested in where we go from here , it seems to me we all have an interest in how Russia turns outward , politically as well as economically , "" Miliband said .
Yesterday 's Kremlin moves appear to have sent an unambiguous message to European leaders : that there will be no softening of Russia 's confrontational stance towards the west under Medvedev .
In Moscow , police detained opposition activists who had been trying to protest against the election result .
Hundreds of police , some in riot gear , encircled Turgenev park , dragging off supporters of the opposition coalition The Other Russia .
Around 250 people were arrested .
The opposition leader and former world chess champion Garry Kasparov led a more successful anti - government rally in St Petersburg in which about 3,000 demonstrators chanted slogans including "" Down with the police state , "" "" Russia without Putin "" and "" Revolution "" .
Yesterday Golos , an independent monitoring body , said the election was tarnished by official pressure to boost voter turnout , stuffing of ballot boxes and multiple voting .
"" Russia 's new political system born in 1989 is in a state of degradation and has been thrown back to Soviet times , "" said one of its analysts , Andrei Buzin .
The Council of Europe 's parliamentary assembly dubbed the poll "" more of a plebiscite "" than a democratic election .
Vladimir Churov , the head of Russia 's central election commission , shrugged off accusations of vote rigging , saying the poll had been transparent ."
2008-03-05,"Germany and central Europe were bracing themselves for cuts in gas supplies last night when Russia stepped up a dispute with Ukraine by slashing supplies for a second day .
The display of muscle promptly followed the election of Dmitry Medvedev as new Russian president on Sunday .
He is also chairman of the giant gas monopoly , Gazprom .
The dispute , a replay of a mini - crisis two years ago that alarmed European policy - makers and highlighted their dependence on the Kremlin for keeping Europe 's radiators running through the winter , erupted on Monday when Gazprom cut supplies to Ukraine by a quarter , citing unpaid debts .
Gazprom cut supplies again last night by a further quarter , setting off alarms in Brussels and Berlin and bringing warnings of cuts to Europe by Ukraine 's pipeline operator .
Andris Piebalgs , the EU 's energy commissioner , convened an emergency meeting of the EU gas coordination group last night to "" ensure a fully coordinated EU response "" .
Brussels stressed that no European country was reporting any interruption of gas supplies which flow from Siberia and central Asia to Europe via Ukraine .
But the Ukrainian pipeline operator , Naftogaz , said it reserved "" the right to adopt adequate and asymmetric actions to defend the interests of its customers , "" indicating it could interfere with the pipelines to Europe .
While Gazprom maintained the row was purely about money , analysts noted that it erupted within hours of Medvedev being anointed Russia 's president - elect on Sunday .
Medvedev has been chairman of Gazprom for six years .
The timing suggested Medvedev was bent on showing he would be as robust as Vladimir Putin in his dealings with the west and Russia 's post - Soviet neighbours .
Europe gets a quarter of its gas from Gazprom , but the post - communist countries of central Europe are almost entirely dependent on Russia for gas , while Germany , Gazprom 's biggest customer , gets about 40 % .
Angela Merkel , the German chancellor , will travel to Moscow at the weekend to meet Medvedev .
She is certain to press the Russians on the dispute .
The Ukrainian company said Kiev was being blackmailed by the Russian behemoth . ""
The Russian side has rushed to unprecedented psychological pressure on negotiators from Naftogaz Ukraine and Ukraine as a whole , "" it said ."
2008-03-11,"Outgoing president Vladimir Putin gave a hint of how he may continue to direct the show in Russia during a surprise visit to the theatre at the weekend
The Kremlin leader and his wife Lyudmila dropped into a Moscow theatre on Sunday evening to see a production of the 19th - century comedy Woe from Wit by Alexander Griboyedov .
The audience gave them a standing ovation as they took their seats .
But after the performance Putin , who is due to hand over to his successor Dmitry Medvedev in May , went backstage and surprised the cast by giving them advice on how to interpret the play .
"" Why did you show the hero crying at the beginning ? ""
he demanded in critical remarks broadcast by state television .
"" One gets the impression of him as a weak person .
But he 's a strong man .
He withstands everything that 's thrown at him , but you showed him snivelling . ""
"" You 're absolutely right , and I 'm so glad that the actor has heard this , "" said director Rimas Tuminas .
Putin replied : "" The actor has nothing to do with it .
He 's done what you told him to do . ""
Putin also found contemporary relevance in a scene where the hero criticises fellow Russians for bending over backwards to adopt western ways .
"" This is a particular lesson for the new members of the European Union , "" he said , to nervous laughter , before adding : "" I 'm joking , I 'm joking . """
2008-03-18,"Vladimir Putin appeared to pave the way for a breakthrough deal within weeks on the Pentagon 's contentious missile shield plans yesterday when he responded positively to an offer from George Bush .
With the White House and the Kremlin preparing Putin 's swansong summit with Bush at a Nato meeting in two weeks in Romania , the outgoing Russian president appeared to soften his opposition to US plans for missile interceptors and a radar site in Poland and the Czech Republic .
The US defence secretary , Robert Gates , and the secretary of state , Condoleezza Rice , met Putin and his successor , Dmitry Medvedev , in Moscow yesterday ahead of the Nato summit in Bucharest .
Putin is to attend in one of his last foreign acts as Russia 's president .
The US and the Czechs are keen to wind up lengthy negotiations on the missile shield , but hope to strike a deal with Moscow , while the Poles remain unconvinced , looking for stronger American security guarantees and a new air defence system to protect them from Russian threats .
It was not clear what Bush offered the Russians in a letter to Putin that softened Moscow 's opposition .
But US officials said there was nothing new .
The Pentagon insists the shield 's facilities are aimed at Iran , while Moscow maintains they could be directed at Russia 's nuclear arsenal .
Washington has previously sought to allay Moscow 's concerns by offering Russia inspections of the sites in Poland and the Czech Republic , suggesting Russia 's participation in the shield , and delaying the new system 's operability pending Iranian missile advances .
But according to Nato and European officials , the Russians are looking to broaden the international security agenda with the US beyond the missile shield by reviving an arms control dialogue and offering the west logistical and transport help for the Nato effort in Afghanistan .
All of this is likely to be broached at the Nato summit .
Despite the apparent race to conclude a missile shield pact , Poland remains the trickiest partner .
The Poles are worried about Russia , not Iran , and are pressing Washington for beefed - up defences , which , in turn , will increase Russian opposition .
Officials in central Europe say the entire package could yet unravel and that Washington 's fallback position would be to deploy the interceptor rockets slated for Polish silos at sea , or in the UK ."
2008-03-25,"And to think , Financial Times editor Lionel Barber 's interview with Russian president elect Dmitry Medvedev was going so well until the very last question , when the FT man shoehorned in a plug for the FT.com website .
"" I very much hope I can persuade you to look at FT.com in the morning , "" Barber tells him .
Medvedev , looking only slightly non - plussed , replies : "" I do , occasionally . ""
Probably not one for the next FT ad campaign , then . ""
Dmitry Medvedev reads it ... occasionally . ""
Follow the link above to see for yourself after about four minutes in the fourth and final part of Barber 's interview ."
2008-03-25,"Nato membership for Ukraine and Georgia could threaten European security and undermine attempts to improve transatlantic relations , the Russian president - elect warned today .
Dmitry Medvedev , who was elected earlier this month and will take office in May , signalled that , like his predecessor , Vladimir Putin , he would draw a line in the sand at two of Russia 's neighbours joining the west 's military alliance .
"" We are not happy about the situation around Georgia and Ukraine , "" Medvedev said in an interview with the Financial Times .
"" We consider it extremely troublesome for the existing structure of European security .
No state can be pleased about having representatives of a military bloc to which it does not belong coming close to its borders .
"" Ukraine 's pro - western president , Viktor Yushchenko , who came to office in January 2005 in the so - called Orange revolution , has made Nato membership a priority for his former Soviet country of 47 million people .
Russia has already warned Ukraine of deteriorating relations should it join Nato 's membership action plan , a stepping stone towards full membership .
Medvedev said there was little public enthusiasm in Ukraine for joining Nato , despite Yushchenko 's eagerness .
The Georgian public is largely in favour , but Nato countries have expressed concern at the state of emergency imposed there in December to end opposition protests .
Britain said it recognised the aspirations of Georgia and Ukraine to join Nato , but said they had to meet various criteria , including on human rights and democratic processes .
"" We keep the door open to Nato expansion to countries such as Georgia and Ukraine , "" said a Foreign Office spokesman , adding that each application would be treated on its merits .
Nato , a military alliance created in 1949 to contain the then Soviet Union , has steadily expanded eastwards since the Soviet break - up in 1991 .
Seven eastern European countries - Bulgaria , Estonia , Latvia , Lithuania , Romania , Slovakia and Slovenia - joined Nato in March 2004 .
Nato is currently engaged in its most important operation since its creation through the International Security Assistance Force ( Isaf ) in Afghanistan , where it is trying to prop up the government of Hamid Karzai against a reinvigorated Taliban .
The Nato aspirations of Ukraine and Georgia are expected to be a thorny subject at the alliance 's summit in Bucharest , Romania , next week .
Some of Nato 's 26 member states , including heavyweights such as France and Germany , as well as Belgium , Luxembourg , the Netherlands and Spain , have expressed reservations about the alliance 's eastward expansion .
Luxembourg 's foreign minister , Jean Asselborn , recently said the EU wanted to start on a fresh footing with Russia now that it was about to get a new leader after Putin .
In his FT interview , Medvedev , who has a legal background , also spoke about the importance of the rule of law .
Outlining a three - point plan , Medvedev said the first step was to assert the law 's supremacy over executive power and individual actions , the second was to create a "" new attitude to the law "" and the third was to create an effective courts system by assuring the judiciary 's independence and prestige ."
2008-04-07,"Vladimir Putin was yesterday offered the leadership of Russia 's dominant political party , United Russia , when he gives up the presidency and becomes prime minister in May.
Putin has yet to respond to the offer but analysts said that if he agreed , the party leadership would considerably strengthen his position in relation to his successor , Dmitry Medvedev , who will be inaugurated on May 7 .
The next day the State Duma , the lower house of parliament , will meet to endorse Putin 's appointment as prime minister , a subordinate job he has agreed to take because he says Russia needs stability and continuity .
If he were to lead the pro - Kremlin party , which commands a 315-seat majority in the 450-seat assembly , he would be insured against any possible attempt by Medvedev , 42 , to sack him should their partnership sour in future .
Although the president hires and fires the prime minister , parliament must give its approval .
Parliament can also impeach the president .
The suggestion that Putin should head United Russia , an artificial creation with only one policy , to support the Kremlin , was made by its party leader , Boris Gryzlov , at a news conference . ""
If Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin headed United Russia , it would be the very best option .
Such a proposal will probably be made at our congress [ on April 14 ] .
"" Up to now , Putin has distanced himself from the party .
But analyst Andrei Ryabov of the Carnegie Centre said it would be a "" logical step "" for Putin to become party leader , as he needed to bolster his position in a system that gave most power to the president . ""
As prime minister he will need more power than the constitution allows him , just in case , "" he said .
Independent political analyst Alexander Tsipko said : "" In my opinion , Putin remains the main political figure in Russia .
United Russia could play an important role in helping him to keep power .
It could be an important political instrument in case of unforeseen circumstances .
"" Putin , who respected the letter of the constitution by declining to run for a third presidential term , has made it clear that he will be entrusting foreign affairs to Medvedev , who will represent Russia at this year 's G8 summit ."
2008-04-20,"Ahead of last month 's presidential election in Russia there was widespread suspicion that the poll was fixed in advance .
Several days before the vote , insiders were even able to give accurate figures for just how big a share of the vote Dmitry Medvedev would win .
Privately , even the Kremlin 's most ardent supporters conceded that the presidential election - like December 's parliamentary elections in Russia - would see widespread use of "" administrative resources "" , or put more simply , fraud .
Now there appears to be proof .
On Monday , the physicist and computer expert Sergei Shpilkin posted his analysis of the official results taken from the website of Russia 's central elections committee .
As reported by the Moscow Times , Shpilkin found some strange anamolies .
A disproportionate number of polling stations returned round numbers - numbers ending in a zero or a five - for both voter turnout and Medvedev 's percentage share .
In a normal election , the distribution of voting is shaped like a bell curve , with the median and most popular value at the top .
In Russia 's election the distribution was normal until the figures reached 60 % .
After that , however , the curve resembled - as the Moscow Times put it - "" shark 's teeth "" - with spikes on multiples of five .
In other words , local election officials had been told in advance what percentages to "" deliver "" for Medvedev , and for how many people needed to "" vote "" .
In some places this blatant ballot - rigging appears to have backfired : at a polling station in the Dagestani town of Kizilyurt , for example , 766 people "" voted "" , but not one of them voted for Medvedev .
Instead , 95 % of residents were said to have voted for Andrey Bogdanov - a pro - Kremlin independent who polled a miserable 1.3 % of the vote nationally , compared with 70.3 % for Medvedev , Vladimir Putin 's handpicked successor .
Apparently , gormless local election workers stuffed the wrong ballot papers into the box .
All of this confirms that fraudulent elections have now become an established part of Russian political life - in the words of the Soviet dissident Sergei Kovalev , who wrote an open letter to Vladimir Putin just before the March 2 poll , "" a tasteless farce played out by untalented directors on the entire boundless Russian stage "" .
Putin , meanwhile , who steps down as president on May 7 , has done his best to cover up such shenanigans .
In December 's parliamentary elections , 99 % of Chechens voted for Putin 's United Russia party , with turnout in Chechnya also put at an astonishing 99 % .
Asked by a journalist from Le Figaro about these curious results , Putin described them as "" perfectly objective "" .
According to Shpilkin , an election analyst at the Institute for Applied Economics , only 56 % of Russians actually voted last month - compared to the official Kremlin figure of 69.7 % .
Additionally , 14.8 m out of the 52.5 m votes cast for Medvedev were bogus , meaning that Medvedev 's real support from Russia 's 100-million strong electorate is around one - third - not the massive mandate the Kremlin likes to claim .
Given that , who can blame Medvedev for feeling slightly anxious when he takes over next month as Russia 's third post - Soviet leader .
It seems that the real power will continue to reside with Vladimir Putin , who becomes prime minister , swapping the Kremlin for Moscow 's White House , and who earlier this week took over as chairman of United Russia , the dominant party .
Medvedev 's election victory was clearly much smaller than claimed - despite his endorsement by Putin , and despite relentless and favourable coverage from Kremlin - controlled television .
Given that he was going to win anyway , one wonders why the Kremlin went to so much trouble to manicure his victory ."
2008-05-03,""" We are the opposition , "" declared former chess world champion and leading member of the anti - Kremlin Other Russia coalition Garry Kasparov in a recent Russian newspaper article .
If this is the case , then it has escaped the attention of some quite important people - the Russians .
Since the whitewash of Dmitry Medvedev 's election victory in March , Russian liberals have been scratching their heads , trying to work out whether there is an opposition or not and , if not , when and how one will appear .
The state of the opposition in Russia can be summed up by a friend 's attitude to the presidential elections last month .
"" I 'm not going to vote , "" she told me .
"" I 'm going ice - skating instead . ""
My friend , an intelligent 20-something who works for a western firm , is apathetic , even antagonistic towards Vladimir Putin .
Nevertheless , her reason for not voting was the most frequently heard in the run - up to the elections : "" There is no one to vote for . ""
And this is understandable .
The candidates were Kremlin - backed Dmitry Medvedev , Kremlin - supporting Communist Party leader Gennady Zyuganov , the ( allegedly Kremlin - sponsored ) nationalist Vladimir Zhirinovsky and the unknown Democratic Party of Russia leader Andrei Bogdanov ( widely thought to have been put on the ballot by the Kremlin for show and to ensure the contest took place ) .
There was no truly anti - Kremlin candidate on the ballot paper - former Prime Minister Mikhail Kasyanov was barred from taking part after some of the two million required signatures he collected were described by the Central Election Commission as forgeries ; Kasparov accused the authorities of preventing his party from holding a meeting of sufficient size to qualify for the election .
Even so , the authorities ' crackdown on opposition is , interestingly , only part of the story .
The problem does not only lie in their lack of a platform to present their politics - their personalities and their politics simply give them no chance of winning a large base of popular support .
The 1990s , seen by many in the west as Russia 's gloriously free years of democratic flowering , are seen in a different light here .
Boris Yeltsin , revered in the west , is viewed mainly with dislike , or even revulsion .
He presided over what is widely associated with the handing over of state resources to the oligarchs , the financial crash of 1998 , and a "" free "" media controlled by said oligarchs .
This is the historical view endlessly pedalled by the Kremlin , but its resonance with Russians suggests it tallies , at least to some extent , with their experience .
Consider Mikhail Kasyanov , known to all Russians as "" Misha two percent "" for the alleged kickback he got from any deal which required his signature during his reign as prime minister from 2000 to 2004 and the last member of the government with connections to Yeltsin .
Consider Nikita Belykh , leader of the Union of Right Forces , a party which can not escape the legacy of the "" young reformers "" of the 1990s - Anatoly Chubais , Yegor Gaidar and Boris Nemtsov - who are blamed for the financial chaos of the Yeltsin years as capitalism was introduced by "" shock therapy "" .
Consider Grigory Yavlinsky , leader of the liberal Yabloko party , who is known for his noble democratic principles but whose support has been in decline since the ' 90s .
Yavlinsky is the clearest example of the problem which has befallen many opposition politicians - their time has passed and people have stopped expecting anything from them .
Kasparov is a rare example of someone not connected to the politics of the 1990s , but his problems lie elsewhere .
In his article in the liberal Novaya Gazeta newspaper , Kasparov laid out the reasons why his party are the real opposition : they are not represented in the State Duma , they are never on TV , they have no ties to the Kremlin and they did not take part in the presidential elections .
In short , they do not take part in politics .
This attitude cements the most recognisable image of Kasparov : smiling and raising a hand in mock victory when he is arrested at protest marches .
He is not a serious politician , but a showman .
He does not have a clear explanation as to how a "" democratic "" leader would be any more successful in combatting the large - scale corruption and the mafia which control Russian business .
Post - Soviet Russia is not a tabula rasa on which a western - style democracy can be built .
How could he actually achieve this ?
So Russian politics is at an impasse .
Putin receives much popular support , but his politics have failed to energise and inspire the Russian people as a whole .
There is a feeling that "" we are doing OK , so let 's leave things as they are and enjoy a bit of stability "" .
Russians have got used to adapting to a repressive regime , so the feeling that they ca n't change things , which to us in the west is depressing , leads them to seek consolation by absorbing themselves in the social lives that they have been deprived of for so long .
Dispiriting it may be , but it seems to me that a plausible opposition movement will only gain support if the oil price drops significantly or the problems with inflation reach crisis point .
Only then , if the current political system proves itself incapable of dealing with the country 's problems and giving people enough not to want change , will Russians have sufficient impetus to put their ice - skates away and fight for change ."
2008-05-05,"As Dmitry Medvedev waits in the wings for his inauguration on May 7 , the west is examining his every word , eager for the slightest sign that Russia 's new president will be more "" reasonable "" and easier to deal with than Vladimir Putin , the man who got him elected .
If one is selective with the evidence , a semi - reasonable case can be built for those desperate enough to believe it .
Medvedev was in his 20s when the Soviet Union broke up , and thus is less "" contaminated "" by a Soviet mentality .
He is a fluent English speaker who does not have a secret - service background and has been dealing with the west for almost a decade as the Russian energy industry 's leading figure .
Moreover , he is a lawyer by training - presumably instilling in him at least some respect for the rule of law - and his pronouncements and interviews thus far have been largely moderate , even liberal .
Unfortunately , however , words mean almost nothing in such a Byzantine country .
In fact , Medvedev will be Russia 's most malleable leader since Tsar Nicholas II .
While Medvedev 's liberal instincts are debatable , the forces arrayed against him not in doubt are : the Sechin clan , the Cherkessov clan , the siloviki ( stalwarts of the military and security services ) , his rivals whom he beat to the top job , and of course , his predecessor and mentor , Putin .
The irony is that Medvedev has almost no room for manoeuvre , despite holding one of the most powerful presidencies in the world .
His popularity has been bestowed , not earned , so it can be taken away as easily as it was given .
For all his semi - encouraging talk , Medvedev has stressed continuity over change , and his references to Putin 's presidency have been as reverential as he has been obedient .
He was chosen for his unquestioning loyalty , and it is difficult to envisage Putin playing second fiddle to a man who has been his underling for 18 years .
Moreover , Medvedev , who has been at the helm of the state - owned gas giant Gazprom for the last six years , is likely to be constrained in a more prosaic way .
Given Gazprom 's record of opacity while Medvedev 's was in charge , the existence of kompromat ( compromising material ) , used as blackmail against him to keep his energy policy in line and others ' vested interests safe , is highly likely .
Gazprom itself will continue to operate as a non - commercial actor .
Despite serious problems with extraction , production and depletion ( production at three of Russia 's four major fields is already declining ) , the propensity to use hydrocarbon resources as a geo - strategic weapon trumps economics .
And , with the resource boom fuelling Russia 's self - proclaimed return to international influence , the Kremlin will continue to exploit its successful strategy of playing one European country off against another , aided by the EU 's lack of a coherent Russia strategy and a common energy policy .
The widespread misconception that Europe is massively dependent on Russian oil and gas explains its frequent appeasement .
But Russia needs the revenue at least as much as Europe needs the energy .
Nearly all oil pipelines in the region head west .
While Europe accounts for 90 % of Russia ' gas exports , Europe 's gas imports are only 60 % Russian .
Europe is seeking to diversify supply , and Russia its demand - though neither is doing so very successfully .
Perhaps the most worrying prospect is that Medvedev could learn all of Putin 's bad habits and none of his good ones . ""
Putinism "" is predicated on the need for an enemy , and that enemy , at least since 2003 , is the west .
Medvedev is unlikely to try to change course .
He could , however , smooth over some of the rougher edges of Putin 's energy policy - a small concession here , a new deal there - but only at the fringes .
In that case , the west will need to be ever more vigilant .
Putin was a wolf , but at least he - unlike Medvedev - dressed the part .
Foreign investors and EU politicians may not see through Medvedev 's benign disguise - or may choose not to .
It 's no use complaining about Russia 's strategic bullying when we are not being strategic ourselves .
The west ca n't change Russia 's behaviour with persuasion , so it must try to use its leverage : make the Nabucco pipeline bypassing Russia a reality , build LNG terminals , include energy in the EU 's common foreign and security policy , diversify supply , and screen companies seeking capital in London 's stock exchange more carefully .
Our energy security is in our own hands , not Russia 's .
In association with Project Syndicate , 2008 ."
2008-05-05,"After several years of rising tension , hopes are being raised across Europe that tomorrow 's inauguration of Dmitry Medvedev as the new president of Russia will mark a significant improvement in relations .
The optimistic scenario is that Medvedev will turn out to be a liberal who uses his predecessor 's legacy of revived national self - confidence to usher in an era of democratic reform and constructive diplomacy from a position of strength .
A more realistic prognosis is that Putin has created an authoritarian regime too corrupted by power to change , except reluctantly and under pressure of circumstance .
Medvedev owes his position to the managed part of Putin 's "" managed democracy "" and is not about to turn on the system that created him .
Even if he wanted to , he lacks the independent power base to try .
He will enjoy the title and trappings of office , but Putin will remain Russia 's de facto national leader .
As prime minister - elect and leader of a party controlling two - thirds of the Duma , he is already unsackable .
But the real source of power is his ability to deliver the "" men in epaulets "" , the securocrats that have come to dominate the state office under his leadership .
We can be sure that Putin will work hard to keep it that way .
After all , he would n't want to end up in London fighting an extradition demand from one of his successors .
He has , nevertheless , chosen a good moment to step out of the limelight , not least because the fragility of his achievement in orchestrating Russia 's national revival is about to become apparent .
The nation 's demographic profile remains awful , with average male life expectancy at 59 and a population set to shrink by up to a third over the next four decades .
For all the bombastic talk about Russia 's return to the top table of world power , Putin still has n't found a way to stop large numbers of Russian men drinking themselves into an early grave .
A more immediate problem , and one entirely of Putin 's own creation , is the looming crisis in the Russian energy sector , newly restored to state control by means of intimidation and outright illegality .
Productive enterprises have been forcibly taken over by inefficient state companies that have failed to invest in replacement production and will soon struggle to meet domestic demand , let alone export commitments .
This means that even if energy prices remain high , the foreign earnings that have boosted Russian growth could start to dwindle unless corrective action is taken soon .
One way the Russian government plans to do this is to reduce consumption by raising domestic energy prices now that elections are safely out of the way .
Whether this can be done to the level required without provoking a political backlash is open to doubt .
In a country of widening inequality and rising inflation , cheap gas is an important plank of social welfare .
As Putin found when he tried to monetise pensioner benefits three years ago , the Russian people are capable of taking to the streets when their material security is threatened .
A popular protest movement that became a serious opposition would soon start to ask awkward questions about the kind of regime Putin has created and the extent of its mismanagement and abuse of national resources .
Far from "" liquidating the oligarchs as a class "" , Putin has simply redistributed wealth from the Yeltsin "" family "" to his own cabal .
This new oligarchy may conceal its identity behind public office , but it is motivated by the same desire for self - enrichment .
Harsher economic times ahead would lay that bitter truth bare for the Russian people to see .
Unfortunately , there is no guarantee that this opposition would assume a liberal and democratic character .
A population fed on anti - foreigner paranoia and chauvinist revivalism could easily take a different course .
Either way , strong or weak , Russia represents a foreign policy challenge Europe can not ignore .
Unfortunately , its recent record in dealing with Moscow is one of lamentable weakness and division , allowing Russia to dictate terms to a block three and a half times its size .
With the EU and Russia due to open negotiations on a new cooperation and free trade agreement in the summer , there is an opportunity to restore balance by setting out a clear choice .
Russia can be a close and trusted partner if it is prepared to respect the multilateral rules and democratic standards it has signed up to .
But if it continues to use authoritarian and coercive methods at home and abroad , the EU should seek to immunise itself from their effects .
Terms of access to the single market would be more restricted ; Russia would no longer be treated as a member of the democratic club and an automatic member of its institutions ; and concerted efforts would be made to reduce dependence on Russian energy .
One test of EU resolve will be how it handles the issue of the Energy Charter Treaty , one of a growing list of binding international instruments Russia is unilaterally defying .
It would certainly be perverse to sign a generous trade pact with a county that is breaking the rules at our expense by adopting monopolistic policies and using energy supplies as a weapon against its neighbours .
If Russia wants free trade , then it must honour its promise to build an energy relationship based on fair commercial principles instead of power politics .
If it wants to secure the right of Gazprom to buy up major European energy companies , it must open its own market on a reciprocal basis and stop expropriating private investments .
Apart from anything else , this would be greatly to Russia 's own advantage in helping to deal with its internal problems .
The politicisation of energy supply is proving to be self - defeating because it is destroying trust and deterring the investment Russia needs to maintain production and growth .
The Putin model of corrupt authoritarianism will not enable Russia to address its social and economic problems and establish its long - term revival .
The sooner it can develop a relationship with the EU around principles of liberal multilateralism and economic openness , the better for both .
It may be that a domestic energy crisis persuades Medvedev and Putin of this truth and forces them to change for reasons of pure self - interest .
There is certainly evidence that they are capable of thinking pragmatically in that way .
It was the combination of high energy prices and the failure of European governments to push back against Russia 's authoritarian lurch that encouraged Putin to drop cooperative engagement in favour of coercive diplomacy .
It is only by setting firm limits now and making it clear that Russia stands to lose from continuing down its current path that the EU can secure the fresh start it wants .

2008-05-07,"Dmitry Medvedev today became Russia 's new president and the country 's third post - Soviet leader during a glittering ceremony at the Kremlin which – formally at least – brought down the curtain on Vladimir Putin 's eight tumultuous years in power .
Standing next to Putin , the outgoing president , Medvedev swore on oath on Russia 's constitution .
He then delivered a speech promising to improve the lives of ordinary Russians , fight corruption and end the country 's "" legal nihilism "" .
He said : "" I 'm going to pay special attention to the fundamental role of the law .
We must achieve a true respect in law , and overcome the legal nihilism , which is hampering modern development . ""
He also promised to make life "" comfortable , confident and secure "" for ordinary Russians .
Medvedev also paid warm tribute to his predecessor .
He is expected to nominate Putin tomorrow as Russia 's new prime minister and head of the government .
"" I would like to thank Vladimir Putin for his personal support , which I have felt constantly , "" he said .
Today 's carefully choreographed ceremony left little doubt that Putin and Medvev are likely to run Russia as a tandem – with Putin wielding considerable influence , especially behind the scenes , from his new prime ministerial office in Russia 's White House .
Putin arrived first at the Kremlin palace .
He strolled down a long red carpet in front of 2,400 dignitaries , diplomats , and Russia 's patriarch Alexey II .
Medvedev turned up next – a diminutive figure , who as he entered the Kremlin 's vast gold Andreyevsky Hall nervously scanned his feet .
Afterwards both men stood together side by side in the Kremlin 's cold , blustery palace courtyard as a 31-gun salute boomed cross the capital .
Aged just 42 , and the youngest Russian leader for well over a century , Medvedev now faces a formidable series of problems – both at home and abroad .
Early challenges include dealing with Russia 's rampant inflation – currently running at at least 12 % .
He also has to tackle growing popular dissatisfaction at rising food and utility prices , and Russia continuing demographic crisis .
Medvedev also has several foreign policy problems in his in - tray .
He has to decide what to do about the breakaway region of Abkhazia , where Russia is embroiled in a military standoff with Georgia , and negotiate a new co - operation and partnership agreement with the European Union .
Medvevev has announced that his first foreign trip will be to China and Kazakhstan .
But one of his early tasks will be to try and establish good relations with the next president of the United States – and improve Moscow 's fractious relationship with Washington .
Today experts said that arguably Medvedev 's biggest challenge would be to prevent the Kremlin 's powerful siloviki , or military / intelligence clan from moving against him .
Unlike Putin , Medvedev – a former St Petersburg lawyer – was never in the KGB , whose ex - members dominate the top echelons of Russia 's government and bureaucracy . ""
He has got enough problems to make his hair go grey , "" Sam Greene , an expert at the Moscow Carnegie Centre said today .
Asked who Russia 's real leader would be , he said : "" We have to assume the status quo remains in place , with Putin as the person in the elite whom everyone calls . ""
This regime has thrived on flexibility and informal power relations .
I 've got no reason to think this is going to change in the future .
The thing that made Putin different from Boris Yeltsin is his ability to mediate between different factions within the elite .
This is n't something codified in the constitution , and it ca n't easily be passed to Medvede , "" he said .
Political analysts are divided as to whether Putin intends to come back as president in 2012 , or gradually fade away from politics .
Under Russia 's constitution , Putin who took over from Boris Yeltsin in 2000 was obliged to step down as president .
But there is nothing to stop him returning after a four - year gap .
Today Putin strongly hinted that he stuck to the law – despite calls from powerful factions inside the Kremlin for him to amend the constitution and serve a third term as president .
"" I made a commitment to work openly and honestly , to faithfully serve the people and the state .
And I did not violate my promise , "" he said in a brief address .
Medvedev 's promise , meanwhile , to turn Russia into a law - based society is an intriguing one .
Yesterday , the authorities banned an anti - Kremlin opposition rally in Moscow by supporters of The Other Russia movement , despite the constitution guaranteeing the right to assembly .
One man was arrested and bundled into a police van after trying to unfurl a banner .
"" Our pensions are now 40 times less than what MPs earn .
We have to survive on 4,000 roubles ( £ 88 ) a month , "" Zoya Vasilyevna , a 77-year - old retired teacher , complained at the rally .
"" It was my generation who defended this country in the war , but now these bastards have stolen all the resources . ""
Putin only likes billionaires .
He 's not interested in us , "" she said ."
2008-05-08,"Vladimir Putin was today confirmed as Russia 's new prime minister by the country 's lower house of parliament in a move that formalises his power - sharing role with the new president Dmitry Medvedev .
Deputies in Russia 's state duma voted overwhelmingly to support Putin 's candidacy – by 392 to 56 votes .
Only the communists voted against .
MP 's from Putin 's United Russia party then led a standing ovation .
Today 's widely anticipated move follows the inauguration yesterday of 42-year - old Medvedev – Putin 's close ally - as Russia 's third post - Soviet leader .
Immediately after today 's vote Medevev said he would pass a decree formally naming Putin as head of Russia 's new government .
Both men are now expected to run Russia in a tandem , with Putin wielding considerable influence from the prime minister 's office in Russia 's White House .
This morning both men sat side by side in the packed duma , further confirming Russia 's new political dynamic .
In a wide - ranging address to MPs , Putin this morning set out the new government 's priorities .
He said Russia was determined to overtake Britain as the world 's sixth leading economy later this year .
His government would also tackle the country 's myriad economic problems – including its "" alarming "" inflation rate , Putin said .
He also promised to persuade Russian to smoke and drink less – a big task .
"" We need an information campaign to advocate healthy living , "" he declared .
Before the vote , Medvedev told the duma he was proposing Putin for the prime minister 's job , adding that "" Vladimir Vladimirovich "" needed no introduction .
"" I think nobody doubts that our tandem , our co - operation will only strengthen , "" Medvedev said .
Putin would "" play a key role "" in implementing policy , he said .
Medvedev also lauded Putin 's hawkish policies towards the west during his eight years as president .
"" We know that great changes have taken place in respect of Russia 's role on the international stage .
Russia is once again internationally respected , "" he said .
Political analysts are not clear as to whether Putin intends to return as president in 2012 - after serving a four - year stint as prime minister .
They agree , however , that he is likely to remain the dominant figure in Russian politics , with Medvedev a junior partner .
Critics say the show of solidarity masks fears that Putin has navigated Russia into a dangerous period of political uncertainty , with two centres of power taking shape in a potentially debilitating and divisive arrangement .
Under the constitution , the prime minister temporarily replaces a president who dies or is incapacitated .
Putin , 55 , a longtime KGB officer , served as prime minister for five months in 1999 under Boris Yeltsin , who stepped down unexpectedly on December 31 of that year and handed him the presidency .
Putin was elected to his first term three months later ."

· Another delegate at the stormy plenary session held in Berlin 's Reichstag was Russia 's hawkish ambassador to Nato , Dmitry Rogozin .
Rogozin recently suggested that it was Nato who shot down a Georgian spy drone flying over the breakaway region of Abkhazia - despite the fact that video footage shows a Russian MiG blowing it up .
Rogozin was also unamused by the Medvedev Pooh - bear quip .
( "" Medved "" in Russian means bear . )
"" One thing any hunter knows is it is dangerous to enter the lair of the bear , "" Rogozin growled . ·
Good news today for Russia 's 893,631 prisoners .
Traditionally , prison inmates have spent their time engaged in gulag - style pastimes such as knitting woolly hats .
Now , however , the Russian government has approved a list of 90 occupations that Russian felons can do while serving time .
Intriguingly , these include hunting and fishing .
The regulations also say that prisoners can open "" small electrical factories "" , should the wish seize them , or "" set up recruitment agencies "" .
And they can flog "" wholesale tobacco "" .
It 's not clear how inmates are allowed to do all of this without escaping .
But it clearly beats digging canals in Russia 's frozen north .
· Over in Moscow 's Yakutia Institute there was delight yesterday following a new survey that suggests the indigenous inhabitants of Siberia are closely related to Orkney islanders .
A study by scientists from the University of Oxford and University College Cork tells that reindeer hunters from Yakutia in Siberia have the same genetic makeup as their Orkney cousins .
How Orcadians may have travelled to Siberia is still a mystery .
( The survey also confirms that the first humans wandered out of Africa 50,000 years ago . )
"" This is good news , "" Prof Igor Rastvortsev , the institute 's pro - vice chancellor , says .
"" We are always glad to know our origins , and I 've heard of Orkney . "" · Further proof that Andrei Lugovoi is a secret Anglophile .
The former KGB agent - who was charged last year with the murder of Alexander Litvinenko - recently admitted that he likes the Sherlock Holmes stories .
Lugovoi follows the English Premier League , and watched last week 's rain - sodden Champions League final in Moscow between Manchester United and Chelsea .
Now it turns out Lugovoi is a fan of British education .
He sends his nine - year - old son to one of Moscow 's British - run Russian schools .
And while his son gets extra English lessons , his older teenage daughter has studied hotel management in Cambridge .
· Interesting times in Ukraine .
Ever since the 2004 orange revolution , Ukraine has been in a state of near - permanent political crisis .
Now , though , one of Ukraine 's leading oligarchs has come up with a solution to end the feud between the country 's Russian - speaking orthodox east and the Ukrainian - speaking Catholic west - he 's sent for Paul McCartney .
Apparently inspired by McCartney 's hit Pipes of Peace , Victor Pinchuk has organised a free concert in Kiev 's Independence Square on June 14 starring Macca .
Pinchuk , a former lab technician , who is worth £ 1.5bn and owns an £ 80 m home in London , is even flying in VIP guests .
Expect harmony to break out soon between Ukraine and next - door Russia .

2008-06-26,"Dmitry Medvedev , Russia 's president , flew into Siberia last night for his international debut - a summit with EU leaders .
The EU wants to reach a deal with the Kremlin on legally binding strategic pact .
But negotiations , which start formally today in the booming oil town of Khanty - Mansiisk , could drag on for years , analysts predict .
Russia favours a concise format , but the EU wants a comprehensive pact to lay out details of cooperation in areas such as energy , justice and security .
Brussels will hope that Medvedev adopts a more conciliatory tone than his predecessor , Vladimir Putin , now prime minister , who Russian officials said will not attend .
Fyodor Lukyanov , editor - in - chief of Russia in Global Affairs , said Putin 's absence is likely to make negotiations easier .
"" Medvedev wo n't use the same ugly metaphors that Putin did .
This is n't insignificant , "" he said .
But Russia was less enthusiastic about rebuilding its troubled relations with the EU , he suggested .
There are several areas of disagreement .
The EU wants Moscow to ratify the EU 's energy charter , which would give European energy producers access to Russia 's pipelines .
In turn Moscow accuses Brussels of barring access to EU markets .
Yesterday Benita Ferrero - Waldner , the EU commissioner for external affairs , said talks would be tough , but a "" negotiated solution "" was possible .
The choice of summit venue is symbolic - reminding Europeans of their dependence on Russia 's energy reserves .
The Khanty - Mansiisk region , 1,500 miles east of Moscow , produces almost two - thirds of the country 's oil . ""
With the oil price sky - rocketing Russia seems to have the EU over a barrel , "" said one western diplomat .
"" But it is n't quite as simple as that .
We have something they want - a market .
The oil is n't any use to them stuck in the ground . """
2008-06-27,"For Europe 's top officials , there was a pleasant surprise today .
Arriving at their summit hotel , deep in the noiseless Siberian forest , EU bureaucrats found a signed gift from their host Dmitry Medvedev .
Russia 's new president had given the EU 's top brass a book of his amateur photographs .
The snaps included Italian cherubs , a rowing boat bobbing on a dappled turquoise lake , ducks , and several sensitive landscapes . ""
He 's got a cultural and aesthetic side , "" one impressed EU official remarked . ""
He 's clearly got a sense of humour .
He 's a nice regular guy .
He 's rather impressive . ""
Today marked Medvedev 's major international debut .
Seven weeks after taking over from Vladimir Putin , Medvedev hosted talks between the EU and Russia on a new partnership and cooperation agreement .
The contrast between the new man in the Kremlin and "" his judo - loving predecessor "" – as one EU official put it – was overwhelming .
It also went some way towards answering the question : who is Medvedev ?
Putin used summits to demonstrate his gift for sardonic repartee .
Often , he went further – memorably clobbering the US during an infamous speech in Munich last year .
He also regularly hinted that Russia might nuke Europe .
Medvedev , by contrast , was all smiles this afternoon - chatting in the Siberian sunshine with the European commission president , José Manuel Barroso .
He even had a friendly word for Peter Mandelson , the EU 's trade commissioner .
"" I 'm not going to make any comparisons , "" Barroso said , asked if he preferred dealing with Medvedev to Putin .
Speaking at a press conference after this morning 's talks , which formally opened negotiations on a new EU - Russia deal , Barroso paid tribute to the Kremlin 's youthful 42-year - old boss .
His talks with Medvedev had taken place in an "" open , relaxed and very constructive atmosphere , "" he said , telling Russia 's president fondly : "" I just wanted you to know that . ""
Javier Solana , the EU 's foreign policy representative , was similarly gushing .
"" We have found a wavelength , "" Solana said , recalling his happy dinner with Medvedev last night , shortly before Spain – his side - beat Russia 3 - 0 in their Euro 2008 semi - final .
However , it is too early to say whether Medvedev means a fresh start to the EU 's frequently troubled relations with Russia .
So far there is n't much evidence to suggest that the Medvedev era is substantively different from the Putin one .
Today , Medvevev launched a Putin - like attack on Estonia and Lithuania – accusing them of discriminating against Russian speakers .
The two EU Baltic states were guilty of glorifying fascism , he said , after Lithuania passed a new law last week banning Soviet symbols . ""
Victory over fascism is our common heritage .
Attempts to desecrate the memory of those who fought for freedom are absolutely unacceptable , "" Medevedev said .
US plans to build a missile defence shield in Europe were "" dangerous "" , he added .
Putin , of course , is still around .
Russia 's new prime minister may not actually have attended yesterday 's summit , held in the pleasant western Siberian oil town of Khanty - Mansiisk , 1,500 miles east of Moscow .
But he hovered over the proceedings like a mocking ghost .
"" Putin had a sense of humour but only when he was making the jokes , "" one EU official said , recalling previous bad - natured EU - Russia meetings . ""
His humour was slightly more cynical , slightly more cruel [ than Medvedev 's ] .
It was humour at other people 's expense . ""
Today 's negotiations are designed to draw up a new wide - ranging and legally binding partnership deal between the EU and Russia .
Talks were scheduled to begin in 2006 , but were delayed because of Russia 's rows with Poland and Lithuania .
Both sides have so far failed to agree on the format of the negotiations – with Russia favouring a concise pact .
The EU wants a more comprehensive deal , spelling out details in key ' sectoral ' areas including energy and justice .
Still , with Medvedev at the helm they might just get there .

2008-07-01,"The future of BP in Russia was in doubt last night after its joint oil venture TNK - BP confirmed that its chief executive , Bob Dudley , and all international staff would have to leave Russia this month .
The decision by Moscow officials not to renew Dudley 's visa follows a bitter battle between BP and its Russian partners that could see a group of oligarchs led by Mikhail Fridman and Viktor Vekselberg seize operational control of TNK - BP .
Gordon Brown is expected to raise the issue in wider talks on energy security when he meets the new Russian president , Dmitry Medvedev , at the G8 summit in Japan next week .
Brown 's predecessor had a row with Vladimir Putin at the last G8 summit and Anglo - Russian relations have been deteriorating since then .
With BP struggling to rebuild a reputation hit by problems in the US and TNK - BP making up a quarter of its stagnating output , the British firm can ill afford to lose its influence and possible ownership of such vital assets .
"" We ca n't say the Russian half has won but they are close to winning , "" said Konstantin Cherepanov , an analyst with the Moscow brokerage KIT Finance .
The Russian shareholders denied having anything to do with BP 's visa woes but most Kremlin - watchers are in no doubt that BP 's Russian partners have used state resources to put pressure on BP .
BP described the visa ruling as "" utterly disgraceful "" .
A company spokesman in London said : "" We are very disappointed to see that many of the expatriate staff working in TNK - BP will have to leave Russia and may not be able to return .
The loss of these staff will definitely damage TNK - BP , its performance and , by extension , the performance of the Russian oil sector .
"" We are both surprised and disappointed that TNK - BP management 's properly authorised request has been denied and that a process which the company has gone through without problems in previous years has been interfered with by two shareholders in the company 's management , acting without authority in disregard of agreed and established internal processes , "" he said .
Dudley 's departure will raise further questions about the rule of law in Russia and the climate for international investors .
It will also throw doubt on the reformist credentials of Russia 's new president .
On Friday , Medvedev assured the EU 's trade commissioner , Peter Mandelson , that the Kremlin would not get involved in the dispute , which has escalated in recent months .
He told Mandelson that the state was neutral and would "" keep away "" .
In reality , BP has suffered unprecedented harassment from the Russian state , including the FSB - Russia 's spy agency - which raided TNK - BP 's and BP 's Moscow offices in March , as well as the interior ministry and Moscow city hall .
Nine other TNK - BP executives are likely to leave with Dudley as early as next week .
They include James Owen , chief financial officer , and two vice - presidents , Kris Sliger and Richard Herbert .
It is not yet clear whether Dudley 's exile is permanent or temporary .
Dudley had asked for permits for 146 foreign specialists to be renewed .
German Khan , TNK - BP 's executive director , asked for 63 .
On Monday Moscow city hall approved the lower figure .
In theory , Dudley could return with others once their visas are ready .
In reality , the Russian partners are likely to arrange his indefinite exclusion .
The Russian shareholders have repeatedly demanded Dudley 's resignation .
Dudley said : "" We have been given no grounds to believe these issues will be resolved before senior international staff and their families will have to leave Russia . ""
With TNK - BP in effect decapitated , BP might have to pull out of Russia and sell its stake to Gazprom , Cherepanov said .
"" This is the worst - case scenario .
But it 's more likely they [ BP ] will revise the rules on how the company is managed . '
The Russians shareholders accuse Dudley of running TNK - BP like a BP subsidiary .
They also want the firm to expand abroad even if this brings it into conflict with BP ."
2008-07-02,"Dmitry Medvedev , Russia 's president , has called for a new era of relations with Britain following a torrid two years which saw the murder of a high - profile emigre and battles over British business interests .
In a wide ranging interview -his first with foreign newspapers since taking office in May - Medvedev said Russia and Britain had endured worse crises in the past and it was time to move on . ""
International relations always require people to come towards each other , "" he said .
"" There has to be a willingness to find compromises and listen to your partner .
Russia is ready to move , but we expect corresponding steps from our British partners . ""
Medvedev said he had "" a calm and good conversation "" with Gordon Brown on the phone recently and was looking forward to seeing him at next week 's G8 summit in Hokkaido , Japan .
He has sent a leading adviser to London to prepare for a bilateral Anglo - Russian meeting during the summit which he expected to be "" comprehensive and useful "" .
Brown is likely to raise concerns about the treatment of BP and its international staff in Russia .
In March the FSB , Russia 's post - KGB spy agency , raided the Moscow offices of BP and a joint venture , TNK - BP .
The British company has also faced problems with the tax police and the interior ministry .
On Tuesday TNK - BP said its international experts were being forced to leave Russia in a visa dispute .
Yesterday , Russia said some of the executives could stay .
But Brown 's spokesman said the firm 's treatment "" sends a worrying signal to investors about doing business in Russia "" .
Under Vladimir Putin , Medvedev 's predecessor , Britain 's relations with Russia fell to the worst level of any major European country after the Crown Prosecution Service accused Andrei Lugovoi , a Moscow - based former KGB agent , of murdering emigre Alexander Litvinenko .
Both countries expelled four of the other 's diplomats and in January , Russia forced Britain to close the British Council 's offices in St Petersburg and Yekaterinburg .
The British Council recently said it was going to court in Russia over an "" exorbitant "" tax demand .
Medvedev described the British Council in Russia as a "" nest of spies "" in an interview in the magazine Itogi before he took office .
But when reminded of that by the Guardian this week , he laughed .
Declining to mention the British Council or Britain 's demand to have Lugovoi sent for trial in London , he accentuated the positive by switching the issue to economics .
"" We 've never had such excellent economic links before .
Enormous investments are being made , "" he said .
"" On issues where we disagree ... I think we must discuss them face to face . ""
He said he liked London and had been there "" at least five times "" , including on holiday .
His comments came during a 90-minute meeting with eight journalists , one from each G8 nation , in the Kremlin .
He took a tough line on issues from Kosovo to Iran , accusing the EU and Ban Ki - moon , the UN secretary general , of making mistakes .
He contrasted his own "" colossal experience "" in Russia 's executive with that of the two US presidential candidates , John McCain and Barack Obama , who have served only in the legislature .
"" You need a certain preparation .
I believe I 've got it "" , he said .
Medvedev made it clear that ultimate power in Russia was no longer with Putin , now prime minister .
"" There are people whose advice you can ask , including Vladimir Putin , "" he said .
"" He 's very experienced ...
But if you make a mistake , it 's your own responsibility . """
2008-07-02,"Dmitry Medvedev , Russia 's new president , will be the youngest world leader at next week 's G8 summit in Hokkaido , Japan .
Aged 42 , he has been in office for just two months .
But in a lengthy interview in the Kremlin this week he presented himself as a man of "" colossal experience "" by contrast with the two US presidential candidates , John McCain and Barack Obama .
In a put - down that managed to sound gracious , he said : "" I sympathise with my American colleagues .
It often happens that a person is elected president who has , let 's say , very serious experience in Congress or the House of Representatives but does n't know how the executive branch works .
"" Of course you can learn .
Why do I say this ?
Because for the last few years I 've worked in the executive branch in the presidential hierarchy and this has given me colossal experience . ""
Asked about McCain 's comment two years ago that Russia should be thrown out of the G8 because of its poor human rights record , Medvedev brushed it aside as "" not serious "" .
The G8 was not created because countries liked each other but because of the world 's economic problems , he said .
"" Any US administration , if it wants to be successful , including in getting over the current depression in the American economy , has to conduct a pragmatic policy at home and abroad , "" he said .
Unlike his predecessor Vladimir Putin , who spent his early career in the KGB , Medvedev was a lawyer in St Petersburg before becoming a local government official there under Putin .
He was promoted to head the gas giant Gazprom while still in his 30s .
But like Putin , Medvedev is a short man with little charisma .
He entered the room briskly , shook hands with barely a trace of a smile , and got down to business .
Asked whether he was a liberal ( ie more "" western "" than Putin ) , he said : "" I 've never tried to measure myself on any scale .
A person is more multifaceted than the label they often get stuck with .
On the other hand someone 's whole behaviour allows you to characterise them in a certain way .
This person has liberal convictions , that person has conservative ones , this person is a radical socialist , and so on . ""
Considering I 'm a young president , I would n't like to make an evaluation of myself .
It 's not my job to do that .
But I do have a certain basic set of values which have been fundamental for me since my time at university .
I 've always started from the position that you have to obey the law and respect the supremacy of the laws which parliament passes .
It 's vital to fight against contempt of the law , against any legal nihilism .
The economy must be based on market values .
There must be unconditional defence of property rights .
These are the principles I took on as a student , just as there are other values like human rights which must be protected unconditionally in any state activity . ""
On the west 's recognition of Kosovo 's unilateral declaration of independence , he said : "" We consider Kosovo as a dangerous and unfortunate precedent .
Europe will pay for it for decades .
It 's obvious that a whole host of other separatist regimes will exploit it to justify their own desire for legal status . ""
He took issue with Ban Ki - moon , the UN secretary general , for making a statement in support of the EU 's decision to replace Kosovo 's UN administration with an EU presence . ""
At a minimum these are decisions which the secretary - general must not take on his own .
They must be taken by the security council .
And it 's quite strange when the security council has n't made any pronouncement but the secretary general speaks out on the issue "" .
On Iran , he attacked the EU for increasing sanctions against Tehran by freezing the assets of Iran 's main foreign bank just when talks were moving forward .
"" If we 're talking to them , then we should n't take actions that excite the Iranian leadership and are designed to lead to additional sanctions .
I just do n't understand why the EU took this recent action .
I mentioned this to [ European commission president José Manuel ] Barroso and [ EU foreign policy supremo Javier ]
Solana at the EU - Russia summit last week .
Either we talk to them or we try to criticise them on any pretext , "" he insisted .
On world economic problems , which will dominate next week 's meeting between Britain , Canada , France , Germany , Italy , Japan , Russia , and the US , Medvedev wants "" new economic mechanisms "" .
"" It 's clear that institutions created in the 70s and 60s , and a number of structures that are the key players , are failing to cope with the problems .
So there are various ideas aimed at adjusting the world 's financial system .
"" First of all it must be fairer and take into account the set of risks which are relevant today .
It must take into consideration the negative experience connected with overheating in the world economy as a whole and the economies of individual countries .
It must take into account the negative experience connected with the mortgage crisis which did n't only affect the United States ... there were problems in other countries too .
In short , the system must be remodelled to fit today 's world .
"" We have to formulate proposals and start negotiation to discuss what shape this system could take .
A number of countries are preparing these proposals , Great Britain among them .
We are also preparing proposals ...
it does not mean demolishing the architecture created over decades .
But the fact that it has to be improved and be more up - to - date , and better protected from risks , that it must not suffer from national egoism , financial and economic egoism , but must be fairer towards other countries - this is absolutely clear . ""
He said there was an excessive reliance on the dollar and argued that the rouble should be a reserve currency now it is convertible on foreign exchanges . ""
The system can not be oriented towards only one country and only one currency .
In future it has to be based on the balance of the leading economies and their stable growth and on the principle of several reserve currencies .

2008-07-02,"Russian oligarchs spelled out their determination to take control of the TNK - BP joint venture today as they called for an extraordinary meeting of the board of directors to take place on Monday at which they will demand that chief executive Bob Dudley is removed from his post .
They cited "" repeated infringements "" by Dudley of Russian employment , migration and tax laws Dudley is a former BP manager and critical to the London - based oil company 's influence inside the Russian joint venture , AAR .
The move came as the new prime minister , Dmitry Medvedev , said in an interview on Wednesday that he was determined to rebuild relations with Britain .
Mikhail Fridman , chairman of TNK - BP and one of the oligarchs , said he did not want conflict with BP , but all attempts at reasoned discussion had failed . ""
The conflict between AAR and BP is about control of TNK - BP .
We want the company to be managed as an independent oil company in the interest of all shareholders , including the 5 % of minority shareholders .
BP wants to operate our joint venture like a BP subsidiary , "" he explained .
Stan Polovets , chief executive of the AAR consortium made up of Alfa Group , Access Industries and Renova Group , said the Russian shareholders had asked for a meeting because Dudley was eroding value in TNK - BP and exposing its shareholders to legal risk .
"" We continue to believe that the underperformance of TNK - BP will continue unless the changes we have proposed are implemented , including the appointment of an independent CEO . ""
He also published a strategy document which accused BP of running the company for its own benefits and misrepresenting the intentions of the oligarchs .
The document , which is being distributed round London by a newly appointed firm of City PRs , claimed BP should allow an increase in the free float of TNK - BP shares from 5 % to 25 % , expand the business outside Russia and move into new areas such as refining and transportation .
It said TNK - BP had badly under - performed Russian rivals such as Lukoil , which had seen its market value rise by 467 % since September 2003 compared with TNK - BP 's 138 % .
Meanwhile dividends had fallen over the last two years .
The AAR document claimed that BP had turned down suggestions proposed by Russian company executives that TNK - BP take advantage of opportunities in Kazakhstan , Kurdistan and Poland .
It said "" BP has blocked every move "" and "" our patience is wearing thin "" .
Earlier in the day , BP 's problems appeared to be easing slightly when the immigration authorities said foreign executives working at TNK - BP would be granted some visas .
Russian officials confirmed that Robert Dudley – TNK - BPs embattled chief executive – would receive his visa on Thursday .
Seven other key foreign executives would also get new work permits , they added .
"" We have eight work permits prepared for TNK - BP top executives , including its head Robert Dudley , "" Konstantin Poltoranin , spokesman for Russia 's federal migration service , told Interfax .
In addition to Dudley , work permits will be issued to TNK - BPs chief finance officer James Owen , and to vice presidents Martin Fossum , Francis Steven Sommer , Klark Cridland , Richard Herbert and John Easton , Poltaranin said .
Department director Pyotr Zimowski would also get a visa , he added .
Poltaranin claimed that work permits for up to 49 international staff at the firm would be issued within 10 days .
"" There are no obstacles to the work of foreign citizens who are employees of TNK - BP , "" he said .
In reality , however , around two thirds of TNK - BP 's foreign experts will still be forced to leave the country .
Dudley originally asked the Moscow authorities to extend working permits for a total of 146 international staff .
On Monday Moscow city hall approved the request for just 71 .
Today authorities told TNK - BP that documents for only 49 people were submitted correctly .
The other specialists would need to submit fresh applications , they said .
BP welcomed the move , but a spokesman warned : "" Unless additional permits are accepted and granted , at least half the non - Russian staff , recruited from a number of firms around the world , will be ejected from Russia , as a result of the original unauthorised and improper application that was supported by two of the shareholders in TNK - BP 's management . ""
The modest concession on visas comes ahead of next week 's meeting between Gordon Brown , the prime minister , and Medvedev at the G8 summit in Japan .
It is the first bilateral encounter between Russian and British leaders since the murder , in 2006 , of the Russian dissident Alexander Litvinenko ."
2008-07-03,"Dmitry Medvedev is certainly doing his best to present a moderate and reasonable face to the world , as his interview in today 's Guardian confirms .
But the signals coming out of Moscow are mixed to say the least .
This week 's decision to deny visa renewals to foreign staff working at TNK - BP indicates that the Russian state remains determined to extend its grip over the energy sector and squeeze out foreign investors by illegitimate means .
We have also seen the resumption of hostile actions against the British Council and , on a much more serious level , an escalation of Russia 's military involvement in Georgia .
The generous interpretation of this confused picture is that the transfer of power to Medvedev is still underway and will take some time to complete .
We should therefore defer judgment until a later date .
There is talk of a major reshuffle of Kremlin personnel in the autumn that would give the new president a firmer basis to act on his own instincts .
According to this thesis , Medvedev 's consolidation of authority would open the way for progress in areas like energy and international security that have caused the sharpest divisions with Europe and the US .
There may be something in this .
There is a certainly a suggestion that the campaign against BP is being orchestrated by the hardline siloviki faction of the Kremlin most hostile to the Medvedev succession .
This group , composed of senior officers with backgrounds in the KGB and FSB , feels that the top job should have gone to one of its own .
Recent controversies may therefore be part of an internal power play designed to challenge Medvedev 's authority and constrain his ability to change course .
An important indicator of where Russia is going will be whether Medvedev acts to rein the siloviki in , perhaps using an anti - corruption drive as cover .
The alternative view is that Medvedev is fulfilling to perfection the "" good tsar "" role allotted to him by Vladimir Putin as a way of diffusing international criticism of Russia 's retreat from democratic reform and multilateral diplomacy .
By projecting and image of moderation and benevolence , Medvedev can blame the misdemeanours of his government on faceless subordinates and make it harder for Russia 's critics to respond effectively .
Accepting pleas that he wants to do the right thing , foreign leaders will shy away from punitive actions that might undermine him .
Which of these scenarios comes closest to the truth is something that can only be tested in real - world conditions and with the benefit of time .
Medvedev says that respect for the rule of law is the philosophical lodestar of his approach to government .
Russian leaders often say this , but not many of them seem to appreciate that the rule of law is a contact between government and the governed in which both accept binding constraints .
Putin regarded the law as an extension of state power , not something to which the state should be subordinate .
Will Medvedev be different ?
If so , it will mean a number of different things : respect for the property rights of BP and other investors ; an end to Russia 's status as the most serious violator of the European convention of human rights ; the release of prisoners who did not receive a fair trial ; no more transgressions on the territorial integrity of Georgia ; and fidelity to Russia 's binding commitments under the energy charter treaty and other international instruments .
Only when these issues are addressed will we really know which Dmitry Medvedev we are dealing with ."
2008-07-03,"Roman Abramovich , the Russian billionaire and owner of Chelsea FC , today bowed out of Russian politics when he resigned as governor of the frozen far - eastern province of Chukotka .
Abramovich stepped down as the region 's governor at "" his own request "" , the Kremlin said today .
Russia 's new president , Dmitry Medvedev , had signed a decree relieving him of his duties , it added .
Abramovich had been in the job for seven years and his departure follows at least one unsuccessful earlier attempt to quit last year .
Vladimir Putin turned down Abramovich 's request and asked him to carry on .
He agreed .
Today Abramovich 's spokesman said that the oligarch was departing from politics because he considered his job in Chukota completed .
Since becoming governor he has pumped billions into the sparsely populated Pacific region , near to Alaska . ""
When Mr Abramovich came to Chukotka the region was in serious crisis .
In the past seven years he 's succeeded not only in pulling it out of crisis but significantly boosting the standard of living , "" his spokesman , John Mann , told the Guardian . ""
He 's rebuilt infrastructure , housing , schools and hospitals .
He 's bought in new investors to build the economy of the region .
He 's put Chukotka on a great footing for future development , "" said Mann .
Asked why Abramovich was quitting now , Mann said : "" It 's very much mission accomplished .
But I think there 's no overriding reason .
I think it 's just a change of role . ""
Abramovich , 41 , is Russia 's third richest man , according to Forbes Russia magazine , with a $ 24.3bn ( £ 12bn ) fortune .
He has been spending more time recently in Moscow than London , aides say , following his divorce last year .
During the Putin era , Russian oligarchs were obliged to obey the state and to show social responsibility , observers suggest .
Those who challenged the Kremlin invariably ended up in exile or in prison .
By taking personal responsibility for Chukotka , one of Russia 's most backward and underdeveloped regions , Abramovich showed his loyalty to Putin .
He also fended off critics who accused him of unpatriotic behaviour when he bought Chelsea in 2003 .
Today analysts suggested that Abramovich had been allowed to give up his government job following Putin 's departure as president and the inauguration in May of Dmitry Medvedev as Russia 's new leader . ""
Putin did n't want him
[ Abramovich ] to leave while power was being transferred , "" said Sergei Mikheyev , vice - president of Moscow 's Centre for Political Technologies . ""
He asked him to stay on .
Now the transfer has happened .
The situation has changed . ""
"" Chukotka will really miss him .
It is impossible for anybody else to invest as much money into the region , "" said Mikheyev .
Abramovich was previously Russia 's richest man .
But he has recently slipped down the table following the sale of his oil firm Sibneft to Gazprom in 2005 .
Most of his assets are now held by Millhouse Capital , his private investment vehicle .
Last month Abramovich moored his personal $ 300 m yacht in St Petersburg while he attended the annual economic forum in Russia 's second city .
The British singer Amy Winehouse also played a concert at the opening of an art gallery in Moscow to be managed by Abramovich 's girlfriend Daria Zhukova .
Today Mann said that Abramovich would continue to financially support the autonomous district of Chukotka . ""
Millhouse is investing in several projects there as well as two charities , "" he said ."
2008-07-07,"Gordon Brown 's hopes of a thaw in Britain 's relationship with the Kremlin received a setback yesterday after "" sharp - edged "" talks with the new Russian president , Dmitry Medvedev .
In a meeting that lasted just over an hour , Brown received little sign that Moscow was prepared to give ground on three key issues : visas for BP staff working on a joint venture ; the closure of British Council offices ; and Russia 's refusal to extradite Andrei Lugovoi for the alleged poisoning of Alexander Litvinenko in London in November 2006 .
A Downing Street spokesman described the meeting as "" constructive and workmanlike "" - normally seen as diplomatic code for difficult talks .
With relations between Britain and Russia at their frostiest since the end of the cold war , a Kremlin spokesman said the talks had not avoided any "" sharp issues "" .
Brown pressed Medvedev for action on visas for BP workers that would speed up a $ 38bn joint venture with the Russian oil company TNK , and stressed that cultural ties between the two countries would be helped by the re - admittance of the British Council .
Downing Street said Brown had sought to break the ice by congratulating Medvedev on the victory of a Russian soccer team , Zenit St Petersburg , over the Scottish side Rangers in this year 's Uefa cup final , but admitted : "" We are not going to solve all these problems in one meeting , but it is important that we have a constructive relationship with Russia that allows us to raise and discuss some of these difficult issues .
"" Medvedev 's chief foreign policy adviser , Sergei Prikhodko , said the prime minister and the president had had "" frank discussions and did not avoid any sharp issues in the political and humanitarian sphere "" .
The president proposed to focus on raising relations to a normal level .
Brown outlined his ideas about problems with bilateral ties .
Relations between London and Moscow soured after Medvedev 's predecessor , Vladimir Putin , accused Britain of providing a haven for the Kremlin 's political foes , including the self - exiled tycoon Boris Berezovsky .
They became still more strained when Russia refused to extradite Lugovoi to Britain .
Late last year , Russia ordered the British Council to close its two offices outside Moscow , and this year problems have developed with the TNK - BP joint venture .
TNK - BP , owned by BP and four Russia - connected billionaires , began in 2003 as a joint venture blessed by the Kremlin .
It produces a quarter of BP 's global oil output , and last year posted a net profit of $ 5.7bn .
But earlier this year , the Russian co - owners rebelled against BP , and they are planning legal action for control of the company .
Their protest was accompanied by tax police raids , security sweeps and a visa clampdown , which many assumed showed the Kremlin was pressing the firm to accept a state partner .
Shell received similar treatment in 2006 , when Russian officials tried to force the group to sell a controlling stake in its Sakhalin gas venture to rival Gazprom .

He also stressed that cultural ties between the two countries could be helped by the re - admittance to Russia of the British Council .

They were further strained when Russia refused to extradite the ex - security guard Andrei Lugovoy , who is accused of poisoning the outspoken Kremlin critic Alexander Litvinenko in London in 2006 .
Late last year , Russia ordered Britain to close down its two British Council offices outside Moscow .
This year problems have developed with the BP - TNK venture .
TNK - BP , co - owned by BP and four Russian - connected billionaires , began in 2003 as a model venture blessed by the Kremlin .
It produces a quarter of BP 's global oil output and posted a net profit of $ 5.7bn last year .

Their protest was accompanied by tax police raids , security sweeps and a visa clampdown , which many assumed showed the Kremlin was pressuring the firm to accept a state partner .

2008-07-08,"If it had been boxing , the encounter would have been deemed a mismatch .
Dmitry Medvedev , a young , fit - looking 42 , freshly elected in a ( stage - managed ) landslide , feisty and full of beans versus Gordon Brown , 57 , veteran of a hundred forgotten punch - ups , slow on his feet , unelected , hounded and , according to media speculation , well on his way to an early bath .
Yet the supposed besting of Britain 's prime minister in his bout with Russia 's president was not a foregone conclusion .
In interviews prior to their meeting at the G8 summit in Japan , Medvedev appeared to signal a desire to repair relations strained to freezing point by the 2006 Litvinenko murder case and a long list of bilateral and strategic grievances .
In the event , Medvedev was more pugnacious than placatory .
Perhaps he was anxious , in his first outing on the world stage , to appear as hardnosed as his predecessor , the pugilistic Vladimir Putin .
Perhaps he was irritated by weekend reports , attributed to anonymous senior security sources , that Moscow was running a spy offensive in Britain – and compromising its terror defences .
Those same mysterious "" sources "" were at it again on Monday , even as Brown and Medvedev came to grips , telling a BBC reporter that "" we strongly believe "" the Russian state was directly involved in Litvinenko 's fatal poisoning .
For good measure , they also claimed to have foiled a Russian plot to murder another London - based Kremlin critic , the billionaire Boris Berezovsky .
Russia has long complained that Britain has become a willing sanctuary for dissidents bent on overthrowing Putin 's authoritarian political system .
Its refusal to extradite Andrei Lugovoi , chief suspect in the Litvinenko case , is justified by what Moscow sees as British encouragement of subversive forces .
As if to rub it in , on the eve of the G8 , London granted political asylum to Andrei Sidelnikov , a reformist opposition leader .
Diplomatically speaking , that was a poke in the eye .
Looked at another way , Britain 's wider concerns about Russian policy , shared by US and European partners , are not without substance .
They range from Moscow 's democratic deficit , its arms build - up and resumption of strategic nuclear bomber patrols over the Norwegian Sea , to its perceived troublemaking and obstructionism on issues such as Kosovo 's independence , curbing Iran 's nuclear activities , and Georgia 's Nato and EU membership aspirations .
It was Medvedev 's refusal to budge on specific matters such as Lugovoi 's extradition , the closure of British Council offices in Russia , and visa problems experienced by BP staff , rather than strategic differences , that produced headlines suggesting Brown had taken a beating .
Yet Medvedev 's spokesman , Sergei Prikhodko , declined to indulge in the sort of tub - thumping Putin so enjoyed .
He insisted the new Russian leader still believed bilateral collaboration could be revived and expanded . ""
Medvedev proposed concentrating on the prospects of restoring relations to the level they were several years ago , "" he said .
"" We have a certain prospect for positive progress in UK - Russian relations . ""
The root of Brown 's difficulties in trying to promote a focused , robust foreign policy in support of British interests and values may not lie with awkward customers such as Medvedev , France 's Nicolas Sarkozy or even with Robert Mugabe , but with domestic perceptions , broadcast around the globe , that he is an unlucky , mortally wounded politician whose time is fast running out .
In a wired - up world , the Russians read the papers as everybody else does .
They do not need legions of spies to tell them the "" Westminster village "" and the British media are increasingly obsessed with plots , real or imagined , to bring the prime minister down .
Like US presidential contender Barack Obama or China 's leadership , they make calculations about just how much face - time , how many concessions , and how much leeway they must give a man whose political need is greater than their own , and who , in any case , may soon be replaced .
It is a cruel business .
It is unfair .
But it 's politics .
Despite his apparently successful moral blackmail of fellow G8 leaders today , it is uncertain whether he really has the power to deliver effective international action on Zimbabwe .
It is an uncomfortable thought , but Mugabe may well outlast him ."
2008-07-08,"BP was hit by further trouble in Russia yesterday when tax inspectors started an "" unusually rigorous "" audit of its TNK joint venture operation in Moscow .
Only hours after Gordon Brown raised official harassment of the company with Russian president Dmitry Medvedev at the G8 meeting in Japan , there were new demands requesting unprecedented levels of information on a group of foreigners seconded to TNK - BP .
These included time sheets , certification of business trips and passport copies showing foreign travel covering a two - year period from January 2006 to December 2007 .
The information must be submitted within 10 days or penalties would apply , according to a source , while a BP spokesman in London confirmed that a tough review of the business was under way . ""
These kinds of audits go on all the time but the latest one seems to involve an unusually rigorous claim for documentation . ""
TNK - BP , Russia 's second - biggest foreign investment , has been reeling from a year - long struggle between BP and its Russian oligarch partners over management control and future strategy .
The oligarchs , led by Mikhail Fridman of the Alfa Group , want TNK - BP to cut the number of foreigners directly employed by , or seconded to the business which provides a quarter of BP 's worldwide oil output .
The non - Russian staff are too expensive and are not needed in such great numbers , according to the oligarchs , but BP - backed TNK - BP management say they provide expertise to the company .
Senior management at BP has called on the Russian government to guarantee that administrative resources of the state , such as security services and tax police , will not be used against TNK - BP as part of the shareholders ' struggle .
Brown raised the matter at a meeting with Medvedev in Japan on the sidelines of the G8 summit and was told that only the kind of checks normal in all EU states would be undertaken .
Other G8 leaders are also understood to have spoken to Medvedev on the same issue ."

2008-07-08,"As leaders of the G8 nations discuss the environment and the global financial crisis with Russian president Dmitry Medvedev this week , and EU leaders continue attempts to hammer out a partnership agreement with Moscow , Russian policies are directly undermining western interests in the Caspian region .
The west needs the Caspian .
The EU is in the midst of an energy security crisis : increasing percentages of its oil and gas come from Russia , are funneled through Russia , or pass through Russian - controlled infrastructure .
The countries of the Caspian region – Azerbaijan , Kazakhstan , Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan – present the only viable alternative sources with which Europe could diversify away from the dominance of a Kremlin - controlled monopoly .
Turkmenistan 's natural gas reserves alone rival those of the Gulf states , yet the EU has so far only tentatively discussed direct European access to these resources .
On the other hand , Caspian countries are key to ensuring that British , American and other Nato forces in Afghanistan are well supported and fully supplied .
In separate deals made at the most recent Nato summit , the leaders of Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan opened up their land transport corridors and airfields to all non - lethal provisions for alliance troops in neighbouring Afghanistan .
But despite this , both the strategic importance and energy potential of the Caspian region is now in jeopardy .
On his way to the G8 summit in Japan , Medvedev – the former chairman of Russia 's gargantuan energy monopoly , Gazprom – launched a diplomatic campaign to scuttle western efforts to build greater links with Caspian countries .
His first stop on July 3 was Baku , where he offered for Russia to buy all of Azerbaijan 's natural gas for market prices .
Azerbaijan has so far studiously ignored Moscow 's energy demands , developing immense oil and gas pipeline projects through Turkey that supply Western markets .
But President Ilham Aliyev 's decision to begin negotiations with Moscow seems to indicate that the west 's neglect of Azerbaijan on other issues has engendered a shift of calculus in Baku .
Medvedev continued to Turkmenistan , where he reportedly warned that the country 's support of Nato operations not go too far .
The Turkmen president , Gurbanguly Berdymukhammedov , has made a point of courting the west recently , not only attending the Nato summit , but visiting the European commission in Brussels and meeting with US officials in New York .
His interest in western support to build a trans - Caspian gas pipeline towards European markets was countered over the weekend by Medvedev 's attractive offer of linking Turkmen gas fields to a Russian pipeline system .
It is time that European countries , Nato and the US realise that their fundamental interests coincide in the Caspian region , and do more to shore up links to an area that is in danger of falling back in to what Moscow calls its "" orbit "" .
France , in the new European presidency , can not merely focus its term on a "" Mediterranean union "" as planned .
It would do well to support a new Polish - Swedish EU initiative , the "" eastern partnership "" , which aims to reach out to Europe 's neighbours in the Black Sea and Caspian regions .
While Washington is in the midst of a lengthy transition period , any new US administration will have to step up its energy development plans in the Caspian region , throwing substantial diplomatic weight behind a trans - Caspian pipeline , as well as attendant western - oriented energy projects .
Nato , in turn , can no longer afford to ignore the festering security gaps between Europe and Afghanistan .
The resolution of frozen conflicts between Azerbaijan and Armenia , as well as in Georgia and Moldova , could be aided significantly by Nato security guarantees and peacekeepers .
In addition , the significant illegal trafficking flows that spread through the region and on to European streets can only be addressed with Nato aid and assistance .
Increased western involvement in the Caspian is sure to perturb Russia , at least initially .
But , the west can not afford to lose the indispensable frontier region of our time .
If western countries and institutions act decisively to ensure a role in the region 's future , Moscow will have to realise that an antagonistic approach only jeopardises Russian security .
Resolved conflicts , reduced transnational threats and economic and energy development are in the interest of both Russia and the west in the broader Caspian region .
But Moscow and the countries of the Caspian will only see the west as a partner in these efforts if the west is a presence in the region ."
2008-07-09,"Dmitry Medvedev today warned Russia may take retaliatory steps after being "" extremely upset "" by a US defence pact with the Czech Republic .
The Russian president reacted angrily yesterday after the Bush administration capped a five - year campaign to extend its controversial "" star wars "" missile shield project from the US to Europe by signing a deal to build a radar station south of Prague .
The first formal agreement between the US and central Europe on the defence scheme instantly prompted threats from Moscow that it would retaliate militarily if the agreement is ratified .
Speaking at a news conference at the G8 summit in Japan , Medvedev said Russia was still open to talks with the US .
"" We will not be hysterical about this
but we will think of retaliatory steps ...
We are not closed to further negotiations and we will continue these .
"" It is completely obvious that , after the signing of the agreement a new stage in implementing the idea of the missile shield has started .
We are extremely upset by this situation "" .
Poland is insistent on getting batteries of US Patriot missiles in return for deploying the shield 's interceptor rockets in the north of the country , and this may still upset White House hopes of finalising the project before George Bush steps down .
The Russian foreign ministry warned yesterday that the Kremlin would react "" not diplomatically , but with military - technical means "" if the agreement in Prague came into effect .
Condoleezza Rice , the US secretary of state , travelled to Prague for the signing ceremony of the radar station , sited at a derelict former Red Army base south of the capital .
The radars aim to track ballistic missile launches from Iran , although Tehran does not possess such firepower . ""
Ballistic missile proliferation is not an imaginary threat , "" Rice said .
The Bush administration is in a hurry to conclude deals on the $ 3.5bn ( £ 1.75bn ) project to extend the missile shield system from California and Alaska to Europe .
But Rice had to abandon plans to travel on to Warsaw to complete the pact because of Polish concerns that the siting of 10 interceptor rockets underground in northern Poland would undermine rather than enhance Polish security .
"" We are at a place where these negotiations need to come to a conclusion , "" Rice said .
The Russian foreign ministry said last night the deal in Prague would "" complicate "" European security and subvert talks between Moscow and Washington on the dispute .
The Poles do not feel threatened by Iran , but are permanently wary of Russia .
They are demanding US security guarantees such as Patriot missiles to shore up their defences against short and medium - range missile attack .
The US has balked , not least for fear of increasing Russian hostility to the project .
"" It is extremely important that Patriots are stationed in Poland , "" said the Polish defence minister , Bogdan Klich .
"" The fundamental issue is in what way the American installations are going to be protected from an eventual missile attack , and in what way Poland is going to be protected from an eventual ballistic missile attack , "" he told TVN24 television .
The US has offered to put Patriots in Poland for a year .
Rice said yesterday she had told the Poles what the US "" can not do "" .
Radek Sikorski , the Polish foreign minister , went to Washington for last - ditch talks aimed at salvaging an agreement and preventing the collapse of talks that have been going on since 2003 .
The Americans want to start building the facilities next year , and for them to be ready by 2012 .
But public opinion is against the project in both Poland and the Czech Republic and the plans for the missile shield - the effectiveness of which remains unproven - could yet unravel .
The government in Prague will struggle to get the radar deal through parliament while the Czechs and the Americans have yet to agree on the legal status of US troops in the country ."
2008-07-12,"Gordon Brown will hold urgent talks with European leaders about Zimbabwe today after plans to impose UN sanctions on Robert Mugabe 's brutal regime collapsed in disarray .
Russia and China used their vetoes in the UN Security Council to block the measures - only three days after the Russian president , Dmitry Medvedev , signed a statement endorsing financial penalties against leading figures in Harare .
Brown had told MPs on Thursday of a ' major breakthrough ' at the G8 on Zimbabwe , with Russia now signed up to sanctions .
William Hague , the shadow foreign secretary , accused him yesterday of being ' clearly over - confident ' about the deal , with questions now being asked about the government 's diplomatic skills .
The Foreign Secretary , David Miliband , accused the Russians of double - dealing , adding : ' The vote yesterday showed that , in the end , the Russians and the Chinese - I would n't quite say put two fingers up - effectively blocked the action .
The Russians and Chinese were briefing in all sorts of directions . '
Downing Street said Brown would discuss the way forward in Paris today with the French President , Nicolas Sarkozy , and European Commission President José Barroso .
Options include expanding an EU ban on travel to leading members of Mugabe 's regime and taking measures against companies owned by 14 individuals close to the regime , who would have been targeted by the UN motion unsuccessfully proposed by Britain and the US .
It is understood that the Foreign Office and the US State Department realised on Friday , hours after Brown 's parliamentary statement , that Moscow was backtracking amid speculation of a difference of opinion within the Russian government , but decided to push ahead with the vote to flush positions into the open .
A Downing Street spokesman said those who vetoed the proposed economic sanctions , arms embargo and travel ban ' must now take responsibility for the failure of the Security Council to act ' .
Brown will still ask for a UN envoy to be sent urgently to Harare .
Kofi Annan , the Ghanaian former UN secretary - general , offered his help in negotiating a peaceful solution to the crisis .
He told The Observer : ' They are talking of sending UN envoys now , and already I have talked to people involved , and I am offering advice and my services .
Of course I would help because I am an African . '
Britain may also take bilateral measures with the US .
But these may lack the moral authority of a united UN front against Mugabe , thus strengthening what is widely seen as his illegitimate grip on power .
There was jubilation among Mugabe 's supporters at the vetoes .
His information minister , Sikhanyiso Ndlovu , said he wanted to ' thank those who helped defeat international racism disguised as multilateral action at the UN ' , adding that the UN should have nothing to do with member states ' elections .
The blocking of sanctions was also welcomed in South Africa .
The British ambassador to the UN , John Sawers , pointedly described Russia 's decision as ' inexplicable ' , adding : ' The Security Council has failed to shoulder its responsibility to do what it can to prevent a national tragedy deepening and spreading its effects across southern Africa . '
His US counterpart , Zalmay Khalilzad , said the Russians had seemed supportive of sanctions all week
and then ' something happened in Moscow ' .
That gave China , which has a growing reputation for exploiting Africa 's oil and mineral stocks with scant regard for human rights , an excuse to veto the sanctions ."
2008-07-15,"Russia 's new president , Dmitry Medvedev , today launched an outspoken attack on America 's European missile defence plans , in the latest sign that his policy towards the west is identical to that of his hawkish predecessor , Vladimir Putin .
Medvedev denounced the Bush administration 's plans to build a missile defence shield in the Czech Republic and Poland - allegedly to shoot down potential rogue missiles fired by Iran .
He accused the US of "" aggravating the situation "" and promised Russia would "" respond appropriately "" . ""
This common ( security ) heritage can not survive if one of the sides selectively destroys isolated elements of the strategic construction , "" Medevev said this morning , adding : "" This does n't satisfy us . ""
Addressing Russian ambassadors in Moscow , Medvedev also called Kosovo 's US - backed independence as "" illegal "" , and accused the Baltic states of glorifying fascism .
"" They are shuffling history like a pack of cards , "" he complained .
Medvedev 's hardline comments in one of his first major speeches on foreign policy since his inauguration in May are likely to disappoint western observers .
They had hoped that his presidency might usher in a more conciliatory era in relations with the west .
The latest tensions follow Russia 's decision last week to veto a UN security council resolution imposing sanctions and travel restrictions on Robert Mugabe .
This earned an unprecedented rebuke from the US ambassador to the UN , Zalmay Khalilzad , and British officials .
Khalilzad said Russia 's actions were not worthy of a G8 partner .
He suggested that Medevedev had reneged on commitments he gave during last week 's G8 summit in Japan - a claim the Kremlin angrily rejects .
Medvedev was also embroiled in several deepening confrontations with Russia 's neighbours - most notably Georgia and the Czech Republic .
Last week , the Czechs formally signed a deal with the US secretary of state , Condoleezza Rice , agreeing to host the Pentagon 's missile defence shield .
Yesterday , Russia 's state - run oil pipeline Transneft confirmed it had halved oil deliveries to the Czechs - a move it claimed was "" commercial "" rather than "" political "" .
Prague officials expressed scepticism at Russia 's explanation .
With tensions rising over Georgia 's breakaway regions of Abkhazia and South Ossetia , Moscow last week admitted one of its warplanes had entered Georgian air space .
Georgia 's pro - US government threatened to shoot down any more military jets that crossed into its territory .
"" There are no signals that Russia 's foreign policy , as well as its domestic policy , has changed , "" Vladimir Ryzhkov , an independent opposition politician and former deputy in Russia 's Duma told the Guardian today .
He added : "" It 's the same line .
No new ideas .
No new signal .
"" Russia 's ongoing diplomatic war with Britain - which last week saw the Kremlin identify a senior British diplomat in Moscow as a spy - was further evidence that there were no significant differences between Medvedev and Putin , Ryzhkov said .
"" Relations between Russia and Britain are very cold , "" Ryzhkov noted .
"" Many people wrote and said that Medevedev was a liberal and a moderniser .
I was always more sceptical .
We have to wait and see what happens over the next six months . ""
He added : "" I think there is a struggle in the top of the Russian political leadership between modernisers and conservatives .
Medvedev is not in control of the situation .
Putin 's role is still crucial .
Paradoxically the position of Putin 's officials has strengthened over the past three months . ""
Medvedev 's speech this morning took place in front of Russian diplomats at Russia 's foreign ministry , a grandiose Stalin - era skyscraper in central Moscow .
Medvedev , a 42-year - old ex - lawyer , eschewed the often - waspish rhetoric used by his predecessor .
But his message was essentially the same as Putin 's .
Medvedev criticised the Conventional Armed Forces in Europe treaty - which Putin withdrew from - describing it as "" ineffective and unfair "" .
In a new foreign policy "" concept "" , he also today reaffirmed Russia 's deep opposition to Nato enlargement . ""
Russia continues to disapprove of Nato expansion , in particular , its plans to admit Ukraine and Georgia as new members and to bring Nato military infrastructure closer to Russian borders in general , "" Medevdev 's office said in a statement on the presidential website .
Since becoming president , Medvedev has made several progressive - sounding speeches , calling for a reform of Russia 's notoriously compromised legal system and calling for an end to corruption .
So far , though , it appears that any comparisons with Mikhail Gorbachev , the Soviet Union 's last reformist leader , are far - fetched .
"" We can compare Medvedev with the early Gorbachev days , in March and April 1985 , "" Ryzhkov said today .
"" Even Gorbachev started new signals from practically his first days . """
2008-07-15,"Russia 's new president , Dmitry Medvedev , yesterday launched an outspoken attack on America 's European missile defence plans , in the latest sign that policy towards the west is unchanged since Vladimir Putin .
Medvedev denounced the Bush administration 's plans to build a missile defence shield in the Czech Republic and Poland , allegedly to shoot down a rogue missile fired by Iran .
He accused the US of aggravating the situation and promised that Russia would respond appropriately . ""
This common [ security ] heritage can not survive if one of the sides selectively destroys isolated elements of the strategic construction , "" Medvedev said , adding : "" This does n't satisfy us . ""
Addressing Russian ambassadors in Moscow , Medvedev also dubbed Kosovo 's US - backed independence illegal and accused the Baltic states of glorifying fascism .
"" They are shuffling history like a pack of cards , "" he said .
Medvedev 's hard line in one of his first speeches on foreign policy since his May inauguration is likely to disappoint western observers .
They hoped his presidency might usher in a more conciliatory era .
The comments follow Russia 's veto last week of a UN security council resolution imposing sanctions and travel restrictions on Robert Mugabe .
This earned Medvedev a rebuke from US 's ambassador to the UN , Zalmay Khalilzad , that Medvedev had reneged on commitments he gave during last week 's G8 summit in Tokyo - a claim the Kremlin rejects .
Medvedev is also embroiled in deepening confrontations with neighbouring Georgia and the Czech Republic .
Last week the Czechs signed a deal with the US , agreeing to host the missile defence shield .
On Monday , Russia 's state - run oil pipeline Transneft confirmed it had halved oil deliveries to the EU country - a move it claimed was commercial , not political .
With tensions rising over Georgia 's breakaway regions of Abkhazia and South Ossetia , Moscow last week admitted that four of its warplanes had entered Georgian airspace .
Georgia 's pro - US government has threatened to shoot down any more military jets that cross into its territory .
"" There are no signals that Russia 's foreign policy , as well as its domestic policy , has changed , "" Vladimir Ryzhkov , an opposition politician , said .
"" It 's the same line .
No new ideas .
No new signal .
"" Russia 's diplomatic war with Britain - which last week saw the Kremlin identify a senior diplomat in Moscow as a spy - was further evidence there were no significant differences from Putin .
Russia 's ambassador in Britain , Yuri Fedotov , yesterday said an unprecedented anti - Russian campaign by Britain had wrecked any new impetus between London and Moscow after last week 's meeting between Medvedev and Gordon Brown .
Medvedev 's speech at Russia 's foreign ministry eschewed Putin 's often waspish rhetoric , but his message was the same .
He criticised the conventional armed forces in Europe treaty - which Putin withdrew from - as ineffective and unfair , and reaffirmed opposition to Nato enlargement .
"" Russia continues to disapprove of Nato expansion , in particular its plans to admit Ukraine and Georgia as new members and to bring Nato military infrastructure closer to Russian borders in general , "" his office posted on the presidential website ."
2008-07-17,"The Russian president has warned that government officials who can not use a computer could soon be out of a job .
"" They either should learn or , as they say , goodbye , "" Dmitry Medvedev said yesterday in a meeting with officials in Petrozavodsk , north - west Russia .
"" We do n't hire people who ca n't read and write .
Computer literacy today is the same . ""
Since taking office in May , the 42-year - old has made it his mission to modernise Russia and fight pervasive corruption .
He said yesterday that if the government carried out more of its work online , it would increase transparency and make corruption more difficult to hide .
He added that there had been no real progress towards putting documents , government purchase orders or the results of government - funded research online , despite years of talk about establishing an "" electronic government "" .
He blamed the foot - dragging on poor computer skills . ""
Civil servants who do n't have elementary computer skills can not work effectively , "" Medvedev said .
"" Computer literacy should be part of job evaluations . ""
The government should help increase internet access , he added .
Internet penetration in Russia is among the lowest in Europe , with only 12 % of people aged 15 or older regularly online , according to a study by the internet research firm comScore .
But it also has the fastest - growing number of internet users .
The Russian leader has often pointed to his use of the internet .
He told Itogi magazine in March that he was fond of watching the television news online .

2008-07-22,"Venezuela 's president , Hugo Chávez arrived in Moscow yesterday on his latest arms - buying spree , saying that his country needed to buy more weapons to defend itself from the US .
Chávez met Russia 's president , Dmitry Medvedev , and was expected to sign a $ 2bn ( £ 1bn ) arms deal for new missile defence systems and diesel - powered submarines during the two - day visit .
"" I have great hopes we will be able to continue building our strategic alliance , "" Chávez said .
"" The deals will guarantee the sovereignty of Venezuela which is being threatened by the United States . ""
His latest visit to Moscow - his sixth - is likely to irritate Washington and comes at a time when relations between Russia and the US are under strain .
Moscow is vehemently opposed to the Bush administration 's plans to site a missile defence shield in central Europe .
It is also hostile to Georgia and Ukraine 's US - backed attempts to join Nato .
Chávez told Medvedev he was passing on greetings from Fidel Castro .
Taking a thinly veiled swipe at the US , he said Cuba 's former president had told him that Russia was the only powerful country to have "" common sense "" .
According to the Russian daily Kommersant , Chávez wants to buy 20 Tor - M1 air defence systems , three or four diesel - powered submarines , and Ilyushin warplanes .
After Algeria , Venezuela is the second - biggest buyer of Russian arms , with Chávez having already spent $ 4bn .
His Kremlin talks were expected to include discussions on oil and gas projects .
But Chávez said he also wanted to get to know Russia 's new premier .
"" This is my first visit to President Medvedev .
We will get acquainted because a very wise , personal diplomacy is being carried out . ""
Chávez claims Washington planned the 2002 coup against him .
The US accuses him of seeking out its enemies - such as Iran - as allies .
Its suspicions are likely to be confirmed today when he flies to Minsk to visit Belarus 's president , Alexander Lukashenko .
US - Belarus relations are at rockbottom owing to a number of rows ."
2008-07-22,"The Venezuelan president , Hugo Chávez , today arrived in Moscow on his latest arms - buying spree , saying that his country needed to buy more weapons to defend itself from the United States .
Chávez met Russia 's president Dmitry Medvedev this morning .
He is expected to sign a billion - dollar arms deal with Russia for new missile defence systems and diesel - powered submarines .
"" I have great hopes we will be able to continue building our strategic alliance , "" Chávez said after landing in Moscow for a two - day trip .
He added : "" The deals will guarantee the sovereignty of Venezuela which is being threatened by the United States . ""
Chávez 's latest visit to Moscow –
his sixth – is likely to irritate Washington .
It comes at a time when relations between Russia and the US are already under strain over a host of issues .
Moscow is vehemently opposed to the Bush administration 's plans to site a missile defence shield in central Europe .
It is also hostile to Georgia and Ukraine 's US - backed attempts to join Nato .
Today Chávez told Medvedev he was passing on greetings from Cuba 's former president Fidel Castro , who had written him a letter .
Taking a thinly veiled swipe at the US , he said America lacked common sense . ""
Fidel spoke on the crisis of common sense in the world , especially in some powerful countries .
Russia has fortunately retained this common sense , "" he said .
According to today 's Kommersant newspaper , Venezuela has a long shopping list .
It wants to buy 20 TOR - M1 air defence systems , three or four diesel - powered submarines , and Ilyushin war - planes .
The potential deal was worth $ 2bn , the paper said .
Venezuela is already the largest purchaser of military hardware from Russia in Latin America , and the second biggest in the world after Algeria .
Chávez has already spent $ 4bn on Russian arms .
Past purchases have included Sukhoi fighter jets , helicopters and rifles .
Today 's talks were also expected to include discussions on oil and gas projects .
"" This is my first visit to President Medvedev , "" Chávez said .
"" We will get acquainted because a very wise , personal diplomacy is being carried out . ""
Chávez accuses Washington of planning a 2002 coup against him .
The US in turn accuses him of deliberately seeking out its enemies — such as Iran and Cuba — as allies .
Its suspicions are likely to be confirmed on Wednesday when Chávez flies to Minsk for meetings with Belarus ' dictatorial president , Alexander Lukashenko .
US relations with Belarus are at rock bottom , following several recent rows .
Medevedev 's decision to meet Chávez today at his Meindorf castle residence near Moscow suggests that there has been no change in Russia 's foreign policy since he succeeded Vladimir Putin in May."
2008-07-23,"No one following the course of EU - Russia relations over the last few years can fail to have noticed a recent improvement in their tone and atmosphere .
In the second term of his presidency , Vladimir Putin 's approach to the EU ranged from passive aggression to open confrontation .
In stark contrast , his successor , Dmitry Medvedev , described his first EU - Russia summit as "" sincere , neighbourly "" , an assessment shared by EU leaders .
This relationship is obviously in its honeymoon phase and we therefore need to be cautious .
Its durability will be tested in the autumn , when the EU and Russia begin in earnest to work out the details for a new "" strategic partnership "" .
Does Medvedev have the authority to move beyond a change of tone and agree real progress on substance , or is he merely the acceptable face of Putinism , a congenial frontman for an otherwise unchanging regime ?
Understandably , there is willingness to give him a chance .
The EU wants close and friendly relations with Russia in order to deal with issues of common interest , from climate change and energy security to security policy and the stability of the European neighbourhood .
What that should n't mean is a willingness to pursue agreement at any price .
Russia has taken a pronounced authoritarian turn since the current EU - Russia agreement was negotiated in 1997 .
It has also been increasingly willing to use coercive methods in its relations with other states , including the UK and some other members of the EU .
We can not skirt round these issues if we want to stand up for our values and interests .
As a prosperous bloc of nearly 500 million citizens , the EU ought to find it relatively easy to maintain balanced and healthy relations with a neighbour of 130 million .
The EU accounts for 52 % of Russian trade , whereas Russia accounts for only 8 % of EU trade .
But converting that advantage into real political leverage requires the EU to behave in a much more disciplined and unity .
The Kremlin has found it too easy to play a game of divide and rule and maintain an upper hand in its relations with the EU .
The EU 's problems with Russia stem not just from a divergence of interests , but also of political values , at least as far as the ruling elite is concerned .
Putin 's authoritarian model of government is now posed as a serious long - term alternative to European style multi - party democracy .
Indeed , Russia has often seemed to be at the forefront of efforts to roll back the tide of democratic change in the post - Soviet space and beyond .
Within the UN security council , the Russian government has acted in concert with China to give impunity to regimes such as Zimbabwe and Sudan .
There will always be those prepared to ignore difficult issues for an easy life , but they will not be the only voices in this debate .
While much of the focus has been on the views of member states , few have so far taken account of the fact that the European parliament also has to give its assent before a new EU - Russia agreement can be sealed .
This should not be taken for granted .
The parliament has its own views that will have to be addressed as part of this process .
The most important of these are democracy and human rights , where a serious retreat from European standards has become evident in Russia in recent years .
The current EU - Russia agreement contains unambiguous commitments to support multi - party democracy , human rights and the rule of law .
But instead of the progress we were promised , we have seen a very serious erosion of freedoms across the board .
A priority must be improvements in the substance and procedures of EU - Russia human rights consultations , with independent NGOs from Russia and the EU given a formal role .
We need to give Russian NGOs a voice they are increasingly denied at home .
A second area of concern relates to energy and Russia 's increasingly important role as an energy supplier .
Instead of becoming an area of cooperation , it has become one of tension , with many EU countries concerned at Russia 's apparent desire to use monopolistic advantage to secure political leverage over the countries around it .
The framework for EU - Russia energy relations must be the energy charter treaty , which Russia and all EU member states have signed and are legally bound by .
This provides essential guarantees on market access , security of supply , transit , transparency and investor protection that Russia is clearly not respecting .
It is hoped that the new agreement will make progress towards an EU - Russia free trade area .
If this is framed and implemented properly , it would certainly yield major benefits for all concerned , but we have to be sure that the conditions are in place to make it a reality .
The European parliament has been particularly critical of new rules , signed into law by Vladimir Putin in the last days of his presidency , designed to restrict foreign ownership in 42 strategic areas of the Russian economy .
Of course we should open the European single market to third countries , but only if this is done on a reciprocal basis .
One final consideration is the fact that Russia and the EU share a common neighbourhood in eastern Europe , the Caucasus and the Balkans .
Both sides should see a joint interest in underwriting the political and economic progress of countries in these regions , but it is not always clear that Russia is willing to play a constructive role .
Instead of acting to end frozen conflicts , Russia 's intervention in Georgia has been highly destabilising ; energy resources have been used coercively ; autocratic rule in Belarus has been encouraged ; Serbian rejectionism in relations to Kosovo has been supported ; and now Russian leaders seem to be questioning the territorial integrity of Ukraine .
Can we be optimistic about the prospects for agreement against such a backdrop of difficult and contentious issues ?
It is certainly a good thing that relations between the EU and Russia are once again being conducted on open and friendly terms .
Whether this lasts depends ultimately on whether President Medvedev is able and willing to convert fine words into good deeds .
The important thing is that EU leaders must not trim their ambitions or neglect their own values in order to secure a quick but empty deal .
That approach may create the illusion of harmony , but only at the cost of worse relations in the longer term ."
2008-07-31,"Tony Hayward , the chief executive of BP , met Mikhail Fridman , leader of the opposing faction at TNK - BP , in Prague on Wednesday in a move that indicates a thaw in relations .
Signals of a potential settlement of the dispute came as Russian president Dmitry Medvedev expressed concern at the way the state authorities have been dealing with commerce - an issue that has inflamed the TNK - BP row and knocked foreign investor sentiment in Russia .
TNK - BP 's co - owners , BP and the Russian AAR consortium , would not comment on the substance of the dialogue .
A number of well informed sources said there was progress , apparently helped by the decision of TNK - BP 's chief executive Robert Dudley to leave Russia last week .
"" Up till now the dispute was about Dudley because BP supported him and AAR opposed him , "" said one source .
"" Now Dudley is out of Russia it has paved the way for both sides to be able to talk to each other properly again . ""
The 50:50 joint venture , Russia 's third - largest oil producer , remained under pressure at home as a Siberian court yesterday upheld a challenge to a list of management nominees to the board of its main operating unit , TNK - BP Holding .
AAR complained that TNK - BP 's management failed to consult them on the nominees .
The court ruled that the management , led by Dudley , had acted illegally by drawing up the list , a court spokeswoman and a TNK - BP spokesman said .
Medvedev expressed frustration at his government 's inability to deal with the red tape and corruption he said was hampering business in Russia ."
2008-08-06,"Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn , the celebrated Russian writer , has been laid to rest after a funeral service held at Moscow 's historic Donskoi monastery earlier today .
The Russian president , Dmitry Medvedev , and his predecessor , Vladimir Putin , were among the mourners who joined the Nobel laureate 's family and friends for the service in the monastery 's cathedral .
After the Russian Orthodox ceremony , which included goose - stepping honour guards and a choir singing dirges , his flower - strewn casket was carried to a grave in the cathedral 's cemetery preceded by a uniformed soldier carrying a huge photograph of the man .
At the graveside a priest said prayers and blessed his body before sprinkling it with frankincense .
Relatives kissed his forehead before the coffin was sealed and interred .
He was buried in accordance with his will in the monastery grounds , where Russian cultural figures have been laid to rest since the 18th century .
According to observers , the service bore all the hallmarks of a state funeral , including a military band and a gun salute .
Earlier in the day , the Russian public paid tribute to the author , who died from heart failure on Sunday aged 89 .
Flanked by his widow , Natalya , two sons Stepan and Yermolai , and a military guard , his body lay in an open coffin inside the Russian Academy of sciences , as thousands of mourners trouped past offering their condolences and placing flowers on the floor by the coffin .
Solzhenitsyn came to prominence with his books The Gulag Archipelago and One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich which exposed Stalin 's brutal prison system and forced him into 20 years of exile from the former Soviet Union ."

2008-08-12,"The Russian president , Dmitry Medvedev , today ordered an end to the military offensive in Georgia .
Speaking on national television , Medvedev said Russian forces had punished Georgia and restored security for Russian peacekeepers and civilians in the separatist South Ossetia region . ""
The aggressor has been punished and suffered very significant losses , "" he said .
"" Its military has been disorganised . ""
Soon afterwards , Russian military officials confirmed that forces would remain where they were until there was a reaction from the Georgian government in Tblisi .
Colonel General Anatoly Nogovitsyn said they would retaliate against any "" provocation "" .
Denis Keefe , the British ambassador to Georgia , told BBC television : "" If this news that military operations are stopping is correct , then it is what this country needs and we can then get on to build peace . ""
This is a beautiful place with a wonderful people .
They do n't deserve the suffering that has been inflicted by military operations . ""
The reported halt to the Russian advance came as the French president , Nicholas Sarkozy , travelled to the capitals of Russia and Georgia in an attempt to mediate in the conflict .
Earlier , the Georgian president , Mikhail Saakashvili , said his country had been split in two as Russian forces continued to advance .
Saakashvili said the main east - west route through Georgia had been cut off , separating the east of the country from its western Black Sea coast .
He accused Moscow of "" ethnic cleansing "" in the breakaway province of Abkhazia , where local forces were today reported to be trying to remove Georgian troops from the northern area of the Kodori gorge .
The Abkhaz forces ' operation was announced by Sergei Shamba , the foreign minister of the Abkhaz separatist government , who said a UN observer mission in the area had been warned and had withdrawn .
"" Everything is developing according to plan , "" he said .
The UN and Nato were also meeting today as the west stepped up efforts to persuade Russia to agree a ceasefire with its US - backed neighbour .
Violence began in South Ossetia , the other Russian - backed separatist province in Georgia , last week .
However , Russian forces have advanced much further into Georgia and are now only a few hours from the capital , Tbilisi .
Moscow has denied it has any intention of marching on the city .
Saakhashvili has urged residents not to panic , saying they would have seven or eight hours ' warning of any impending troop advance .
Russian officials denied Georgian claims that soldiers had occupied the central town of Gori , which has been bombarded by air strikes .
Speaking after an emergency UN security council meeting last night , the Georgian UN ambassador , Irakli Alasania , said : "" A full military invasion of Georgia is going on . """
2008-08-12,"Condoleezza Rice , the US secretary of state , may have been hitting the phones in the crisis over Georgia , yet it is Nicolas Sarkozy who has emerged as the west 's point man in efforts to reach a diplomatic solution .
The hyperactive French president will meet his Russian counterpart , Dmitry Medvedev , before holding a news conference and then going on to Georgia to meet Mikhail Saakashvili , the Georgian leader , who has accused Moscow of trying to "" murder a small country "" .
With the US too close to Georgia , France has emerged as the honest broker in the conflict .
The Russian prime minister , Vladimir Putin - the man really calling the shots in this crisis - yesterday let fly at President Bush 's administration .
He was furious at the US airlift of Georgian troops to Tbilisi from Iraq , where they have been helping the Americans .
France 's moment in the diplomatic limelight stems partly from circumstance .
As the current holder of the rotating EU presidency , France can naturally be expected to take the lead in trying to defuse the crisis , which began with Georgia 's attempt to retake its breakaway province of South Ossetia .
But Sarkozy also fancies his chances of pulling off a diplomatic coup because of his good relations with Moscow .
France , along with Germany , opposed Bush 's move to put Georgia on a fast track to Nato membership at the Nato summit in Bucharest in April .
The French president was also one of the few European leaders to congratulate Putin on his party 's parliamentary election victory in a ballot that was widely criticised as unfair .
( Though of course , Bush thought Putin trustworthy after looking him in the eye when they first met , in 2001 . )
Sarkozy , who relishes being at the centre of attention , also has an eye on his poor poll ratings at home .
Last month , he managed to get Arab and Israeli leaders to sit at the same table for the launch of his Mediterranean Union project , so more diplomatic success could revive his fortunes on the home front .
Yet this is no mere vanity project for Sarkozy , and France has been putting in the diplomatic legwork .
The French foreign minister , Bernard Kouchner , has preceded his boss to the region .
France last night circulated a draft resolution at the UN security council calling for an "" immediate and unconditional cessation of hostilities and the complete withdrawal or Russian and Georgian forces "" before August 7 .
Other elements of the plan call for a humanitarian corridor and for a European peacekeeping force to replace the Russian "" peacekeepers "" , which have been deployed in South Ossetia since 1992 .
Eager for a lifeline out of the mess it has unwittingly created , Georgia has accepted the proposal .
But the Russians are not biting .
They are unhappy that the resolution , in the words of their ambassador to the UN , Vitaly Churkin , is "" too soft "" on Georgia , and contains "" no reference to Georgian aggression or Georgian atrocities "" .
The Russians are probably still working out how far they can push in pursuit of their goal of "" regime change "" in Georgia .
Putin , as has become all too evident , loathes the polished , US - educated Mikhail Saaskashvili and wants a leader in Tbilisi more willing to kowtow to the Kremlin .
The Russians hold all the cards and are in no hurry to end the crisis , although they say they have now stopped all military operations in Georgia .
Meanwhile , Sarkozy has all the familiar problems involved in trying to keep the EU 's 27 members marching in step .
Unsurprisingly , members formerly in the Soviet orbit - Poland and the three Baltic countries - want a complete review of relations with Russia ; with Ukraine , they want the strongest possible backing for Georgia .
"" Old Europe "" , on the other hand , which relies on Russia for 30 % of its gas supplies , does not want to antagonise Moscow .
Angela Merkel , the German chancellor , who is due to meet Medvedev in Sotchi , on the Black Sea , has thrown her support behind the French peace effort .
Germany is particularly dependent on Russia for its energy needs , and so is not going to condemn Moscow strongly .
And Silvio Berlusconi , the Italian leader and a man with his own authoritarian tendencies , has warned against an "" anti - Russian "" coalition in Europe .
Be that as it may , at some point there will be a diplomatic agreement in a form that may not be a million miles away from the French plan .
In which case , Sarkozy will not be shy in claiming credit for shuttle diplomacy .
The US , meanwhile , will have played only a bit part , and that fact will be seen as further evidence of its diminished status - in the waning days of the Bush administration , at least ."
2008-08-15,"Russia said today that South Ossetia and Abkhazia were unlikely to want to remain part of the Georgia as the war of words between Washington and Moscow grew more heated .
The Russian president , Dmitry Medvedev , said he respected the principle of territorial integrity but "" after what happened , it 's unlikely Ossetians and Abkhazians will ever be able to live together with Georgia in one state "" .
In Washington , George Bush demanded Moscow honour a commitment to get out of Georgia , declaring the country had chosen democracy and "" we wo n't cast them aside "" .
He said Georgia 's integrity and sovereignty must be respected and that a contentious relationship with the US was not in Moscow 's best interests .
"" Bullying and intimidation are not acceptable ways to conduct foreign policy in the 21st century , "" Bush said .
The US secretary of state , Condoleezza Rice , today arrived in Tbilisi to bolster Georgia after it was routed by Russia .
Medvedev , speaking in the Black Sea resort of Sochi where he had talks with the German chancellor , Angela Merkel , said : "" If someone continues to attack our citizens , our peacekeepers , we will of course respond in just the same way we have responded .
There should be no doubt about this . ""
Moscow appeared to raise the temperature further by saying Poland 's agreement to host a US missile defence system exposed it to attack .
Colonel General Anatoly Nogovitsyn , deputy head of the Russian general staff , was quoted by the news agency Interfax as saying : "" Poland , by deploying ( the system ) , is exposing itself to a strike – 100 % .
"" Earlier , he had reiterated Russia 's warning that placing missile defence structures in Poland and the Czech Republic would bring an unspecified military response .
Poland agreed last night to station interceptor rockets at missile silos as part of a US missile defence shield in the Baltic region .
The US says the shield is aimed at Iran , but Russia 's Nato ambassador , Dmitry Rogozin , told Reuters news agency that "" the fact that this was signed in a period of very difficult crisis in the relations between Russia and the United States over the situation in Georgia shows that of course the missile defence system will be deployed not against Iran but the strategic potential of Russia "" .
Merkel said some of Russia 's actions against Georgia over South Ossetia had been "" disproportionate "" and Russian troops should withdraw from central areas in Georgia .
Washington has warned that the fighting could set back Moscow 's relations with the west for years , but has ruled out engaging militarily in the region .
Rice 's visit came after the US sent military transport planes with humanitarian and medical supplies to Georgia , coupled with a warning from Bush to Russia not to obstruct the aid effort .
Despite a draft French - brokered ceasefire requiring Russian and Georgian forces to return to pre - conflict positions , Moscow 's forces today remained deep in Georgian territory well outside the disputed regions of South Ossetia and Abkhazia .
Georgia has not formally signed the ceasefire agreement , which allows Russian peacekeepers to remain in South Ossetia .
Russian troops were today still blocking the entrance to Gori , which sits on Georgia 's main east - west road , although they allowed in some humanitarian supplies .
Georgia 's president , Mikheil Saakashvili , warned that "" Russia 's invasion of Georgia strikes at the heart of western values "" .
In an article for the Washington Post , reprinted in today 's Guardian , he said : "" If the international community allows Russia to crush our democratic independent state , it will be giving carte blanche to authoritarian governments everywhere .
"" Russia has dismissed western insistence that Georgia 's territorial integrity forms the basis of any settlement of the conflict .
The Kremlin 's stance has fuelled fears that it is determined to annex South Ossetia and Abkhazia .
Human Rights Watch said today it had collected evidence of Russian warplanes using cluster bombs against civilians in Georgia .
Military aircraft killed at least 11 civilians and injured dozens of others in Gori and the village of Ruisi on Tuesday , the group said .
This was denied by the Russian general staff ."
2008-08-16,"The Russian president , Dmitry Medvedev , has signed a ceasfire pact brokered by the French to end hostilities in Georgia .
George Bush today said the development was "" a hopeful step , "" but added : "" Now Russia needs to honour the agreement and withdraw its forces and of course end military operations .
"" Foreign secretary David Miliband welcomed the declaration but added that Russian "" aggression "" against Georgia and threats to neighbouring states , such as Poland , were unacceptable .
The Russians had been refusing to pull back their forces in Georgia until Georgian president Mikheil Saakashvili signed the six - point ceasefire plan arranged by President Nicolas Sarkozy of France earlier this week -although they had refused to sign it themselves .
Saakashvili reluctantly signed the plan yesterday – which calls for Russian troops to pull back but also grants them limited patrols inside Georgia , while accusing the Russians of being "" evil "" and "" 21st century barbarians "" .
Kremlin sources have now confirmed that Russia has signed the pact .
"" The president informed participants of the security council meeting that he had just now signed the six - point plan , "" said the Kremlin 's chief spokeswoman , Natalia Timakova .
Under the plan , some emotive issues remain open to interpretation – including whether Georgia is able to send troops back into areas of South Ossetia .
The ceasefire agreement should prompt international talks to define the status of South Ossetia and Abkhazia .
Meanwhile , the risk of a new era of east - west confrontation triggered by Russia 's invasion of Georgia heightened yesterday when Moscow reserved the right to launch a nuclear attack on Poland because it agreed to host US rockets as part of the Pentagon 's missile shield .
Miliband welcomed Medvedev 's signing of the peace plan and said the priority was to ensure that commitments made in the agreement were "" speedily and fully implemented "" .
Earlier , Washington accused Russia of "" bullying and intimidation "" in Georgia , Russia 's deputy chief of staff turned on Warsaw and said it was vulnerable to a Russian rocket attack because of Thursday 's pact with the US on the missile defence project . ""
By deploying , Poland is exposing itself to a strike - 100 % , "" warned Colonel General Anatoly Nogovitsyn .
He added that Russia 's security doctrine allowed it to use nuclear weapons against an active ally of a nuclear power such as America .
The warning worsened the already dismal mood in relations between Moscow and the west caused by the shock of post - Soviet Russia 's first invasion of a foreign country .
There were scant signs of military activity on the ground in Georgia , but nor were there any signs of the Russian withdrawal pledged on Tuesday under ceasefire terms mediated by the European Union .
Instead , the focus was on a flurry of diplomatic activity that exposed acute differences on how Washington and Berlin see the crisis in the Caucasus .
Condoleezza Rice , the US secretary of state , went to Tbilisi to bolster Georgia against the Russians as President George Bush denounced Russian "" bullying and intimidation "" as "" unacceptable "" .
Angela Merkel , the German chancellor , met Russia 's President Dmitry Medvedev on the Black Sea close to Georgia 's borders and sent quite a different message , offering a mild rebuke of Moscow .
"" Some of Russia 's actions were not proportionate , "" she said .
Unlike the Americans and some European states who are saying the Russians should face "" consequences "" for their invasion , Merkel said negotiations with Moscow on a whole range of issues would continue as before and spread the blame for the conflict .
"" It is rare that all the blame is on one side .
In fact , both sides are probably to blame .
That is very important to understand , "" she said .
In Tbilisi , Rice was much more forthright , saying that the invasion had "" profound implications for Russia ...
This calls into question what role Russia really plans to play in international politics .
"" You ca n't be a responsible member of institutions which are democratic and underscore democratic values and on the other hand act in this way against one of your neighbours . ""
Saakashvili said : "" Russia has every time been testing the reaction of the west .
It 's going to replicate what happened in Georgia elsewhere , "" said Saakashvili .
"" We are looking evil directly in the eye .
Today this evil is very strong , and very dangerous for everybody , not just for us . ""
Rice 's show of solidarity with Georgia 's beleaguered president was theatrically undermined when Russia dispatched a column of armoured personnel carriers towards the Georgian capital .
As the talks were taking place , 10 armoured personnel carriers laden with Russian troops set off from Gori , penetrating to within 20 miles of Tbilisi . ""
Georgia has been attacked .
Russian forces need to leave Georgia at once , "" said Rice .
The withdrawal "" must take place , and take place now ...
This is no longer 1968 , "" she added in reference to the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia 40 years ago next week .
The ceasefire terms favour the Russians who routed the Georgians .
But the secretary of state argued the plan would not affect negotiations over the central territorial dispute between Georgia and the two breakaway pro - Russian provinces of Abkhazia and South Ossetia .
The deal allows Russian troops to remain in the two provinces and to mount patrols and "" take additional security measures "" on Georgian territory beyond the two enclaves .
Senior Russians continued to insist yesterday that Russian troops had not stepped outside South Ossetia and Abkhazia despite the fact they have been deep inside Georgian territory in several places all week .
"" Our ground forces never crossed the border of the conflict zone , "" said Sergei Ivanov , the deputy prime minister .
Moscow also indicated it would resist possible European attempts to deploy international peacekeepers in the contested territories .
"" We are not against international peacekeepers , "" the Russian president said .
"" But the problem is that the Abkhazians and the Ossetians do not trust anyone except Russian peacekeepers . ""
He also attacked the agreement between Washington and Warsaw on the missile shield and said claims that the shield was aimed at Iran were "" fairy tales "" "" This clearly demonstrates the deployment of new anti - missile forces in Europe has as its aim the Russian Federation , "" said Medvedev .
"" The moment has been well chosen . ""
The timing of Thursday 's agreement on missile defence means that tensions are soaring on Russia 's southern and western borders .
Polish armed forces yesterday paraded in Warsaw to mark a rare defeat of the Russians 888 years ago and President Lech Kaczynski hailed the accord on the Pentagon project as a boost for Poland 's security .
In return for hosting 10 interceptor rockets said to be intended to destroy any eventual ballistic missile attacks from Iran , Poland is to receive a battery of US Patriot missiles for its air defences and has won a mutual security pact with Washington ."
2008-08-17,"Russia said today that a withdrawal of troops from the separatist - held Georgian region of South Ossetia was "" being considered "" , but denied reports that the pullout had begun .
The commander of Russian forces in Georgia said earlier that some troops were moving out of South Ossetia .
Speaking outside the strategic Georgian city of Gori , Major General Vyachislav Borisov told the Associated Press that a "" planned withdrawal "" approved by the Russian president , Dmitry Medvedev , was under way .
Minutes later , a spokesman for the Russian defence ministry said a withdrawal was under consideration but had not yet started .
The South Ossetian interior minister , Mikhail Mindzayev , speaking by phone from the Ossetian capital , Tskhinvali , also denied a withdrawal was under way .
Alexander Lomaia , the head of Georgia 's national security council , said Russian tanks remained in Gori and were "" moving deeper "" within the country .
The German chancellor , Angela Merkel , who held talks with Medvedev on Friday , was travelling to Georgia today to meet President Mikhail Saakashvili amid western diplomatic efforts to end the crisis .
Yesterday , Medvedev signed a ceasefire agreement to end the bloody 10-day - old war , but gave no clear indication of when he would begin to withdraw Russian troops .
In a snub to the United States , which has demanded that Moscow remove its armed forces from Georgia immediately , Medvedev said the Russian military would remain until "" extra security measures "" were in place .
The Russian foreign minister , Sergei Lavrov , gave no timetable for a pullout .
He said Moscow would withdraw once security measures had been carried out in the conflict zone - the breakaway enclaves of South Ossetia and Abkhazia .
Last night , the US president , George Bush , cautiously welcomed Russia 's apparent commitment .
He described the ceasefire deal , also signed by Saakashvili on Friday , as a "" helpful step "" .
Bush reaffirmed his commitment to Georgia 's battered territorial integrity , saying the issue was not up for debate .
The British foreign secretary , David Miliband , praised the ceasefire move but said he was "" concerned "" by reports of continuing Russian military action .
Yesterday , Georgia claimed Russia was still destroying its civilian and military infrastructure .
It said Russian soldiers had blown up a railway line near the town of Kaspi , outside Tbilisi - severing the last railway link between the east and west of the country .
Moscow denied this .
Russian military helicopters also attacked Borjomi national park - setting fire to huge areas of protected forest , Georgian officials said .
Borjomi , a popular spa town since Tsarist times , is home to endangered species , including bears .
Medvedev signed yesterday 's agreement in the Russian Black Sea resort of Sochi , 20 km from the border with Abkhazia , Georgia 's second breakaway province .
Analysts said they expected Russia to absorb Abkhazia and South Ossetia into the Russian Federation - possibly within days .
Both territories are likely to hold referendums calling for a formal association with Russia .
The six - point ceasefire agreement , which was drafted by the French president , Nicolas Sarkozy , in his role as EU president , authorises Russia to carry out "" additional security measures on a temporary basis "" until an international peacekeeping force arrives in Georgia .
This requires a UN resolution .
There are growing claims of atrocities committed by irregular militias , to which the Russian forces are accused of turning a blind eye .
The Observer has witnessed half a dozen assaults and robberies of civilians and journalists by mercenaries in the past five days ."
2008-08-17,"The French president , Nicholas Sarkozy , today warned Russia of "" serious consequences "" if it failed to honour its pledge to begin withdrawing its troops from the separatist - held Georgian region of South Ossetia tomorrow .
Sarkozy 's warning was reiterated by the US secretary of state , Condoleezza Rice , and the German chancellor , Angela Merkel , as Russia came under intense international pressure to support the ceasefire it signed on Friday .
Sarkozy , who drafted the truce agreement in his role as EU president , warned the Russian president , Dmitry Medvedev , that failure to pull out under a ceasefire deal would have "" serious consequences "" for Russia 's ties with the EU .
Sarkozy 's office said he had told Medvedev there must be a "" withdrawal , without delay "" of all Russian military forces in Georgia .
His office said Medvedev had promised the troop withdrawal would begin tomorrow at around midday .
The two men spoke by telephone yesterday , but details of their conversation were only revealed this afternoon .
His warning was followed by strong criticism from Rice , who accused Medvedev of failing to honour his pledge to withdraw troops quickly .
"" I hope he intends to honour the pledge this time , "" Rice said on the US TV show Meet the Press .
She said the Russians had said earlier in the crisis that they would start pulling troops from Georgia but had not done so . ""
This time I hope he means it ...
people are going to begin to wonder if Russia can be trusted .
"" The US defence secretary , Robert Gates , stepped up the hardline rhetoric , saying he believed Russia was showing signs of returning to its authoritarian past .
He said its actions would require the US to re - evaluate its relationship with Moscow .
On a visit to Georgia to meet President Mikhail Saakashvili , Merkel called for "" very fast "" Russian withdrawal from Georgia and gave strong support to Georgia , saying it was on track to become a member of Nato .
The announcement of a Russian timetable for withdrawal followed a morning of conflicting reports about whether or not the Russian pull - out had begun .
The commander of Russian forces in Georgia said some troops were moving out of South Ossetia .
Speaking outside the strategic Georgian city of Gori , Major General Vyachislav Borisov told the Associated Press that a "" planned withdrawal "" approved by the Russian president was under way .

Pope Benedict expressed hope that the ceasefire would turn into a stable peace , and called for the urgent opening of humanitarian corridors between Georgia and South Ossetia .
According to the United Nations refugee agency UNHCR , nearly 100,000 people have been driven from their homes by the conflict .

2008-08-21,"The Georgian president , Mikheil Saakashvili , said today he did not believe Russia would withdraw from his country in the coming days as promised , but the most Georgia could do in response was offer "" passive resistance "" .
The Russian army has been reducing its presence in some of the towns it has occupied , but is reportedly taking new territory and holding positions within 30 miles of the capital .
The Russian president , Dmitry Medvedev , yesterday told his French counterpart , Nicolas Sarkozy , that Russian troops would withdraw from most of Georgia by Friday .
Some would go to Russia , according to the Kremlin , and others to South Ossetia and the security zone that extends four miles into Georgia along the South Ossetian border .
There has been little or no change in the positions the Russians hold near the capital , or throughout much of the region .
Saakashvili said that while Russia was withdrawing troops in some places , "" they are going around now and trying to grab new strategic areas in Georgia "" .
He repeated his plea for help from the international community .
"" We still expect more , "" he said .
"" We still believe this is not all , that this is just a beginning .
"" What we 're seeing now is a clear regrouping and also , again , some kind of deception campaign , saying ' Look , we 're moving out ' , "" Saakashvili said , adding that the Russians were "" making fun of the world "" .
Should the Russian occupation continue , he said , Georgians might begin peaceful protests and "" passive resistance "" .
He said Georgians would "" hold hands together ... and they will reconstruct "" .
Russia was "" dreaming to turn my country into Chechnya - into some kind of insurgency warfare field where they go around and operate with brutal force "" .
While the majority of Georgians supported Saakashvili 's government during the fighting , this could change if the occupation continues and the 158,000 people who have been displaced are unable to return to their homes .
Saakashvili said the popularity of his government would "" depend on how we will perform , how well we rebuild .
The last thing I 'm worried about is about my political future right now . """
2008-08-22,"Russian troops have started withdrawing from the city of Gori , Georgia 's security council chief said today .
Alexander Lomaia made the announcement at about 4 pm local time but it will not be possible for the pledge by the Russian president , Dmitry Medvedev , to remove all troops by the end of today to be met .
The confirmation of the start of the Russian withdrawal came after Gori 's regional governor , Vladimir Vardzelashvili , said 40 Russian military vehicles had left the city , heading north to South Ossetia .
However , a Russian general has warned that it could be 10 days before the bulk of Russian troops have left Georgia .
Their departure from Gori was met with joy among the population .
"" It 's such a relief , "" said one 68-year - old resident .
"" I was waiting for this day and finally I see the Russians leaving my home town .
I 'm so happy . ""
Gori 's position , deep within Georgian territory , made it a strategically important place to hold for the Russians and they had dug in , running checkpoints outside the city and on Georgia 's main east - to - west road , which skirts the city .
Earlier , the UN 's top official for refugees called for people who had fled the conflict in South Ossetia to be allowed to return home .
In the first visit to Georgia 's breakaway province by a senior UN official , the high commissioner for refugees , Antonio Guterres , and the Russian foreign minister , Sergei Lavrov , agreed on the principle that all civilians should have the right to return home , a UNHCR statement said .
The UN estimates 158,000 people have been displaced since fighting broke out on August 7 over South Ossetia .
About 80,000 displaced people are being housed in more than 600 centres in and around the Georgian capital , Tbilisi .
More than $ 11 m ( £ 5.9 m ) in aid has been flown in , such as prepared meals , blankets , cots , mattresses and portable showers .
Humanitarian aid is getting to Gori , but Henrietta Fore , the head of USAid , said the Russian military must open safe corridors to let aid workers and more supplies get through .
Workers did manage to get into Gori yesterday to hand out supplies . ""
The distribution of food and hygiene kits went well
—
that is just one day , but it 's a step in the right direction , "" Fore said .
She said USAid 's own people must be allowed into the Russian - held area to increase supplies and assess the situation .
"" We 've been calling on the Russians for access , "" she said , adding there had not been a reply .
In Igoeti , a major checkpoint on the road from Tbilisi to Gori , Russian troops were allowing aid organisations and local traffic through .
Red Cross vehicles , mine - clearing jeeps and trucks carrying peaches were seen heading into Gori .
Further west , near a base at the key Black Sea port of Poti , Russian troops were seen digging large trenches by a bridge that provides the only access to the city .
Five trucks , several armoured personnel carriers and a helicopter were parked nearby .
Another Russian position was seen in woods outside the city .
Lomaia said Russia 's control of key roads aimed to "" suffocate us economically "" and "" steer anger among the population , which can be channelled toward the government of this country "" .
While refugees from the fighting crammed Georgian schools and office buildings in and around Tbilisi , a scattering of people left in deserted villages were badly in need of basics .
"" There is no bread , there is no food , no medicine .
People are dying , "" said Nina Meladze , 45 , in the village of Nadarbazevi , outside Gori .
She stayed while others fled to Tbilisi because she could not leave elderly relatives .
She said the village had been virtually abandoned since the war broke out .
"" I can not go on like this any more , I cry every day , "" she said .
The UN security council has remained deadlocked over Georgia , unable to agree on a resolution or statement on the crisis , which erupted two weeks ago .
Russia has put a draft resolution before the council endorsing a six - point peace plan brokered by Nicolas Sarkozy , the French president .
Western countries say the Russian draft is unacceptable as it does not mention Georgia 's territorial integrity or spell out where Russian forces will be deployed in future .
Most importantly , the west says , Russia has so far made no substantial withdrawal ."
2008-08-25,"Russia was last night on another collision course with the west after Russian MPs voted unanimously to back independence for Georgia 's two breakaway republics of Abkhazia and South Ossetia .
The move - which requires the approval of Russia 's president , Dmitry Medvedev - gives a strong domestic legal basis for the Kremlin to take control of the areas after Russia 's invasion of Georgia this month .
Russia 's upper house , or Federation Council , voted by 130 - 0 to call on Medvedev to support South Ossetia and Abkhazia 's independence .
The Duma passed the same motion by 447 - 0 .
Both houses are known for their slavish loyalty to the Kremlin .
The US and the EU swiftly denounced the vote .
George Bush said he was "" deeply concerned "" by the move , and the White House said the vice - president , Dick Cheney , would visit Tbilisi next week .
The EU said the breakaway regions should remain in Georgia .
The German government called the move "" in no way appropriate to either calming or defusing tensions "" .
But there were strong signs last night that Moscow remains unmoved by the threat of western sanctions , which have been growing since Russia invaded Georgia after Georgia 's military incursion into South Ossetia this month .
The US , France , Britain and other EU countries are considering punitive measures .
These include ending Nato cooperation with Moscow , freezing Russia 's application to join the World Trade Organisation , and suspending its participation in G8 summits .
Speaking in the Black Sea resort of Sochi , however , Medvedev yesterday suggested he would be unconcerned if Nato chose to sever ties .
This would be "" no great loss "" , he said .
"" If they choose to break off this relationship , even the whole of it , nothing terrible will happen . ""
Medvedev 's comments signal a further deterioration in Russia 's fraught relations with the west .
The French president , Nicolas Sarkozy , has convened a special EU meeting on Georgia on Monday to consider future relations with Moscow .
The meeting comes amid growing dismay at Russia 's failure to comply with the ceasefire agreement and pull out all of its troops .
Russia has previously stopped short of recognising the regions ' independence .
But Moscow is likely to use the votes to pressure the international community into accepting Abkhazia and South Ossetia as no different from Kosovo - whose US - backed declaration of independence in February was vehemently opposed by Russia and Serbia .
The Russian foreign minister , Sergei Lavrov , recently indicated a change by saying that Georgia could "" forget about "" its territorial integrity .
But promoting separatism in the Caucasus holds dangers for Russia , which faces growing insurgencies in its southern republics and has fought two brutal wars combating separatism in Chechnya .
One analyst said it was unlikely that the Kremlin would unilaterally recognise South Ossetian and Abkhazian independence . ""
This would be more troublesome and problematic for Russia , "" said Fyodor Lukyanov , the editor - in - chief of the journal Russia in Global Affairs .
Russia 's preferred "" scenario "" would be for the two to eventually win Kosovo - style acceptance , he said , rather than suffer the unresolved fate of Turkish - backed northern Cyprus .
"" My guess is that this vote is a means to achieve better conditions for international negotiations , "" he added .
Georgia 's national security council secretary , Alexander Lomaia , said the Kremlin would isolate itself if it recognised the regions , which have enjoyed de facto independence since the early 1990s .
"" If it does this , Russia will further isolate itself from the entire world , and will force the international community to seek more active ways to restore the territorial integrity of Georgia , "" he told Reuters .
Georgia yesterday said Russian troops continued to occupy much of the country .
In the Black Sea port of Poti , south of Abkhazia , Russian soldiers drove into the port terminal and took away computers and photocopiers in armoured personnel carriers , Georgian officials said .
The deputy chief of Russia 's army staff , Colonel - General Anatoly Nogovitsyn , said his troops were merely performing peacekeeping duties , adding that the EU - brokered ceasefire deal allowed them to be there , despite the fact that it calls for Russian forces to return to the positions they occupied before the war started .
He said Russian troops were needed in Poti , not least because of the arrival in the area of Nato ships : "" The fact that there are nine western warships in the Black Sea can not but be a cause for concern . ""
Market verdict Russia is facing another chastening reprimand , this time from the financial markets .
The main stock index has fallen 20 % in the last month , dipping yesterday to its lowest level since November 2006 .
The rouble is also under pressure .
Georgia is not the only factor , but it has clearly rattled the markets .
However , Russia is a long way from a repeat of its financial meltdown , the 10th anniversary of which recently passed almost unnoticed ."
2008-08-25,"Russia 's president Dmitry Medvedev today said it would be "" no great loss "" if Nato decided to call off its relationship with Moscow , adding that the Kremlin was unconcerned by possible sanctions from the west over its invasion of Georgia .
Medvedev said ties with Nato had "" worsened sharply "" following the war in Georgia earlier this month , which he said came from Georgian "" aggression "" .
"" We are ready to take any decision [ from Nato ] , up to halting relations altogether , "" Medvedev declared .
Speaking in Sochi , where he was meeting Russia 's hawkish ambassador to Nato , Dmitry Rogozin , Medvedev said "" collaboration "" with Nato was more in the alliance 's interests than Russia 's . ""
If this breaks nothing terrible will happen to us , "" he noted .
Medvedev 's comments signal a further deterioration in Russia 's already fraught relations with the west .
He spoke after MPs from Russia 's upper and lower houses voted this morning to back independence for Georgia 's breakaway regions of South Ossetia and Abkhazia .
France 's president Nicholas Sarkozy has convened a special EU meeting on Georgia to consider future relations with Moscow .
It comes amid growing European dismay at Russia 's failure to comply with the ceasefire agreement and pull out all of its troops .
The US vice president , Dick Cheney , will also visit Tbilisi next week .
Yesterday the Germans - who together with the rest of the EU , continue to insist on Georgia 's territorial integrity - condemned the Russian votes as unhelpful .
They were "" in no way appropriate to either calming or defusing tensions , "" the German government said .
Russia 's upper house , or Federation Council , voted 130 - 0 to call on Medvedev to support South Ossetia and Abkhazia 's independence .
The Duma passed the same motion 447 - 0 .
Both houses are known for their slavish loyalty to the Kremlin .
Several MPs compared Georgia 's president Mikheil Saakashvili to Hitler - likening his incursion earlier this month into South Ossetia to the Nazi 's 1941 invasion of the Soviet Union .
The Abkhaz leader Sergei Bagapsh thanked Medvedev for his "" courageous "" support , adding : "" It 's a historic day .
"" Russia has previously stopped short of recognizing the regions ' independence .
But Moscow is now likely to use the votes to pressure the international community to accept that Abkhazia and South Ossetia are no different from Kosovo - which won US - backed independence in February , despite vehement opposition from Russia and Belgrade .
Russia 's foreign minister , Sergei Lavrov , recently indicated a change by saying that Georgia could "" forget about "" its territorial integrity .
But promoting separatism in the Caucasus holds dangers for Russia - which faces growing insurgencies in its own southern ethnic republics , and has fought two brutal wars battling separatism in Chechnya .

2008-08-26,"Russia has stepped up its defiance of the west by recognising the independence of South Ossetia and Abkhazia , Georgia 's two breakaway provinces .
Less than three weeks after Russia and Georgia went to war over South Ossetia , Dmitry Medvedev , the Russian president , said in a televised announcement : "" I have signed decrees on the recognition by the Russian Federation of the independence of South Ossetia and the independence of Abkhazia . ""
Georgia condemned Medvedev 's declaration .
"" This is an unconcealed annexation of these territories , which are a part of Georgia , "" said Giga Bokeria , the deputy foreign minister .
Western leaders followed suit , with some of the strongest language coming from the German chancellor , Angela Merkel , who called it "" absolutely unacceptable "" but called for dialogue to be maintained with Russia .
The US secretary of state , Condoleezza Rice , said Russia 's move was regrettable .
She said Abkhazia and South Ossetia were part of Georgia "" and it will remain so "" .
The British foreign secretary , David Miliband , said Russian recognition of Georgia 's breakaway regions was "" unjustifiable and unacceptable "" .
A Foreign Office spokesman said : "" We reject this categorically and reaffirm Georgia 's sovereignty and territorial integrity .
This is contrary to obligations that Russia has repeatedly taken on in [ UN ] security council resolutions .
It does nothing to improve the prospects for peace in the Caucasus . ""
France , which holds the rotating presidency of the EU , reiterated its commitment to Georgia 's territorial integrity .
It has called a meeting of EU leaders to discuss the crisis next Monday .
There was jubilation in Abkhazia where people fired into the air , opened bottles of champagne and wept with joy .
In Sukhumi , Abkhazia 's capital on the Black Sea coast , office workers spilled into the streets moments after Medvedev made his announcement .
"" We feel happy .
We all have tears in our eyes .
We feel pride for our people , "" Aida Gubaz , a 38-year - old lawyer , told Reuters .
"" Everything we went through , now we are getting our reward . "" There were similar scenes in Tskhinvali , the capital of South Ossetia , where a Reuters photographer heard celebratory gunfire on the city 's outskirts .
Both houses of Russia 's parliament yesterday unanimously adopted resolutions urging Medvedev to recognise the independence of South Ossetia and Abkhazia , but the Russian government had been expected to move more cautiously .
Some analysts thought Russia 's preferred scenario was for the two provinces to eventually win Kosovo - style acceptance , rather than face an unresolved status like Turkish - occupied northern Cyprus .
George Bush , the US president , yesterday expressed his deep concern at the parliamentary votes and urged the Russian government not to recognise the regions .
The two provinces rebelled against Georgian rule after the collapse of the Soviet Union and have had de facto independence since the early 1990s .
Russia 's envoy to Nato , Dmitry Rogozin , compared the tension between Russia and the west to the eve of the first world war , saying a new freeze in relations was inevitable . ""
The current atmosphere reminds me of the situation in Europe in 1914 ... when because of one terrorist , leading world powers clashed , "" Rogozin told the RBK Daily business newspaper .
"" I hope Mikheil Saakashvili [ the president of Georgia ] will not go down in history as a new Gavrilo Princip . ""
He was referring to the assassin of the Austro - Hungarian archduke Franz Ferdinand .
The influential daily Kommersant ran as its front page headline "" Russia 's leaders quarrel with the west "" .
Below was a photo of Medvedev taking aim with a Kalashnikov gun during a visit to a weapons factory this year .
Two US warships are due to deliver humanitarian supplies tomorrow to the Georgian port of Poti , where hundreds of Russian troops are manning checkpoints in so - called security zones . ""
At the request of the Georgian government , these ships will be delivering humanitarian aid to Poti , "" a spokesman for the US embassy said today . ""
The USS McFaul and another US ship will dock in Poti on Wednesday .
"" In another show of support for Georgia , the White House announced that Dick Cheney , the US vice - president and a critic of Russia , would visit Georgia next week as part of a trip to former Soviet states seeking closer links with the west .
Tension remains high in Poti on the Black Sea coast as Russia has left many troops in place despite withdrawals from most of Georgia last week .
Russian media reported that the guided missile cruiser Moskva , flagship of the Russian Black Sea fleet , put to sea again from its Crimean base for what the navy described as a routine training exercise to test weapons and onboard systems .
Russia has pulled back most of its forces from Georgia proper but has angered the west by keeping troops in a large buffer zone around the two rebel regions , saying they are required as peacekeepers .
The west says the size of the buffer zones violates the terms of a French - brokered ceasefire and has called on Russia to withdraw without delay .
Georgian and Russian forces have been locked in a standoff in the village of Mosabruni near the edge of South Ossetia , about 30 miles north - west of the Georgian capital , Tbilisi .
"" We are afraid our children will be killed , "" said a Georgian villager , Iza Mikhanishvili , 31 .
"" There are Georgian forces on one side , Ossetians on the other .
Yes , they are peacekeepers , but we are afraid every single night that something will happen .
The only thing we want is peace .
I do n't care who we are with . """
2008-08-27,"The British foreign secretary , David Miliband , today said Russia must not start a new cold war as he accused Moscow of trying to redraw the map of Europe in the wake of the war in Georgia .
Miliband was speaking in Kiev , the capital of Ukraine , a Russian neighbour that , like Georgia , wants to join Nato .
The Russian president , Dmitry Medvedev , yesterday defied the west by recognising as independent the breakaway Georgian provinces of South Ossetia and Abkhazia . ""
The Georgia crisis has provided a rude awakening , "" Miliband said in a speech to students . ""
The sight of Russian tanks in a neighbouring country on the 40th anniversary of the crushing of the Prague spring has shown that the temptations of power politics remain . ""
The old sores and divisions fester .
And Russia is not yet reconciled to the new map of this region .
Yesterday 's unilateral attempt to redraw the map marks a moment of real significance .
""
The Russian president says he is not afraid of a new cold war .
We do n't want one .
He has a big responsibility not to start one . ""
But Miliband again reiterated his opposition to Russia 's explusion from the G8 group of leading industrialised countries .
The German chancellor , Angela Merkel , today spoke to Medvedev by phone and told him the presence of Russian troops in parts of Georgia was a grave violation of the ceasefire deal between the countries .
It was the first contact between the Kremlin and the west since Medvedev surprised the world by recognising Georgia 's separatist provinces - a stance Merkel sharply condemned . ""
The chancellor renewed her call for the immediate enforcement of the six - point [ ceasefire ] plan , "" said Merkel 's spokesman , Ulrich Wilhelm .
The Kremlin said Medvedev had assured Merkel he remained committed to the ceasefire with Georgia under which Russia agreed to withdraw most of its forces .
The two provinces yesterday reacted with jubilation to the Russian recognition of their independence .
Georgia today said it was withdrawing all but two of its diplomats from Mosco .
Timur Yakobashvili , a government minister , said the Georgian ambassador would not return to the Russian capital .
Russia 's short war with Georgia has sparked nervousness in Ukraine , which wants closer ties to the west .
The Ukrainian president , Viktor Yushchenko , said Russia 's decision to recognise the Georgian rebel regions was "" unacceptable "" and threatened security in countries that were once part of the Soviet Union .
The French foreign minister , Bernard Kouchner , warned that Russia could have its eye on other neighbouring countries , such as Ukraine and Moldova .
France , which holds the rotating EU presidency , has called an emergency meeting of EU leaders to review the relationship between Russia and Europe next week .
Kouchner told Europe 1 radio it was "" not impossible "" that Russia would now regularly choose to confront the west rather than cooperate with it . ""
There are other objectives that one can suppose are objectives for Russia , in particular the Crimea , Ukraine and Moldova , "" he said .
Like Georgia , Ukraine has a pro - western president and a large Russian - speaking population , but it is much bigger than Georgia .
Russia 's Black Sea fleet is docked at the port of Sevastopol in the Crimea , southern Ukraine , under a lease that runs until 2017 , and most people who live there are ethnic Russians .
Yushchenko said Ukraine may try to increase the cost of leasing the Sevastopol base to the Black Sea fleet - a renegotiation Moscow said would break a 1997 agreement .
Medvedev has been accused of inflaming the crisis with his declaration that Russia was "" not afraid of anything , including the prospect of a new cold war "" .
But he told a news agency : "" We do n't want it , and in this situation everything depends on the position of our partners . ""
He said the west would have to "" understand the reason behind "" the decision to recognise the regions if it wanted to preserve good relations with Russia .
Medvedev is hoping to drum up support from eastern allies at a summit of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation ( SCO ) tomorrow .
But Moscow 's allies in the former Soviet Union , Asia and elsewhere , who traditionally side with the Kremlin against the west on contentious issues , are not expected to give their backing at the summit in Tajikistan 's capital , Dushanbe .
The biggest prize for Russia would be to win the support of China when Medvedev meets the Chinese president , Hu Jintao , at the summit , but Alexey Mukhin , the head of the Centre of Political Information thinktank , said this would not happen . ""
China , which has its own separatists , will be the biggest problem , "" he said .
"" The recognition of Abkhazia and South Ossetia is unacceptable for Beijing . """
2008-08-28,"Britain will not accept the redrawing of Europe into spheres of influence , the foreign secretary said today , as he kept the diplomatic pressure on Russia after its recognition of Georgia 's breakaway provinces .
David Miliband 's comments on BBC Radio 4 's Today programme followed a tough statement signed by himself , the foreign ministers of the US , Canada , France , Germany , Italy and Japan , deploring Moscow 's "" excessive use of military force "" in Georgia .
The statement , described as an "" unprecedented step "" by the Foreign Office , followed a warning from Miliband delivered in Kiev , the Ukrainian capital , to the Russian president , Dmitry Medvedev , that he bore a "" big responsibility "" not to provoke a new cold war .
Miliband said Russia 's approach was "" anathema "" and belonged to the second world war era of Yalta .
He rejected the argument that Nato was an offensive alliance seeking to encircle Russia .
The 1945 agreement at the Yalta conference , between the leaders of Britain , the US and the Soviet Union , saw each of the allied powers given a sphere of influence on the globe , with eastern Europe falling under Moscow .
In their joint statement , the foreign ministers said Moscow 's recognition of South Ossetia and Abkhazia violated Georgia 's integrity and sovereignty .
"" We ... condemn the action of our fellow G8 member .
Russia 's recognition of the independence of South Ossetia and Abkhazia violates the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Georgia and is contrary to UN security council resolutions supported by Russia . ""
Miliband said he went to Ukraine yesterday because it was important to say to a friendly country that "" we support their democratic choices "" .
The foreign secretary reiterated Britain 's support for Ukraine 's wish to be in Nato and rebuked Russia for treating its neighbours as if they were either "" your enemy of vassal "" .
Miliband , tipped as a future Labour party leader and potential prime minister , went to Kiev to deliver a speech aimed at flying the flag of western democracy on Russia 's doorstep , while seeking to avert a new crisis boiling over on the Crimean peninsula , home to an ethnic Russian population and Moscow 's Black Sea fleet .
The speech represented the strongest criticism of the Kremlin from a leading European government official in years , delivered in a country that is Russia 's neighbour and which Russians view as the cradle of their civilisation .
Miliband declared a turning point had been reached in Europe 's relations with Russia after nearly two decades of relative tranquility .
He said Tuesday 's decision by the Russian president , Dmitry Medvedev , to recognise Georgia 's breakaway regions of Abkhazia and South Ossetia represented a radical break and a moment of truth for the rest of Europe . ""
[ Medvedev 's ] unilateral attempt to redraw the map marks a moment of real significance , "" the foreign secretary said yesterday .
"" It is not just the end of the post - cold war period of growing geopolitical calm in and around Europe .
It is also the moment when countries are required to set out where they stand on the significant issues of nationhood and international law . ""
The Georgia crisis has provided a rude awakening . ""
He responded to Medvedev 's boast that he was not scared of a new cold war , saying : "" We do n't want a new cold war .
He has a big responsibility not to start one .
While Miliband delivered his broadside in Kiev , his French counterpart , Bernard Kouchner , warned that Ukraine - as well as Moldova , which also has a pro - Russian breakaway region , Transnistria - could become the next targets of a newly assertive Russia .
Ukrainian officials say Russia has been distributing passports to ethnic Russians living in Crimea , as it did in South Ossetia .
They fear that a row over the use of the base may be employed to stir up separatist sentiment as a precursor to calling for a referendum on seceding from Ukraine .
Kiev is also concerned that Russia could orchestrate a conflict over its Black Sea fleet , which is based in the Crimean port of Sevastopol under a lease agreement with Ukraine .
Viktor Yushchenko , the Ukrainian president , has riled Moscow by suggesting that Russia should pay a higher rent for Sevastopol and could be subject to more stringent conditions on its use .
Miliband urged the Ukrainian government to "" stick to the letter "" of the lease agreement .
Last night , G7 foreign ministers issued a joint statement condemning Russia 's recognition of Abkhazia and South Ossetia , and deplored Moscow 's "" excessive use of military force in Georgia and its continued occupation of parts of Georgia "" .
Yushchenko , who met Miliband yesterday , said Russian actions in Georgia were unacceptable .
"" What has happened is a threat to everyone , not just for one country .
Any nation could be next .
When we allow someone to ignore the fundamental right of territorial integrity , we put into doubt the existence of any country . """
2008-08-29,"The hostile reaction of the United States and the European Union to the Kremlin 's move was predictable .
Russian president Dmitry Medvedev anticipated that , and expressed his disdain .
What he apparently did not anticipate was the disapproval by China , an ally in their joint opposition to the hegemony that the United States has enjoyed since the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 .
The difference between the two powerful neighbours came to the fore at the annual summit of the six - member Shanghai Cooperation Organisation ( SCO ) in the Tajik capital of Dushanbe on Thursday .
Medvedev failed to convince the other leaders that Moscow 's actions were essential to prevent Tbilisi 's aggression against South Ossetia .
The SCO , originally known as the Shanghai Forum , was established in 1996 as a confidence - building regional organisation to defuse tension on the Sino - Soviet border .
It initially consisted of China , Russia , Kazakhstan , Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan , with its headquarters in Shanghai .
It then graduated to a regional body with a broader mandate for security , acquired Uzbekistan as its sixth member , changed its name to the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation , and resorted to holding joint military exercises .
The SCO 's backing for the Kremlin 's actions in South Ossetia and elsewhere in Georgia would have provided Medvedev with a powerful diplomatic tool to counter Western opposition , but he seems to have overlooked the "" concern "" Beijing had expressed over the Kremlin 's action in Georgia before the SCO summit .
Where the Chinese president seems to have taken an uncompromising stance at the Dushanbe summit is on the cardinal principle of the territorial integrity of a state .
This has been one of the five pillars of China 's foreign policy since the mid-1950s , called panchsheel ( Five Principles ) .
The others are : mutual non - aggression ; mutual non - interference in each other 's internal affairs ; equality and mutual benefit ; and peaceful co - existence .
It is in the light of the panchsheel that Beijing 's recent moves in Sudan and Zimbabwe ought to be seen .
At the SCO summit , President Nursultan Nazarbayev of Kazakhstan , sharing borders with Russia and China , would have backed the Chinese line strongly .
Though the overall parity that ethnic Slavs , mainly Russians , enjoyed with ethnic Kazakhs on the eve of Kazakhstan 's independence in 1991 no longer exists , some Kazakh areas adjoining Russia have a Slav majority .
So , in future , that region could demand independence from Kazakhstan just as South Ossetia and Abkhazia did in the case of Georgia .
As for China , the demand of many native Uighurs in the vast Xinjiang province for independence has a long history .
This is equally true of Tibet .
Therefore it would have been unthinkable that Beijing would condone Moscow 's recognition of the independence of South Ossetia and Abkhazia .
Yet China shares its leadership of the SCO with Russia .
So the communiqué issued by the summit in Dushanbe was a compromise .
SCO presidents reaffirmed their commitment to "" efforts aimed at preserving the unity of a state and its territorial integrity "" while expressing their approval of "" the active role of Russia in assisting in peace and cooperation in the region "" .
Taking their cue from the SCO summit , the policymakers in the Kremlin would be well advised to seek a compromise with the west by using its recognition of South Ossetia and Abkhazia as a bargaining chip to secure a reversal of the west 's earlier recognition of independence of Kosovo from Serbia ."
2008-09-08,"Russia has agreed to pull all of its forces out of Georgia within a month under a landmark deal reached by the president , Dmitry Medvedev , and his French counterpart , Nicolas Sarkozy , in Moscow today .
Describing the agreement as "" momentous "" , Sarkozy said Moscow had promised to scrap its checkpoints inside Georgia within "" a week "" and to remove all forces from areas adjacent to the breakaway enclaves of South Ossetia and Abkhazia within a month .
The deal envisaged the deployment of a 200-strong force of EU observers to Georgia by October 1 , Sarkozy said .
Additionally , international talks would take place on October 15 in Geneva on the future of South Ossetia and Abkhazia , which Moscow unilaterally recognised as independent late last month .
Sarkozy , the current EU president , led today 's negotiations together with the European commission president , José Manuel Barroso , and the EU 's foreign policy chief , Javier Solana .
The deal appears to mark a major achievement for Sarkozy .
He had been widely criticised after Moscow 's failure to implement his previous August 12 ceasefire deal , which called for Russia to pull its troops out .
"" All has not been resolved .
We are aware of that .
But what has been resolved has been considerable , "" Sarkozy said , adding that the EU and Russia had avoided "" a cold war that we do n't need "" .
In a press conference this afternoon after four hours of talks , Medvedev made clear that Russia 's withdrawal of forces depended on Georgia signing a "" non - aggression pact "" with South Ossetia and Abkhazia .
Today 's deal does not include Abkhazia and South Ossetia where , Medvedev said , Russia will continue to provide what he termed "" military assistance "" .
Sarkozy is flying tonight to Tbilisi to hold talks with the Georgian president , Mikheil Saakashvili , who is expected to agree today 's deal .
But there was no agreement today on the future status of Abkhazia and South Ossetia , Georgia 's two breakaway enclaves .
Medvedev said Moscow 's decision to recognise them as independent was "" irrevocable "" .
Sarkozy , for his part , said the EU , which dispatched him to Moscow after an emergency session of all 27 member countries last week , condemned Russia 's move .
"" It was n't up to Russia to recognise unilaterally the independence of Russia and South Ossetia .
There are international rules which need to be upheld , "" Sarkozy said .
Medvedev today criticised the US , which , he said , had encouraged Georgia 's "" aggression "" against South Ossetia and its attack on August 8 .
He made clear Russia would no longer accept a "" unipolar model "" in international and security relations in which Washington gets to decide "" the rules of the game "" .
Asked whether the Kremlin planned to invade any more of its neighbours , Medvedev looked irritated .
Referring to Georgia , he said : "" This is an individual situation .
Everything else is just plots ...
Some people are trying to look at Russia like the Soviet Union .
Russia is different .
But Russia needs to be taken into account . ""
David Clark , chair of the Russian Foundation and a former foreign office special adviser , said today that Russia had so far outwitted the EU , which now needed to revise its relations with Russia . ""
[ Vladimir ]
Putin has been running rings round the EU for four or five years .
He has been able to do it because he has bet on European weakness and disunity .
So far his numbers have come up every time .
Whether he will continue to be right is the big question for European foreign policy . ""
Clark said events in Georgia demonstrated that it was no longer possible for the EU to have a value - based relationship with a resurgent Russia , which believed itself a "" great power "" and thought it had "" privileged interests "" in post - Soviet countries such as Georgia and Ukraine .
The EU should still consider a raft of sanctions against Moscow , he said .
They could include the suspension of a new EU - Russia partnership and co - operation agreement , freezing Moscow 's WTO application and a revival of the G7 format excluding Russia .
The EU should consider other more draconian measures , he said , including stripping Russia of the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi .
Europe 's financial authorities should scrutinise the finances in the west of wealthy Russians , he said .
"" This is something that will really make them sweat , "" Clark told the Guardian .
Before today 's agreement , the Georgian government said Russia had beefed up the number of checkpoints next to the Black Sea resort of Poti to three , sending in additional armoured personnel carriers and around 50 troops .
The strategic port is outside any security zone around Abkhazia or South Ossetia .
Russia sent two jets into Georgian airspace on Sunday , the government said .
According to the ceasefire agreement , its forces should have left Georgian "" core territory "" weeks ago , it added .
"" The repeated violation of Georgian airspace and the expansion of Russia 's checkpoint system far from the conflict zone suggests that the Russian Federation has no intention to honour its commitments .
"" Georgia and Russia severed diplomatic relations last week .
According to Russia 's Kommersant newspaper , Moscow plans to establish diplomatic relations with Abkhazia and South Ossetia tomorrow .
Officials in Tskhinvali , South Ossetia 's damaged capital , are now looking for a building to house the new Russian embassy , the paper said .
The two countries clashed today in the International Court of Justice in the Hague .
Georgia says there is "" compelling evidence "" that Russian forces have been involved in the ethnic cleaning of Georgians from South Ossetia , Abkhazia and adjacent regions .
Russia denies the claim .
The case is to be heard over three days ."

The pullout does not include Abkhazia and South Ossetia where , Medvedev said , Russia would continue to provide what he termed "" military assistance "" .
Sarkozy flew to Tbilisi last night to hold talks with Georgia 's president , Mikheil Saakashvili , who yesterday wrote a letter accepting a non - aggression pact .
However , in a sign of continuing tension between Russia and the US , the Bush administration said it was cancelling a much - heralded civilian nuclear cooperation deal with Russia , which Bush had sent to Congress for approval in May , after two years of tough negotiations .
The US secretary of state , Condoleezza Rice , said in a statement yesterday : "" We make this decision with regret .
Unfortunately , given the current environment , the time is not right for this agreement . ""
Earlier , in Moscow , Medvedev had bitterly criticised the US , which , he said , had encouraged Georgia 's "" aggression "" against South Ossetia and its attack on August 8 .
The US was also "" actively "" re - arming Georgia , he claimed , and made it clear that Russia would no longer accept a "" unipolar model "" of world affairs in which the US decided "" the rules of the game "" .
Asked whether the Kremlin planned to invade any more of its neighbours , Medvedev looked irritated .
Referring to Georgia , he said : ' This is an individual situation .

But Russia needs to be taken into account . ""
Assuming Russia fully withdraws its forces , talks could resume in October on an EU - Russia cooperation deal , Sarkozy said .
EU countries suspended the talks last week in protest at Russia 's actions in Georgia .
According to Russia 's Kommersant newspaper , Moscow plans to establish diplomatic relations with Abkhazia and South Ossetia today ."
2008-09-09,"For the second time in under a month , Nicolas Sarkozy has left Moscow holding a piece of paper he claims will bring peace in our time .
This time no one is holding their breath .
The deal the French and EU president struck with the Russian leader , Dmitry Medvedev , is at least a little tighter than its August 12 precursor , which had loopholes big enough to drive a tank through – or several armoured columns as it turned out – under the guise of the "" additional security measures "" Moscow was entitled to take .
Those measures have provided cover for Russian forces to entrench themselves deep inside Georgia well beyond the breakaway regions of Abkhazia and South Ossetia that they were ostensibly there to protect .
Despite repeated pledges from President Medvedev that they would pull out , they remain dug in around the strategic port of Poti and the western hub of Senaki , raising questions over how much control the new man in the Kremlin wields over Russia 's armed forces .
Under the new Sarkozy deal , the Russians will withdraw from those positions in "" Georgia proper "" by October 11 , once 200 EU monitors arrive to take over their positions .
Four days later , there will be international talks on Georgia 's future in Geneva .
It sounds plausible , but there is plenty of room for scepticism .
Firstly , there are other conditions on the Russian withdrawal which could provide ample wiggle room if Moscow wants to make use , of it .
There is , for example , the stipulation that Georgian forces return to their bases .
The catch is – for many of them , there are no bases to return to .
They have razed by Russians .
Any attempt to regroup at their charred remains would mean crossing Russian checkpoints .
Secondly , the pullback from Poti and Senaki would require Georgia to pledge not to use military force in nearby Abkhazia .
Tbilisi , however , is unlikely to sign anything that appears to confer legitimacy on Abkhazia 's secession , and would probably call for Russia to give similar undertakings .
As for the Geneva peace talks , there is the question of what there is to talk about .
Moscow has recognised Abkhazian and South Ossetian independence , an irrevocable step that precludes any compromise solution on status .
It is entirely unlikely that Moscow or the authorities it backs in the two regions will allow the return of the 250,000 Georgians driven out of Abkhazia in the early 1990s or of tens of thousands forced to leave South Ossetia after last month 's conflicts .
This critical stumbling block illustrates the essential difference between the partition of Georgia and the Kosovo declaration of independence earlier this year , which Russia points to as a precedent .
Kosovo 's breakaway reversed the results of Serbian ethnic cleansing .
The secession of Abkhazia and South Ossetia is intended to set the consequences of ethnic cleansing in stone .
Nato troops in Kosovo have spent the past nine years protecting the Serb minority .
Russian troops in Georgia have done nothing to impede the victimisation of the Georgians in the breakaway regions , to put it mildly .
It is hard to see what Geneva can achieve , and it is equally difficult to imagine what the EU can do if Russia does not withdraw from Georgia after all .
Britain 's attempt to use the crisis to crystallise some sort of united European bargaining position on Russian gas supplies has gone nowhere .
The national interests at stake are too immediate and too visceral .
No European government is willing to risk its voters going cold this winter because of withheld supplies .
When Russian diplomats talk about the future of Abkhazia and South Ossetia , they either mention the precedent of Kosovo ( recognised by some nations and not by others ) or they talk about northern Cyprus ( recognised only by Turkey ) .
Turkey 's recognition has done it no harm in the long term , they point out .
For Moscow , another two frozen conflicts is a quite acceptable outcome ."
2008-09-09,"Russia said today its troops would stay in the breakaway Georgian provinces of Abkhazia and South Ossetia for a long time to come , a day after Moscow agreed to pull its forces out of other Georgian territory within the month .
Yesterday 's deal , between France 's president , Nicolas Sarkozy , and his Russian counterpart , Dmitry Medvedev , specifically excluded Abkhazia and South Ossetia .
The future of the two enclaves , which Moscow recognised as independent last month , will be discussed at an international conference in Geneva on October 15 .
But Russia 's foreign minister , Sergey Lavrov , said Russia 's military presence in Abkhazia and South Ossetia was necessary in order to avert Georgian attempts to regain control .
He said troops would remain for the foreseeable future , though he did not indicate how many soldiers would be based in the area .
Russia would sign formal agreements with both regions on the extent of the military presence .
Lavrov 's comments will heighten tensions with Georgia , which regards South Ossetia and Abkhazia as inseparable parts of the country .
In a cautious welcome to yesterday 's deal , Georgia 's president , Mikhail Saakashvili , reiterated his country 's claim to the regions .
The Russians , he said , "" should get the hell out of the territories they control "" .
Describing the deal as "" momentous "" , Sarkozy said Moscow had agreed to scrap its checkpoints inside Georgia within a week and had promised to remove all forces from areas adjacent to South Ossetia and Abkhazia within a month .
The agreement also envisaged the deployment of a 200-strong force of EU observers to Georgia by October 1 , Sarkozy said .

2008-09-12,"Georgia 's attack on the breakaway region of South Ossetia was unnecessary and unprovoked and was encouraged by the United States , Russia 's president , Dmitry Medvedev , said in an interview yesterday .
"" For Russia , August 8 was like September 11 for the United States , "" he told a group of foreign journalists and academics .
"" I would like to see major lessons from it for the world . ""
He made clear that the lessons , as Russia sees them , are that the post - cold war "" illusion "" that a world with one super power is a safe and predictable place is now over .
The 42-year - old president said George Bush had phoned him shortly after he had ordered Russian forces to drive the Georgians back . ""
' You 're a young president with a liberal background .
Why do you need this ? '
Medvedev quoted Bush as saying .
"" I told him we had no choice , "" he said .
The Russian president 's interview followed a day after a similar interview with the prime minister , Vladimir Putin .
He seemed to be talking from the same script , though there were important differences between the two .
The president was more blunt about his Georgian counterpart , Mikheil Saakashvili , calling him "" burdened with a host of pathologies "" and alleging he often appeared in public under the influence of drugs .
"" Russia had to recognise South Ossetia as an independent state - a move widely criticised in the west - because otherwise Georgia might attack again . "" If he takes this blood once he would try again if he was not muzzled , "" he said .
Medvedev accused the US secretary of state , Condoleezza Rice , of blocking a tentative deal made between Russia and Georgia to sign an agreement on the use of force .
"" Rice met him and the boy changed miraculously afterwards .
He started to postpone the agreement .
He started preparations for war . ""
The Russian president rejected Georgia 's argument that if Nato had given it a membership action plan , as Bush wanted to do earlier this year ( the move was blocked by France and Germany ) , Russia would not have dared to use force .
"" I can assure you that as president I would not have wavered for a second to make the same decisions that I made back then , "" he said .
He was firmer than Putin in disowning any parallels between today 's Russia and the Soviet Union .
Putin once described the Soviet collapse as the greatest geopolitical tragedy of the 20th century .
Medvedev , 13 years younger than his predecessor , said he felt no nostalgia .
"" I do n't want to live in a militarised country behind an iron curtain .
It 's boring .
Been there and seen the movie .
I 've done that , "" he said .
He took a more optimistic position on the effects of the crisis on Russia 's relations with the US and the EU .
"" I do n't think this phase of confrontation will be lengthy , "" he asserted .
Both men made it clear that Russia was not planning to take South Ossetia into the Russian Federation .
Eduard Kokoity , the region 's president , said on Thursday that he wanted his republic to join Russia now that it had declared independence from Georgia .
Within an hour he had come under pressure to change his position , telling the Russian news agency Interfax that he had been "" misunderstood "" .
Nato is to review its relationship with the Georgian and Ukrainian governments at a summit in December and discuss whether to let them start membership proceedings .
The issue is likely to sharpen divisions within the alliance and the Russians hope the advocates of delay will be stronger after Georgia 's attack on South Ossetia .
Starting the process of letting Georgia and Ukraine join Nato would be "" a seriously destabilising factor "" , the Russian president said .
"" We do n't understand what Nato can gain by drawing in nations that are still at a crossroads , where the elites and people are split , where there has been no referendum , and where there is a major risk of separatism , "" he said ."
2008-09-26,"Russia announced an overhaul of its strategic nuclear forces and army yesterday , in the clearest sign yet that Moscow may be preparing for a possible full - scale military confrontation with the US and Nato .
Speaking after Russia carried out its biggest military exercises since the cold war , Dmitry Medvedev , the president , said Russia would build a space defence system and a fleet of nuclear submarines by 2020 .
This summer 's brief war with Georgia , which led to a further rift between Moscow and the west , showed the need for Russia to have a strong military in a state of "" permanent readiness "" , Medvedev said .
His defence initiative is the biggest in Russia for at least a decade .
It comes amid bitter opposition from Moscow to Washington 's plan to site a missile defence system in central Europe - a project the Kremlin says upsets Europe 's strategic balance .
The move is also a riposte to US - backed plans for Georgia and Ukraine to join Nato .
Moscow opposes Nato 's further expansion , arguing that it challenges its regional "" privileged interests "" .
Moscow also accuses the US of encouraging , and even participating in , Georgia 's attack on the breakaway enclave of South Ossetia . ""
Just recently we had to rebuff aggression unleashed by the Georgian regime .
As we discovered , a local smouldering conflict - even occasionally a frozen one - can flare up into a genuine war , "" Medvedev said , addressing Russian troops .
He said Russia needed a "" guaranteed nuclear deterrent system "" in place by 2020 .
The armed forces had to be prepared for "" various political and military scenarios , "" he warned .
He promised large - scale construction of warships , including nuclear submarines armed with cruise missiles , and also announced plans for a system of air and space defence .
The president promised to improve living conditions for Russian soldiers , as well as better military education and training .
He was speaking after watching an military exercise in the southern Urals .
Yesterday one leading analyst said the exercise - which involved 40,000 troops , 7,300 pieces of heavy equipment and nuclear - capable missiles - was designed to simulate a war with the US . ""
This is very significant .
Right now the present Russian leadership believes that a war with Nato is very much possible , "" Pavel Felgenhauer , a Moscow - based defence analyst , told the Guardian .
"" This is the first time since the collapse of the Soviet Union that the Russian military is actually preparing for an all - out nuclear war with America . ""
He added : "" I believe we [ the Russians ] are sending the west a serious message .
The message is treat us with respect , and if you do n't go into our backyard we wo n't go into yours .
Russia wants to divide the world into spheres of influence .
If not , we will prepare for nuclear war . ""
Felgenhauer said Russia 's military was old but still effective .
"" Our military is backward in its development .
But we still have a sizeable nuclear potential .
It can kill a hell of a lot of people , "" he said .
Russia 's conflict with Georgia worsened tensions with the US that had been building since Vladimir Putin , a former KGB spy and Medvedev 's predecessor , came to power in 2000 and began reasserting Russia 's status as a world power .
Russia 's military endured years of under - funding following the collapse of the Soviet Union , with its warships and aircraft sitting idle for long periods .
Analysts say the nuclear deterrent did not suffer the same neglect .
The Kremlin , now sitting on a large cash pile after several years of high oil and gas prices , has already injected large sums into reviving the military .
Putin , now prime minister , announced earlier this month that nearly $ 95bn ( £ 51.5bn ) would be allocated to defence and security in 2009 .
That is a 27 % increase on the previous year , but still a fraction of total US defence spending , which this year was more than $ 600bn .
Backstory Russia is underpinning its planned military resurgence with diplomacy and alliances around the world .
Its latest partner is another oil - rich power flush with petrodollars and bluster which likes to chastise America : Venezuela .
Hugo Chávez was on hand to meet Medvedev on the sidelines of the Orenburg exercises as the two ratcheted up their challenge to US influence by forging military and economic deals and signalling a possible nuclear energy programme in Venezuela .
In addition to accords on oil , gas and weapons purchases , they discussed building nuclear reactors in Venezuela , a move that would underline Washington 's lost sway over a region once considered its backyard .
A Russian naval squadron is sailing towards the Caribbean for joint military exercises with Venezuela , the first such deployment in the western hemisphere since the cold war .
Moscow has recently deepened links with leftwing governments across Latin America : a gas deal with Bolivia , hurricane assistance to Cuba and a promise to upgrade Nicaragua 's military .
Russia 's naval deployment is a response to the presence of the US navy in the Black Sea during the war with Georgia .

2008-10-01,"At his recent meeting with Russia 's Federation Council international affairs committee , Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov spoke of the transformation of the system of international relations .
He repeated many of his remarks made there in his address to the 63rd session of the UN general assembly on September 27 .
The idea of transforming the world order did not come to Russian diplomats suddenly , in the wake of the short victorious war with Georgia in August : even before then , in July , Russia 's president , Dmitry Medvedev , approved the new foreign policy concept of the Russian Federation .
All these documents contain approximately the same ideas .
Yet , in his address to the UN assembly , Lavrov said that the crisis in the Caucasus has changed the world in the same way that 9/11 had .
If so , why has the concept not changed ?
This is because , for the Russian leaders , the Georgian attack on South Ossetia was the last decisive proof that the present world order has , indeed , got to change .
In their view , the Georgians could only commit the folly of attacking South Ossetia in the present "" unipolar "" world , in which America does what it wants in its own interests , and enables its allies to behave as they please , while the rest of the world is supposed to comply .
During his term as president , Vladimir Putin spoke about it with increasing bitterness , but to no avail .
Defeating Georgia was , for Russians , the act of "" rising from our knees "" .
The compliance , it showed , was over , and so the new world order has got to arrive .
According to Lavrov , this new world order would involve the reaffirmation of the principles of international law : for example , territorial integrity and non – interference in the internal affairs of foreign states ; the re - introduction of the principle of collective security ; reaffirming the role of the UN and the strengthening of the organisation itself and of its security council .
So far , so good .
But surely , if these principles were to be reaffirmed , they should be applied equally to all ?
When Russia was bombing Grozny , the Chechen capital , it was defending its own territorial integrity – but then , when Saakashvili ordered the bombing of Tskhinvali , the Ossetian capital , was n't he doing the same ?
And surely , if the American recognition of Kosovo 's independence was illegal , from the point of view both of existing agreements and international laws , than Russia 's recognition of the independence of Abkhazia and Ossetia should fall within the same category .
The difference is that , in Russia 's perceptions , both Georgia and Serbia are positioned within Russia 's sphere of interest , together with other former Soviet republics and some of the former socialist states .
Russia is unhappy when any of these states join or want to join Nato .
Medvedev 's concept of Russia 's foreign policy directly states that "" Russia maintains its negative attitude towards the expansion of Nato , notably to the plans of admitting Ukraine and Georgia … "" But if the principle of "" spheres of interest "" – one of the unuttered , but generally observed rules of the cold war era – is also back , then what is Russia doing selling Venezuela weapons and developing its military ties with it ?
Surely , Venezuela is closer to American borders than to Russian ?
Reassuringly , Lavrov says that Russia would not "" fall into anti - Americanism "" and will not let itself "" be put against Europe "" .
But in some respects , Russia 's new world order is strangely reminiscent of the old one that prevailed during the cold war .
Russia 's recent strategic military exercise , "" Stability 2008 "" , in preparation for a full - scale nuclear war with the US and Nato is a telling sign of its "" new "" thinking .
Russia 's policy - makers had better think again .
Russia 's army is no match for those of either the US or Nato .
Despite its new oil riches , Russia still can only afford to spend a fraction of what US spends on its military .
And while there has been strong growth , Russia 's economy is nowhere near what it should be if it really wants to compete with the west militarily .
Neither does Russia have an ideology , distinct from anti – Americanism , that could unite a significant group of allies behind it .
The world has long ceased to be either bipolar or unipolar ; in its own interests , Russia would do better to bear this in mind ."
2008-10-07,"He has been using the internet since 1996 , logs on every morning , and even reads the foreign press online .
But today Dmitry Medvedev - Russia 's 43-year - old leader - took his cyber - credentials a step further when he delivered his first - ever presidential podcast .
Speaking from his office inside the Kremlin , Medvedev gave a fluent and impressive performance - chummily addressing viewers of his website as "" dear friends "" .
"" This is the first time I have used this format to address you through my site , "" he said this morning .
Medvedev went on to expound his views on international security ahead of a European summit in the French town of Evian tomorrow .
Following Kosovo 's secession , the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq and the recent conflict in Georgia , Medvedev described the current system of collective security as "" extremely ineffective "" .
He has suggested a new multi - lateral system of security - an idea his western partners have so far received coolly .
Medvedev 's fondness for new technology is in stark contrast to his 56-year - old predecessor Vladimir Putin - Russia 's former president turned prime minister - who rarely uses email .
In an interview earlier ths year , Medvedev said he typically began every day by turning on his PC .
"" I look at the sites of our major Russian and foreign media , "" he told the Financial Times , adding that he browsed sites that were "" positive "" about the authorities as well as ones in "" tough opposition to them "" .
Today one leading pro - Kremlin analyst described Medvedev 's inaugural two - minute video blog as "" very good "" .
"" Putin is a post - Soviet leader .
Medvedev is a post - post Soviet leader , "" Sergei Markov , a member of the pro - government United Russia party told the Guardian . ""
He is very advanced at using hi - tec technologies .
Among G8 leaders he is the most advanced . ""
Markov went on : "" For him to use the internet and video is not something extraordinary .
It 's normal .
I would say that Medvedev is very comfortable with the internet in the same way that Putin is comfortable when he 's in church .
Medvedev is now addressing the advanced part of the elite .
"" Russia currently has some 40 million internet users - just under a third of the population .
The internet is one of the few media spaces in Russia not controlled by the Kremlin , which keeps an iron grip on TV and most newspapers .
Medvedev is expected to repeat his video message in person tomorrow to European leaders when he attends the world policy conference in Evian ."
2008-10-08,"Russia 's president , Dmitry Medvedev , outlined plans yesterday for a new security pact to ban the use of force in Europe and defuse increasing tensions between Moscow and Nato .
Yesterday 's speech at the World Policy Conference in Evian , France , was intended as a bridge - building exercise after Russia 's occupation of Georgia in August , which threatened a new cold war .
Medvedev promised that by midnight last night Russian troops would leave "" security zones "" in the undisputed areas of Georgian territory .
However , the Georgian government claimed the withdrawal was only partial and that Russian troops showed no signs of leaving the strategic outpost of Akhalgori , near the Georgian capital , Tbilisi , and outside the breakaway region of South Ossetia .
Russian authorities also continued to block EU monitors from entering South Ossetia and Abkhazia ( recognised as independent states by Moscow ) , which have been at the centre of the Russia - Georgia conflict .
European diplomats said the monitors would try to cross the lines again soon .
"" We are absolutely not interested in confrontation , "" said Medvedev , devoting much of his speech to giving details of a new European security agreement that he first mentioned earlier in the year .
The new European pact would include "" a clear affirmation of the inadmissibility of the use of force - or the threat of force - in international relations "" and would be built on the principle of the territorial integrity of independent nations .
It would also prevent "" the development of military alliances to harm the security of other members of the treaty "" - a clear reference to Nato expansion , which Moscow sees as a significant threat to its security .
Western diplomats said the proposals remained vague , and sounded unlikely to gain wide support in Europe .
The US , Britain and eastern Europe in particular refuse to contemplate a Russian veto on Nato membership for states such as Ukraine or Georgia .
A Russian official said the Medvedev initiative was a "" work in progress "" currently being discussed in European capitals .
Britain 's foreign secretary , David Miliband , talked it over with his Russian counterpart , Sergey Lavrov , at the UN last month .
The aim , the Russian official said , was to elicit responses and then invite European leaders to a summit , probably after a new US administration takes office in January .
"" This is a highly revisionist speech , "" said David Clark , the chairman of the Russia Foundation , a London - based thinktank .
"" It 's clearly an attempt to rewrite the post - cold war settlement .
A lot of what Medvedev is talking about was in the Charter of Paris in 1990 .
"" The charter paved the way for the new Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe after the fall of the Berlin Wall . ""
Moscow wants a security relationship dependent on power rather than values , "" Clark added .
"" The Russian government has been hostile to the OSCE since about 2003 - 04 , when it started to criticise Russian elections . ""
The Russian official said that in recent years that the OSCE had tilted from a military - political organisation to an organisation promoting human rights and democracy ."
2008-11-01,"The Russian navy could significantly expand its presence in the Mediterranean after it emerged yesterday that Libya 's leader , Muammar Gadafy , has offered Moscow the chance to open a base on its coastline .
Gadafy flew into Russia for his first visit since 1985 last night , meeting President Dmitry Medvedev for dinner ahead of talks on more than a billion pounds worth of arms purchases for Libya and cooperation over nuclear energy .
Citing a source involved in organising the visit , the business daily Kommersant said the Libyan leader wanted to offer the Kremlin a naval base in the port of Benghazi in order for Russia to establish a permanent base on the north African coast . ""
In line with the Libyan leader 's plan , Russia 's military presence will become a guarantee of non - aggression from the United States which , despite numerous conciliatory gestures , is not in a hurry to embrace Col Gadafy , "" the paper said .
Kremlin officials would not comment on the report but Admiral Ivan Kapitanets , a former deputy navy commander of the Soviet Union and Russia , told Interfax news agency that the plan would "" expand the operational potential "" of the navy .
Russia already has a promise from Syria that it will provide a permanent facility for the Russian navy at Tartus in the eastern Mediterranean .
Elsewhere , the Russian navy has fleets in the Black Sea , the Baltic , the Arctic and the Pacific Ocean , but although its ships already patrol the area , the new development would give it a permanent presence in the Mediterranean .
Moscow announced plans last year to step up its naval presence in different regions ."
2008-11-05,"The Russian president Dmitry Medvedev chose this day – the day when the United States and world are preoccupied with Obama 's victory in the American presidential elections – to deliver his first message to the Russian parliament , the Russian version of a state of the nation address .
The timing was Medvedev 's own : the speech was announced for late October but was twice postponed .
So , what was it that Medvedev wanted to tell the new American president ? ""
We , "" he said , "" have no problems with the American nation , we have no inbred anti - Americanism .
We hope our partners , the new United States administration , will make a choice in favour of full - fledged relations with Russia . ""
It looks like this short expression of hope that the US will change its ways was the only reason for the delay .
In his speech , Medvedev did not congratulate Obama on his victory and did not even mention him by name .
In fact , as far as America goes , Medvedev 's message seems to have been directed more at the outgoing administration , than the incoming one .
He announced that Russia would place an Iskander rocket system in Kaliningrad – the Russia 's exclave between Nato members , Poland and Lithuania – in order "" to neutralise the [ US ] missile defence system if necessary "" ; that Russia may jam this system electronically ; and that it is also considering using Russia 's navy resources for the same purpose .
He also mentioned that a missile division dislocated in the Kaluga region , which was supposed to be disbanded by 2010 , will stay in service .
Amazingly , despite all that , he also said that Russia would not be drawn into a new arms race .
Medvedev blamed the "" conceited "" foreign policy of the US for the August war in Georgia and Ossetia , and said that Russia "" will not retreat from the Caucasus "" .
He also blamed the world economic crisis on America 's failure to coordinate its economic policy with other countries , for , in his view , it was this lack of coordination that had turned the "" local "" crisis into a global one .
The Russian president did not exactly call the US the "" evil empire "" , as Ronald Reagan used to refer to the Soviet Union , but he left Russians in no doubt as to who the main baddy in the world is .
This may not be an inbred anti - Americanism , but anti - Americanism it certainly is .
Having placated the hawks by his foreign policy statements , Medvedev offered some consolation to the liberals in his internal policy proposals .
True , he has suggested the extension of the president 's and parliament 's terms to six years – simultaneously saying that he would not change the constitution , only amend it .
But his proposed changes of the electoral law could give hope to liberal parties , and his insistence that democratic institutions will not be disbanded , that "" freedom "" is the greatest value , that censorship should be outlawed and that prosecutors should not "" overdo "" arrests , are music to liberal ears .
If only such themes could be turned into reality … Obama and Medvedev can not just turn the page and start relations between Russia and the US from scratch .
There is simply no such thing in international relations as a blank sheet .
But the pendulum of anti - Americanism in Russia has swung too far for Russia 's own security ; so , despite Medvedev 's harsh words , there is hope that the Americans will not be the only ones to change their ways .
Perhaps , watching the enthusiasm with which the world is embracing the new American president , Russia will amend its ways too ."
2008-11-05,"President Dmitry Medvedev said today that Russia will deploy missiles in territory near Nato member Poland in response to US missile defense plans .
He did not say whether the short - range Iskander missiles would be fitted with nuclear warheads .
In a state of the nation speech , Medvedev also blamed the US for the war in Georgia and the global financial crisis .
He said he hoped the US president - elect Barack Obama would act to improve relations with Russia but he did not offer congratulations to the president - elect .
The missiles will be deployed to the Russian Baltic Sea territory Kaliningrad , he said , but did not add how many would be used .
Equipment to electronically hamper the operation of prospective US missile defense facilities in Poland and the Czech Republic will be deployed , he said .
Medvedev singled out the US for criticism , casting Russia 's war with Georgia in August and the global financial turmoil as consequences of aggressive , selfish US policies . ""
Mechanisms must be created to block mistaken , egoistical and sometimes simply dangerous decisions of certain members of the international community , "" he said shortly after starting the 85-minute speech .
Medvedev , whose criticism of Washington echoed addresses by his predecessor Vladimir Putin , made it clear he was referring to the US .
Georgia sparked the August war on its territory with what he called "" barbaric aggression "" against Russian - backed South Ossetia .
The conflict "" was , among other things , the result of the arrogant course of the American administration , which did not tolerate criticism and preferred unilateral decisions . ""
Medvedev painted Russia as a country threatened by growing western military might . ""
From what we have seen in recent years , the creation of a missile defense system , the encirclement of Russia with military bases , the relentless expansion of Nato , we have gotten the strong impression that they are testing our strength , "" Medvedev said .
He announced deployment of the Iskander missiles as a military response to US plans to deploy missile - defense facilities in Poland and the Czech Republic former Soviet satellites that are now Nato members .
Speaking just hours after Obama was declared the victor in the US presidential election , Medvedev said he hoped the incoming administration will take steps to improve badly damaged US ties with Russia .
He suggested it is up to the US not the Kremlin to seek to improve relations .
"" I stress that we have no problem with the American people , no inborn anti - Americanism .
And we hope that our partners , the US administration , will make a choice in favor of full - fledged relations with Russia , "" Medvedev said .
Russian - American relations have been increasingly tense and were driven to a post - cold war low by Moscow 's war with US ally Georgia ."
2008-11-06,"President Dmitry Medvedev moved yesterday to entrench the current Russian leadership 's grip on power by proposing a presidential term that would extend the stint in office from four to six years .
Medvedev said the extension was necessary to guarantee stability and help Russia deal with huge global challenges .
But critics said the proposal was further evidence of Russia 's alarming and rapid drift towards authoritarianism .
This morning 's Vedomosti newspaper , citing Kremlin sources , said that Medvedev could resign from his post as early as 2009 - paving the way for Vladimir Putin , currently the prime minister , to come back to the Kremlin .
Putin stepped down as president in May , when he handed over to Medvedev , his handpicked successor .
Under this scenario Putin could get his presidential job back next year and then serve two six - year terms , Vedomosti suggested .
In his first state of the nation address yesterday , Medvedev also said he was deploying cruise missiles in western Russia to "" neutralise "" the Pentagon 's missile defence system - and lambasted the US for its "" arrogant course "" and "" unilateralism "" .
Speaking hours after Barack Obama was voted in as the next American president , Medvedev said Russia would site short - range Iskander nuclear - capable missiles next door to Poland , in Russia 's Baltic Sea enclave of Kaliningrad .
The Iskander missiles would be targeted at the US 's missile defence and radar bases in Poland and the Czech Republic , Medvedev said .
Russia would also install radio - jamming equipment to sabotage the US weapons , he added .
The US insists its system is aimed not at Russia but at Iran .
Medvedev 's threat - with its echoes of cold war - style confrontation along the frontiers of eastern Europe - is likely to be an early foreign policy headache for Obama , as his fledgling administration seeks to improve ties with the EU .
The Democrats are ambivalent about the Bush administration 's expensive defence plans in Europe .
But if Obama dumps the project he risks accusations of weakness and caving in to Russian bullying .
With Medvedev 's predecessor , Vladimir Putin , looking on , sometimes nodding approvingly but mostly inscrutable , the Russian president told his audience in the Kremlin that "" we have no problem with the American people "" .
He said he hoped that "" our partners , the US administration "" , would choose to have "" full - fledged relations with Russia "" .
At the same time he said Moscow had to respond to the security challenges posed by the US and Nato 's expansion right up to Russia 's borders .
"" These are forced measures , "" he said , referring to Russia 's new nuclear deployment , adding : "" We have told our partners more than once that we want positive cooperation ... but unfortunately , they do n't want to listen . ""
But the most striking part of Medvedev 's speech concerned constitutional themes - and his proposal to extend not only the presidential period in office but also the parliamentary term for Russia 's state Duma , from four to five years .
Medvedev , who took over as president from Putin in May , did not say when the changes would be implemented .
This morning Putin 's spokesman , Dmitry Peskov , said he "" did not see "" Putin returning as president next year .
He told Vedomosti : "" In 2009 the term of the current president will continue . ""
The paper , however , suggested that Medvedev could enact unpopular social reforms before quitting , citing the constitutional changes to justify his early exit .
Analysts suggested that the most obvious beneficiary of the move would be Putin , who could return as president next year or in 2012 - and then extend his stint in power to 2024 .
Russia 's present ruling team would remain in power indefinitely , they added .
"" It 's about the minimisation of risk , "" said Grigorii V Golosov , a professor in the faculty of political sciences and sociology at St Petersburg 's European University .
He added : "" Even as empty as elections are in contemporary Russia they are still risky for power - holders . ""
"" If you want to minimise risk you have to make elections as seldom as you can .
I wonder why they do n't make it every seven years . ""
The Kremlin would now find some "" para - constitutional procedure "" , later ratified by the high court , to change the country 's 1993 constitution , Golosov predicted .
Such a move was technically illegal , he said , as the constitution guaranteed the right to vote every four years .
Other analysts said the Kremlin was now enacting an ambitious long - term plan to create a "" mini - USSR "" , which would include Russia , Belarus and the breakaway territories of South Ossetia and Abkhazia - effectively annexed by Russia after its war with Georgia in August .
Putin could become head of this new union , they said .
"" This is quite natural for an authoritarian government , "" Olga Kryshtanovskaya , the head of elite studies at Moscow 's Institute of Sociology , said of the plan to extend the presidential term .
"" A democratic country tries to limit the time of its leaders .
An authoritarian one tries to prolong its power as long as possible . ""
Before he stepped down as president Putin regularly insisted that Russia 's constitution was sacrosanct .
He cited it as the main reason why Andrei Lugovoi - the former KGB agent charged with the 2006 murder in London of the Russian dissident Alexander Litvinenko - could not be extradited to the UK to stand trial .
Yesterday Medvedev said he was not planning to change Russia 's constitution as such , but merely to "" amend "" it .
Last night the Kremlin said this could be done without a popular referendum .
The new six - year term would not apply to the current incumbent and would only come into effect after Medvedev 's term was up , it suggested ."
2008-11-06,"Silvio Berlusconi , the Italian prime minister , offered his own particular form of praise today for America 's president - elect Barack Obama , describing him as "" young , handsome and tanned . ''
Berlusconi , who is known for his regular off - key remarks , subsequently claimed to be joking after he spoke of Obama at a news conference , following talks with the Russian president , Dmitry Medvedev .
When asked by a reporter about the future prospect of US - Russian relations , Berlusconi referred to the youth of both leaders - Medvedev , 43 , and Obama , 47 - which he said should make it easier for Moscow and Washington to work together .
He then continued : "" I told the president that [ Obama ] has everything needed in order to reach a deal with him : he 's young , handsome and tanned . ""
Later , when he returned to his hotel , Berlusconi said his comment that Obama was "" giovane , bello e abbronzato "" , "" was a big compliment , "" which only "" imbeciles "" would misinterpret , Italy 's state news wire Ansa reported .
"" If some people do n't have a sense of humour , then it 's their problem , '' he said .
It is not the first time Berlusconi 's descriptions have jarred with the public .
When he took over the rotating presidency of the EU in 2003 , he likened Martin Schulz , a German member of the European Parliament , to a concentration camp guard .
In the same year , at an event sponsored by the New York Stock Exchange in America , he said people should invest in Italy because the women there are pretty .
"" We have beautiful ladies and beautiful women , so my suggestion from the bottom of my heart is to try to make investments in Italy , '' he said .
"" The secretaries are beautiful . ''
Berlusconi 's comments on Obama were not the only ones raising eyebrows today .
The Iranian president , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , sent a congratulatory message , the first time an Iranian leader has offered his good wishes to an American president - elect since the Islamic Revolution in 1979 .
Ahmadinejad is said to have congratulated Obama on "" attracting the majority of voters in the election '' , according to a report by the official IRNA news agency .
He went on to say he hoped Obama would "" use the opportunity to serve the ( American ) people and leave a good name '' during his term .
While Iran and the US have had no formal diplomatic relations since 1979 , Ahmadinejad did send President Bush a slightly less succinct offering two years ago : an 18-page letter containing his views and questions on religion , history and international relations ."
2008-11-06,"Dmitry Medvedev , 43 , and Barack Obama , 47 , share a couple of things in common .
Both are exceptionally young , inexperienced and almost wholly untried in their respective roles as president and president - elect of the world 's two great nuclear powers .
Both have a lot to prove to their fellow citizens , to the world , and to themselves .
In this context , the Russian leader 's highly aggressive state of the nation speech , timed for delivery as Obama raised his fist in victory , can be seen as a first exploratory punch in a boxing match between rank novices .
This contest is likely to run for many rounds .
It will certainly be rough and clumsy .
And it could turn very nasty indeed .
Medvedev 's decision to deploy short - range Iskander missiles in Kaliningrad , up against the borders of Nato and the EU , looks like a rather obvious attempt to test the mettle of the US greenhorn .
Although Obama does not take office until January 20 , how to respond and , more broadly , how to handle rock - bottom bilateral relations with Russia 's resurgent nationalists , are questions he can not put off for long .
Getting Obama 's attention also appears to be part of Medvedev 's gameplan .
Moscow has been complaining for years that the west , and the US in particular , ignores its concerns .
Medvedev said it again on Wednesday .
Then he reeled off a litany of grievances including claims that Washington deliberately provoked last summer 's Georgian conflict , that Nato is intent on encircling his country with bases , and that planned US missile defence facilities in Poland and the Czech Republic are targeted at Russia .
Hence , in his view , the need for the Kaliningrad build - up . ""
The missile deployment is all of a piece with Russia planting its flag in the Arctic and [ former president Vladimir ]
Putin going hunting bare - chested in Siberia to , at the other end of the spectrum , active military operations in the Caucasus , "" said David Clark , chair of the Russia Foundation think - tank .
"" They are saying : ' Russia is back .
We 're powerful again .
We 're tough .
You ca n't ignore us ' . ""
Clark said he believed the Kaliningrad deployment was largely a gesture .
Eastern Europeans had no more reason to fear an attack than Russia had to fear the two US bases .
But in bearding Obama , and pointedly withholding public congratulations on his election triumph , Medvedev may have made a serious miscalculation . ""
For economic and strategic reasons Obama may decide to scrap the missile defence plans .
But Medvedev just made it harder for him to do that .
Perhaps he 's trying to box him [ Obama ] into a corner .
That would make a decision not to go ahead look like a victory for Russia , "" Clark said .
The possibility that Obama may cancel the interceptor programme , which the Bush administration says is solely intended to protect against strikes by "" rogue "" states such as Iran , alarms the Czechs and Poles .
Such a decision would inevitably be interpreted as a lessening of the US commitment to eastern Europe and the Baltic and Black sea regions at a time when the Georgia crisis and disputes with Russia over ethnic minorities , energy , Nato enlargement , and political meddling are rekindling cold war memories .
Radek Sikorski , Poland 's foreign minister , said recently Obama had told him he was concerned about the interceptor system 's effectiveness and whether it was indeed aimed at Russia .
"" If he is assured that it is not directed against Russia , then he would … honour the agreements of his predecessors , "" Sikorski said .
All the same , doubts persist , fanned by Democrats in Congress who want to cut funding for the project .
Edward Lucas , author of the recently republished book , The New Cold War , said Medvedev had made an interesting opening move and there was much more to come .
"" It 's the first time since the cold war that Russia has taken physical steps to back up its threats over missile defence .
Medvedev 's testing Obama .
And he 'll do so on other fronts too .
Georgia could bubble up again .
He wants to see how close Obama stands to his European allies , how he handles bilateral issues , how he plays the Iran card as the US tries to leave Iraq .
"" Obama 's instinct for dialogue and consensus may be tempered by the EU 's recent experience .
Europe has been bending over backwards , trying to be nice , but had made little impression on Russia 's leadership , Lucas said .
If EU foreign ministers agree next week to resume strategic partnership talks with Moscow , broken off during the Georgia crisis , Moscow is likely to read the move as a further sign of weakness .
Obama and Medvedev have never met .
That could change next week when the Russian president travels to Washington for the G20 summit on the global economic crisis .
It 's possible Obama will also attend .
If so , he had better keep his guard up ."

Although Obama does not take office until January 20 , how to respond and , more broadly , how to handle rock - bottom bilateral relations with Russia 's resurgent nationalists , are questions he can not put off for long .
Getting Obama 's attention also appears to be part of Medvedev 's gameplan .
Moscow has been complaining for years that the west , and the US in particular , ignores its concerns .
Medvedev said it again on Wednesday .
Then he reeled off a litany of grievances including claims that Washington deliberately provoked last summer 's Georgian conflict , that Nato is intent on encircling his country with bases , and that planned American missile defence facilities in Poland and the Czech Republic are targeted at Russia .
Hence , in his view , the need for the Kaliningrad build - up . ""
The missile deployment is all of a piece with Russia planting its flag in the Arctic and [ former president Vladimir ]
Putin going hunting bare - chested in Siberia , to , at the other end of the spectrum , active military operations in the Caucasus , "" said David Clark , chairman of the Russia Foundation thinktank .
"" They are saying : ' Russia is back .
We 're powerful again .
We 're tough .
You ca n't ignore us . '
""
Clark said he believed the Kaliningrad deployment was largely a gesture .
Eastern Europeans had no more reason to fear an attack than Russia had to fear the two US bases .
But in bearding Obama , and pointedly withholding public congratulations on his election triumph , Medvedev may have made a serious miscalculation . ""
For economic and strategic reasons Obama may decide to scrap the missile defence plans .
But Medvedev just made it harder for him to do that .
Perhaps he 's trying to box him [ Obama ] into a corner .
That would make a decision not to go ahead look like a victory for Russia , "" Clark said .
The possibility that Obama might cancel the interceptor programme , which the Bush administration says is solely intended to protect against strikes by "" rogue "" states such as Iran , alarms the Czechs and Poles .
Such a decision would inevitably be interpreted as a lessening of the US commitment to eastern Europe and the Baltic and Black Sea regions at a time when the Georgia crisis and disputes with Russia over ethnic minorities , energy , Nato 's enlargement , and political meddling are rekindling cold war memories .
Radek Sikorski , Poland 's foreign minister , said recently that Obama had told him he was concerned about the interceptor system 's effectiveness and whether it was indeed aimed at Russia .
"" If he is assured that it is not directed against Russia , then he would ... honour the agreements of his predecessors , "" Sikorski said .
All the same , doubts persist , fanned by Democrats in the US Congress who want to cut funding for the project .
Edward Lucas , author of the recently republished book The New Cold War , said Medvedev had made an interesting opening move and there was much more to come .
"" It 's the first time since the cold war that Russia has taken physical steps to back up its threats over missile defence .
Medvedev 's testing Obama .
And he 'll do so on other fronts too .
Georgia could bubble up again .
He wants to see how close Obama stands to his European allies , how he handles bilateral issues , how he plays the Iran card as the US tries to leave Iraq .
"" Obama 's instinct for dialogue and consensus may be tempered by the EU 's recent experience .
Europe has been bending over backwards trying to be nice , but has made little impression on Russia 's leadership , Lucas said .
If EU foreign ministers agree next week to resume strategic partnership talks with Moscow , broken off during the Georgia crisis , Russia is likely to read the move as a further sign of weakness .
Obama and Medvedev have never met .
That could change next week when the Russian president travels to Washington for the G20 summit on the global economic crisis .
It 's possible Obama will also attend .
If so , he had better keep his guard up ."
2008-11-07,"The weapon that President Dmitry Medvedev has promised to deploy in Russia 's Baltic exclave , Kaliningrad , is the Iskander , a highly effective surface - to - surface tactical ballistic missile system .
Its deployment will be part of what Moscow sees as a direct military response to plans by Washington to place interceptor missiles in Poland and a radar station in the Czech Republic .
During the cold war , Kaliningrad was seen as the first line of defence against an attack from the west and was home to large contingents of ground and air defence units .
Russia reduced its military presence in the region in the 1990s , but it still has tens of thousands of military personnel and several important bases there , including the Chernyakhovsk naval air base as well as the Baltic Fleet 's headquarters at Baltiysk .
Chief in the region 's new armoury will be the improved Iskander - M missile , which Nato calls the SS-26 .
It has a range of up to 310 miles , and so could hit targets in all of Poland and parts of the Czech Republic and Germany if deployed in Kaliningrad .
Moscow test - fired a new cruise missile version of the Iskander last year , at the same time as it tested an intercontinental ballistic missile , the RS-24 .
Russia 's deputy prime minister , Sergei Ivanov , declared the tests a success and boasted that "" these systems can beat any operational and future missile defences "" - a clear indication that they might be aimed at parts of the US anti - missile system in eastern Europe .
The Russian army reportedly fired Iskanders in South Ossetia during the conflict there between Russia and Georgia in August .
Iskander launchers are mounted on an eight - wheeled truck , making them highly manoeuvrable .
Each missile weighs about four tonnes and can be fitted with either conventional or nuclear warheads .
The missile 's "" variable flight trajectory "" means it is difficult to knock down , an advantage that has aroused a lot of foreign interest in the export model , the Iskander - E. Israel has been worried by reports of Syria 's desire to acquire the weapon from Russia .
It is unclear whether the Iskanders to be deployed in Kaliningrad will have a nuclear payload .
Analysts say the Iskanders will probably be positioned with Russia 's 152nd missile brigade , near Chernyakhovsk .
Medvedev said on Wednesday that radio jamming from Kaliningrad would also be used to disrupt the US anti - missile system .
The president said plans to disband , by 2010 , three missile regiments based in Russia 's Kaluga region near Moscow had been cancelled in respond to Washington 's anti - missile scheme ."
2008-11-07,"There were elaborate explanations yesterday as to why the Russian president , Dmitry Medvedev , had chosen to greet the election of a liberal to the White House by deploying nuclear missiles in its western enclave of Kaliningrad .
Russia , we were told , was laying down a marker .
It was saying : you can not ignore us .
Or Medvedev was testing a greenhorn leader to see how he would react .
There was every explanation except the obvious one : cause and effect .
The cause was America 's decision to deploy missiles and a radar system on Russia 's border .
It was a decision which no Russian president of any hue could ignore .
The radar is capable not only of tracking incoming Iranian missiles but of directing a warhead anywhere on Russia 's territory to an accuracy of metres .
Try as Russia might to talk to America , Washington would not be deflected from its course .
Sergei Ivanov , then first deputy prime minister , warned in July 2007 that if America did not modify its plan , Russia would station missiles in Kaliningrad .
Now it is doing so .
That is the effect , so where is the surprise ?
One move in this poker game soon leads to another .
Thanks to America 's insistence on a shield of unproven worth , and Poland 's backing for it , eastern Europe now faces the nightmare return of the short - range missile .
Go back 16 years to discover just how dangerous this bluff was .
Taking the chips off the table is going to be more difficult , even though Barack Obama told Radek Sikorski , the Polish foreign minister , about his doubts concerning the effectiveness of the missile shield .
Whatever the truth about the Pentagon 's claim that the shield is not aimed at Russia , the installation has become a self - fulfilling prophecy .
It invites Russian targeting , from which the missile base now has to be defended .
The result is that missiles are springing up like green shoots .
And no one can afford to wait for the next frozen conflict of the region - an area that runs from the Baltics , through which Russian military convoys travel to Kaliningrad , to the Caspian Sea - to leap out of the deep freeze .
Georgia could erupt again .
The Kremlin is not blameless : it is nationalist , autocratic , the battleground of rival clans capable of provoking a conflict in the Caucasus for the purpose of sending a message to each other .
But the regional stakes are now getting high .
Mr Obama has to convene an early bilateral summit with Mr Medvedev and Vladimir Putin , his prime minister .
The two sides need to untangle the issues dividing them , not tie them ever tighter into an intractable knot .
If he does nothing and gets dragged in by proxies such as Georgia , Barack Obama 's first international emergency may not be Iraq or Afghanistan but Russia ."
2008-11-12,"Just days after Barack Obama was elected president , he got his first test in the global arena .
Russia 's president , Dmitry Medvedev , at first resorted to some Soviet - style sabre - rattling before adopting a more emollient tone .

2008-11-12,"The cliché goes , in a crisis Russia has two friends it can rely on : the army and the navy .
Russian President Dmitry Medvedev may be regretting that certain passages were not cut from his address to the Federal Assembly last week .
In the modern Russian state , however , all is image .
The trouble for Medvedev is that he promised to "" re - equip "" Russia 's navy .
Within days he had ordered defence minister Anatoliy Serdyukov to begin an investigation into yet another naval disaster .
Unlike the Kursk disaster in 2000 , which resulted in 118 fatalities , Russia 's naval command were quick to point out that the Nerpa nuclear - powered submarine "" accident "" in the Sea of Japan on November 8 2008 did not involve a vessel commissioned into the Russian navy .
The 20 dead , including three naval officers and 17 civilians , were suffocated by Freon gas released accidentally to put out a non - existent fire .
Some blame a shortage of gas masks or insufficient emergency training .
The prosecutor general 's office in Moscow is promising criminal proceedings to satisfy Russia 's thirst for culprits .
The desire for truth is buried beneath an elite - serving culture of secrecy that masks the darker side of the disasters befalling Russia 's beleaguered navy .
The Nerpa ( Seal ) began life in 1991 , its construction severely hampered by the collapse of the USSR and the requirements of Russia 's navy in the 1990s .
Sitting partly constructed in the Amur shipbuilding yard in Russia 's far east in the mid-1990s with its earlier name Bars ( Leopard ) , progress towards final completion was slow .
Renewed impetus appeared in 2007 as Russia negotiated arms deals with India , but even through the Nerpa was earmarked for lease to India 's navy as part of a $ 2bn deal , problems continued with pay stoppages and the arrest of a shareholder at the Amur shipbuilding yard .
This latest submarine disaster may , in fact , be more damaging for Russia 's reputation as arms exporter .
However , there are also serious implications for Medvedev and his military ambitions .
Currently , the Russian pacific fleet comprises five strategic missile submarines , 18 multipurpose submarines and 56 warships of various class .
Russia 's Pacific fleet will receive two nuclear - powered submarines by 2012 and a modern aircraft carrier within a decade , according to its commander Vice Admiral Konstantin Sidenko .
Speaking of the aircraft carrier , Admiral Sidenko said , "" Within the next 10 years , we will probably receive it . ""
He knows Russia well enough to add the caveat "" probably "" .
The real tragedy of Nerpa lies in a leadership in the Kremlin that still dreams of a navy that can compete globally with the US .
What Medvedev can not admit publicly is that Russia has neither the capability to build or maintain such a navy .
And for all the Kremlin 's efforts to project an image of a newly - powerful Russia buoyed by its military victory against Georgia in August , its economy faces serious challenges a possible return to a period of net foreign capital outflow as well as longer - term economic issues rooted in diversification and a declining population .
Medvedev needs to quietly take the rhetoric out of his speeches , where he blames the US and the west for Russia 's ills , and concentrate on developing and equipping the type of navy his country needs .
Medvedev 's speech , widely regarded as coinciding with the election of Obama , was largely based on challenging the US and its position in the world .
If he really wants to do that , he 'll need something more realistic than a navy poorly led , underfunded and lacking in basic safety standards ."
2008-11-14,"Nicolas Sarkozy , the French president , said today that he had asked Russia not to deploy missiles in response to US plans for a missile defence shield in eastern Europe .
Speaking at a joint news conference with the Russian president , Dmitry Medvedev , following a Russia - EU summit in Nice , Sarkozy said Medvedev had responded positively to his proposal .
Medvedev announced last week that Moscow would deploy missiles in its western outpost of Kaliningrad in response to US plans for an anti - missile defence shield in Poland and the Czech Republic .
"" I indicated to President Medvedev how concerned we were about this declaration and how there should be no deployment in any enclave until we have discussed new geopolitical conditions for pan - European security , "" Sarkozy said .
Sarkozy , the current holder of the rotating EU presidency , said he had proposed that the EU and Russia hold talks on the future of European security in the middle of next year . ""
As president of the European Union , I proposed that in mid-2009 we meet ... to lay the foundation for what could be the future of European security , "" he said .
In a criticism of the US , Sarkozy said missile defence facilities in Europe would only complicate the situation and did "" nothing "" for Europe 's security . ""
Between now and then , do n't talk about deployment of a missile shield which does nothing to bring security and complicates things , "" the French president said .
The US insists that its anti - missile shield is to protect allies from threats from the Middle East , not Russia .
On EU - Russian cooperation , the president of the European commission , Jose Manuel Barroso , confirmed that the EU would resume partnership talks with Russia that had been put on hold over the war with Georgia .
The talks were suspended in September after a short war between Russia and Georgia over the latter 's breakaway provinces of South Ossetia and Abkhazia .
Critics say it is too early to resume talks because Russia maintains troops in the provinces .
The partnership and cooperation talks , which began in 2007 , aim for greater economic integration and cooperation on security and justice .
Despite some reservations , EU states agreed on Monday to resume talks on a broad partnership pact .
The two sides are expected to discuss a date for the talks .
The EU has strong incentives to maintain good relations with Russia as Moscow is the EU 's third largest trading partner and a leading supplier of gas and oil ."
2008-11-14,"Russia 's parliament voted today to extend the presidential term from four to six years , in a move that entrenches the Kremlin 's grip on power and paves the way for an early comeback by Vladimir Putin .
The country 's Duma , or lower house , voted overwhelmingly to back the constitutional amendment , which had its first reading after Dmitry Medvedev , Russia 's president , abruptly suggested it last week .
The parliament also voted to extend the Duma 's term from four to five years .
The amendment - likely to be ratified next Tuesday - does not apply to Medvedev , whose current four - year presidential stint is n't due to finish until 2012 .
But it comes amid feverish speculation that Putin , Russia 's powerful prime minister , is planning an early return to the Kremlin - possibly in the spring next year .
Failing that , he is likely to get his old job back in 2012 , analysts suggest .
Last week Medvedev said the longer term was necessary to guarantee "" effective "" government .
Today , however , critics said the "" undemocratic "" move was designed to perpetuate the Kremlin 's "" authoritarian "" rule when it is at risk of unpopularity due to the economic crisis .
"" This is very negative .
It 's a clear signal that the regime will be authoritarian and autocratic , and control everything .
It 's all about keeping power , "" said Vladimir Ryzhkov , a Kremlin opponent and former Duma deputy who lost his seat last year after he was banned from the elections .
Russia 's president already enjoys sweeping powers , Ryzhkov said - much greater than those of previous Russian or Soviet heads of state , including both the tsar and the general secretary of the Communist party .
"" The tsar was constrained by the aristocracy .
The party bureaucracy controlled the general secretary .
Today the president controls parliament , the senate , regions , the bureaucracy and the security services , as well as oil and gas , "" Ryzhkov noted .
Russia 's Duma decisively backed both amendments today , with 388 deputies in the 450-seat house voting for the changes .
The Duma is dominated by the pro - Kremlin United Russia party , which rubber - stamps all presidential initiatives .
Only the semi - autonomous Communists voted against .
Before the vote , the Communist leader , Gennady Zyuganov , denounced the changes . ""
If tomorrow you choose the person who is controlled by no one for a six - year term , it will be an even bigger tragedy and danger for the country [ than the economic crisis ] , "" he said .
The amendments are likely to get two more parliamentary readings early next week .
After that they go to the upper chamber , or Federation Council for approval .
This is a mere formality .
The changes are formally legal , critics concede , but go against the spirit of Russia 's 1993 constitution .
Last night Russia 's dwindling band of democrats also criticised the move .
Sergei Mitrokhin - the leader of the Yabloko opposition movement - described it as "" wrong "" and said it was reminiscent of the "" life - long government "" practised by Russia 's neighbours . ""
This is a way towards power stagnation , "" he said .
Others agreed .
"" I do not like it .
I like the principle that says : do not touch the constitution , "" Lyudmila Alexeyeva , the director or the Moscow Helsinki group , told Interfax . ""
If we start making amendments we might never stop . """
2008-11-14,"If diplomats were sportsmen , and their policies were medals , the western embassies in Moscow would surely hold the world record for getting Russia wrong .
It matters not whether the gates of the Kremlin are open , as they were under Boris Yeltsin , or shut as they are now under Dmitry Medvedev and Vladimir Putin .
The result is the same : wilful incomprehension .
In the 1990s when the doors and windows of the Kremlin were wide open ( too wide open ) to western advisers , and when they had a man in charge whom they thought of as "" theirs "" , the diplomats spent most of the decade looking the other way when things went wrong .
This was more difficult that it sounds .
The American embassy had a frontline view of the action when Boris Yeltsin opened fire on the Russian parliament , known as the White House , a couple of hundred yards away .
Snipers from the presidential bodyguard shot at their own forces to get them to storm the building , and prisoners led from the burning building were summarily executed , and yet the Clinton administration said nothing .
This is of some relevance today because some of the Americans who were in Moscow in 1993 then are back advising Barack Obama now .
Three years later , Yeltsin learned how to squeeze out the moderate democratic opposition in a presidential election by whipping up fears that Russia was about to plunge into civil war .
As a result , independent television coverage was crushed .
Again , silence .
Three years after that , western governments were looking the wrong way when Vladimir Putin emerged onto the scene .
The script said that the threat to the neoliberal reform programme would come from unrepentant communists , from the hidden ranks of former KGB officers .
But that was not the way it turned out .
Putin had been a middle - ranking KGB officer , but it was not the KGB who propelled him into power but the people we mislabelled as democrats and reformers .
Putin was hand - picked by Yeltsin to deal with a greater political threat , the challenge of an old Soviet hand , Yevgeny Primakov .
Primakov was not the nemesis of the Yeltsin era , but the man he himself had chosen to keep his family 's dirty financial secrets , a duty Putin performs to this day .
It is an inconvenient truth for the massed ranks of analysts who see in Russia 's invasion of Georgia a return to the Soviet Union or a mini - USSR .
But it is still true that the seeds of Putin 's brand of autocracy and nationalism were planted long before his arrival onto the Russian political stage .
And they were sown not just by the communists , but by the Russian Orthodox Church and by those whom the west hailed as liberal reformers .
If you think that the Soviets had a problem with retreat from empire , just look at a Russian Orthodox vision of Russia 's near - abroad .
Or read the views of another anti - Soviet hero , Alexandr Solzhenitsyn , on Ukraine .
In the space of just one decade from 1992 - 2002 , a short time in Russia 's history , a pro - western communist regime turned into an anti - western capitalist one .
A triumph of western diplomacy .
Western policies continue to stoke the fires of Russian nationalism .
The missile defence shield is a good example .
There are technical doubts as to whether it works , or whether Iran has got a ballistic missile capable of reaching western Europe .
But in the symbolic world of threats and counterthreats , the ghost system has already taken on a strategic life of its own .
No more so than when America announced it was going to protect the as yet non - functioning missile base in Poland with Patriot missiles , a decision made in the heat of Russia 's brief war with Georgia this summer .
Washington undermined its own argument that the missile defence system in Poland was no threat to Russia , by making the defense of the base a direct response to events in Georgia .
That is the folly of linking a dispute over missile defence in Poland with events in Georgia .
It not only undermines the US 's own argument that this system has nothing to do with Russia , but it feeds straight into the Kremlin 's nationalist mindset of encirclement .
None of this is to excuse what is going in the Kremlin .
Isolation and autocracy are , and always were , bad for Russia .
At a time when Russia should have used its huge oil and gas reserves , or its language , education system , and greater industrial wealth , as a form of soft power with its weaker neighbours , it did the opposite .
Now that the oil price is falling , and the crash in the world banking system has created a large hole in Russia 's economy , Putin and Medvedev may well find Russia will need western investment to renew keys parts of infrastructure in the oil and gas industry .
Once again the pendulum will swing .
But the pattern is the same .
Throw all the windows open and then slam them shut .
There are surely more sophisticated forms of ventilation ."
2008-11-14,"Antagonism between the Kremlin and the Bush administration over the deployment of missile systems in Europe deepened yesterday after the US defence secretary , Robert Gates , accused President Dmitry Medvedev of "" provocative , unnecessary and misguided "" plans to station short - range ballistic missiles in Russia 's Baltic exclave , Kaliningrad .
Speaking on a visit to Estonia , Gates said the plans to place Iskander - M missiles in eastern Europe were "" hardly the welcome a new American administration deserves "" .
Medvedev revealed his intention to move Iskander - M tactical missiles into Kaliningrad during his first annual speech to parliament on November 5 - hours after Barack Obama was elected .
He said the deployment was necessary to "" neutralise "" interceptor missiles and a radar station that Washington wants to site in Poland and the Czech Republic .
The announcement caused anger in Washington , with Nato and the EU both expressing trenchant opposition .
There were attempts at conciliation at the weekend , when Medvedev and Obama spoke on the telephone , expressing a wish to meet soon and mend relations .
Separately , the Russian foreign minister , Sergei Lavrov , and the US secretary of state , Condoleezza Rice , met on the sidelines of Middle East peace talks in Egypt for what the state department described as "" good and productive "" discussions .
But yesterday Gates bluntly criticised Medvedev 's announcement on moving Iskanders into Kaliningrad , saying : "" Such provocative remarks are unnecessary and misguided . ""
The US defence secretary rejected calls by the Kremlin for Washington to throw out its European missile shield plans , saying the shield was vital to meet threats from rogue states such as Iran , which had made "" active efforts "" to develop nuclear weapons . ""
Frankly I 'm not sure what the [ Russian ] missiles in Kaliningrad would be for , "" he told journalists in the Estonian capital , Tallinn . ""
After all , the only real emerging threat to Russia 's periphery is Iran , and I do n't think the Iskander missile has the range to get there from Kaliningrad . ""
Moscow has made clear that its weapons in the Baltic exclave would be pointed at the US defence shield , which it believes could be used offensively against Russia .
However , earlier yesterday Medvedev suggested in an interview with French journalists that the Kremlin might review its Kaliningrad deployment if Washington backed off on its missile defence plans .
"" We could reverse the decision if the new US administration re - examined the effectiveness of deploying these rockets and radars , "" Medvedev said .
"" In particular , how adequate a means they would really be for reacting to threats from so - called rogue states .
"" Gates also pushed strongly yesterday for Ukraine to be given a roadmap to Nato membership at a meeting of the alliance 's ministers next month .
The Germans and French are strongly opposed to this .
But Jaak Aaviksoo , the Estonian defence minister , told the Guardian after seeing Gates : "" The US was very persistent on this . ""
He said of Moscow 's threat to deploy missiles in Kaliningrad : "" When you put missiles near our borders , it 's not a friendly move .
I think the Russians will reconsider . ""
In a nutshell
In a reminder of tensions over Georgia yesterday , an adviser to French president Nicolas Sarkozy revealed details of a conversation between his boss and the Russian prime minister , Vladimir Putin .
The two met in Moscow on August 12 , just days after war had erupted between Russia and Georgia over breakaway South Ossetia .
"" I am going to hang Saakashvili by the balls , "" Putin said of the Georgian leader , Mikheil Saakashvili .

Putin responded : "" Why not ?

2008-11-18,"On November 15 , the president of Russia , Dmitry Medvedev , used a speech to the Council on Foreign Relations in Washington to challenge the US president - elect , Barack Obama , to turn away from the foreign policies pursued by George Bush that so rankled with the Kremlin .
Russia opposes United States plans to station components of the controversial anti - ballistic missle ( ABM ) shield in Eastern Europe , which Moscow argues would upset the strategic nuclear balance in Europe .
It is also against the expansion of Nato further eastward to include either Georgia or Ukraine .
Underlying the aspiration to build a constructive relationship with Washington is Moscow 's resentment over the post - cold war order which it views as favourable to American interests ; Russia 's political elite longs to be treated equally as a "" great power "" .
Moreover , Medvedev sees Nato itself , struggling in Afghanistan , as a cold war relic and advocates a new security architecture which it would like to negotiate with Europe and exclude the US .
As the global financial crisis has affected Russia – with fears for the future of its foreign direct investment and the central bank airing concerns over the rouble – Medvedev knows the country can not project an image of a resurgent , powerful state , rich on natural resources , with oil sliding below $ 60 ( £ 40 ) per barrel .
In this sour economic climate , Medvedev resorts to talking up Russian military power to convince Washington that Russia should be dealt with on its terms .
Buoyed by Russia 's military victory in Georgia in August , he promises to respond to the US missile shield interceptors in Poland by "" neutralising "" their possible threat to Russia by stationing Iskander conventional missiles in the Russian Baltic enclave of Kaliningrad .
The Iskander short - range conventional missiles , with a range of 400 km , would certainly pose a threat to the American interceptors in Poland , deployed as components of the ABM missile defence shield .
However , it is , as the Kremlin knows , all about bluff .
Those interceptors have no bearing on Russia 's capability to launch a nuclear attack and , as such , have no implications for the "" strategic balance "" in Europe .
In private , Russian officials acknowledge that these missile defence interceptors would only become an issue in real terms if an American administration decided at a later stage to vastly increase their numbers in Poland and the Czech Republic .
So Russian short - range missiles would once again be targeted on a European country , initially Poland , for no real reason .
Its benefit , for Moscow , is psychological ; it raises fears over Russian power in Europe that allows Moscow to continue to exploit transatlantic fissures in the Nato alliance , promoting conditions in which Russia succeeds in intimidating European states into a new European security architecture that includes Russia and excludes the United States .
Medvedev has been encouraged to think that the EU takes Russia more seriously than it needs to .
After suspending partnership talks between the EU and Russia over the war in Georgia in August , such talks resumed on November 14 .
Already the division is apparent : the French president , Nicolas Sarkozy said the resumption of talks was not a "" sign of weakness "" , while the US deputy assistant secretary of state , David Merkel , said : "" We cautioned the EU and its member states about starting the partnership and cooperation negotiations in light of Russia not fulfilling the ceasefire agreement .
"" Russia has still not withdrawn its troops to positions it occupied before August 7 or abandoned plans to set up military bases in Abkhazia and South Ossetia .
In Washington , Medvedev showed signs of willingness to compromise , but not over Georgia , with the incoming Obama administration .
He even appeared to scale back the threat to deploy missiles to Kaliningrad .
Flexibility was signalled over the controversial missile defence plans , over which the Kremlin believes Obama does not share the same level of enthusiasm as Bush .
"" We have a chance to solve the problem through either agreeing on a global system or , as a minimum , to find a solution on the existing programmes which would suit the Russian Federation , "" Medvedev said in Washington .
In short , as Moscow tries to lever more cordial relations with Washington through Obama , it continues to play a game of bluff based on exaggerating Russian power .
Yet , the prospect of Madeleine Albright and Zbigniew Brzezinski , not known for being soft on Russia , participating in Obama 's foreign policy team may give cause for uncertainty in Moscow .
Obama 's short summary of his position on Russia – regarding Russia neither as an enemy , nor an ally – shows he will prove no pushover for the Kremlin ."
2008-11-18,"Russia 's deepening strategic partnership with Venezuela took a dramatic step forward today when it emerged that Moscow has agreed to build Venezuela 's first ever nuclear reactor .
President Dmitry Medvedev is expected to sign a nuclear cooperation agreement with his Venezuelan counterpart , Hugo Chávez , during a visit to Latin America next week , part of a determined Russian push into the region .
The reactor is to be named after Humberto Fernandez Moran , a late Venezuelan research scientist and former science minister , Chávez has announced .
It is one of many accords he hopes to sign while hosting Medvedev in Caracas next week .
The prospect of a nuclear deal between Moscow and Caracas , following a surge in Russian economic , military , political and intelligence activity in Latin America , is likely to alarm the US and present an early challenge to the Obama administration . ""
Hugo Chávez joins the nuclear club , "" Russian 's Vedomosti newspaper trumpeted today .
Venezuela 's socialist leader said the reactor may be based in the eastern state of Zulia .
He stressed that the project would be for peaceful purposes .
As if to underline that point , four Japanese survivors from the Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombs visited Venezuela this week at the government 's invitation .
The energy ministry , which is scouting locations , said the project was at a very early stage .
A report which mooted a nuclear reactor long before Chávez came to power has been dusted off .
Despite abundant oil reserves , Venezuela 's energy infrastructure is creaking and prone to blackouts .
A nuclear reactor would enable the country to utilise its rich uranium deposits and allay criticism that the government has neglected energy investment .
More importantly for Moscow and Caracas , a nuclear deal will showcase a partnership which advocates creating new "" poles "" of power to check American hegemony .
Nick Day , a Latin American specialist , said the nuclear deal was deliberately timed to pile pressure on the US administration during a moment of transition and weakness .
"" Russia is manoeuvring hard in the time between Obama 's election and his inauguration .
What the Russians are trying to do is to set up a chessboard that gives them greater mobility in negotiations when he [ Obama ] comes to power , "" Day said .
He added : "" Russia 's message is : ' We can exert influence in your backyard if you continue to exert influence in our backyard .
If you do n't take your missiles out of Poland and end Nato expansion we 're going to increase our influence in Latin America and do things to provoke you . ' ""
According to Sergei Novikov , spokesman for Russia 's federal nuclear agency , no reactor can be built until both countries have signed a preliminary agreement on nuclear cooperation .
This will be signed next week , Novikov told Vedomosti .
Both presidents are also expected to firm up details of a Russian - Venezuelan energy consortium to jointly produce and sell oil and gas .
Russian companies which are already exploring oilfields in Venezuela could then extend their reach to fields in Ecuador and Bolivia .
Venezuela has bought $ 4bn of Russian arms , including Sukhoi fighter jets , making it one of Moscow 's best clients .
Chávez has spoken of also buying Project 636 diesel submarines , Mi-28 combat helicopters , T72 tanks and air - defence systems .
Despite the spending spree , Venezuela 's military has not tipped the regional balance of power .
Chávez 's armed forces lag behind that of Brazil , Chile and Colombia and analysts question Venezuelan effectiveness .
For Russia 's president , however , Caracas is a valuable springboard into Latin America .
In addition to Venezuela , Medvedev will visit Peru , Brazil and Cuba — the first trip by a Russian leader to Havana in eight years .
Moscow has spoken of reviving Soviet - era intelligence cooperation with the communist island and in a sign of dramatically improved ties , President Raul Castro last month attended the opening of a Russian Orthodox cathedral in Havana ."

2008-11-27,"President Dmitry Medvedev was due to accelerate Russia 's drive into Latin America with a visit to Venezuela last night , a day after Russian warships dropped anchor off the country 's Caribbean coast .
The Russian leader was to meet President Hugo Chávez to deepen economic and military links and present a united diplomatic front against Washington in the countdown to Barack Obama 's administration .
The first visit by a Russian leader to Caracas underlined a burgeoning alliance between the two countries , both big energy producers , and their ambition to convert petrodollars into strategic clout .
Earlier Medvedev met Brazil 's president , Luiz Lula da Silva , in Rio de Janeiro .
They announced a plan to hold the first summit of major emerging market countries , known as BRICs , in Russia next year .
The other members are China and India .
Tomorrow the Russian president is to discuss oil and economic accords with President Raul Castro in Cuba .
The Russian nuclear - powered cruiser Peter the Great and the destroyer Admiral Chabanenko arrived in Venezuelan waters on Tuesday after a two - month journey from Murmansk .
It was Moscow 's first show of naval force in the region since the cold war .
Next week the visiting warships are due to hold joint exercises with Venezuela 's fleet - a relatively small force designed for coastal patrols - near the port of La Guaira and further out at sea , practising tactical manoeuvres against narco - traffickers and terrorists , said Luis Morales Marquez , a Venezuelan vice - admiral .
"" It is a chance for us to strengthen our friendship and solidarity with the Russian navy . ""
The visit was a moment to savour for Chávez .
He has made seven visits to Moscow , including three this year , to woo support for his vision of a multipolar world .
Medvedev , more prosaically , was expected to try to sell more weapons ."
2008-11-28,"President Dmitry Medvedev was due to hold talks with Fidel Castro tonight to rebuild Russia 's relations with Cuba almost a decade after they ended in acrimony .
The Russian leader earlier met and signed deals on nickel mining and oil exploration with Raul Castro , who succeeded his ailing older brother as Cuba 's president in February .
In a display of bonhomie , the two presidents toured Havana 's historical sights arm in arm .
"" It has been a magnificent visit and now he will see Fidel , "" Raul shouted to TV cameras .
The one - night stop in Havana was the final leg of Medvedev 's week - long Latin America tour , a visit intended to open business opportunties for Russian companies and to show that Moscow could operate in the US backyard amid tension over Washington 's involvement in eastern Europe and the Caucasus .
"" One must admit , to put it simply , we have never had a serious presence here ( in Latin America ) .
These have been just episodes , "" Medvedev told reporters .
His stops in Peru , Brazil and Venezuela showed Moscow 's determination to become a regional player , he said .
"" In some ways we are only now beginning full - fledged , full - format and , I hope , mutually beneficial contacts with the leaders of these states .
We should not be shy and fear competition .
We must bravely enter the fight . ""
A Russian naval squadron led by the nuclear - powered cruiser Peter the Great has moored off Venezuela 's coast and is due to hold joint exercises next week with Venezuela 's navy , Moscow 's first such deployment since the cold war .
Russia 's relations with Havana curdled after the collapse of the Soviet Union ended its subsidies to Castro 's government , a brutal economic blow to an island enduring a US embargo .
Medvedev 's predecessor , Vladimir Putin , rubbed salt in the wound by closing Russia 's Lourdes intelligence base in Havana in 2000 .
Both sides hope to benefit from trade and energy deals , including oil drilling in Cuba 's segment of the Gulf of Mexico .
Today 's visit was carefully prepared over the past year with repeated visits to Havana by high - ranking Russian officials .
The recent opening of a Russian orthodox church in the capital signalled the Castro government 's eagerness .
However analysts said Raul , who is deemed to be more pragmatic than Fidel , would stop short of military or other types of cooperation with Moscow which could sabotage Havana 's hopes of a softer US policy under an Obama administration ."

2008-12-09,"Russian businesses are most likely to use bribery to win foreign contracts despite President Dmitry Medvedev 's promise to clamp down on corruption , according to a report out today .
As part of its 2008 Bribe Payers Index , anti - corruption body Transparency International interviewed 2,742 senior business executives from 22 of the world 's most economically influential countries .
Russia was ranked last , closely followed by China , Mexico and India .
TI said that half of respondents reported that companies from Russia often bribed politicians , political parties and low - level public officials when doing business abroad .
Medvedev said in the summer that corruption was a threat to national security and unveiled a plan to fight it .
However , past Russian anti - graft drives have been limited to high - profile arrests of a few bribe - taking officials and have had little wider impact .
China also has a corruption problem , which it is trying to curb with a number of measures , including the death penalty .
Huguette Labelle , head of TI , said : "" The BPI provides evidence that a number of companies from major exporting countries still use bribery to win business abroad , despite awareness of its damaging impact on corporate reputations and ordinary communities .
"" The inequity and injustice that corruption causes makes it vital for governments to redouble their efforts to enforce existing laws and regulations on foreign bribery and for companies to adopt effective anti - bribery programmes . ""
The UK came joint fifth with Germany and Japan .
Tony Parton , partner in forensics services at PricewaterhouseCoopers , said : "" It is clearly good news that corporate UK 's efforts to improve its record on bribery have paid off as it moves up the index . ""
But he said it was not the time to be complacent . ""
Many UK companies are facing difficult financial times where it may seem tempting to win business at any price , including the payment of bribes .
This , combined with the fact that companies are cutting costs and people , leaves them open to a very real threat that bribery will re - emerge , "" he said .
Firms from Belgium and Canada were perceived as least likely to be involved in corruption .
In the previous index , published in 2006 , India was named as the worst , followed by China and Russia , while companies in Switzerland , Sweden and Australia were seen as least likely to use bribery ."
2008-12-12,"It had seemed an appropriate memorial .
In August , Russia 's president , Dmitry Medvedev decided to name a street in Moscow after Alexander Solzhenitsyn , shortly after the writer 's death aged 89 .
But the residents of Alexander Solzhenitsyn Street - as it is now known - appear to have other ideas .
Together with Russia 's communists , locals have waged a furious campaign against the change of name - and have demanded that the street get its old name of Big Communist Street back Communist activists have complained that Medvedev 's decision to rename the street after Solzhenitsyn - Russia 's greatest literary chronicler of communist repression - is , in fact , illegal .
Under Russian law , the authorities are supposed to wait ten years before they can name a street after a dead person .
Locals , meanwhile , have gone one step further .
Last Sunday residents tore down the street sign , leaving a gaping space above house number 12 .
The authorities have now put the Solzhenitsyn sign up again .
Another plaque bearing the writer 's name hangs at the end of the avenue next to branch of McDonald 's , an outlet the Nobel - prize winning author - no fan of western capitalism - was unlikely to have eaten in .
Changing the name of the street was "" not only a gross breach of existing legislation but also a challenge to all people with communist views because Solzhenitsyn always fought with the communists , "" Sergei Udaltsov , the leader of the communist Left Front youth organisation , told the Moscow Times .
Most residents were against the change , he added , because they have been forced to alter their documents , including passports .
"" My wife and I have n't received our pension , "" Vladimir Gusarov , a pensioner living at number 24 , complained .
Around 1,000 people have signed a petition against the change of name , while the Left Front has initiated a legal action in Moscow 's city court to have it overturned .
Officials , however , insist the decision is constitutional , and point out that there are precedents .
The Urals city of Yekaterinburg , where Boris Yeltsin grew up , already boasts a President Boris Yeltsin street , following the former Russian president 's death last year .
Street names remain a source of bitter controversy in Russia and a proxy battleground for rival ideologies - hardly surprising in a country with a history so tumultuous and unresolved and which includes communists , nationalists , and even monarchists .
After the collapse of the Soviet Union , several Russian towns and cities reverted to their pre - revolutionary names .
Others , however , have kept their communist associations .
Every major town in Russia has at least one Lenin Street , not to mention a statue of the man who brought about Bolshevism .
( Before the 1917 communist revolution , Moscow 's Big Communist Street - or Bolshaya Kommunistecheskaya Ulitsa to give it its name in Russian - was called Alexseyevska , after a local church . )
During his long literary career , Solzhenitsyn was consistently anti - Soviet .
His 1961 novella , One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich , exposed the brutal reality of Stalin 's hidden gulag and labour camp system .
The book brought him worldwide fame and led to his expulsion from the Soviet Union in 1974 .
He returned to post - communist Russia after two decades in exile , mainly in the US , but became swiftly disillusioned with the godless , capitalist society that replaced Soviet rule .
In his last years , Solzhenitsyn reacted approvingly to Vladimir Putin 's restoration of authoritarian government .
Russia 's revival under Putin was apparently in accord with the writer 's own orthodox and national conservative views .
Putin even had tea with Solzhenitsyn last year at his Moscow dacha and gave him a literary prize ."

2009-01-04,"As Russia once again resorts to aggressive economic tactics in its latest dispute over gas supplies with neighbouring Ukraine , its official state documentation is raising the spectre of future military conflict over energy resources .
Russia 's security council prepared a draft document on national security strategy until 2020 .
At a joint security council and state council meeting held in Moscow on 25 December and chaired by Russia 's president , Dmitry Medvedev , the document in question was to be discussed , but this was postponed at the last minute , instead concentrating on Russian policy in the Commonwealth of Independent States ( CIS ) .
President Medvedev ordered a new security strategy in June 2008 , and its draft form has been discussed among all its regions .
The "" strategy of national security of the Russian Federation until the year 2020 "" – written under the direction of Nikolay Patrushev , secretary of the security council , is expected to be adopted at a state council meeting on 20 February 2009 .
In early December 2008 Patrushev toured Russia 's federal districts promoting the new security strategy .
Following a meeting on national security in the far eastern city of Blagoveshchensk he said the proposed draft was pragmatic and practical , and lists specific measures to ensure Russia 's national security .
The document itself begins with the claim that Russia has overcome the "" consequences of the systemic political and socioeconomic crisis of the late 20th century "" and has now restored its capacity to promote its national interest through "" multipolar international relations "" .
After predictably designating the United States as Russia 's main rival , it then turns to how Russia may maintain its position in the world in future and describes rivalry for controlling global energy resources as a longer term source of conflict .
The regions where such confrontations are expected to sharpen is also defined : "" The international policy will focus on the access to the energy sources of the world , including the Middle East , Barents Sea , the Arctic Region , Caspian Sea and Central Asia .
The struggle for the hydrocarbon resources can be developed to the military confrontation as well , which can result with violation of balance on the Russia 's borders with the allies and increasing of the nuclear countries "" .
It also suggests existing conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan , Middle East , some of the South Asian and African countries , as well as in Korean peninsula will have a continued negative impact on the international situation over the next 12 years .
Emphasising possible future Nato enlargement , the new strategy promises to resist US plans to develop its missile defence capabilities , which the Russian elite claims are being aimed against Russia , rather than North Korea or Iran .
Furthermore , Russia will pursue a "" pragmatic foreign policy "" which eschews a new arms race , which clearly the country can not afford in any case .
Despite widespread disagreement among Russian academics and security experts , the document assumes the possibility of future military conflict erupting over energy resources .
Its current gas dispute with Ukraine compelled the Russian government to downplay fears within the EU of any possible disruption to energy supplies , has triggered speculation of increased gas prices in the UK and recently disclosed British government documents confirm that during the last Russo - Ukrainian energy dispute in 2006 the UK energy minister Alan Johnson was briefed eight times on threats to energy security emanating from Russia .
Russia 's pursuit of the "" multipolar world order "" will involve support from its allies in the CIS and its partners elsewhere .
It pledges deeper participation within the G8 , G20 , RIC ( Russia , India , China ) and BRIC ( Brazil , Russia , India , China ) .
Although referring positively to its allies within the collective security treaty organisation , there is no doubt that drawing on the lessons of its experience of the Georgia war last August , Russia will rely more on its own devices and especially its armed forces , which are promised financial and other resources "" sufficient "" for the creation of a new image of the armed forces while retaining its strategic nuclear potential .
The strategy also calls for establishing a "" highly professional community of Russian secret services "" as a means of ensuring the external and internal security of Russia and developing a "" national framework of dealing with international terrorism , extremism , nationalism , and ethnic separatism "" .
All this implies that Russia will continue to use its intelligence services at home and abroad to exaggerate Russia 's power and its image in the world .
Almost bombastic in its tone , once again portraying an "" image "" of a resurgent Russia , the new security strategy neglects real risks stemming from falling production and social hardship – these are not risks based on an imaginary enemy attacking Russia for its energy resources .
The price of oil has fallen sharply , the world 's economy is slowing down and the financial crisis is hitting Russia hard : the country 's political leadership must adjust to new harsh economic realities , but instead chooses to flex military "" muscle "" ."
2009-01-18,"Russia would do everything in its power to end the dispute with Ukraine that has led to drastic cuts in gas supplies to Europe , President Dmitry Medvedev said .
Medvedev held talks with Ukrainian and European officials in Moscow in hopes of ending an 11-day halt in deliveries through Ukrainian pipelines . ""
Unfortunately , all the efforts have brought no results so far , and people living in European countries still do n't have heat , "" Medvedev said before the talks began ."
2009-03-03,"Russia 's financial crisis is beginning to destabilise the delicate Kremlin power balance , with a struggle between rival clans eroding Vladimir Putin 's authority and aggravating his relationship with his protege , President Dmitry Medvedev .
There are growing signs that a powerful group of military and security officials grouped around Putin are locking horns with economic liberals headed by Medvedev as the two groups fight for control of rapidly evaporating state finances .
Medvedev marked the first anniversary of his election victory yesterday , but the triumphalism has long since dissipated .
Russia has been hit hard by the global crisis , with the stockmarket down almost 80 % from its peak , and the rouble sliding fast .
Russia 's top 10 billionaires alone lost an estimated $ 150bn last year .
The sudden evaporation of Russia 's newfound wealth has set the two Kremlin cliques on a collision course and put Putin - now prime minister - in an awkward position .
As a former KGB agent he is heavily identified with the security group , known as the siloviki , but he also has strong personal loyalty to a small clique of liberals from his home town of St Petersburg .
Experts say Putin is losing status as he attempts to contain conflict between the factions .
Cracks are appearing in his relationship with Medvedev . ""
Putin used to act as an arbiter standing above the two main clans - the siloviki and the rational economists , "" said Dmitry Oreshkin , a leading political analyst .
"" Now he 's been dragged down into the fight and he 's under fire from both sides .
The siloviki say he 's a weakling incapable of imposing his will and showing the economists their place , while the economists in turn are consolidating around Medvedev . ""
Medvedev , handpicked by Putin from among loyal acolytes as a successor , has begun to issue muffled criticism of his mentor , leading some to believe that he may be enjoying the trappings of power and be prepared to flex his political muscle .
At a recent meeting with economic officials Medvedev said responses to the financial crisis - set by Putin as head of government - were "" unacceptably slow "" and instead of action on promised reforms there had been only "" talking and talking "" .
Last month Igor Yurgens , director of the Institute of Contemporary Development , a new thinktank created by Medvedev , criticised Putin for restricting press freedom and stressed that "" the most honest and independent opinions on Russia 's problems are coming from the liberal wing , rather than from the so - called statist patriots "" .
"" Medvedev has got the whiff of power in his nose and he likes it , "" said Mikhail Delyagin , an analyst and former government adviser on economic policy .
"" He 's given tacit approval for his administration to engage in an information war with Putin 's apparatus .
"" The man at the centre of the Kremlin power struggle is the finance minister , Alexei Kudrin , who has warned the siloviki and the private corporations in which they have strong interests that the state is limiting financial rescue packages for big business . ""
The siloviki have been used to sharing out the spoils of the state , "" said Delyagin .
"" They want to get rid of Kudrin because he holds the purse strings and he 's not giving them any cash . ""
An $ 18 m corruption investigation into the finance minister 's deputy was renewed three weeks ago in a thinly veiled attack on his boss by the siloviki .
For Putin , the problem is that Kudrin - who yesterday admitted mistakes in handling the financial crisis - is one of his deputies and an old ally from his St Petersburg days .
The internecine struggle between Kremlin factions has prompted rumours that Putin , afraid of becoming a focal point of public discontent , recently considered the possibility of leaving his post .
In this scenario , he would become speaker of the state duma , Russia 's lower house of parliament , as a member of the statist United Russia party .
Another scenario is that Putin will be forced to sack Kudrin in order to appease the military - security clique .
A former lawyer , Medvedev has no law enforcement links in his past and is at loggerheads with key siloviki figures such as the deputy prime minister , Igor Sechin , who rely on Putin for influence .
Medvedev , 43 , has little of the physical aura of Putin , 56 , who has burnished an action - man image by flying jets , practising judo throws and being pictured going fishing with a bare chest .
Commentators , however , say the younger man is slowly gaining authority .
"" At the moment Medvedev can still walk into a room full of governors and no one will even notice him , "" said Delyagin .
"" It reminds you of Winston Churchill 's phrase : ' An empty taxi pulled up at 10 Downing Street , and Clement Attlee got out ' .
But he is building confidence .
And it should n't be forgotten that Attlee in fact defeated Churchill . """
2009-03-04,"Former billionaire oligarch and government critic Mikhail Khodorkovsky went on trial for a second time in Moscow yesterday , in a case seen as a test of Russia 's president Dmitry Medvedev and his promise to end the country 's "" legal nihilism "" .
Khodorkovsky , an oil tycoon who fell foul of Russia 's former president Vladimir Putin and was jailed in Siberia for tax evasion , faces fresh charges of money laundering and embezzlement .
He is accused this time of stealing $ 25bn .
His supporters claim the case is a political attempt by the Kremlin to keep Khodorkovsky in prison .
The tycoon , once Russia 's richest man , was jailed for eight years in 2005 .
Khodorkovsky made his first public appearance in Moscow since 2005 after being flown in last week from his Siberian prison .
Looking tired and considerably older , but in apparent good spirits , he smiled and joked with his business partner Platon Lebedev , who is also on trial .
Yesterday 's preliminary proceedings were held in secret .
Reporters were allowed into the building to watch the trial on three TV screens downstairs , but court officials switched the monitors off seconds before the case began .
The case is likely to be Russia 's most high - profile legal event this year .
Khodorkovsky 's original prosecution was widely seen as retribution , ordered by Putin , after the tycoon funded opposition parties ahead of the 2003 Duma elections .
Some analysts , however , believe the choice of Moscow rather than Siberia as a trial venue is a hopeful sign .
President Medvedev insists he wants to replace Russia 's corrupt and inefficient judiciary with a genuinely independent legal system .
This trial is the big test .
"" This case is of immense importance because of what it will say to all of us about where Russia is going , "" Robert Amsterdam , one of Khodorkovsky 's lawyers , said yesterday .
He dismissed the evidence against the tycoon as "" absurd "" .
It is not clear yet whether the case , which could last more than six months , will be heard in open court .
Yesterday police arrested 10 demonstrators who shouted "" freedom to Khodorkovsky "" outside the building .
Prosecutors allege Khodorkovsky helped embezzle 900bn roubles ( $ 25bn ) and laundered 500bn roubles , charges that could keep him in jail for 22 years if he is found guilty ."
2009-03-04,"Dmitry Medvedev was destined to be a lame duck leader when he was elected Russia 's third president a year ago .
His inauguration ushered in a ruling tandem with his mentor and predecessor Vladimir Putin seemingly shifting a gear to become prime minister .
Putin , however , has so far done all of the steering while Medvedev has been along for the ride .
Russians have not been duped , judging by the latest opinion poll by the respected Levada Centre , which indicate only 12 % believe Medvedev wields real power .
Another 34 % believe it lies with Putin , while 50 % believe it is shared between them .
Buoyed by rising commodity prices , Putin 's eight - year reign restored Russia 's shattered economy , raised living standards for many and re - established Russia 's standing internationally as a power - broker .
A tough act to follow .
Unfortunately , events have not been kind to Medvedev ; the equity market and economy have collapsed ; a war with Georgia and a major gas dispute with Ukraine have soured relations with Europe ; a currency crisis has rattled the public ; and an oil price that rose steadily through his predecessors ' two terms has tanked .
Medvedev 's presidency has brought a change of tone but not a change in substance .
His response to the January murders of a human rights lawyer , Stanislav Markelov , and the journalist Anastasia Baburova on a Moscow street were markedly more sympathetic than Putin 's gruff response to the 2006 murder of journalist Anna Politkovskaya .
Rather than reverse any of Putin 's policies , Medvedev has hinted at reform of the judiciary and the political system .
He has subtly criticised Putin 's cabinet for its handling of the crisis but has n't sacked anyone in the federal executive for their mishandling of the economy .
Russia 's five - day war with neighbouring Georgia in August was arguably Medvedev 's toughest assignment , but many doubt the extent of his involvement in the key decisions .
It was Putin , not Medvedev , who appeared in a flak jacket among Russian troops after the outbreak of war , in which Russia quickly routed its southern neighbour .
Medvedev had never won elected office before becoming president .
He owes his dizzy rise in government and his old job as chairman of energy giant Gazprom to Putin .
A former lawyer , Medvedev made a commitment to the rule of law and to stamp out "" legal nihilism "" a central tenet of his inauguration speech last year .
A new trial commencing on Wednesday of jailed tycoon Mikhail Khodorkovsky is a chance to show his leadership credentials and whether he is committed to those promises .
Khodorkovsky , the former owner of oil giant Yukos was jailed for eight years in 2005 for fraud and tax evasion in a trial regarded widely as a vendetta by Putin , for his funding of rival political forces .
If Khodorkovsky is convicted on new charges , Medvedev will be seen as suffering a setback in his campaign for the rule of law .
If the former oligarch is acquitted , the ex - KGB hardliners surrounding Putin will be seen to have lost .
Russia 's double - headed eagle is working as a tandem , albeit with one driver and a passenger , who is a spoke in Putin 's wheel .
Only time will tell whether Medvedev has the capacity to exercise his legs and turn direction ."
2009-03-04,"Barack Obama yesterday opened the prospect of a deal with Russia on the contentious US missile defence system in Europe in return for Moscow 's help in resolving the Iranian nuclear crisis .
Obama sent a conciliatory letter to the Russian president , Dmitry Medvedev , last month , hand - delivered by US officials based in Moscow , it emerged on Monday .
The contents remain private but officials in both countries said Obama offered to begin a new relationship after the difficult Bush years .
Medvedev yesterday described the letter as a positive signal and said he hoped it might lead to agreements .
Reports in the Russian and US media said the letter contained specific proposals to drop the missile defence system , vehemently opposed by Moscow , as a quid pro quo for help with Iran .
Speaking in the Oval Office alongside Gordon Brown yesterday , Obama said the reports were inaccurate .
But he went on to say : "" What I said in the letter was that , obviously , to the extent that we are lessening Iran 's commitment to nuclear weapons , then that reduces the pressure for , or the need for , a missile defence system . ""
The US and Europe claim Iran is getting closer to achieving a nuclear weapons capability , a charge that Tehran denies , and want Russia to join them in imposing tougher sanctions .
But Russia has resisted such sanctions .
Relations between Moscow and Washington have been soured by a US plan to put the missile defence system in Poland and the Czech Republic .
Washington says it is for protection against an Iranian attack ; Moscow says it is aimed at Russia .
Medvedev , on a visit to Madrid yesterday , confirmed he had received Obama 's letter and welcomed the "" positive signals "" coming from the new administration .
He hoped to reach "" agreements "" but , like Obama , denied there were any quid pro quos , insisting that missile defence and Iran were separate issues .
Asked at a press conference about Obama 's letter , Medvedev said : "" If we are talking about any ' swaps ' [ Iran for missile defence ] , this is not how the question is being put .
This would n't be productive . ""
He added , however , that the Kremlin was working closely with the Obama administration on the threat posed by Iran 's nuclear programme .
"" If the new administration shows common sense and offers a new [ missile defence ] structure which would satisfy European [ needs ] ... and would be acceptable for us , we are ready to discuss it . ""
Medvedev added : "" I count on positive signals we are now receiving from Washington translating into agreements . ""
Natalya Timakova , Medvedev 's press secretary , said the Russian leader appreciated the positive spirit of the message .
"" Obama 's letter contains various proposals and assessments of the current situation .
But the message did not contain any specific proposals or mutually binding initiatives , "" Timakova said .
Medvedev is planning to issue an invitation to Obama to visit Russia at the G20 summit in London next month .
The US is still reviewing its policy towards Iran , but what is evolving is a combination of an offer to Tehran to negotiate directly with Washington combined with a threat of greater economic sanctions .
John Kerry , the Democratic chairman of the Senate foreign relations committee , said yesterday at a hearing on Iran that direct US talks with Tehran would be a good starting point but warned that it would not be enough .
The US would have to go into talks from a position of strength and not allow Iran to draw out negotiations .
"" We need to set a timetable for substantive progress .
And we need to make sure that Iran 's leaders understand that the full weight of the international community will come down on them if this issue is not resolved , "" said Kerry .
"" And by full weight I mean tougher economic sanctions , further restrictions on trade and finance , which will apply meaningful pressure on the Iranian regime at a time when oil prices have plummeted and its economy is hurting . ""
The US secretary of state , Hillary Clinton , said she planned to discuss the missile defence system when she meets the Russian foreign minister , Sergei Lavrov , in Geneva on Friday .
Clinton , interviewed on MSNBC yesterday , sounded less conciliatory than Obama , saying that even if Iran had no nuclear weapons , its conventional weapons would pose a threat and justified the need for the missile defence system ."

But somehow he managed to combine the words and the result came out as follar , which means "" to fuck "" .

Mandla Mandela is to become an MP for the African National Congress , the majority party , after the April elections .
Mandela is a businessman with ties to presidential candidate Jacob Zuma , who faces corruption charges .
Mandela 's candidacy is expected to give the ANC a boost in advance of the 22 April poll .
An ANC spokesman , Brian Sokutu , called his entry into politics "" historic "" .

Associated Press in Johannesburg Crash plane 's altimeter was faulty , say experts
Experts investigating the Turkish Airlines crash that left nine dead said yesterday that a faulty altimeter , which checks altitude , led to the plane stalling .
At 1,950 ft ( 600 metres ) the device registered the plane , which was on autopilot , as being at about ground level , so fuel to the engines was reduced and the plane lost speed .
By the time the pilots realised it was too late .
The Boeing 737 - 800 crashed near Amsterdam 's Schiphol airport on 25 February .
Pieter van Vollenhoven of the Dutch Safety Authority said the jet had had altimeter problems twice before , and Boeing had been told to warn clients .
Associated Press in Amsterdam Wallet full of teeth rattles supermarket customer A customer shopping at a Wal - Mart for a wallet claims he found something that hit an unpleasant note : human teeth .
Police said the man found 10 human teeth on Saturday when he unzipped a compartment in the wallet .
One tooth had a filling .
The customer handed the wallet and the teeth to employees at the Falmouth store but left without giving his name .
Police told the Cape Cod Times that the teeth belong to an adult , but as there was no blood or gum tissue on the teeth , they would be unable to perform DNA tests .
Wal - Mart said it was an "" isolated incident "" .

2009-03-06,"US secretary of state Hillary Clinton predicted today that the US and Russia will complete a new strategic arms reduction treaty by the end of this year and that Moscow and Washington can find common ground on other issues .
"" We intend to have an agreement by the end of the year , "" she told a news conference after two hours of talks with Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov .
Clinton said she expects US president Barack Obama and Russian president Dmitry Medvedev in coming weeks to instruct negotiators from both capitals to complete an arms treaty to replace the one that went into effect in 1991 and is due to expire on 31 December .
Lavrov said he also expects a deal to be completed on time .
The negotiations have not begun , but Clinton said today 's talks in Geneva produced agreement on the need to quickly establish a set of priorities and a negotiating agenda that could be presented to Obama and Medvedev before they meet in London in a few weeks .
Clinton said talks with Lavrov were a "" fresh start "" in resetting relations between the two former cold war foes .
Clinton says the discussions touched on the two nations ' mutual interest in advancing nuclear disarmament and on growing concerns about Iranian nuclear development and instability in Afghanistan .
She said the talks did not produce any formal agreements , but both sides expressed interest in restarting nonproliferation talks .
Clinton also expressed gratitude for Russian willingness to allow US nonmilitary shipments to transit through its borders to Afghanistan .
Clinton said they had "" a very productive meeting of the minds on the range of issues "" expected to be broached in future talks ."
2009-03-17,"President Dmitry Medvedev said today that Russia planned to boost its conventionally armed and nuclear forces to counter a growing threat from Nato , raising the spectre of a military confrontation between Moscow and the west .
In a hawkish speech to Russia 's top generals , Medvedev said Russia intended to upgrade its army and navy from 2011 .
Russia would also overhaul its strategic nuclear forces in an effort to guarantee the country 's "" security "" , he said .
The modernisation was necessary because of the danger posed by the west 's transatlantic military alliance , he said .
"" Attempts to expand the military infrastructure of Nato near the borders of our country are continuing . ""
Medvedev 's remarks come two weeks before his first meeting with President Barack Obama , at the G20 summit in London on 2 April .
The Obama administration has said it wants to "" reset "" its troubled relations with Moscow – but has so far received mixed signals from the Kremlin .
Russia has offered to assist the US in the transport of non - military supplies to Afghanistan .
At the same time , however , Moscow agreed a backroom deal last month with Kyrgyzstan which is likely to lead to the closure of the US 's key military base in central Asia .
At issue is what Moscow regards as the west 's creeping encroachment into Russia 's backyard .
Russia vehemently objects to Nato membership for Georgia and Ukraine , and is also bitterly opposed to the deployment of the US 's proposed missile defence shield in central Europe – currently under review .
Today , Russia 's defence minister , Anatoly Serdyukov , said the world situation meant the "" likelihood of armed conflicts and their potential danger for Russia "" was rising .
"" The military - political situation is characterised by the US leadership 's desire … to expand its military presence and that of its allies in regions adjacent to Russia , "" he declared .
America was actively trying to steal energy and mineral resources in central Asia and other post - Soviet countries on Russia 's borders , he complained , adding that the US was "" actively supporting processes aimed at ousting Russia from the area of its traditional interests "" .
Medvedev said today that Russia 's security council was drawing up a new national security strategy for the period up to 2020 .
The strategy is likely to identify the main threat to Russia as western military expansion and the growing struggle for energy resources , analysts suggest .
The old strategy identified the biggest challenge as terrorism . ""
The primary task is to increase the combat readiness of our forces .
First of all , our strategic nuclear forces , "" Medvedev said .
"" They must be able to fulfil all the necessary tasks to ensure Russia 's security . ""
Medvedev also said another task on Russia 's agenda was to transfer all combat units to a state of "" permanent readiness "" ."

Later , military officials announced that Russia plans to deploy intercontinental missiles fitted with multiple warheads once the strategic arms reduction treaty [ Start 1 ] expires in December .
The US secretary of state , Hillary Clinton , said a new strategic arms deal with Russia was a priority .
Russia has also welcomed talks on a nuclear deal .
Last night Yevgeny Myasnikov , a Moscow defence analyst , said Russia 's wishlist ahead of next month 's Obama - Medvedev meeting was well - known .
"" Russia wants an end to the US 's missile deployment in Europe , a moratorium on Nato expansion , [ and ] a deal on Start , "" he said .
He added that there were doubts as to whether Russia had enough money to modernise the crumbling Soviet - era army and navy after 2011 ."
2009-03-30,"Russia Russia has been eagerly looking forward to the G20 summit - not because of Gordon Brown , but for the first meeting between presidents Barack Obama and Dmitry Medvedev .
The encounter between two men widely seen as pragmatists is likely to see the beginning of a new , slightly improved era in US - Russian relations .
Under their predecessors , George Bush and Vladimir Putin , ties sank to their most dismal level since the cold war .
Russian officials concede that Obama wo n't give Moscow everything it wants .
The lengthy shopping list includes an end to Nato expansion , the scrapping of the US missile defence shield in Europe and a new strategic arms reduction treaty .
On the G20 agenda , Russia will side with the Germans and other Europeans who oppose US - British plans to drag the world out of recession by further spending .
It supports German chancellor Angela Merkel 's call for greater market regulation rather than a further co - ordinated stimulus package .
Moscow also backs China 's idea of creating a new global reserve currency alongside the dollar - an idea the EU has rejected .
Given the weakness of Russia 's crisis - hit economy , though , the new man in the Kremlin is n't in much of a position to impose his ideas on others .
Luke Harding in Moscow Brazil
The G20 meeting has been pushed off the front pages of Brazilian newspapers by more immediate local concerns .
Instead of debating the global economic slump and the intricacies of the IMF , South America 's largest economy has been pondering pressing domestic issues : a four - day drug war in Rio de Janeiro , the training sessions of Brazil 's national football team and the latest federal police crackdown on a multi - billion dollar corruption scheme .
In taxis , restaurants and front rooms across the country the talk has been of shoot - outs , kick - ups or kickbacks rather than toxic assets or protectionism .
Lord Mandelson 's musings on the Brazilian economy made the headlines earlier this month , during the business secretary 's visit to Sao Paulo .
"" The situation here ... is not as serious as in many other countries , "" Mandelson told business leaders in Brazil 's economic capital , Sao Paulo , echoing the much - criticised words of the president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva last year that the impact of the crisis in Brazil would be a "" ripple "" .
With industrial production down nearly 19 % in December and about 700,000 jobs shed between November and February this year , not everyone is convinced .
But Lula 's popularity remains high , at over 60 % , and , for now at least , the financial crisis is seen as a reasonably distant prospect , if not exactly a "" ripple "" .

The global financial crisis has seen France revert to its long - standing mistrust of free markets , globalisation , capitalism and "" fat cat "" bosses .
Nicolas Sarkozy - who was elected on the most free market platform France had ever seen , saying the country 's problem was that it was not taking enough risks or borrowing enough along US or British lines - has changed his tone and adopted a rhetoric that has seen him caricatured as Karl Marx .
The French model of high social protection , cautious banks and a population sceptical of credit cards has n't spared France the crisis , but the country has not yet suffered a banking collapse like that of Britain or Ireland .
As Sarkozy arrives at the G20 , with very low popularity ratings at home , his biggest demand is greater international regulation to clamp down on the excesses of capitalism .
He does n't want more stimulus packages , but a more "" moral "" capitalism .
This is crucial among public opinion in France , where the financial crisis has seen record public support for strikes and street demonstrations , a rise in extreme protests such as taking bosses hostage , and a surge of support for the extreme left .
Currently , the two men most trusted in France to "" change things "" are Sarkozy and Olivier Besancenot , a postman and one - time Trotskyite who heads the New Anticapitalist party .
"" If we do n't want to play the anticapitalist game , capitalism must stop being a caricature of itself , "" the president has said .
Gael Sliman , a director at pollsters BVA , said the French public had given up expecting much from international politicians or summits like the G20 but if strong initiatives were taken on regulation , public opinion could react well .
"" I 'm not going to associate myself with a world summit that decides to decide nothing , "" Sarkozy has warned .
Angelique Chrisafis in Paris Afghanistan With so many dire problems of its own
, Afghanistan is one country that will not be anxiously awaiting the outcome of the G20 summit .
Afghanistan is immune not only to the effects of the economic meltdown that world leaders hope to address in London , but is also enjoying boom conditions as the US and its allies rush to pump yet more money , soldiers and resources into the country .
As the situation in Afghanistan has steadily deteriorated , the country 's financial position has only improved , with western aid pledges increasing year on year .
The latest bit of good news was Barack Obama 's Afghanistan - Pakistan strategy review last week , which confirmed that the US was prepared to shoulder the open - ended commitment of a massively increased Afghan security force .
The Kabul government also has a series of international talkfests in the coming months specifically dedicated to the unfolding crises in Afghanistan , including a one - day UN sponsored meeting in The Hague , which opens tomorrow .
President Hamid Karzai and his entourage left Kabul yesterday to attend the conference .
Jon Boone in Kabul
China Newspapers are not holding their front pages for dispatches from the summit , but among the Chinese elite there is debate about the meeting 's significance .
Some believe it could mark a new era for the international financial order .
China and other emerging nations are demanding an overhaul of the global architecture - not surprising when the world 's third largest economy has less say at the IMF than Belgium .
Beijing is speaking from a position of strength .
Domestic growth is plummeting , but is still likely to expand by 6 % or 7 % this year , and the country boasts large reserves while developed economies are shrinking and debt - ridden .
The vice - governor of the central bank recently said China will "" actively consider "" buying any new bonds from the IMF and many believe an increased contribution must lead to more influence .
But Mumu , a commentator from Securities Times , wrote sceptically : "" It is hard for us to believe that the United States would transfer its hegemony willingly . ""
Wu Xiaoling , a former vice - governor of the central bank , said : "" It 's impossible for any concrete agreements to be reached at the G20 .
We should n't pin much hope on it . ""
She argued its real purpose was symbolic : showing that global leaders were acting together to tackle the crisis .
Tania Branigan in Beijing Kenya
While the G20 summit is likely to mean little to most Africans , their leaders will be closely following the events in London .
At a meeting with Gordon Brown last week , 20 African ministers and prime ministers asked for up to $ 50bn ( £ 34bn ) in additional and easily accessible funding to help the continent through the global downturn .
They also expressed fears that foreign development aid would be reduced .
The African Development Bank says initial hopes that developing nations could decouple themselves from the worldwide crisis had disappeared , with the continent 's average growth projected to slip from 5.4 % in 2008 to 3 % this year .
Donald Kaberuka , the bank 's president , said that fast population increases in many countries meant there would be little or no effective growth per head , wiping out recent progress towards self - sufficiency and causing "" a massive increase in poverty "" .
Countries reliant on mineral exports , such as Zambia and Tanzania , have already seen significant job losses or cancelled contracts due to falling international demand for commodities .
Remittances from the diaspora and tourism earnings are also expected to drop sharply this year .
Xan Rice in Nairobi India
The G20 summit is making headlines in India but mostly because of disputes involving Europeans , China and the US .
India , whose economy is largely driven by domestic demand , has been hit less hard than many other big nations .
It would like a bigger say at the World Bank and the IMF and perhaps more cash to be funnelled its way for infrastructure spending ; but these demands are trotted out at every G20 summit India attends .
The biggest news is that Barack Obama will meet the prime minister , Manmohan Singh , on Thursday , where the US 's Pakistan strategy is likely to be discussed .
However since India is gearing up for elections , the emphasis by Indian diplomats will be to listen and not gloat .
"" They will sit on their hands .
It 's a dead duck government anyway , "" said Mohan Guruswamy , of Delhi 's Centre for Policy Alternatives .
"" The last thing they want to do is blame the global culprit [ for the downturn ] ...
America "" .
Randeep Ramesh in Delhi Iran
With an economy largely isolated from the global financial system , Iran has been bypassed by most of the shocks that will consume the G20 summit .
The country 's leaders have barely been able to conceal their glee at the sight of western economies in freefall .
Yet , while Iran will be conspicuous by its absence , it is unlikely to be far from the thoughts of those present , given the international concern over Tehran 's nuclear programme and its strategic importance as an oil and natural gas producer .
Equally , the event will not pass unnoticed by Iranian officials who , loth as they are to admit it , are highly sensitive to their exclusion from many international forums .
Iran 's leaders believe the country 's historical and geopolitical importance entitles them to a seat at major gatherings .
The country has economic concerns of its own , which have been exacerbated by the global downturn .
A crash in oil prices has left a hole in the national budget and forced public spending cuts on Mahmoud Ahmadinejad 's government .
Iran 's acceptance of a US invitation to a summit on Afghanistan in The Hague just two days before the London gathering is evidence of its desire to escape from isolation .
Robert Tait Iraq Few people in Iraq have heard of the G20 summit and most seem to feel that the fortunes of global finance will have little impact on their world .
But , though they have not been invited , Iraqi politicians and financiers are anticipating a trickle down for Iraq from probable new moves to recalibrate world credit markets .
Mahdi al - Hafez , a member of the economic committee in Iraq 's parliament , predicted world leaders would further attempt to place checks on free market capitalism and enshrine a bigger role for governments "" In 1929 when there were similar problems these [ free market ] countries turned to government intervention to solve the problem , "" he said .
"" And now America has given $ 700bn to deal with the bankruptcies of private companies . ""
Mohamed Khorshed , a Baghdad economist , said : "" What has happened not only affects the economies of the bigger countries but it also impacts on third world countries like Iraq .
As long as they work quickly to rectify things , we should be OK . ""
Kamal Ahmed , who lectures in economics at Baghdad Collage , said financial disaster was fast approaching the Iraqi economy .
"" We know 90 % of Iraq 's economy is dependent on oil prices , which have plummeted in direct connection to the international financial crisis , so Iraq 's eyes will be looking to this summit for a solution , just like all the developed world . ""
Jamil Antwan , another economist , said Iraqi experts would look to the summit to find ways to diversify their economy rather than seek a rescue package .
"" We ca n't just depend on oil revenues and we will be watching eagerly for trends and opportunities for us to leverage off what the rest of the world is doing . ""
Martin Chulov in Baghdad US Many Americans will only become aware of the G20 summit when they see television footage of Barack Obama arriving in London .
Washington 's thinktanks held briefing after briefing last week for policymakers previewing Obama 's visit to Europe .
But that excitement was not shared by the US media .
Newspapers , TV and websites focused almost exclusively on the recession 's effect on the domestic economy rather than the world at large , and towards the end by Obama 's policy switch on Afghanistan .
The Wall Street Journal carried a front - page piece yesterday predicting that Gordon Brown 's ambitious plans for a new world order were likely to fall flat , the New York Times had an article on chancellor Angela Merkel 's scepticism about Obama 's economic strategy and USA Today almost alone had a lengthy story previewing the summit .
Expectations in the White House and the US treasury for the summit are relatively low , given the rifts on policy between Obama and countries such as France and Germany .
There is little reporting in the US of the European sentiment that America is mainly to blame for the recession .
US TV channels began yesterday to mention , albeit briefly , Obama 's trip but the reporting was not about the economics but the picture opportunities , in particular the meeting between the Obamas and the Queen , and whether Michelle Obama would be as big a hit in Europe as Jackie Kennedy .
Ewen MacAskill in Washington"
2009-03-31,"Barack Obama received an early boost from Russia today as he flew from Washington to London for the start of an intensive round of diplomacy aimed at rebuilding US relations around the world after the Bush era .
The US president is scheduled to meet the president of the Russian Federation , Dmitry Medvedev , in London , in the most important of a series of bilateral meetings ahead of the G20 summit .
Medvedev , in an article published in the Washington Post today , responded positively to early overtures from Obama .
The trip to Europe is Obama 's first overseas since becoming president .
It will test his ability to wring out concessions on the international stage on issues ranging from the global recession to Nato involvement in Afghanistan .
To avoid any risk of his trip being judged a failure , he is ready to back a fudged communique on how to handle the recession and has backed away from asking European allies , other than Britain and Poland , to contribute more combat troops to Afghanistan .
His team will also try to make amends to Gordon Brown after the prime minister was perceived to have been shabbily treated on his visit to DC in early March .
The White House is playing up differences from the Bush adminstration .
Speaking before Obama 's departure , and referring to the belief that Bush failed to listen to Europe , the spokesman Robert Gibbs said : "" The president and America are going to listen in London , as well as to lead . ""
Obama opted to fly to Stansted rather than Heathrow to avoid the experience of Bush 's last visit to UK through Heathrow , which created long traffic delays and a host of public complaints .
The president was due to have an early night tonight after a courtesy call on US embassy staff in London .
But tomorrow will see a busy round of face - to - face meetings with world leaders , including the Chinese leader Hu Jintao , as well as with Medvedev and Brown .
Medvedev , in the Washington Post article , wrote that the pessimism that surrounded US - Russian relations last year appeared to be over : "" Long ago , Alexis de Tocqueville predicted a great future for our two nations .
So far , each country has tried to prove the truth of those words to itself and the world by acting on its own .
I firmly believe that at this turn of history , we should work together . ""
The article was seen in Washington as the Russian response to earlier overtures made by Obama in a secret letter to Moscow .
In that letter , Obama hinted that the US would drop plans to deploy a missile defence system in the Czech Republic and Poland , which Moscow opposes , in return for Russian help with the Iran crisis .
Reggie Dale , a specialist on Europe at the Washington - based Centre for Strategic and International Studies , said yesterday he believed Obama had set off on the wrong foot with the Russians by opening with concessions .
"" That is the wrong way to deal with Russians .
They have an incredible talent for sniffing out weakness and exploiting it , "" he said , adding there was a danger Moscow would see Obama as "" a sucker "" .
Charles Kapuchan , a European specialist at the Council on Foreign Relations , was less sceptical but said the question now , with Obama and Medvedev having expressed goodwill , was : ""
Where 's the beef ?
"" There was a need for more than just rhetoric , he said .
Kapuchan viewed the G20 summit 's importance as primarily psychological .
"" I would say the most important objective is to demonstrate as much global solidarity as posible as citizens and markets are jittery and scared that countries will respond to the global crisis by going their own way , "" he said .
On Brown , whom Obama sees tomorrow morning , Dale said : "" I think there is a feeling that they [ the Obama administration ] did not handle the the Brown visit well .
I do not think they would go all the way with the British media about snubs , but they gave the impression it was a bigger deal for Brown than Obama . ""
He added : "" I have heard from officials he [ Obama ] is to make a special effort for Brown , even if Brown does not feel particularly snubbed . """
2009-04-01,"Barack Obama and Dmitry Medvedev have pledged to agree cuts in their countries ' nuclear arsenals by December this year , as part of a "" fresh start "" in US - Russian relations and a step towards "" a nuclear free world "" .
After a meeting between the two men in London , on the eve of the G20 summit , President Obama also accepted an invitation to fly to Moscow in July , by which time both sides hope negotiators from both countries will have worked out an arms control deal to replace the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty ( Start ) which expires on 5 December .
The negotiators were told to begin work at once .
There were no specific figures in the statements issued after the meeting at Winfield House , the US embassy residence , but the two leaders agreed that the new deal would go further than the Moscow treaty that their predecessors , George Bush and Vladimir Putin , agreed in 2002 .
The treaty stipulates operationally deployed ( ready to fire ) arsenals of 1,700 - 2,200 warheads , suggesting the goal of a new treaty would be to go below 1,700 , and a target figure mentioned as a possibility by both sides is 1,500 warheads each .
In fact any new deal is likely to be far stricter than the Moscow treaty , which was full of holes in arms control terms .
It did not apply to non - operational stockpiles , so each side could comply by simply mothballing warheads rather than destroying them .
There were also no verification mechanisms , which give most disarmament treaties their teeth , and either side could pull out with only three months ' notice .
The new deal will be "" comprehensive "" and "" legally binding "" .
It was the first meeting between the two men , and they appeared to get on well .
One Russian official said : "" It was very positive , and it lasted longer than envisaged .
I saw both presidents during and after and they both seemed happy . ""
The leaders issued two statements after the meeting , held on the eve of the G20 summit .
One was a short factual account of the nuclear disarmament plans .
The second was a much more discursive ( 1,500-word ) appraisal of all aspects of US - Russian relations , mostly noting areas of agreement .
"" We , the leaders of Russia and the United States , are ready to move beyond cold war mentalities and chart a fresh start in relations between our two countries , "" the statement said .
"" In just a few months we have worked hard to establish a new tone in our relations .
Now it is time to get down to business and translate our warm words into actual achievements of benefit to Russia , the United States , and all those around the world interested in peace and prosperity . ""
It acknowledged that there were still differences over US plans to build a missile defence system that would include interceptors and radar in eastern Europe .
The US says the system is intended to defend the west against future Iranian missiles , while the Russians believe it blunts their own nuclear deterrent .
The leaders hinted at a compromise , saying they "" discussed new possibilities for mutual international co - operation in the field of missile defence , taking into account joint assessments of missile challenges and threats , aimed at enhancing the security of our countries , and that of our allies and partners "" .
The wording suggested that Obama and Medvedev could be prepared to think creatively to find a way out of the impasse that has threatened to paralyse the relationship in recent years , perhaps including Russia in some form of joint scheme .
They agreed to disagree about the causes of last August 's Russian - Georgian war , but committed themselves to further diplomacy aimed at stabilising the Caucasus region .
And over Iran , another divisive issue , Russia appears to have won the argument for now .
There was a joint call for Iran to abide by UN security council resolutions and suspend enrichment of uranium , but no threat of new sanctions , which Russia opposes .
The new relationship , for the time being , is to be built around nuclear disarmament , which Obama said was a "" good place to start "" to reinvigorate a relationship he argued had been allowed to "" drift "" in recent years .
The driving force behind the new deal is not just the imminent expiry of Start in December , but also the looming review of the non proliferation treaty ( NPT ) next year , at a time when Iran could be close to joining the nuclear club , and other Middle Eastern countries are consequently weighing their nuclear options .
Obama described the NPT as threadbare , and the joint statement said they wanted "" to demonstrate leadership in reducing the number of nuclear weapons in the world "" , to give the nuclear powers more leverage in talks with disgruntled non - nuclear states in talks over the coming year . ""
We committed our two countries to achieving a nuclear - free world , while recognising that this long - term goal will require a new emphasis on arms control and conflict resolution measures , and their full implementation by all concerned nations , "" the joint statement said ."
2009-04-01,"Barack Obama and Dmitry Medvedev have begun talks at the US embassy residence in Regent 's Park , central London , aimed at achieving significant nuclear disarmament and reshaping relations between their two countries .
The Winfield House talks were due to end at about 1 pm and are expected to produce two documents , Russian officials said .
One will set new parameters for the troubled US - Russia relationship .
The other will announce the resumption of talks on nuclear disarmament aimed at reaching a deal by the time the strategic arms reduction treaty ( Start ) expires on December 5 .
It is not yet clear whether there will be any figures in the nuclear document specifying target figures for the nuclear stockpiles .
They could be 1,500 warheads each , down from the 2,200 deployed weapons currently permitted .
The Russian camp says there may be figures in the document .
The Americans have played down such suggestions .
Also possible is a date for a visit by Obama to Moscow this summer to negotiate a new nuclear treaty .
Speaking about the meeting at a joint press conference this morning with Gordon Brown , Obama said US - Russian relations had been drifting for years , and that addressing proliferation was a "" good place to start "" to reinvigorate them .
He said the nuclear non - proliferation treaty , due for renewal next year , was "" threadbare "" and that the existing nuclear powers would be in a much better position to tell non - nuclear countries not to develop weapons if they pursued deep cuts in their stockpiles .
The spectre of nuclear weapons in the hands of terrorists , he said , "" continues to be the greatest threat against humanity "" ."
2009-04-01,"Barack Obama and Dmitry Medvedev have pledged to agree cuts in their countries ' nuclear arsenals by December , as part of a "" fresh start "" in US - Russia relations and a step towards "" a nuclear free world "" .
The first meeting between the two men , on the eve of the G20 summit in London , led to a dramatic improvement in the tone of the relationship and agreement on arms control that could lead to the two countries ' strategic arsenals being cut by a third .
Obama also accepted an invitation to visit Moscow in July , by which time both sides hope negotiators will have worked out the framework of the arms control treaty .
Officials were told to start work immediately .
A joint statement said : "" The era when our countries viewed each other as enemies is long over "" .
Both sides were effusive about the 70-minute session at Winfield House , the US ambassador 's residence in Regent 's Park . ""
After this meeting , I am far more optimistic about the successful development of our relations , "" Medvedev said afterwards .
Obama said there had been "" great progress "" .
Later , a senior US official described the nuclear pledge as "" a very significant breakthrough .
There were no specific figures on arms cuts but the leaders agreed the deal would go further than the Moscow treaty which their predecessors , George Bush and Vladimir Putin , signed in 2002 .
That treaty stipulates operationally deployed [ ready to fire ] arsenals of 1,700 - 2,200 warheads , suggesting the goal of the new treaty would be to go below 1,700 .
Officials on both sides said 1,500 warheads was a realistic , representing a more than 30 % cut in their current arsenals .
Any new deal is likely to be stricter than the Moscow treaty .
That did not apply to non - operational stockpiles , so each side could comply by mothballing warheads rather than destroying them .
There were also no verification mechanisms .
The new deal would be modelled on the more rigorous Start agreement , officials from both sides said .
Obama 's aides said the meeting was not simply a "" get - to - know - you "" encounter , of the sort George Bush favoured , but had been prepared with months of substantive negotiations .
"" We do n't do drive - by summits , "" a senior US official said .
Obama also met Hu Jintao , the Chinese president , yesterday afternoon , and agreed to visit China in the second half of the year .
Their joint statement focused largely on economic cooperation .
Two statements were issued after the Obama - Medvedev meeting .
One was a short factual account of the disarmament plans .
The second was an appraisal of all aspects of US - Russian relations , mostly noting areas of agreement .
"" We , the leaders of Russia and the United States , are ready to move beyond cold war mentalities and chart a fresh start in relations between our two countries , "" it said .
But it also noted differences over US plans to build a missile defence system in eastern Europe .
The US says the system is intended to defend the west against Iranian missiles , while the Russians believe it blunts their nuclear deterrent .
On this the leaders agreed to disagree , but said they had talked about ways of cooperating on missile defence technology .
Nuclear numbers How many nuclear warheads do the US and Russia have ?
The Arms Control Association believes the US deploys at least 2,200 .
Russia is believed to deploy 2,000 - 3,000 .
What efforts were made to cut this ?
Under the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty the US and USSR agreed to slash strategic nuclear delivery vehicles from 10,000 to 1,600 and limit the number of warheads per country to 6,000 .
The Strategic Offensive Reductions Treaty of Moscow , signed in 2002 , limited arsenals to 1,700 - 2,200 by 2012 .
But it allowed warheads to be stored rather than destroyed , and imposed no restrictions on delivery vehicles .
Will other countries follow suit ?
Unlikely .
The 1968 Nuclear Non - Proliferation Treaty 's attempts to limit proliferation were a manifest failure , as Israel , India , Pakistan and North Korea secretly joined the nuclear club ."
2009-04-01,"Bill Clinton hugged Boris Yeltsin and it ended in the collapse of the rouble and a war in Chechnya .
George Bush looked deep into Vladimir Putin 's eyes and they parted company trading missile threats amid a war in Georgia .
Barack Obama pressed the reset button with Dmitry Medvedev yesterday and produced a four - page shopping list of subjects about which they would continue to talk - chief among them the intention to cut nuclear arsenals by a third .
Whatever today brings with the G20 , particularly after the public splits between France and Germany , the US president 's first international foray has already achieved results .
The cold warriors , who say the west should stand up to Russia rather than engage with it , predict that the relationship between Mr Obama and Mr Medvedev will also end in tears .
But there is a self - fulfilling quality to the notion that Russia should only be allowed to join our game when it plays by our rules .
Mr Obama has seen a chance to create a virtuous circle .
By offering to go slow on missile defence , he could generate Russian pressure on Iran to abandon its attempts to build a nuclear bomb .
Russia is key to persuading Iran to stay within the bounds of a civilian nuclear programme , because it is helping Tehran build one .
The abandonment of a covert Iranian plan to build the bomb would obviate the need for a missile defence battery close to Russia 's border .
Deep differences remain over both the missile defence programme and Georgia .
Mr Obama said he had no interest in papering over the cracks .
But his is more than just a change in tone .
The real change is that America has decided to stop making progress on bigger fronts - strategic nuclear arsenals , non - proliferation , military transit routes to Afghanistan - hostage to problems on lesser ones .
This could be more fruitful than confronting Russia for two reasons .
Russia is no longer a rival superpower , but it is the world 's second largest nuclear power .
The new dialogue re - establishes a partnership which existed during Mikhail Gorbachev 's era , but which disappeared during the Clinton and Bush years .
Agreeing to cuts in nuclear arsenals is well within Russia 's comfort zone , although it will be more difficult to achieve now that its conventional forces are so much weaker .
Second , with a strengthened bilateral relationship , America will be less inclined than it was to see Russia through the distorting prism of former Soviet satellite states .
Both Ukraine and Georgia have got their own complex political problems , irrespective of Russia .
Their instability is not solely down to the machiavellian manoeuvring of Moscow .
Of course , Russia today is less confident than it was only six months ago .
Its once - booming economy has screeched to a halt .
December saw a double - digit percentage fall in its industrial output .
The cranes stopped swinging in Moscow and unemployment is spiralling , despite the practice of companies reducing salaries rather than labour .
Tolyatti , the home of the Russian car industry , is in an even worse state than Detroit , and there are demonstrations against Vladimir Putin , the man most Russians venerate .
This is no different to what is happening in the UK , except that in Russia inflation is also booming and private debt is out of control .
So a poorer Russia could make for a less assertive one .
There are bound to be setbacks .
Competing visions of national interest , competing gas pipelines and the natural tendency of Russia 's neighbours to look west for support will continue to create tensions .
A bilateral relationship between Russia and America is easier to achieve than one between Russia and the European Union , which will become more dependent , not less , on Russian gas .
But for all this , the path on which two presidents embarked yesterday is the right one - the only one that can ensure Russia 's true place as a regional power spanning both Europe and Asia ."
2009-04-01,"After their first meeting Wednesday in London , President Barack Obama and Russian President Dmitry Medvedev released a joint statement committing the two countries to a three - month goal of negotiating a new , legally - binding arms control treaty , with a long - term goal of "" achieving a nuclear free world "" .
However , only the concrete facts as negotiated by both sides , and then as ratified by the State Duma and the US Senate , will determine whether this joint statement is more than a rhetorical press release .
Nevertheless , in the initial impression , it is important for three reasons .
First , it reaffirms the US - Russian nuclear weapons reduction partnership participated in to various degrees , for the last 40 years .
Over the course of that partnership , the two countries that maintain 95 % of the world 's bombs have decreased their combined total from a high of over 60,000 nuclear weapons in 1986 ( pdf ) , to around 19,000 today .
The United States has 5,200 nuclear warheads ( pdf ) , 2,700 of which are operational .
Russia 14,000 nuclear warheads , 5,200 operational .
The existing joint nuclear reduction agreement – the May 2002 Strategic Offensive Reductions Treaty ( Sort ) – committed Moscow and Washington to cutting their "" operationally deployed strategic warheads "" to 2,200 each .
Nevertheless , it fell short of past agreements , as it had no effect on warheads in reserve stockpiles or under repair , no roadmap beyond 31 December 2012 –
remarkably the date that compliance was required and the treaty itself expired , and no verification procedures .
The Obama - Medvedev joint statement contains pro - verification language consistent with US - Russian arms control agreements predating the last administration : "" We agreed to pursue new and verifiable reductions in our strategic offensive arsenals in a step - by - step process . ""
Second , although the joint statement gave no numbers , US and Russian officials have floated a ceiling of 1,500 warheads for each nuclear arsenals .
That total is significant , as it would force US military commanders to readjust their nuclear targeting priorities .
In a landmark 2000 New York Times op - ed , Bruce Blair , a former US air force launch control officer and McArthur "" Genius "" Fellowship award - winner , revealed that his research and interviews indicated "" that there are about 2,260 so - called vital Russian targets on the list today "" , and a few hundred secondary targets in China , Iraq , Iran and North Korea .
Cutting the total of operational and reserve nuclear warheads to 1,500 will force nuclear war planners into tough decisions about how to deter the use of nuclear weapons by another state against the US or its allies .
Finally , the joint statement represents a theoretical down payment on Obama 's pledge as a presidential candidate to "" make the goal of eliminating nuclear weapons worldwide a central element of US nuclear policy "" .
Sustained cooperation between Moscow and Washington will be the single most important factor for Obama to turn his pledge into reality .
Realistically , the series of multilateral treaties required to account for , monitor and verify the dismantlement of the world 's nuclear weapons will take decades .
But if negotiated in good - faith , and containing concrete numbers , and adequate verification measures , the treaty due in three months will be a historic first step ."
2009-04-03,"On his return home , Dmitry Medvedev hailed Barack Obama as "" my new comrade "" .
The Russian president said he was not seeking the end of Nato by proposing a new security pact for Europe , and his Nato ambassador , Dmitry Rogozin , a hardwired nationalist , said he would not rule out joining the transatlantic alliance one day .
And this from the land which greeted Mr Obama 's election with the announcement that it would deploy short - range missiles in Kaliningrad if America installed a missile defence battery over the border in Poland .
What a difference a 70-minute meeting in London makes .
Meanwhile , comrade Obama will outline in Prague tomorrow an agenda for a world without nuclear weapons .
Yesterday world prosperity .
Today world peace .
Not a bad week 's work .
Nothing of substance has changed - the core differences between Nato and Russia remain .
But the tone of the dialogue has changed and that does matter .
Instead of winding each other up , the two most important nuclear powers are finding ways to talk about each other in less belligerent ways .
Getting to zero , or getting to the point of eliminating nuclear weapons , has been around as an idea almost as long as the weapons themselves have been .
It has bipartisan support in America , with backers including George Shultz , Henry Kissinger , William Perry and Sam Nunn .
Recently , however , the zero option has received fresh impetus .
One of Mr Obama 's first acts was to end development work on a "" reliable replacement warhead "" which critics said was a cover for designing new weapons .
Reaffirming Britain 's decision to replace Trident
, Gordon Brown said Britain would reduce the number of missile tubes on each submarine from 16 to 12 .
Nothing new there , but he added an intriguing rider .
He said that if it was possible to reduce the number of UK warheads further , "" consistent with the progress of multilateral discussions "" , Britain would be ready to do so .
These are straws in the wind .
It is not known what progress Mr Obama and Mr Medvedev made on the numbers of warheads that would be negotiated in a replacement for the Start treaty , which expires at the end of the year .
Under a different treaty which governs warheads that are "" operationally deployed "" , Russia has an arsenal of 2,700 warheads which would be reduced to between 1,700 and 2,200 by 2012 .
The US has already met that requirement , but both countries are still thought to hold thousands of additional warheads which are not deployed .
The scope for deep cuts in the nuclear arsenal is huge .
Other measures could lower the temperature further .
One legacy of the cold war is the forward deployment of between 200 and 350 US nuclear bombs in Germany , Italy , the Netherlands , Belgium and Turkey .
Nato 's nuclear umbrella was designed as a deterrent against Soviet conventional invasion .
But the boot is now on the other foot .
Russia 's conventional forces have been so weakened in relation to Nato 's that they will be more resistant to the zero option than the US will be .
Getting rid of an obsolete stockpile of freefall bombs in Nato countries would be an important first step .
It would also put Nato in a stronger position to demand stronger non - proliferation mechanisms .
Nato has other problems , like how to defeat a resurgent Taliban in Afghanistan .
The question of burden - sharing between Europe and America will be of greater and more immediate consequence in Afghanistan - now that American troops will be double the size of the force from other Nato members - than it will be on the issue of nuclear stockpiles .
Nato could use Russia 's help in the transit of non - lethal military supplies , as convoys through Pakistan are coming under attack .
But the bigger picture of nuclear disarmament and non - proliferation does affect the smaller one .
Together it creates a world where security is shared .
This is a vision worth fighting for ."
2009-04-09,"The James Bond - like assassination of a prominent Chechen exile in Dubai has refocused attention on the oppressive regime of Ramzan Kadyrov , the Kremlin - backed president of Chechnya in Russia 's unruly Caucasus region .
It has also reinforced doubts about the ability of Dmitry Medvedev , Russia 's president , to fulfil his pledge to uphold the rule of law and strengthen the judicial system after what he has called the "" legal nihilism "" of the Putin years .
Sulim Yamadayev , who had challenged Kadyrov 's control of Chechnya 's security forces , was shot dead on 28 March by a man with a golden gun wearing black gloves , police said .
The Russian - made Makarov pistol was later found discarded nearby .
After two men , a Tajik and Iranian , were arrested and four other suspects fled to Russia , Dubai police chief Lt Gen Dhahi Khalfan Tamim accused Kadyrov 's close associate and first cousin , Adam Delimkhanov , of masterminding the hit .
Delimkhanov , a former Chechen deputy prime minister who is now a member of Russian prime minister Vladimir Putin 's United Russia parliamentary faction , denies involvement . ""
The Dubai police chief 's statements ... aim to destabilise Chechen society .
The police have failed to hold a professional investigation , "" he said .
Delimkhanov said he was ready to co - operate with police inquiries but would defend himself against slander .
Kadyrov was less circumspect , suggesting Yamadayev deserved to die .
"" I must say that Adam Delimkhanov is my close associate , a friend , a brother , or even my right hand .
I take any statements concerning him personally , "" Kadyrov said .
Kadyrov claimed that Yamadayev had tried to assassinate him , at one point by poisoning a lake , and was involved in the 2004 assassination of his father , Akhmad Kadyrov , then Chechnya 's president .
"" We did all we could to bring Sulim Yamadayev , who was involved in a series of killings , kidnappings and other severe crimes , to trial in Russia , "" he said .
By some counts , Yamadayev was the fifth Chechen living abroad to be killed in the past six months .
In January , another former Kadyrov associate , Umar Israilov , was gunned down in Vienna .
He had accused Kadyrov and Delimkhanov of torturing him and beating him with a shovel .
Others have died closer to home .
In September , Ruslan Yamadayev , Sulim Yamadayev 's brother , was shot dead near the Kremlin .
Russian media have also linked Delimkhanov to the violent death of another Kadyrov foe , the former Chechen warlord and FSB commander Movladi Baisarov .
The FSB is the successor organisation to the KGB .
Analysts quoted by the Moscow Times say Kadyrov has struck a Faustian pact with the Kremlin where Putin , his close ally , still holds sway despite Medvedev 's presidency .
In return for suppressing the pro - independence rebellion that racked Chechnya in the 1990s ( and in which he played a leading role ) , Moscow has given Kadyrov a largely free rein to do as he likes , they said .
Kadyrov in turn has demanded unswerving loyalty from rivals on pain of exile or worse .
Despite comparisons between the Dubai murder and the polonium radiation killing in London in 2006 of the Kremlin critic , Alexander Litvinenko , no Russian criminal investigation has been opened into the Yamadayev slaying .
Neither the Kremlin nor the Russian defence ministry , for which Yamadayev reportedly worked , has commented publicly .
"" The Kremlin 's deal with Kadyrov was effectively unlimited powers in exchange for loyalty , "" analyst Tatyana Stanovaya told the Moscow Times .
"" Even after this murder , Kadyrov still remains within the limits of this agreement .
"" The likelihood that those who ordered the latest killings will not be made to answer for their crimes is part of a wider problem concerning judicial independence , political manipulation , and intolerance of dissent that bedevils Russian civil society , commentators say .
The prosecution of four men accused of killing Anna Politkovskaya , the renowned investigative journalist and arch - critic of Kadyrov and Putin , collapsed recently amid a widespread conviction that those responsible were not in the dock .
Nor has progress been reported in apprehending the killer of Stanislav Markelov , a noted human rights lawyer , and a Novaya Gazeta journalist , Anastasia Baburova , who were shot dead on a Moscow street in January – and this despite Medvedev taking a personal interest in the case .
Britain 's extradition request for former KGB agent Andrei Lugovoi , wanted in connection with the Litvinenko murder , meanwhile remains blocked .
Controlling homicidal Chechen warlords would be difficult for any government .
But for Russia 's leaders , the bigger issue is their perceived acceptance , even encouragement , of violence as a legitimate political tool and their collective , ongoing failure to protect the right to dissent ."
2009-04-13,"The billionaire Russian owner of London 's Evening Standard was disqualified today from standing as a candidate for mayor of Sochi , in an apparent setback for President Dmitry Medvedev and his attempt to portray Russia as a modern democracy .
A court in the Black Sea resort of Sochi declared Alexander Lebedev 's candidacy invalid .
A judge ruled that the local election committee had acted "" illegally "" when it allowed the billionaire to register as a candidate last month for the mayoral elections on 26 April .
Lebedev described the decision as "" insane "" .
He blamed the ruling on the pro - Kremlin regional administration and said that officials had grown increasingly terrified that their candidate , Anatoly Pakhomov , who is backed by Russia 's prime minister , Vladimir Putin , may lose .
Lebedev told the Guardian : "" The regional authorities were highly frustrated .
They were irritated by my candidacy .
There is no doubt that if I were to run there would be a second round of elections with two participants . ""
Sochi 's bureaucrats were extremely keen to avoid a run - off , which would be triggered if no candidate won more than 50 % of the vote , Lebedev said .
He claimed they had resorted to dirty tricks in a desperate attempt to guarantee that Pakhomov , the acting mayor , won a straight first - round victory .
Election fixing in Russia is depressingly routine .
But there had been hopes that the poll in Sochi would be a genuine contest given the high levels of media scrutiny and the fact that the resort is hosting the Winter Olympics in 2014 .
Some also saw it as a sign of a Medvedev thaw .
Today , Sochi 's local election commission took the unusual step of condemning the judge 's action .
Segei Mendeleev , a commission member , said there was nothing wrong with Lebedev 's election papers , adding that the commission had correctly approved his application along with eight other candidates .
Mendeleev said : "" This raises serious questions about the legitimacy of the election here in Sochi .
The judge 's decision is absolutely without precedent .
We do n't agree with it .
It also is n't clear how we are supposed to implement it since we 've already registered Lebedev .
As far as we are concerned he 's still a candidate . ""
As well as today 's court decision , Lebedev claimed that local officials had ripped down all of his election posters .
"" We found an agency to put up some of my photos .
But all of them were taken down in the evening .
Some of the billboards were cut and taken away by truck , "" he said .
The tycoon – who bought the Evening Standard in January – said he was undaunted and would continue his campaign .
He also said he would appeal .
But he conceded there was not enough time to get Russia 's supreme court to overturn the lower court 's ruling .
The election in Sochi had looked like being one of the most colourful in Russia 's usually monochrome voting history .
As well as Lebedev , other would - be contenders included a ballerina , a mason , and Andrei Lugovoi , the former KGB agent accused of murdering the Russian dissident Alexander Litvinenko in London .
Lugovoi , now an ultra - nationalist MP , dropped out on Kremlin advice .
The only serious challenger now left in the race is Boris Nemtsov , an opposition leader with the democratic Solidarity movement .
Nemtsov and Lebedev have complained that the administration has banned both of them from appearing on TV or in Sochi 's newspapers .
Today Lebedev 's campaign manager , Artyom Artymov , said there was no doubt local officials had arranged to have Lebedev removed from the ballot .
He said : "" The regional authorities control the courts here .
They understand that the real threat to their candidate is Lebedev , and not Nemtsov . ""
Lebedev 's short - lived election campaign began late last month .
Since then the sneaker - wearing tycoon has swapped his luxury Moscow dacha for Sochi 's dusty squares and market places , drawing curious crowds .
He had also been planning to invite the mayor of London , Boris Johnson , to visit Sochi , as part of his effort to attract voters .
This is not Lebedev 's first election campaign .
The billionaire stood for Moscow mayor in 2003 but was beaten by the incumbent pro - Putin candidate Yuri Luzhkov .
The Russian capital and Black Sea resort share similar problems , Lebedev has said : abysmal traffic jams , poor infrastructure , and a lack of cheap housing ."
2009-04-15,"President Dmitry Medvedev yesterday took the unusual step of giving an interview to the opposition newspaper Novaya Gazeta , in an apparent attempt to reach out to a group normally spurned by the Kremlin – Russia 's downtrodden liberals .
Medvedev 's decision to talk to a paper known for its harsh criticism of Russia 's leadership comes amid growing speculation about the state of his relationship with the prime minister , Vladimir Putin , who got Medvedev the job .
Russia - watchers are divided over whether Medvedev 's approach represents a genuine thaw or whether he is merely a more personable and less waspish representation of Putin , a former KGB spy .
In the interview , published today , Medvedev defended democracy and the rule of law – two things that critics of the government say are conspicuously absent from today 's Russia .
He also praised the "" colourful "" election campaign under way in the Black Sea resort of Sochi .
The billionaire Alexander Lebedev , who co - owns Novaya Gazeta and owns the London Evening Standard , was disqualified from the race on Monday .
Lebedev has accused the pro - Kremlin regional authorities of scuppering his attempt to become Sochi 's mayor .
However , Medvedev gave the impression he was unaware of Lebedev 's problem .
"" I do n't know who has been removed [ from the ballot ] , "" he said .
He added : "" But in any case there is a fully fledged political fight going on in Sochi
…
It 's good for democracy to have such a colourful campaign . ""
Medvedev also said it would be wrong to predict the outcome of the criminal case against the former oligarch Mikhail Khodorkovsky .
Khodorkovsky , already jailed for eight years , is on trial in Moscow accused of fraud , in a case most observers see as a politically inspired Kremlin vendetta .
"" There ca n't be any foregone conclusions in legal proceedings , "" Medvedev insisted .
Medvedev promised Novaya Gazeta an interview in January after meeting its editor , Dmitry Muratov .
The invitation came after two of the paper 's staff , lawyer Stanislav Markelov and freelance reporter Anastasia Baburova , were murdered .
The paper 's special correspondent Anna Politkovskaya , a withering critic of Putin and his Chechen proxies , was also shot dead in October 2006 outside her Moscow flat .
Yesterday Medvedev said he liked the fact Novaya did not "" lick up "" to anybody .
The paper is known for its investigations into corruption .
Medvedev said he was trying to tackle the problem , pointing to his recent initiative to force Kremlin officials to disclose their incomes , and those of their wives and children .
Last night Sam Greene , deputy director of the Moscow Carnegie Centre , said it would be wrong to think that Medvedev 's frequent encounters with liberal journalists and human rights activists meant that he now disagreed with Putin .
On all serious issues they were still in harmony , he said .
He added : "" They are different individuals , with different backgrounds and different personalities .
But I do n't think there are any real differences [ on policy ] .
But I think it is important for Medvedev to exert his own personality and style .
From the very beginning he has said interesting things about legal and civic culture . ""
Asked why Medvedev had agreed to fraternise with the Kremlin 's traditional enemy , Greene said : "" I think it 's a fairly smart move .
It allows Medvedev to say that this is n't a regime which is anti - democratic .
It gives arguments to the PR machine , so they can say , if we are an autocratic regime we would n't be talking to Novaya Gazeta . """
2009-04-23,"US and Russian negotiators will meet in Rome tomorrow to take the first step towards a new nuclear disarmament treaty that will involve cutting hundreds of weapons from both countries ' arsenals .
The meeting follows an agreement between Barack Obama and his Russan counterpart , Dmitry Medvedev , earlier this month to negotiate a new arms control agreement to replace the 1991 Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty ( Start ) which expires on 5 December .
Tomorrow 's talks between the two chief negotiators , Rose Gottemoeller and Anatoly Antonov , will be followed on 7 May by a meeting in Washington between the US secretary of state , Hillary Clinton , and the Russian foreign minister , Sergey Lavrov .
In July , Obama is due to fly to Moscow , by which time both sides hope the framework of a new treaty will have emerged .
The goal is to get the deal ratified by both countries ' legislatures , or at least well on the way towards ratification , by the December deadline .
At their meeting in London , the two presidents agreed that any new deal should aim to reduce deployed arsenals on either side below the 1,700 - 2,200 warheads level agreed in 2002 .
A ceiling of 1,500 deployed warheads on each side is a frequently mentioned goal .
On top of their deployed ( ready to launch ) warheads , both the US and Russia are estimated to each have about 10,000 warheads in storage .
The new deal may not significantly decrease those stockpiles , if at all , but it is expected to put limits on "" delivery systems "" – missiles and bombers .
However , the top limit for the number of such delivery systems may be one of the main sticking points in the next three months of talks .
At a conference in Washington earlier this month Gottemoeller said that replacing Start by December was "" a difficult task , but it 's a doable task "" . ""
So we need to keep our eye on the prize over the next six months
and we need to work carefully , "" she told the conference organised by the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace .
"" We will do what we have to do to get this negotiation done but as Secretary Clinton said when she went before the Congress for her own hearing , if necessary , we will look for ways to find more time for the negotiators . ""
Daryl Kimball , the executive director of the Arms Control Association in Washington , said : "" The two sides clearly want a result and it 's likely they will produce a follow - on treaty to Start .
The two countries ' positions are not that far apart on key issues . ""
But Kimball cautioned that "" there may not be breathtaking reductions in the arsenals "" .
In order to reduce the number of deployed warheads below 1,500 , the US would have to review the whole structure of its nuclear force – and that will have to await a "" nuclear posture review "" currently under way and expected to take some months .
Moscow wants the US missile defence system to be put on the table before it considers cuts far beyond the 1,500 level .
Obama has signalled that he might be willing to do this by pointing out that the missile defence system 's deployment in Europe would depend on its technical feasibility , cost - effectiveness and the evolution of a future missile threat from Iran , all of which are fiercely debated .
Both Moscow and Washington say that after the new treaty is agreed , they expect negotiations to begin on another disarmament round involving deeper cuts in strategic weapons .
The new round , expected to start next year , could also involve tactical warheads , and other nuclear powers , including Britain , France and China ."
2009-04-24,"Russia and the US today held their first negotiations on a new treaty to reduce their nuclear weapon stockpiles , in a further sign of improved relations in the post - Bush era between Moscow and Washington .
American and Russian negotiators held preliminary talks today in Rome on replacing the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty ( Start-1 ) , signed in 1991 , and which expires in December .
The US president Barack Obama and Russian president Dmitry Medvedev agreed last month to reduce their nuclear arsenals during a meeting at the G20 summit in London .
But there are doubts as to whether any new deal can be concluded by the year 's end .
In particular , Moscow wants a new treaty to see a reduction not only in nuclear warheads but also in delivery systems such as strategic bombers with cruise missiles , and nuclear missiles fired from land or sea .
It also wants to ban nuclear missiles from space .
The Kremlin is likely to link any agreement to a broader deal on other strategic concerns , such as Washington 's planned missile defence shield in central Europe .
In a speech in Prague earlier this month , Obama said he wanted to go ahead with the project .
Russia is vehemently opposed .
Moscow is also against further Nato expansion on its doorstep .
It does not want Nato to grant membership to Georgia and Ukraine , both post - Soviet states within what Russia regards as its traditional zone of influence , or for the US to build up its military presence in the region .
"" One should bear in mind that the lower we go in terms of the number of warheads , the more serious issues linked to missile defence and the strategic potential of other nuclear powers appear , "" deputy foreign minister Sergei Ryabkov told the Russian news agency Interfax .
Ryabkov , however , expressed optimism that a deal could be cut with the Obama White House .
He said there were positive "" signs that the current US administration "" was more willing to listen to Russia 's concerns than the previous one , Interfax reported .
Today one analyst said that an agreement was likely only if Moscow agreed to postpone its concerns over the US 's missile defence shield .
But while Russia had reservations about the US 's intentions , Moscow also found it deeply flattering to hold negotiations directly with Washington , he added .
"" To reach an agreement with the United States reinforces our great power status .
In reality we have lost this , "" Ruben Sergeyev , an expert in nuclear arms reduction in Moscow told the Guardian .
He added : "" Russia does n't really have any other claim that it is a great power apart from oil , gas , and science .
Our army is in rapid decline . ""
During his speech in the Czech Republic , Obama said that Washington would press ahead with the development of a missile defence system in Europe as long as there is a threat of Iran developing nuclear missiles .
But he said the US 's long - term goal was to reduce and eventually eliminate nuclear weapons , and said he would host a summit on this topic within the next year .
Rose Gottemoeller , the new US assistant secretary of state for verification and compliance , described today 's talks in Rome as "" very productive "" .
Her Russian counterpart , Anatoly Antonov , said Moscow would do its utmost to prepare a new draft treaty by the end of the year .
The next round of negotiations will take place in Washington in May."
2009-05-07,"It is one year today since Dmitry Medvedev – a 43-year - old ex - lawyer from St Petersburg and a fan of elderly rockers Deep Purple – took over as Russia 's president .
Over the past 12 months , Medvedev has given the impression that he is a liberal .
In a series of speeches , he has talked about the need to reform Russia 's legal culture and establish an independent judiciary and competitive political system .
There have even been some interesting gestures – including Medvedev 's decision last month to grant an ( admittedly dull ) interview to the high - profile opposition newspaper Novaya Gazeta .
Earlier last month , while pondering Medvevev 's anniversary , and whether we should believe anything he says , I dropped into the trial in Moscow of the former oligarch Mikhail Khodorkovsky .
Khodorkovsky , the ex - CEO of the oil company Yukos , is in court again , this time charged with embezzlement and money laundering .
Khodorkovsky , together with his business partner Platon Lebedev , was sitting inside a glass cage ; he cut a composed if etiolated figure .
Seven burly guards armed with pistols and Kalashnikovs stood inside the courtroom – presumably in the unlikely event that Khodorkovsky tried to escape .
Khodorkovksy 's parents sat in the front row .
Just before the session started , a guard came up to Khodorkovsky 's elderly father and took away his chair .
Even the most neutral observers have come to the conclusion that this latest Khodorkovsky trial is a nothing more than an act of political vindictiveness – designed to keep Khodorkovksy in prison when his current eight - year sentence is up .
The trial is trundling towards its pre - scripted conclusion , even though this latest case against him is embarrassingly feeble and contradictory .
Everyone in Moscow is aware that Khodorkovsky 's real crime is to have challenged Putin .
His mistake was to break the unwritten covenant that Russian businessmen – especially rich ones – should stay out of politics .
Which begs the question , why has Medevedev allowed the trial to go ahead ?
If , as he suggests , he believes in a judiciary free from political influence , then the Khodorkovksy trial is a blatant abuse of process .
At a time when Russia is mired in economic crisis and desperate for foreign investment , the case is clearly not helping Russia 's international image – indeed
Russia needs it like a hole in the head .
Quizzed about this last week , a Medvedev aide merely repeated what the president had said about independent courts – a less - than - convincing explanation as to why the Kremlin has decided to stage another dreary post - modern show trial .
In the run - up to today 's anniversary , Russian political scientists have been discussing several intriguing topics – the nature of the relationship between Putin and Medvedev ; the possibility that Medvedev could eventually sack his old boss ; and whether there is such a thing as a Medvedev "" thaw "" .
Optimists believe that the blog - friendly president – from a younger generation than Putin , and without the KGB heritage – is a genuine reformer .
Given time , they think , he will unravel some of the harsher aspects of Putinism and move Russia on a less authoritarian path .
The president 's progressive rhetoric , moreover , and his meetings with civil society groups , are part of an attempt to refashion the now - failing social contract of the Putin era – more money but less freedom , they add .
Sceptics , however , point to what Medvedev has actually done .
The list is not long .
The president 's most significant reform is to increase the presidential term from four to six years – facilitating Putin 's potential comeback in 2012 .
( Under this scenario Putin would do a double stint and remain in power until 2024 .
Eventually , the scenario continues , he would be carried out of office like Brezhnev . )
In August last year Medvedev signed an agreement with France 's president , Nicholas Sarkozy , to end the war in Georgia and to pull Russian troops back to their pre - conflict positions .
The troops , however , failed to leave and are now sitting on the borders of South Ossetia and Abkhazia .
On the international stage , Medvedev cuts a somewhat folorn figure – largely because his western partners know that the real arbiter of Russian power politics is still Putin .
On the home front , Medvedev is increasingly at risk of becoming a joke , since much of what he says bears no resemblance to reality .
In his Novaya Gazeta interview he praised the recent mayoral election campaign in the Black Sea resort of Sochi as a "" fully - fledged political struggle "" .
At the same time , the local pro - Kremlin administration was busy fixing the election so its candidate won , bussing in thousands of soldiers , teachers and sanatoria workers to vote early – in a piece of political "" technology "" employed throughout the Putin years .
While there are stylistic differences , there is so far no real evidence that Medvedev is different from Putin – or that Medvedevism even exists .
The best - informed analysts suggest Medvedev is simply an export version of Putin , designed to soothe the west and make sure that the Russian elite 's assets in Europe stay safe .
A Medvedev aide last week said it was too early to discuss whether he intended to stand again as president in 2012 .
At the moment , however , it appears he is merely keeping the seat warm until his old patron decides to come back .
For all his likeability , Medvedev is a fake ."
2009-05-12,"A new era of glasnost sponsored by the Russian president , Dmitry Medvedev , is casting light into some of the darkened corridors of the Kremlin .
Medvedev has recently made a string of striking public outreach gestures and this week signalled he could ease political restrictions imposed by his predecessor Vladimir Putin .
Some of the measures hark back to the late 1980s when then USSR president Mikhail Gorbachev first announced a policy of glasnost , which translates as openness or transparency .
Gorbachev 's policy of glasnost , along with his restructuring of the economy and the political system , ushered in a momentous period of change and turmoil , which ultimately led to the break - up of the Soviet Union .
Many of the post - Soviet freedoms were subsequently rolled back during Putin 's eight - year reign .
A year on from his inauguration , the substance of Medvedev 's presidency is beginning to synch with the mood music .
Earlier this week , Medvedev said the 7 % threshold for political parties to win seats in the State Duma may be lowered .
Putin had introduced the threshold in the wake of the 2004 Beslan hostage massacre arguing the need to preserve the integrity of the state .
The ruling meant that only four political parties – none of them opposed to Putin – surpassed the 7 % threshold in the parliamentary elections of December 2007 .
Like Gorbachev , Medvedev is a trained lawyer and his pledge last May to eradicate "" legal nihilism "" no longer seems utterly hollow .
Federal and regional politicians , along with and security figures embroiled in scandals over the last few months , are actually being held to account .
Under Putin 's reign , many scandals were raked over and the figures would be allowed to carry on as if nothing happened , as long as the party line was toed .
For example , when photos surfaced of a January helicopter crash in Siberia that appeared to involve government officials on an illegal hunt , wildlife campaigners assumed the Kremlin would hush up the incident .
Yet state - run media covered the story , a senior official in the region resigned and federal prosecutors investigated .
Another example last month was a decree by Medvedev dismissing Police Colonel General Vladimir Pronin , head of the Moscow directorate of the interior ministry .
Pronin had described a police major guilty of a drunken killing spree in a supermarket as "" a good professional "" .
In politics , there is a mountain to climb before Russia 's centralised and authoritarian system of "" sovereign democracy "" breaks down like its Communist forerunner .
Opposition candidates suggested that local officials had fixed the recent mayoral elections in Sochi , the venue of the 2014 Winter Olympics .
The Kremlin - backed candidate Anatoly Pakhomov won a landslide victory .
Challengers had little space to campaign ; local television blacked out news coverage and advertising of opposition candidates .
Seven candidates were disqualified due to clerical errors , but at least liberal leader Boris Nemtsov was allowed on the ballot .
Opposition figures could n't get on the ballot during last year 's presidential elections .
In the courts , the former head counsel of Yukos , Svetlana Bakhmina , was released on parole in April after being locked up as a young mother years earlier .
In the trial of her former boss , Mikhail Khodorkovsky , spectators were surprised when Kremlin opponent Gary Kasparov appeared and publicly blasted the prosecutors .
Khodorkovsky 's fate , however , is likely to be another stretch for the same tax evasion and fraud charges that he was charged with in 2004 .
Gorbachev allowed human rights dissident Andrei Sakharov to return to Moscow in 1986 from his forced internal exile in a move that showed the world that the regime had changed .
It would be unthinkable for Medvedev to make such a move as long as Putin remains sitting on his shoulder as the all - powerful prime minister .
There are signs though in the Kremlin that the balance of power could be tipping more to the liberal faction and away from the statists and secret service henchmen .
Charges against deputy finance minister Sergei Storchak of embezzling $ 44 m in state funds have been dropped in a case widely perceived to be politically motivated and part of a power struggle between finance minister Alexei Kudrin and Igor Sechin , deputy prime minister and chairman of oil giant Rosneft .
Kudrin , the leader of the liberals , triumphed in the battle over the country 's purse strings having argued for steep budget cuts as Russia readjusts its spending plans amid falling oil revenues , which is at odds with the security services ' desire for increased funding for defence - related industries .
Russia 's small liberal press and its NGOs are enjoying something of a revival under the new regime .
Medvedev recently gave a full press interview to liberal paper Novaya Gazeta , his first one - on - one interview to any Russian newspaper .
Another departure has been regular meetings with the leaders of Russian NGOs and human rights activists , with the full transcript of meetings and occasional critiques of Kremlin 's policies published on the president 's site .
Nobody knows how far this glasnost - lite will go .
It may just be for the timeline of the crisis or until his mentor Putin decides Medvedev 's usefulness has expired ."
2009-05-21,"All leaders love to interfere with the pursuits of discipline of history : they assume that by doing so they can define the cause of their nations ' past .
However , the more sophisticated among them have long since understood that historical battles are better left to professionals , if one were to avoid a future hush judgment .
Not so in Russia , where President Dmitry Medvedev has just signed a decree creating a commission tasked to counter attempts "" to falsify "" history to Russia 's detriment .
To those who consider only the immediate context , this might seem an innocent or even a noble move , for it comes as a response to the attempts to reinterpret the results of the second world war and to counter neofascist tendencies both in the Baltic states and Russia .
What could be fairer than defending Russia 's image as the vanquisher of fascism ?
Better still if this could be done with a whole lot of new archival documents at hand ( one of the proclaimed goals of the commission is declassification of the so far closed archives pertaining to the second world war ) .
Yet many in Russia , historians , political commentators and journalists alike , are not happy .
To begin with they do not trust the composition of the proposed 28-person body : there are only three historians on it , none of any serious stature ; the rest are high - ranking officials of Medvedev 's administration , the army and the intelligence .
Much more important , however , is the nature of the task itself .
Every historian knows that history as an academic discipline can only exist when its contents are contested , challenged and renewed –
it is a process of getting closer to the truth , but it can never be "" the truth "" itself .
The moment the informed debate stops and one version is proclaimed to be "" the truth "" , history dies , and what emerges in its place is either ideology or "" heritage "" , or both .
It is often called "" the official history "" – but this , of course , has got nothing to do with real , proper academic history .
Russia is all too familiar with the notion of "" official history "" : in the Soviet era it was the only one allowed .
After the collapse of the Soviet Union historical debate and research blossomed , but recently the government again started to take a great interest in history , prescribing textbooks and attempting to return to "" the official history "" .
In this light Medvedev 's commission looks much more sinister .
Was , for example , the Soviet army a liberator of the Baltic states or was it an army of occupation ?
Was Stalin 's collectivisation the reason for the Holodomor famine in Ukraine ?
And if Mededev 's commission does not allow one to debate this issue , then would it allow historians to debate the nature of Stalin 's policy at all ?
Would it allow them to discuss Stalin 's terror ?
And what would be the punishment meted out for those who do , despite the prohibition ?
The answer to this last question is already clear : United Russia , the parliamentary majority party , led by former president , now Prime Minister Putin , has just introduced a bill that envisages a three - year imprisonment for those who attempt to "" falsify "" history , for instance , to revisit the outcomes of the Nuremberg trial .
If such revisions are attempted by a journalist or by a public figure then the punishment is five years ' imprisonment .
And if such revisions are part of other states ' official histories , for instance those of the Baltic States or Ukraine , then Russia would impose sanctions on such states .
By early June the bill will sail through both chambers of parliament and will become law – a death knell for history .
But history is a strange discipline – for as long as it has existed it has been pronounced dead .
But it comes back with a vengeance , meting out its own sentences on those who try to silence it .
There 's no doubt that it will do so again this time ."
2009-05-21,"Russia and the European Union were today holding a summit intended to improve their battered relationship , amid mutual exasperation and irritation in Moscow at the EU 's recent attempts to lure eastern European countries away from Moscow 's orbit .
Russia 's president , Dmitry Medvedev , was hosting a two - day EU - Russia summit in the far eastern city of Khabarovsk , close to Vladivostok and Russia 's Pacific coast .
EU leaders , including the European commission president , José Manuel Barroso , arrived in the city this morning .
The summit comes at a time of growing frustration between Brussels and Moscow over a host of issues ranging from energy policy to the war in Georgia .
The EU was irritated by Russia 's gas war in January with Ukraine and Medvedev 's failure to pull Russian troops out of the breakaway Georgian republics of South Ossetia and Abkhazia .
For its part , the Kremlin is annoyed by the EU 's attempt earlier this month to improve ties with half a dozen post - Soviet countries .
A summit of 33 countries in Prague brought the EU 's 27 governments together for the first time with the leaders of Ukraine , Georgia , Moldova , Armenia , Azerbaijan and Belarus .
Russia believes the EU 's "" eastern partnership "" initiative is a challenge to its own strategic and security interests in a region it regards as its backyard .
Medvedev insists that Moscow enjoys what he calls "" privileged interests "" in states occupying the volatile buffer zone between the EU and the Russian Federation .
Today Medvedev joked with a group of students that the remote summit venue , 3,800 miles from Moscow or 5,300 miles via the epic Trans - Siberian Express , had been chosen to remind the Europeans of Russia 's vast size .
Several EU delegates moaned when Russia held last year 's summit with the EU in western Siberia , Medvedev said .
"" They complained : ' Oh , it 's a long way . '
We said : ' If you do n't like it you can fly somewhere else . '
They thought for a bit and said : ' OK , we 're ready , ' "" Medvedev said .
He added : "" They [ the Europeans ] should understand how big Russia is and should feel its greatness .
On the other hand , we also want a partnership with the EU .
It 's important for us to get together . ""
Today analysts were pessimistic that this latest EU - Russia summit would make much progress .
"" Russia and EU relations are in stalemate .
There is a serious lack of mutual understanding , a lack of willingness to understand each other , and a lack of strategic common values , "" Fyodor Lukyanov , editor - in - chief of Russia in Global Affairs , told the Guardian .
He went on : "" Relations with Obama and the US are now better .
At the same time relations with the EU are getting worse .
Since the 1990s Russian - EU relations have been governed by the assumption that Russia would go the European way without applying for membership .
This model is now exhausted .
They need a new model . ""
According to Lukyanov , the Kremlin was furious after the EU pressured Belarus this month not to recognise South Ossetia and Abkhazia . ""
The message was : choose Russia or not Russia .
It was absolutely unnecessary from the European side .
Alexander Lukashenko [ Belarus 's president ] was n't going to recognise them anyway for his own reasons , "" Lukyanov said .
Today Barroso stuck a conciliatory note .
"" Russia and the EU are interdependent .
The global financial and economic crisis stresses the need to develop the potential of our relationship , remove obstacles and co - ordinate our efforts , "" he declared , saying that "" regular and frank dialogue "" was the way to overcome "" difficult "" issues .
This afternoon Medvedev took his European colleagues on a scenic boat trip along the vast Amur river .
The Amur , which is home to the giant Kaluga sturgeon , passes remote sandy bays and a rustic embankment of willows and oaks , before winding its way to nearby northern China .
Negotiations are due to start tomorrow ."
2009-06-16,"Tens of thousands have taken to the streets of Tehran , the country 's clerics have ordered a recount in several areas , and his grip on power is looking increasingly weak .
But today Mahmoud Ahmadinejad took time out from the turmoil engulfing Iran to drop into a regional summit in Russia , taking a break from the anti - government protests following Friday 's disputed ­Iranian presidential election .
Smiling broadly , and looking remarkably untouched by the crisis back home , President Ahmadinejad met Russia 's president , Dmitry Medvedev , in the city of Yekaterinburg .
He pumped Medvedev 's hand warmly .
Medvedev was hosting a meeting of the Shanghai Co - operation Organisation ( SCO ) , which represents a loose - knit group of central Asian nations , including Kazakhstan , Uzbekistan , Tajikistan , Kyrgyzstan , as well as China and Russia .
Iran is one of several observers , together with India and Pakistan .
While Iran 's powerful guardian council announced a partial recount of Friday 's disputed vote today , the SCO group formally congratulated Ahmadinejad on his landslide win .
Their willingness to overlook apparently glaring irregularities in Friday 's poll is hardly a surprise .
None of the SCO member states can be described as proper democracies ; central Asia 's leaders , moreover , are all a bunch of super - presidents , apparently in the job for life .
Should Ahmadinejad eventually be swept from power , his decision to fly to Yekaterinburg will probably go down in history as his Paris moment – recalling Margaret Thatcher 's ill - fated decision in 1990 to leave Downing Street for a European summit while her Tory enemies , led by Michael Heseltine , plotted to remove her .
Other leaders in the wrong place at the wrong time include Mikhail Gorbachev , then Soviet president , who was on holiday in the Crimea in August 1991 when a group of KGB hardliners led an unsuccessful coup attempt .
After three days of house arrest he managed to fly back from his dacha .
Ahmadinejad was supposed to have turned up to the summit yesterday but in the end his trip was brief and little more than symbolic : a few pleasantries with Medvedev , a quick round - table in Yekaterinburg 's Hyatt hotel , and then off home .
The Iranian president scrapped a press conference scheduled for later today .
Before he went , Ahmadinejad did manage to utter a few words .
Not on the chaos enveloping Iran , but on the United States – a failing empire , as he put it .
"" America is in the grip of political and economic crisis , "" he told the SCO leaders , according to Reuters , adding : "" The United States and its allies are unable to deal with the crisis . ""
The Kremlin , meanwhile , expressed satisfaction today that Ahmadinejad had made his first foreign trip to Russia .
The two countries share a basic antipathy towards the US . ""
The Iranian elections are the internal affair of Iran , "" the deputy foreign minister , Sergei Ryabkov , explained .
"" We welcome the fact that elections took place , we welcome the new president on Russian soil and see it as symbolic that he made his first visit to Russia .
This allows hope for progress in bilateral relations .
"" Iran 's president , who helps rule the world 's fifth - largest oil producer , has made a tradition of stealing the limelight at conferences , including an SCO meeting in Shanghai in 2006 that was dominated by news about Tehran 's nuclear programme ."
2009-06-26,"Russia 's president Dmitry Medvedev spent this week in Africa , visiting four countries , Egypt , Nigeria , Angola and Namibia .
Russian official sources present the visit as purely economic , stressing that its goals are to assist Russian business and to develop mutually beneficial relations with African countries .
The president is accompanied by a 400-strong business delegation , and a number of important economic agreements have been signed , particularly in the sphere of energy resources and nuclear power .
This seems logical .
A number of big Russian companies , such as Alrosa , Rusal , Renova , Rosneft and Gazprom are either involved in Africa or are seeking deals there , yet Russia 's trade with the continent falls far behind that of China or India , let alone the US .
Russia 's own enormous energy resources are located in areas that are not easily accessible , sparsely populated and have extremely unfriendly climatic conditions – so developing them would be a much costlier business than developing the same resources in Africa .
But historically , visits of Russia 's ( Soviet ) heads of state to Africa always had a political agenda –
for example the 1961 visit by Leonid Brezhnev to Ghana and Guinea and the 1977 visit of Nikolai Podgornyj to Tanzania , Zambia and Mozambique .
Each marked a new stage of Soviet involvement in Africa .
Is Medvedev 's visit completely different ?
Not quite .
There is , indeed , a serious business element to it – much more serious , in fact , than during the African visit of Medvedev 's predecessor Vladimir Putin three years ago .
However , there is hardly any doubt that Medvedev 's visit is at least as much about policy as it is about business – and perhaps much more so .
It has to be considered in the context of Russia 's final withdrawal from its negotiations to join the WTO , and the two summits that Medvedev hosted in Yekaterinburg – that of Bric countries and of the members of the Shanghai Co - operation Organisation .
The US asked to participate as an observer , but the request was not granted .
All these moves are a sign of a new stage of Russia 's policy of disengagement with the west and of its leaving western financial and economic space .
This tendency has been developing for a few years , but now it has obviously reached a new active phase .
During his second term as president Putin often spoke of the need to transform the global economic order in order to diminish its dependence on the west .
The Yekaterinburg summits sought to achieve exactly this .
In effect , Medvedev 's visit to Africa should be seen as a move to create a bloc of countries rich in energy resources .
The existence of such a bloc , in Russia 's thinking , would increase the political weight of its participants and thus change the balance of power and influence in the world .
This may be more difficult to achieve than some Russian politicians think .
Some African leaders may still be grateful to Russia for its assistance in their liberation struggles , but they need delivery , not just deals .
Russia 's record on this is not great .
More importantly , however , the competition for the control of energy resources is exactly the field where Russia is bound to find itself in a head - on collision course not just with the west , but also with China , Russia 's prize political ally in the new global order as it is seen from Moscow .
It remains to be seen , how effective Russia 's new engagement in Africa is going to be , and what effect it will have on its bigger goals .
But for now it will certainly increase Medvedev 's political weight at the coming G8 meeting ."
2009-06-28,"A three - step process for the phased elimination of nuclear weapons will be unveiled by a powerful group of former policy makers in Washington tomorrow .
The report by the Global Zero Commission , formed last December to urge Barack Obama and Dmitry Medvedev to rid the world of nuclear weapons , is released ahead of a summit in Moscow between the two leaders next weekend .
The US - Russia summit , Obama 's first as US president , is expected to see a bilateral agreement cutting nuclear stockpiles through a pact to replace the 1991 Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty ( Start-1 ) , which expires this year .
A new treaty is seen as crucial to head off a new nuclear arms race drawing in other countries .
The US and Russia possess 95 % of the world 's strategic nuclear warheads – about 5,000 each .
Next weekend could see agreement to cut the number to 1,500 each .
Ahead of the summit , Nato and Russian foreign ministers met in Corfu in Greece yesterday for the first time in more than a year .
The meeting of the Nato - Russia Council , whose work was frozen last year in western protest at Russia 's invasion and partition of Georgia , was the first under a new American administration that has promised to "" press the reset button "" in relations with the Kremlin .
The two sides agreed to disagree over Georgia , while resuming military co - operation and seeking deals on Afghanistan and Iran .
A new nuclear disarmament treaty will be among five urgent issues discussed by Obama and Medvedev next weekend .
At least one of the others , which includes Iran , is related to the Global Zero initiative .
The three - step disarmament process will be outlined in Washington DC by the 100 Global Zero commissioners including Richard Burt , the former chief US negotiator for Start-1 and a former ambassador to Germany , and Igor Yurgens , a senior adviser to Medvedev .
The Global Zero report warns : "" The world is nearing a proliferation tipping point when nuclear weapons spread beyond the capacity of any effort to rein them in and the chances increase that they will be used by a country in conflict or by accident , or by a terrorist group .
"" Eight states have admitted they have nuclear weapons , but there are fears that if Iran presses ahead with its nuclear ambitions , it will set off a damaging chain reaction with countries such as Saudi Arabia and Egypt following suit .
Key elements of the commission 's plan include the negotiation of a US - Russia accord for bilateral deep reductions going far beyond expected commitments , the negotiation of a multilateral global zero accord for the phased reduction of all nuclear arsenals , and the establishment of a comprehensive system of safeguards on the use of nuclear energy ."
2009-06-30,"It probably seemed a good idea at the time .
But Russia 's attempt to create a joint gas venture with Nigeria is set to become one of the classic branding disasters of all time ‑ after the new company was named Nigaz .
The venture was agreed last week during a four - day trip by Russia 's president Dmitry Medvedev to Africa .
The deal between Russia 's Gazprom and Nigeria 's state oil company was supposed to show off the Kremlin 's growing interest in Africa 's energy reserves .
Instead , the venture is now likely to be remembered for all the wrong reasons ‑ as a memorable PR blunder , worse than Chevrolet 's Nova , which failed to sell in South America because it translates as "" does n't go "" in Spanish .
Alert users of Twitter first highlighted the unfortunate English connotations of Nigaz , which appears to have eluded Medevedev 's Russian - speaking delegation .
Writing on Monday , shunty 75 observed : "" Nigaz is the name for the new Gazprom Nigeria venture .
They need a new PR outfit .
NO WAY ! !
Haha ! ! ""
Other twitterers also derided the name .
An article in Brand Republic pointed out the obvious : that the name has "" rather different connotations "" for English - speakers .
It recalled other international branding mishaps including the Ford Pinto ‑ which in Brazil means small penis ‑ and the Pepsi slogan "" come alive with the Pepsi generation "" .
In Taiwan this rousing motto translated as "" Pepsi will bring your ancestors back from the dead "" .
It is unclear why nobody alerted Medevedev to the blunder .
But one possible explanation is that the offending word is still widely used in Russia , and was even famously employed by the poet Vladimir Mayokovsky in the 1920s .
The new company Nigaz plans to invest at least $ 2.5bn ( £ 1.5bn ) in oil and gas exploration and aims to build refineries , pipelines and gas power stations across Nigeria .
"" We have a chance to become major energy partners , "" Medvedev declared last week following a meeting with Nigeria 's presient Umaru Yar'Adua in the capital Abuja ."
2009-07-02,"Barack Obama has chided Vladimir Putin , the Russian prime minister , for "" cold war approaches "" to relations with the US , saying Putin had "" one foot in the old ways of doing business and one foot in the new "" , just days before the two men meet in Moscow .
In an interview with the Associated Press , Obama said the US was developing a "" very good relationship "" with Putin 's successor as president , Dmitry Medvedev , over issues such as nuclear arms reduction .
But the American president acknowledged the balance of power in Russia by saying that he would also meet Putin , because he "" still has sway "" .
"" I think that it 's important that , even as we move forward with President Medvedev , that Putin understand that the old cold war approaches to US - Russian relations is outdated – that it 's time to move forward in a different direction "" , said Obama .
"" I think Medvedev understands that .
"" I think Putin has one foot in the old ways of doing business and one foot in the new .
To the extent that we can provide him and the Russian people a clear sense that the US is not seeking an antagonistic relationship , but wants co - operation on nuclear non - proliferation , fighting terrorism , energy issues , we 'll end up having a stronger partner overall in this process . ""
In April , Obama met Medvedev and spoke of "" the beginning of new progress "" in relations , praising the Russian president as "" critical "" to that movement .
After that meeting , the two men issued a statement saying they were ready "" to move beyond cold war mentalities "" .
Obama 's latest remarks clarify that he sees Putin standing in the way of progress , particularly on issues such as weapons reduction .
His comments may in part be driven by a belief that Putin is behind Russian objections to US plans to place a missile system in eastern Europe .
However his remarks , likely to infuriate the Kremlin , come amid growing pessimism that next week 's Moscow trip will lead to a genuine "" reset "" in relations .
Putin will discuss "" tactical and strategic issues "" with Obama , the prime minister 's spokesman , Dmitry Peskov , said last night .
He added : "" Putin will want to share his vision of current Russian - US relations on the basis of his experience of intensive contacts at the highest level when he was president .
He has tremendous experience of contact with US presidents and a brilliant knowledge of the agenda . ""
Peskov told Ekho Moskvy radio : "" Of course , he will be interested to understand the new US head of state , in order to make his modest contribution to the vision of possible prospects of development . ""
Medvedev became president last year , when Putin took the job of prime minister .
While Medvedev has adopted a more liberal - seeming rhetoric , differences with his predecessor are stylistic , rather than substantive .
Few in Russia doubt that Putin is the supreme arbiter of foreign policy .
During his Moscow trip , Obama is likely to discuss Iran , Russian co - operation over transit supplies to Afghanistan and a new nuclear arms reduction agreement .
Both sides have agreed in principle to reduce their nuclear arsenals to 1,500 warheads each , after Obama and Medvedev 's meeting in April at the G8 summit in London .
In reality , there is little prospect of a swift arms reduction deal .
The Kremlin wants the US to cancel its missile defence shield in eastern Europe in return for concessions in arms reduction –
a demand Obama is unlikely to meet ."
2009-07-06,"The US and Russia have agreed to work towards cutting deployed nuclear warheads to as few as 1,500 each under an agreement signed by Barack Obama on his first trip to Russia as president .
Obama and the Russian prime minister , Dmitry Medvedev , signed a framework deal aimed at cutting warheads to a maximum of 1,675 within seven years of a nuclear arms reduction treaty coming into force .
Current treaties allow for a maximum of 2,200 warheads , though both sides are thought to have more than that deployed , or capable of launch .
According to some expert estimates of current numbers , the new commitment would mean each side scrapping almost 1,000 warheads .
The pact signed today also calls for the number of strategic delivery systems to be reduced to between 500 and 1,100 on each side , from 1,600 under current treaties .
Such systems include intercontinental ballistic missiles , submarine - launched missiles and heavy bombers .
Obama said he intended to host a summit on global nuclear security next year .
Among a flurry of other bilateral announcements today , Russia said it was prepared to let the US fly troops and weapons across its airspace to Afghanistan .
"" We must lead by example and that 's what we are doing here today , "" Obama said of the preliminary nuclear accord .
"" We resolve to reset US - Russian relations so that we can co - operate more effectively in areas of common interest . ""
Medvedev said today 's summit was a "" first step , but a very important step "" towards resetting relations .
Obama and Medvedev agreed during their last meeting in April to hold talks on a successor treaty to the 1991 Start-1 pact , which expires in December .
But attempts to reach a deal have been aggravated by disagreements over the Pentagon 's planned missile defence shield in Poland and the Czech Republic .
Yesterday , Medvedev said any new arms reduction treaty was definitively "" linked "" to America 's missile defence ambitions in central Europe .
"" We consider these issues are interconnected , "" he said .
"" It is sufficient to show restraint and show an ability to compromise .
And then we can agree on the basis of a new deal on Start . ""
Obama responded by saying that he would complete a review of the need for the missile defence shield in the next two months , and would then re - address the issue with the Russian government in search of a definitive agreement on the issue .
In an interview today with the Russian opposition newspaper Novaya Gazeta , Obama stressed that the missile defence system was not aimed at Russia but rather intended to protect the US and its allies from an Iranian nuclear missile .
He acknowledged "" Russian sensitivities "" over the shield but said he hoped Moscow would "" become a partner in the project "" .
He made clear he would not accept Moscow 's linkage between arms control and missile defence , a statement that suggests there is little prospect of a rapid breakthrough .
Tomorrow , Obama he will meet Vladimir Putin , Russia 's prime minister and the man who most people believe still runs the country .
Obama described Putin slightingly last week as having "" one foot in the past "" .
Russia 's state - controlled media have so far given Obama a less than overwhelming reception .
The Kremlin - controlled Channel One TV last night failed to mention Obama 's visit in its headlines , leading instead with a report on Medvedev 's attempts to encourage energy conservation .
The US and Russia account for more than 90 % of the world 's nuclear weapons .
They have agreed in principle to reduce their nuclear warheads to a maximum of 2,200 warheads under the Start treaty .
But until now they had not been able to agree on a reduction in the systems used to launch them ."

2009-07-06,"The framework agreement struck between Barack Obama and Dmitry Medvedev today is in line with what the two leaders set out to do when they met in London in April and puts them on course to have a new arms limitation treaty in place by December .
The cuts in arsenals they have pledged are by no means deep .
The US and Russia would reduce their deployed warheads to between 1,500 and 1,675 each .
That represents a more meaningful cut for Russia , which is estimated to have more than 2,700 , than for the US , which has 2,200 , but each country has seven years to reach those goals .
The new limits on long range delivery systems – missiles and bombers - are also not particularly challenging .
Stockpiled weapons are not covered by this new agreement nor are short - range tactical warheads .
However , the negotiators had very little time to build a framework .
A replacement had to be found for the Start treaty , which expires in December .
This deal at least goes further than the 2002 Moscow treaty agreed by George Bush and Vladimir Putin , and does not have its loopholes .
The new agreement , for example , will have means of verification built in . ""
This is what was expected rather than what was hoped for .
It is realistic , "" said Paul Ingram , the executive director of the British American Security Information Council , who predicted that the two sides would succeed in turning today 's framework deal into a final treaty .
"" The negotiations are going to be tense .
The Russians will be playing hardball but the Americans know Moscow has a strong interest in getting a treaty signed .
Both sides have too much invested in reaching an agreement .
"" Once a final treaty is signed , the next question will be how much further the US and Russia have to go .
Obama has dedicated himself to the distant goal of a world free of nuclear weapons , but that remains a theoretical target .
Getting to 1,000 warheads each will be hard enough .
To get there , the Russians will demand the cancellation or fundamental reworking of the proposed US missile defence system , which Moscow says blunts the effectiveness of the Russian nuclear deterrent .
That problem has been put to one side for now , but will become a much greater obstacle to progress as the numbers of warheads gets lower .
If the US and Russia do manage to get their deployed arsenals below 1,000 warheads , pressure will grow on the other established nuclear powers , Britain , France and China , as their arsenals , numbered in hundreds , will become more relevant .
Nicolas Sarkozy is expected to address the issue soon , and Gordon Brown will make a statement on the future of Britain 's submarine - launched Trident deterrent next week .
The wheels of nuclear disarmament seem to be turning once more ."
2009-07-06,"Barack Obama is due to arrive in Moscow today for his first trip to Russia as US president amid dwindling hopes of a breakthrough deal on nuclear weapons .
The summit 's centrepiece is supposed to be a groundbreaking pact on nuclear arms reduction , but Russia said there could be no agreement unless the US was prepared to heed its concerns on missile defence .
Obama and the Russian president , Dmitry Medvedev , agreed at their last meeting , in April , to hold talks on a successor treaty to the 1991 Start-1 pact , which expires in December .
But attempts to reach a deal appear to have come unstuck over the same problem that defeated the Bush administration : the Kremlin 's unbending hostility to the Pentagon 's planned missile defence shield in Poland and the Czech Republic .
While Obama has agreed to review the plan , he is not prepared to abandon it .
Yesterday Medvedev said any new arms reduction treaty was definitively "" linked "" to the US 's missile defence ambitions in central Europe .
"" We consider these issues are interconnected , "" he said .
"" It is sufficient to show restraint and show an ability to compromise .
And then we can agree on the basis of a new deal on Start . ""
Medevedev 's comments place Obama in an uncomfortable position on one of the biggest foreign policy trips of his presidency .
If he makes concessions he risks a political backlash at home and the charge of capitulation .
If he does n't , he may emerge from the US - Russia summit no more successful than George Bush .
Russian officials revealed that they had not been able to reach agreement on a "" framework document "" setting out a blueprint for nuclear talks – an ominous sign .
Obama , however , made clear his determination to improve relations .
"" I believe that Americans and Russians have many common interests , interests that our governments have not pursued as actively as we could have , "" he told the Russian newspaper Novaya Gazeta .
On Tuesday he will meet Vladimir Putin , Russia 's prime minister and the man most people believe still runs the country .
Obama described Putin slightingly last week as having "" one foot in the past "" .
In his interview , Obama acknowledged "" Russian sensitivities "" over the shield , but said it was needed to protect the US and Europe from a nuclear - armed Iranian missile .
He made clear he would not accept Moscow 's linkage between arms control and missile defence , a statement that suggests there is little prospect of a rapid breakthrough .
Analysts said there were profound , irreconcilable differences between both sides , not just over the shield but also on technical issues including counting , verification and delivery systems .
"" It requires a miracle to resolve these differences , "" said Sergey Rogov , director of the US and Canadian Institute in Moscow .
The US and Russia account for more than 90 % of the world 's nuclear weapons .
They have agreed in principle to reduce their nuclear warheads below the 2,000 agreed in the Start treaty to 1,500 - 1,700 each .
But they have not been able to agree on a reduction in delivery systems , which include intercontinental ballistic missiles , submarines missiles and heavy bombers .
According to Rogov , Russia wants to reduce the number of launchers to 600 .
The US is insisting on around 1,000 .
Additionally , Moscow is against the US having what it calls a "" return potential "" , which would allow nuclear weapons scrapped by the US to be redeployed in the event of a nuclear crisis .
"" I 'm not sure Obama understands it , "" Rogov said .
Writing last week in Novaya Gazeta , the Moscow defence analyst Pavel Felgenhaur predicted the summit would be a failure .
He said the Russian government , emboldened by the recent oil price rise , expected the US to make "" one - sided "" concessions while making none itself .
During his two - and - a - half day trip to Moscow , Obama is expected to seek Russia 's co - operation on Iran , and support for a stronger sanctions regime against North Korea .
Yesterday , however , Medevev hailed Iran as a "" major partner "" ."
2009-07-08,"Forget about missile shields , nuclear cuts and the cold war .
The big question thrown up by Barack Obama 's trip to Russia is : should Dmitry Medvedev have worn jeans ?
On Monday night Medvedev hosted a dinner for Obama and his wife , Michelle , with Medvedev 's wife , Svetlana , completing the double date .
While Obama turned up in a jacket and a pair of presidential slacks , Medvedev donned a pair of blue denims and a pinstripe designer blazer .
Ever since , bloggers have been debating the semiotics of Medvedev 's trouser choice for the dinner at the president 's dacha .
Were the jeans a nod to America and a sign , perhaps , of Medvedev 's closet pro - westernism ?
Or are they merely an attempt by a 43-year - old world leader to look , well , cool ?
Medvedev is no stranger to jeans , memorably teaming them with a black bomber jacket when he was elected president last year .
yesterday , meanwhile , he was back in a suit ."
2009-07-16,"Dmitry Medvedev has rejected claims by Russian human rights groups that Chechnya 's president , Ramzan Kadyrov , was responsible for the murder of a prominent human rights activist .
Russia 's president dismissed the theory over the death of Natalia Estemirova as primitive and unacceptable .
Instead , her killing had been committed to discredit the Kremlin , he suggested .
Estemirova , 50 , was abducted from her home in Grozny on Wednesday morning .
Her body was discovered near the village of Gazi - Yurt in neighbouring Ingushetia .
She had been shot in the head and chest and dumped near the main road .
Medvedev 's remarks came amid growing international anger at Estemirova 's death .
Germany 's chancellor , Angela Merkel , urged Russia to clarify the circumstances surrounding the killing .
The US described her murder as an "" outrageous crime "" .
The EU also condemned it .
Estemirova was a leading activist in the Grozny office of Memorial , Russia 's oldest human rights organisation .
Like her friend Anna Politkovskaya , murdered in 2006 , she was a scathing opponent of Kadyrov .
Over a decade she documented killings , kidnappings and other abuses .
Today the head of Memorial , Oleg Orlov , accused Kadyrov of responsibility for Estemirova 's murder , saying the president had threatened her at a meeting in 2008 .
His aides had warned her to stop her work or face the consequences , he said .
"" We know who is responsible .
We know what position he occupies .
His job is Chechen president , "" Orlov alleged .
He added : "" Ramzan personally hated [ Natalia ] .
He insulted her and threatened her .
We do n't know whether it was Ramzan himself who ordered to kill Natalia or his close associates .
But President Medvedev seems satisfied to have a murderer as head of one of Russia 's republics . ""
Yesterday Kadyrov promised to investigate Estemirova 's death , which he blamed on forces trying to discredit Chechnya and Ingushetia .
He described her murder as a barbaric crime and a carefully planned act .
Speaking in Munich , Medvedev described her death as a "" very sad event "" and said he was convinced her killers would be properly punished .
Human rights activists also pointed the finger of blame at Vladimir Putin , Russia 's prime minister .
Ludmilla Alexeyeva , the head of the Moscow Helsinki Group , said Putin 's unstinting support for Kadyrov had created a culture of impunity in Chechnya .
Alexeyeva , a Soviet - era dissident , added : "" The number of people who fear Kadyrov is similar to Stalin in Soviet times . ""
Alexeyeva pointed out that the president 's enemies kept on being murdered .
In March a Chechen dissident , Umar Israilov , who had told the European court of human rights that Kadyrov had personally tortured him , was shot dead in the streets of Vienna .
Another Kadyrov opponent , Sulim Yamadayev , was gunned down the same month in Dubai .
Russia 's Kremlin - controlled newspapers ignored her death .
Alexeyeva , who is in her 80s , upbraided Russian journalists for not covering an event that has generated headlines across Europe and the US . ""
Stick your hand up if you are Russian , "" she demanded during a press conference on the killing .
Six or seven hands went up ."
2009-07-21,"Diplomats say Dmitry Medvedev , Russia 's neophyte president , is gradually emerging from the dark shadow cast by his predecessor and current prime minister , Vladimir Putin , and becoming his own man .
His international reputation was reinforced at this month 's Moscow summit when Barack Obama described him as a "" professional "" and promised a new start in bilateral relations . ""
President Medvedev and I are committed to leaving behind the suspicion and rivalry of the past , "" Obama said , the presidential charm machine set to rapid fire .
Medvedev 's domestic stock is rising , too .
His poll ratings soared last autumn after Russia 's war with Georgia and his condemnation of Stalin 's labour camp gulag as a "" tragic page in our country 's history "" – and have remained consistently high despite the economic downturn .
The 43-year - old 's reputation as a next - generation reform technocrat was underscored this week when he unveiled plans to open up regional and national politics to younger Russians , especially under-30s who comprise more than 25 % of the population .
Medvedev , formerly Putin 's campaign manager , had not held public office before his election last year – and would likely have remained an obscure apparatchik but for Putin 's endorsement .
But speculation , rife 12 months ago , that the new man was merely keeping the presidential podium warm pending an inevitable Putin return in 2012 , is subsiding .
Kremlin insiders now suggest Medvedev is in the process of acquiring sufficient political clout to chart an independent future .
All well and good for the boyhood fan of Deep Purple and Black Sabbath – but increased exposure brings increased expectations , and a host of problems lie between Medvedev and a second presidential gig .
One of the most pressing , enforcement of the rule of law , was highlighted last week after the slaying in Grozny of Natalia Estemirova , a courageous human rights critic of Chechnya 's warlord president , Ramzan Kadyrov .
Unlike Putin , Medvedev was quick to condemn the murder , as was the case earlier this year after Chechnya human rights lawyer Stanislav Markelov and Novaya Gazeta journalist Anastasia Baburova were gunned down in Moscow .
But he was equally quick to absolve Kadyrov of blame .
And critics say he again failed to set in train a process that might catch those who ordered and carried out these and other murders , including that of investigative journalist Anna Politkovskaya . ""
Medvedev has expressed his outrage at Natasha 's [ Natalia 's ] death but that is not enough , "" said Tanya Lokshina of Human Rights Watch in Russia , writing in the Washington Post . ""
The Russian government must launch an immediate and thorough investigation into not only Natasha 's death but the full range of human rights atrocities that have unfolded under ( Kadyrov 's ) leadership .
"" More broadly , the Estemirova killing refocused attention on Russia 's unruly northern Caucasus region .
Unstable and dangerous though Chechnya is , neighbouring Ingushetia was even worse in 2008 in terms of insurgency - related violence , and Dagestan was not far behind .
The context is the feared spread of Islamist militancy from central Asia – a potent challenge to Medvedev 's authority as with previous Russian leaders back to the time of the tsars .
US vice - president Joe Biden 's visits to Ukraine and Georgia this week provide an uncomfortable reminder for Medvedev , meanwhile , that Obama 's feelgood politics , so persuasive up close , conceal sharp edges and red lines .
The US leader wanted nuclear arms cuts and help with Afghanistan – and got both .
But he has not jettisoned the Bush administration 's commitment to Nato membership for the two former Soviet republics and is likewise pursuing planned missile defence batteries on Russia 's western borders .
He continues to urge reduced European dependency on Russian oil and gas , the Kremlin 's economic lifeblood .
"" Our efforts to reset relations with Russia will not come at the expense of other countries , "" said Tony Blinken , a Biden adviser .
Like the EU , the US viewed Medvedev 's visit to South Ossetia last week as an affront to Georgian sovereignty .
Washington rejected as old hat Russian ideas about "" spheres of influence "" , other American officials said .
And that principle applied not only to Georgia and Ukraine but also to resource - rich or strategically placed countries such as Uzbekistan , Turkmenistan and Kyrgyzstan , where the US has recently renewed its lease on an air base .
Russia still sees itself as a great power , a perception vigorously promoted by Putin .
But the toughest challenge facing Medvedev may be to tailor and trim that inflated self - image to fit a less glamorous reality .
Russian weakness , subtly exploited by Obama in Moscow , was the hidden story of the Putin years .
In the Medvedev era , developing a law - abiding , economically diversified civil society at home while pursuing less un - civil , more co - operative behaviour abroad may be the path to returning strength and a second term ."
2009-08-17,"A cargo ship that went missing in European waters in what was feared to be a pirate hijacking has been found 300 miles off the Cape Verde islands , the Russian defence minister said .
The 15 Russian crew of the Arctic Sea were alive , Anatoly Serdyukov told the Russian president , Dmitry Medvedev .
The ship , bound for Algeria with £ 1 m worth of timber from Finland , last radioed the British coastguard on 29 July .
Its last confirmed location according to tracking systems was off northern France the following day .
Maritime officials feared the disappearance was the first case of piracy in European waters in living memory .
There were other claims of a commercial dispute , or that it was being used to smuggle arms or drugs .
These claims were denied by the ship 's owners .
"" The Arctic Sea was discovered at 1 am Moscow time today 300 miles off the Cape Verde islands , "" Serdyukov told the president , according to the Interfax news agency .
"" The crew have been moved to our anti - submarine warfare ship .
They are answering questions .
The questioning aims to clarify all circumstances of the incident .
All crew members are alive and they are feeling well .
They were not under armed control . ""
Serdyukov gave no further details of what happened to the Maltese - flagged ship but said he hoped to be able to say more later today .
On Saturday , the Finnish , Swedish and Maltese authorities said they were investigating crimes of aggravated extortion and alleged hijacking in relation to the Arctic Sea .
Markku Ranta - Aho of Finland 's National Bureau of Investigation told a Finnish radio station that a "" largish "" ransom demand had been made for its return .
The 4,000-tonne vessel was meant to arrive in Béjaïa , Algeria , on 4 August .
The mystery surrounding the disappearance deepened with reports that on 24 July , the day after the ship left Finland , it was boarded by armed men who tied up the crew and stole a few items before leaving in an inflatable dinghy .
The attack was not reported immediately and only emerged 10 days later when Interpol issued an alert .
After the first reports about the Arctic Sea , Mark Dickinson , the general secretary of the seafarers ' union Nautilus International , said it was "" unbelievable "" that a vessel could "" apparently be commandeered by hijackers and sail through the world 's busiest waterway with no alarm being raised and no naval vessel going to intercept it "" ."
2009-08-27,"Russia has placed an anti - missile defence system close to its border with North Korea , in an apparent sign of growing alarm in Moscow at Pyongyang 's nuclear programme .
Russia 's chief of army staff , General Nikolai Makarov , told reporters on a trip with President Dmitry Medvedev to Mongolia the military had deployed its S-400 anti - missile division , a state - of - the - art anti - aircraft system capable of shooting down short- and medium - range ballistic missiles .
The system , stationed in Russia 's far east , would "" guarantee "" fragments from an errant North Korean missile would not fall on Russian territory , he said .
"" We are definitely concerned by the conditions under which tests are being carried out in North Korea , including nuclear devices , "" he added .
Russia shares a tiny border with North Korea in its Pacific far east , with the Russian naval port city of Vladivostok only 93 miles from North Korea .
In 2006 an off - course North Korean missile reportedly plunged into Russian waters near the port of Nakhoda .
One analyst cast doubt on the general 's comments , describing them as "" baffling "" .
Mikhail Barabanov , a Moscow - based defence analyst , said today there was no evidence that Russia had deployed its S-400 system in the far east . ""
Either the general was doing some sort of PR , or the journalists did n't understand what he was talking about , "" he said .
He conceded that the military may have transferred the radio - location system from the S-400 to the North Korean border to monitor the testing of missiles .
The Kremlin is vehemently opposed to the US 's plans to site a ballistic missile defence system in central Europe – which Washington argues would protect the US and its allies from a rogue missile fired by Iran or North Korea .
Moscow believes the system targets its nuclear arsenal .
Makarov 's remarks indicate that Russia apparently shares the US 's assessment of North Korea 's nuclear threat , after the north 's nuclear test in May and a series of launches of small- and medium - size missiles , which provoked international condemnation .
These concerns persist despite recent signs of a softer approach from the north and the release this month of two imprisoned US journalists who had inadvertently strayed across the North Korean border , after a visit to Pyongyang by the former US president Bill Clinton . ""
North Korea 's missile testing technique is pretty crude .
You ca n't exclude the possibility that a missile could fall on Russia , "" Said Aminov , editor of the Anti - aircraft Defence Digest , a Russian website , said today .
He added : "" The far east is an extremely important region for the Russian Federation from both a political and military standpoint .
"" Russia is a member of the six - party disarmament group , which also includes China , Japan , North and South Korea and the US ."
2009-09-11,"Russia 's president , Dmitry Medvedev , has admitted that his country faces appalling structural problems including a weak democracy , shrinking population , and a non - performing economy .
In a withering assessment of the country , Medvedev avoided criticising Vladimir Putin , the man in charge for most of the last decade and now prime minister , but said Russia had so far failed to fulfil its enormous potential .
The country faced vast social challenges , he said , including corruption , a feeble civil society , terrorism , alcoholism , and smoking .
Russia was also in the grip of a poverty - fuelled insurgency across its North Caucasus , he added .
"" An ineffective economy , a semi - Soviet social sphere , a weak democracy , negative demographic trends and an unstable Caucasus .
These are very big problems even for a state like Russia , "" Medevdev wrote in his official blog .
The president also conceded that Russia 's vertically controlled political system â€ “ in which all opposition parties have been squeezed out â€ “ was not ideal .
Its democracy should be "" open , flexible , and complex "" with "" competitive elections "" , he suggested .
Most commentators were left underwhelmed by Medvedev 's comments â€ “ which follow a number of recent attempts by the president to shape the debate over Russia 's future .
Most Russians continue to believe that it is Putin who runs the country .
The newspaper Vedomosti noted that Medvedev â€ “
a former St Petersburg lawyer â€ “ used the word "" but "" 18 times in his article , and the word "" of course "" nine times .
It was pointless to call for modernisation and innovation while the Putin - led Russian government was doling out billions to inefficient state - run firms , the paper noted .
Political commentators have spent the past year scanning for signs of a split between Putin and Medvedev .
The current consensus is that there is n't one .
In his article , addressed to Russia 's "" dear citizens "" , Medevev was careful not to blame Putin , his mentor .
Experts said that Medvedev did not appear to recognise that , as president , it was his task to solve Russia 's manifold problems .
"" You have to ask Medvedev some primitive questions .
What are you doing ?
You are the president .
You have all the constitutional powers , "" said Andrei Ryabov , a scholar at Moscow 's Carnegie Centre .
Ryabov said that Russian bloggers had reacted sceptically to the article â€ “ ahead of Medvedev 's once - yearly state of the nation speech next month .
"" They point out that if Medvedev was serious he would dismiss his government , "" he said .
Asked whether the president 's speech was "" hot air "" , he replied : "" Something like that . ""
Putin is due to give his own assessment of the health of the nation later today during a meeting with international journalists , including the Guardian , at his dacha just outside Moscow ."
2009-09-11,"Vladimir Putin dropped the heaviest hint so far that he aims to return to his former post as president in 2012 , a move that could see him still in the Kremlin in 2024 – aged 72 .
Speaking to a group of international scholars and journalists at his country residence , the Russian prime minister refused to quash rumours that he would return as president when Dmitry Medvedev finished his first term .
He said the process of deciding who would be president would follow the same pattern as in the run - up to the last election , when Putin effectively called all the shots and picked Medvedev as his successor .
An election took place , but the result was a foregone conclusion . ""
Was there any competition in 2007 ?
No .
Then we wo n't have this in 2012 , "" Putin said .
Smiling broadly , he added : "" We will agree because we are people of one stamp .
We will take all these things into account and then decide . ""
Putin even sought to use Britain as a defence of the Russian example of a ruling elite deciding over the head of the people who should lead the state . ""
Look at Great Britain , when a friend of mine [ Tony Blair ] retired and automatically promoted Gordon Brown to the post of prime minister .
Did the people of Great Britain participate in this ?
There was a change in leadership in the country and they just decided .
Whereas when my term expired I supported Dmitry Medvedev because I thought he was the best person to be leader , and I was right .
"" Putin 's comments to the annual session of the Valdai Club , a group of foreign and Russian experts , raise the prospect that his era , which began in 2000 , could extend for at least another decade .
Under Russia 's new constitution the next president is entitled to stay in power for two consecutive six - year terms .
Medvedev has been struggling hard to emerge from Putin 's shadow and the prime minister 's latest comments will not help his efforts to put an individual stamp on his term of office .
His power remains largely declarative and on Thursday he delivered a withering assessment of the state of his country , while avoiding any direct reference to Putin .
The country faced vast social challenges , Medvedev said , including endemic corruption , a feeble civil society , terrorism , alcoholism and smoking .
It was also in the grip of a poverty - fuelled insurgency across its North Caucasus . ""
An ineffective economy , a semi - Soviet social sphere , a weak democracy , negative demographic trends and an unstable Caucasus .
These are very big problems even for a state like Russia , "" Medvedev , who took over as president in May 2008 , wrote in his official blog .
The president also conceded that Russia 's vertically controlled political system , in which all opposition parties have been squeezed out , was not ideal .
The country 's democracy should be "" open , flexible and complex "" , he wrote .
There should also be "" competitive elections "" .
Commentators were underwhelmed by Medvedev 's attempts to shape the debate .
Most Russians believe that Putin still runs the country .
Although foreign policy is supposed to be the president 's preserve , Putin talked widely about US attempts to press the so - called reset button to establish better relations with Russia and Iran .
Putin said Obama 's intentions were good .
"" It gives me modest optimism , "" he said of their meeting in Moscow in July .
However he refused to say what Russia would give Obama , if , as expected the US announces plans to shelve the instalment of missile interceptors in Poland and a high powered radar system in the Czech Republic , as part of missile defence against Iran .
Putin met the group at his dacha in Novo - Ogaryovo , among pine and birch forests just outside Moscow .
Unlike on previous occasions , he made no attempt to appear as Russia 's strongman .
Instead he cracked jokes with journalists , saying at one point that Obama had struck him as "" cute "" .
On Iran , Putin was less hard line than the foreign minister , Sergei Lavrov , saying that while Iran had the right to develop a civil nuclear energy programme , it had to understand how explosive the attempt to get a nuclear bomb would be to the Middle East as a whole .
"" Iran should exercise responsibility and remove concern on the part of Israel and the international community as a whole , "" Putin said .
This week Russia had been embarrassed by revelations in the Israeli press that the prime minister , Binyamin Netanyahu , flew secretly to Moscow on Monday .
The visit came after unconfirmed reports that parts of the Russian S300 anti - aircraft system had been found on a ship bound for Iran .
Israel has pressed Moscow not to go ahead with the sale of the system to Iran , for fear that it could make endanger Israeli aircraft striking Iran 's nuclear installations"
2009-09-15,"President Dmitry Medvedev today invoked the memory of Martin Luther King as he announced a major reform programme to clean up corruption in Russia , force oligarchs to share their wealth , and diversify its oil - dependent economy , hinting in the process that he could run for a second term .
"" We are not used to saying ' we have a dream ' in my country ... but this is my political vision "" .
Speaking to a group of Russian experts and journalists , he said that corrupt officials ran Russia .
"" They have the power .
Corruption has a systemic nature , deep historic roots .
We should squeeze it out .
The battle is n't easy but it has to be fought .
I do n't think we can achieve tangible results in one year or two .
If I am a realist we could get good results in 15 . ""
Medvedev said he was acutely aware of the pitfalls which had ensnared previous reformers like Mikhail Gorbachev . ""
The danger is either you take a decision , there is no specific action and you are left with nothing , or you create divisions within different elites and you start a war .
So the ultimate goal should be to reach out ... to the majority of the population who want you to develop the country . ""
Medvedev , who has yet to explain how he will tackle corruption , hinted that he was prepared to run again as president , saying at one point he wanted to return to a multi - party contest in 2012 .
If he does decide to go for a second term he is likely to have company .
Last week the prime minister , Vladimir Putin , himself dropped a broad hint that he would run for president .
Today Medvedev issued a clear warning to the oligarchs who have become wealthy through the selling of natural resources .
"" A huge number of businessmen do nothing .
Their businesses do n't do anything other than sell raw materials .
We need to change the business model , the business mentality .
Of course it is easier to sell raw materials but it is a road to nowhere .
We must work with everyone , calmly and consistently to push through reform .
We can not hide and run . ""
Calls for reform have been frequently made before and to little effect .
Most commentators seeing the president 's performance were deeply sceptical about his ability to deliver .
But having stabilised the economy that threatened to come apart in the last years of the previous century , Medvedev , who is backed in his reform programme by Putin , appears to be marking the start of a new political campaign .
Ahead of his attendance at the G20 summit in Pittsburgh next week , Medvedev praised both his relationship with his US counterpart , Barack Obama , and made conciliatory remarks about the need to keep in step over Iran 's nuclear programme .
In contrast to his foreign minister , Sergei Lavrov , who last week ruled out more coercive sanctions on Iran , Medevedev said : "" Not only do we and the US have worries [ about Iran 's nuclear programme ] , so do countries in the Middle East .
Sanctions are not very effective on the whole but sometimes it is necessary to embark on sanctions and that can be the right thing . ""
The president revealed he recently spoke at length with Obama and that the level of communication with the current administration in Washington was of a different order to the one he had with George Bush .
As if to emphasise his credentials as a moderniser , the president insisted on meeting the Valdai group of Russian experts in refurbished rooms on the upper level of the luxury GUM shopping mall on Red Square , eschewing the more formal setting of his Kremlin offices opposite ."
2009-09-24,"Dmitry Medvedev emerged from a meeting with Barack Obama last night singing quite a different tune from usual about sanctions on Iran . ""
Sanctions rarely lead to productive results but in some cases are inevitable , "" the Russian president said .
To the White House that has been waiting anxiously for payback for dumping missile defence , that sounded very much like a yes .
The New York Times reported Michael McFaul , the top Russia man in the White House as declaring : "" I could n't have put it better myself . ""
Officially there is no link between the Iran sanctions question and missile defence .
Unofficially the Russians were expected to be nice in return for having their least favourite weapons project abandoned .
This is a big deal in theory .
If the Russians support further sanctions , then the Chinese will at least abstain .
Then Iran has to contemplate a serious economic threat for maintaining its nuclear ambitions .
Of course the sanctions Medvedev has in mind might fall far short of those that the White House are thinking of , and this could be a false dawn for multilateral consensus .
We will see .
If the Medvedev statement does represent an about - turn on policy , it has not yet percolated down to ministerial level .
At a meeting last night of foreign ministers from the six - nation group on Iran ( described variously as E3 + 3 or 5 + 1 depending on your arithmetic preference ) the agreed language was still very much the lowest common denominator .
In the final text , Iran was threatened with "" next steps "" if it did provide a "" serious response "" to demands it suspend uranium enrichment .
Sergey Lavrov was so nervous about the form of words , he did not want the chair of the meeting , David Miliband , to say anything after the meeting other than the agreed text .
That is not really Miliband 's style , and he was soon chatting in the corridors , but did not say much more of substance .
Iran would have to present "" concrete practical steps "" to resolve the enrichment impasse at a meeting on October 1 .
Had the Russians changed their tune inside the meeting ?
Miliband was going to reply but then thought better of it .
"" I leave the Kremlinology to you "" , he smiled ."
2009-09-24,"China today maintained its opposition to further sanctions on Iran , disrupting western attempts to present a united front at a critical meeting next week .
Barack Obama , Gordon Brown and Nicolas Sarkozy all used their speeches to the UN security council session on nuclear weapons to call for tough sanctions if Iran continues to reject compromise on its uranium enrichment programme at the 1 October meeting in Geneva .
They had been encouraged by the statement the day before by the Russian president , Dmitry Medvedev , who said that sanctions were seldom productive but sometimes "" inevitable "" .
However , China 's foreign ministry has maintained its opposition to sanctions .
"" We believe that sanctions and exerting pressure are not the way to solve problems and are not conducive for the current diplomatic efforts on the Iran nuclear issue , "" a spokeswoman , Jiang Yu , told journalists .
China has in the past sought to avoid being isolated diplomatically , particularly among the five permanent members of the security council .
Western diplomats had assumed that once they had convinced Russia to agree to sanctions China would follow , or at least abstain .
Western officials at the UN general assembly said that it was unclear how deep China 's opposition was .
Some suggested that the foreign ministry might be following the current party line , which may yet be reconsidered by the leadership before next Thursday 's meeting with Iranian officials .
The foreign ministry statement could also reflect Chinese irritation at Hillary Clinton and David Miliband , who both made public statements about the threat of sanctions after a Wednesday night meeting of foreign ministers from the permanent five states and Germany ( the six - nation group that handles nuclear negotiations with Iran ) .
That meeting agreed a joint text , threatening Iran only with further , undefined "" steps "" if it did not compromise on uranium enrichment .
Russia and China wanted all the officials there to stick to the text and not to give their own interpretations in public .
China is anxious not to disrupt future oil supplies from Iran , and the Financial Times today reported that Chinese state companies have started selling petrol to Iran this month .
Iran is dependent on such supplies at it has limited oil refining capacity , and its petrol imports are seen in western capitals as a possible target for sanctions .
At today 's security council meeting , both Brown and Sarkozy used strong language to call for action on Iran . ""
Today , I believe we have to draw a line in the sand .
Iran must not allow its actions to prevent the international community from moving forward to a more peaceful era , "" Brown said .
"" And as evidence of its breach of international agreements grows , we must now consider far tougher sanctions together . ""
Sarkozy delivered an impassioned address in which he lambasted Iran for defying the UN over its nuclear programme .
"" There comes a time when stubborn facts will compel us to take a decision if we want a world without nuclear weapons , "" the French president told the security council ."
2009-09-25,"In retrospect , the Qom file explains a lot about the events of the past week in New York .
It explains the big smile on Barack Obama 's face after his meeting with Dmitry Medvedev , and Medvedev 's admission that sometimes sanctions are inevitable .
It explains Nicolas Sarkozy 's and Gordon Brown 's passionate public speeches denouncing Iran in the Security Council on Thursday .
They knew the next morning 's news would make them look prescient .
The nature of the intelligence coup may also explain why Angela Merkel preferred to have breakfast on Friday morning with Dmitry rather than join Barack , Nicolas and Gordon on stage .
It was humiliating for Germany and the BND intelligence service to be left out in the cold , informed at the last moment along with the Russians and Chinese .
The implications of the Qom discovery are still being thrashed out .
On ArmsControlWonk.com , Andreas Persbo of the arms control group VERTIC makes an interesting point .
If the uranium hexafluoride for the Qom enrichment plant had come from the conversion plant in Isfahan , its diversion would almost certainly have been spotted by the IAEA .
So for the Qom scam to work , there would have to be a parallel conversion plant somewhere - a complete shadow fuel cycle .
All this makes the Geneva meeting on Thursday all the more of showdown .
The Russian statement makes it clear that Moscow sees it as a decisive for Iran .
There seems little doubt that if Iran continues to stonewall , there is another wave of sanctions coming , but there is a lot of argument yet to be had over what kind of sanctions .
The original idea of cutting off supplies of petrol is looking less attractive with every passing day .
It would be a smugglers charter along the northern border , just as it was in Iraq .
European officials also fear it would be used as an excuse by Tehran to cut petrol subsidies and blame the West .
Plus , as the Financial Times has reported , China has just captured a big chunk of Iranian petrol market ."
2009-10-01,"Russia has begun a fresh round in its age - old battle against alcoholism , considering a law that would raise taxes on beer by 300 % and ban its sale in the country 's ubiquitious kiosks .
The industry and trade ministry has drafted the law , following last month 's order by President Dmitry Medvedev for a range of measures to battle what he termed a "" national disaster "" .
The order followed a report by the Public Chamber , Russia 's chief oversight body , that found alcohol contributed to some 500,000 deaths each year – a figure 16 times higher than that cited by federal health officials .
The draft law targets beer , an increasingly trendy drink in Russia but one that still lags far behind vodka in popularity .
Many Russians doubt its alcoholic strength . ""
Beer , if consumed in moderation and in the right circumstances , can not lead to alcoholism , "" said Vladimir Kuznetsov , of the Russian Beer Producers ' Union .
The St Petersburg government submitted a similarly tough amendment to the federal law on alcohol this week , saying it was "" time to equate beer with an alcohol product "" .
Vodka accounted for 66 % of alcohol sales in 2008 and 50 % this year so far , according to the state statistics service .
Beer sales comprised 25 % of sales last year , up to 33 % this year .
Critics of the planned law say it will only depress small- and medium - sized businesses , a sector Medvedev has signalled as one most deserving of support .
Beer sales accounted for more than 40 % of kiosk revenue , Kuznetsov said .
He warned the anti - beer initiative could "" contribute to the increase of unemployment and social disturbance "" .
Foreign beer producers will also suffer .
Russia is the third - largest beer market in the world , after China and the US , and 80 % of beer on the market is foreign - made .
Shares in Carlsberg , the Danish brewer , dropped 3 % in a day when the beer tax was floated this week .
Among those who stand to benefit are producers of harder spirits .
State officials have recently begun to float the idea of creating a state vodka monopoly , ostensibly to crack down on bootleg liquor .
Youth are particularly vulnerable , with the starting age for drinking dropping from 16 to 13 .
The interior minister , Rashid Nurgaliyev , said recently that 15.4 % of all children between 10 and 14 said they drank regularly .
Russians support the crackdown , according to a recent poll by VTsIOM , which found that 65 % of Russians would support or probably support a government - run anti - alcohol programme ."
2009-10-01,"Intense speculation in Moscow that greenhorn president Dmitry Medvedev is positioning himself to run against his mentor and long - time patron , prime minister Vladimir Putin , in the 2012 elections seems to have little substance .
But Putin 's personal hegemony faces other formidable challenges that could more plausibly dislodge him .
His continued dominance is not inevitable .
Medvedev 's recent comments that he might seek a second term caused surprise , given the widespread assumption that Putin will return to the presidency in 2012 and that his protege is merely keeping his seat warm .
"" If I work well , if people trust me , why not run ? "" Medvedev asked .
In another interview he said : "" I am not ruling anything out . ""
But after Putin stepped in brusquely , saying he and Medvedev would "" figure out between ourselves "" who would stand , the younger man backed down . ""
I am ready to work in a different job .
I do not want to look into the future …
but I am ready to work at any post .
The president 's job is difficult , the premier 's job is also difficult .
The main thing is to be useful to the nation , "" he said last week .
Nor was his sudden bout of humility wholly surprising .
For Russian voters , Medvedev , Putin 's former St Petersburg aide and campaign manager , is seen very much as second fiddle .
Lacking a party base , he is bound by Putin 's agenda , they say .
A Levada Centre poll last month found that only 20 % of Russians believe Medvedev pursues independent policies .
Despite striking statements from Medvedev bemoaning Russia 's weak democratic institutions , decrepit economy , and widespread corruption , 81 % said he was Putin 's creature , doing Putin 's bidding .
Mikhail Kasyanov , a former prime minister , dismissed talk of a succession battle .
"" I am convinced Putin will run in 2012 for two , six - year terms .
A suitable function will be found for Medvedev .
"" Writing in the Moscow Times , analyst Vladimir Frolov said significant differences were nevertheless discernible and that mutually hostile camps were forming around the two men . ""
Despite assurances of political and personal closeness , they already have ideologically diverging teams who would hate to see their boss yield the right of way
…
Putin is already in full campaign mode .
Medvedev is busy building his own support base and projecting the image of the nation 's moderniser and agent of change . ""
The US is trying , not very subtly , to exploit such tensions as do exist .
"" I think it 's important , even as we move forward with President Medvedev , that Putin understand that the old cold war approach to US - Russian relations is outdated …
I think Medvedev understands that , "" Barack Obama said at July 's Moscow summit .
Part of Washington 's strategy to "" reset "" relations with Russia is encouraging a post - Putin generation of leaders free of cold war prejudices .
But while winning plaudits abroad , Medvedev does not seem to be benefiting much at home from Russian foreign policy "" successes "" on missile defence and nuclear arms cuts .
Inside Russia , Putin 's hand is seen in such developments .
And while Moscow feels largely vindicated by this week 's EU report on its 2008 war with Georgia , this verdict is also likely to accrue to the credit of the Georgia - baiting , ostentatiously macho Putin rather than the nerdy , technocratic Medvedev .
Yet while Medvedev currently presents no serious challenge , Putin faces looming problems that could be his undoing .
Foremost among them is Russia 's mismanaged , mostly state - controlled economy and its over - reliance on energy exports that are set to dwindle in the coming decade .
After the boom years that artificially boosted Putin 's popularity , the prime minister is in the firing line as unemployment soars and retail sales , industrial output and wages all continue to fall .
Russia 's GDP in 2009 is predicted to shrink by a startling 8 % while its cash reserves , previously swollen by oil and gas revenues , are declining .
Economists suggest any recovery will be painfully slow .
This has potential implications for the 2012 election year .
Russia also faces significant domestic security challenges , especially in the Caucasus where violence in predominantly Muslim Dagestan , Ingushetia and Chechnya is again on the rise .
On Sunday a campaign of assassinations in Dagestan reached Moscow itself , with the shooting dead of a senior official on a visit to the capital .
The unrest undermines Putin 's claims to have settled Russia 's Caucasus problems through the immensely bloody second Chechen war .
The Georgia time - bomb , meanwhile , remains un - defused .
In an interview with the Wall Street Journal this summer , Joe Biden , the US vice - president , offered a crushing verdict on Putin 's Russia .
"" They have a shrinking population base , they have a withering economy , they have a banking sector and structure that is not likely to be able to withstand the next 15 years , they 're in a situation where the world is changing before them and they 're clinging to something in the past that is not sustainable . ""
US officials subsequently spent much time trying to soothe hurt feelings in Moscow .
For Putin , Biden 's remarks reportedly amounted to an outrageous slur .
Medvedev 's reaction , on the other hand , is not recorded .
He would not dare say so –
but it 's possible
he agreed with every word ."
2009-10-09,"Opposition leaders in Russia have accused the authorities of fixing the forthcoming election for a new city council in Moscow , and claim that all democratic candidates have been kicked off the ballot .
Some 30 million Russians go to the polls on Sunday for regional elections , in the first test of President Dmitry Medvedev 's pledge to make Russia 's electoral system more "" competitive "" .
But ahead of the poll , critics say that , far from improving under Medvedev , Russia 's democracy has slid backwards .
They allege that Moscow 's veteran 73-year - old mayor , Yuri Luzhkov , has manipulated the vote in advance to ensure a landslide victory for his pro - Kremlin United Russia party .
"" You can forget about elections in this country , "" Boris Nemtsov , the leader of the opposition movement , Solidarity , said .
"" There are no elections at all . ""
Asked whether Medvedev had improved Russia 's record , he answered sardonically : "" He 's not a president .
He 's a famous Russian blogger .
"" Russia 's election commission disqualified Nemtsov and other Solidarity candidates from contesting Sunday 's city council vote , claiming that the 5,000 signatures they had each collected to stand in single - mandate districts had been "" forged "" .
"" They even told me my own signature was forged , "" Nemtsov said .
Other parties were also disqualified .
The election comes at a tricky moment for Luzhkov .
After more than 17 years in power , his relations with the Kremlin have become increasingly strained .
He has also been battered by corruption scandals , with allegations that he helped his wife , the billionaire Yelana Baturina , to become the richest woman in Russia and eastern Europe .
Baturina has been embroiled in a legal struggle against a fellow Moscow property developer , Chalva Tchigirinsky .
In documents submitted to the high court in London , Tchigirinsky claimed in May that Baturina secretly co - owned his business – a fact that enabled him to secure highly profitable contracts from Moscow 's Luzhkov - run government .
Baturina denies the allegation .
The couple faced further embarrassment when British newspapers reported that Baturina had bought London 's largest private house – a 90-room Grade II - listed mansion in Highgate – for £ 50 m .
Baturina says she is not the owner .
But opposition activists have plastered pictures of the property on the Moscow metro .
The poll is likely to see the handful of opposition deputies in the current 35-seat United Russia - dominated Duma lose their seats .
Western diplomats say there is no evidence to suggest that Medvedev 's frequent appeals – calling on Russia to transform itself into a genuine democracy and progressive society – have had any effect whatsoever .
United Russia activists defied the rain today to hand out copies of a newspaper urging Muscovites to vote for Luzhkov 's party .
The paper had a large portrait of Russia 's prime minister , Vladimir Putin , on its front page .
Intriguingly , there was no mention anywhere of Medvedev , whom few Russians believe to be the country 's real leader .
Luzhkov is suing Nemtsov after he published a dossier on his website accusing the mayor of corruption .
Nemtsov said today that he was not bothered by the writ .
He said : "" Moscow courts are under Luzhkov 's control .
He knows he will win here .
But he does n't understand we have other places to discuss these things , like in London . ""
Critics also accuse the mayor of flattening the Russian capital 's architectural heritage and replacing its historic buildings with tasteless sham replicas .
Yesterday , builders knocked down a protected 19th - century building , Deacon 's House , to make way for a block of luxury flats .
Luzhkov 's city hall had earlier promised to protect the property ."
2009-10-10,"Amid increasing fears of an Israeli strike against Iran , America will this week press Russia to support a threat of tougher sanctions against Tehran in an attempt to avert possible military action .
Secretary of State Hillary Clinton will meet Russian president Dmitry Medvedev and his foreign minister , Sergey Lavrov , on Tuesday with worries about Iran 's nuclear ambitions at the top of the agenda .
Clinton , who began a five - day European trip yesterday , is expected to push Russia to support a move for stronger sanctions in the wake of recent revelations about a secret uranium enrichment site near the Iranian city of Qom .
Washington wants Russia to back the sanctions if Iran does not agree to halt its enrichment activities .
American officials also believe that tough sanctions supported by Iran 's traditional allies , China and Russia , could go some way to mollifying Israeli hawks who have been making increasingly militant noises about Iran 's nuclear ambitions .
But there is no guarantee that Clinton 's diplomatic push will actually get Iran to suspend its uranium enrichment programme by the end of the year , as Washington has demanded .
Russia has been a hard sell in putting sanctions in place against Iran , and officials are sceptical that Moscow will fully support the latest moves .
There are fears that Iran 's agreement to let UN inspectors into the Qom site , and its reopening of talks between Iran 's chief nuclear negotiator and diplomats from the US , Russia , China , Britain , France and Germany may have persuaded the Russians thatno further steps were needed .
In the face of Iran 's apparent determination to secretly develop its nuclear facilities , Russia has recently struck a harder tone , although it has still not explicitly backed new sanctions .
Last week , in a pre - recorded television interview , Medvedev said that Russia did not want to see any more nations develop nuclear weapons .
"" The expansion of the ' nuclear club ' is very much not in our interests , "" he said .
However , he failed to address the sanctions issue directly .
One factor aiding Clinton might be Russia 's reaction to Barack Obama 's decision to abandon plans left over from the George W Bush era to base a missile defence system in eastern Europe .
The plans were intensely disliked by Moscow .
Although scrapping them brought criticism from some European nations and US conservatives , the move was welcomed in Moscow and could signal a thaw in relations and perhaps ease co - operation on thorny issues such as Iran .
Other matters for Clinton and Medvedev to discuss will include arms control and the worsening situation in Afghanistan and North Korea .
Last week , tensions over Iran rose further after former Israeli deputy defence secretary Ephraim Sneh said Israel could attack Iran by Christmas if further sanctions were not introduced .
The comments were the latest in a series of statements by Sneh that have struck an increasingly militant tone .
In mid - September , he told the Dow Jones newswire : "" If they , by weakness and by stupidity , allow the bomb , we have no choice .
We ca n't allow them to continue .
It 's urgent . ""
Now Sneh 's most recent comments have seen Iran complain last week to the United Nation 's general secretary Ban Ki Moon .
Mohammed Khazaee , Iran 's ambassador to the UN , wrote to Moon , saying that such words were "" irresponsible "" in international diplomacy .
"" There is no explanation for Israel 's continuing threats against Tehran , "" he wrote .
However , some Iranian officials have responded in kind .
At the end of last week , a senior Iranian commander in the Revolutionary Guard threatened an instant and devastating response to any Israeli attack .
Mojtaba Zolnour , the Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei 's representative in the Guard , said it would attack Israel with missiles if a US or Israeli missile landed in Iran . ""
Should a single American or Zionist missile land in our country , before the dust settles , Iranian missiles will blow up the heart of Israel , "" Zolnour told the state IRNA news agency .

We inadvertently described Ephraim Sneh as Israel 's "" deputy defence secretary "" but he ceased to be deputy minister of defence in June 2007 .
This has been corrected ."
2009-10-30,"A joke has became popular in the Czech Republic : One day , God invites Barack Obama , Dmitry Medvedev and Václav Klaus over and says : "" I invited you today because you are the three most important people in the world and I decided the world is going to end . ""
The next day , Obama gives a speech in Congress , saying : "" I 've got some good news and some bad news for you .
The good news is that God does exist .
The bad news is that the world is going to end . ""
Medvedev goes to the Duma and says : "" Well , I 've got some bad news for you .
God really exists and he is going to end the world . ""
Than Klaus goes to the Czech parliament and says : "" I 've got some good news for you .
I am one of the three most important people in the world and the Lisbon treaty will not be ratified . ""
The joke captures something of the absurdity of Klaus 's quixotic , obsessional obstruction of the Lisbon treaty – but also some of ordinary Czechs ' sneaking admiration for their renegade president .
But , since Thursday , it seems that the joke is no longer funny .
Václav Klaus is no longer important and the treaty will be ratified .
So did Klaus win his long - lasting battle against the Lisbon treaty , the one that put the Czech Republic on the front pages of European newspapers ?
Looking back at his earlier statements , it looks more like capitulation .
Václav Klaus may claim a victory – after all , the EU leaders have granted him what he asked for .
But considering how long he played this game and keeping in mind all the strong language he used over the last few months , it 's not much of a victory .
It is clear that he did n't change his mind and still does not agree with the treaty .
Although he is less and less popular in the Czech Republic , he has huge backing on this issue , with polls finding 65 % of Czechs opposed to the Lisbon treaty .
Despite this , he has succumbed to "" persuasion "" from elsewhere in the European Union .
Klaus hates the EU even more than he despises global warming activists , but under enormous pressure , even he , generally considered an arrogant , stubbon man , could n't take it .
It was last week when Guy Verhofstadt , the leader of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe , said , among others , that Europe should pretend Klaus does not exist and continue with the implementation of the treaty as though it were already ratified .
He insisted Europe should ignore Klaus – in the same way that it ignores the views of the European voters : apart from the Irish , we had no control over what happens .
And even the Irish had to be given the opportunity to over - rule themselves in a second referendum , after they came up with the wrong answer in the first one .
Fears that the Czechs might lose their commissioner emerged as Brussels 's lobbying intensified .
French newspapers commented that Klaus was seriously harming the international image of the Czech Republic .
Nicolas Sarkozy put it plainly – any further delay would have consequences for the Czechs .
But perhaps , finally , Klaus simply realised that he is not one of the three most important people in the world .
Plans on how to change the president 's powers , so that he would no longer hold an effective veto over the ratification , were quietly discussed in the corridors of the Czech parliament , especially among the Greens and Social Democrats , who are and always were pro - Lisbon .
Perhaps Klaus judged that he 'd pushed his case – and his luck – for as long as he could ; any further and he might stand to lose those constitutional powers .
The reality is that , while he may claim to have won an important battle with the European Union , he has lost the war .
He did not become a permanent European dissident ; he will not be remembered as the one who saved Europeans from the treaty , which is probably what he wanted .
For a few months only , Klaus was more than an irritant : he placed an obstacle in the road to closer European union that other European leaders were forced to reckon with .
The European elites were obliged to listen to a Czech voice .
With the ratification of the Lisbon treaty now virtually assured , it might well be the last time that can be said ."
2009-11-11,"When Russian president Dmitry Medvedev recently condemned the horrors of Joseph Stalin 's gulags it sounded like a statement of the obvious .
"" I am convinced that the memory of national tragedies is as sacred as those of victories , "" he posted on his video - blog . ""
Even now , you hear it said that the huge losses were justified by some kind of higher state aim .
No development of a country , none of its successes or ambitions can be reached at the price of human losses and grief . ""
But what is obvious to us is ground - breaking in Russia .
Medvedev spoke on 30 October , the national day of remembrance for political repression .
Stalin 's terror and the second world war both consumed the lives of millions .
But unlike the state pageantry of the 9 May VE day parade , 30 October remains a very low key affair , which passes most Russians by .
The enormous price Russians paid in "" human losses and grief "" is the great unmentionable , even if almost every family in the land lost someone to the gulags and purges .
In fact , rather than condemn the crimes of the Stalinist era , a growing number of Russians are lauding their former leader .
Perhaps this is a way of rationalising the victims ' deaths , like the Old Bolsheviks at their show trials , desperately clutching for meaning where there was none , except the cult of Stalin .
Last year Stalin came a close third in a television poll for the greatest Russian ever .
For many , he is still revered as the leader who stopped the Nazis .
The Red Army did ensure victory for the Allies , but that was because of the incredible bravery of Soviet soldiers , not their political commissars .
Victory against Hitler may well have come faster had Stalin not wiped out most of the Red Army 's officer class in the purges .
But there is little room for nuance in public discourse in today 's Russia about the horrors perpetrated under the old system .
Indeed Vladimir Putin , now Russian prime minister , spoke for many when he said in 2004 that the break - up of the Soviet Union was "" a national tragedy on an enormous scale "" .
An increasing number of Russians agree with him .
From our cosy western , liberal perspective this seems incredible .
We are amazed .
How can they think like that ?
But a better question is "" Why would n't they ?
"" We have just celebrated the anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall .
I have spent most of the past 20 years living in or reporting on the former communist countries .
I still remember the electric excitement when the first East Germans made through to the west and we all dreamed of a happy , united Europe that had finally exorcised its ghosts .
How naive we were in our optimism , believing that the newly free countries would adopt our liberal , tolerant mores and enthusiasm for taking personal responsibility for making our own way in the world .
That was the dream , but it was our comfy fantasy , not theirs .
And as we imposed it on societies with very different histories and cultures it soon became a nightmare : of ultra - liberal economic shock therapy , mass unemployment , the plundering of state resources by former communist elites turned capitalist , and endemic poverty and corruption .
The recent financial crisis has only highlighted the growing regional nostalgia for communism 's certainties , increasingly tinged with an angry patriotism .
Russians do n't pine for Stalin because they miss the dawn knock on the door , the ride to Lubyanka in a sweat - stained sedan with no door handles and a bullet in the back of the neck .
They miss guaranteed state provision of work , food , housing and holidays and a sense of national greatness , that their motherland , whatever it is called , remains a power to be reckoned with .
Tragically , many have convinced themselves that the terrible human cost of communism 's economic never - never land was a price worth paying ."
2009-11-12,"He is frequently derided as someone with no real power .
But today Dmitry Medvedev â€
”
Russia 's president â€
” came up with a novel suggestion to alter time itself â€ ” or at least to reduce his country 's number of time zones .
Russia today is divided into 11 time zones .
When residents of Kaliningrad in the Baltic territory are eating breakfast , citizens of Kamchatka , thousands of miles away on the Pacific coast , are going to bed .
During his annual state of the nation address , Medvedev said Russia needed to "" objectively assess "" whether these sprawling zones could be reduced .
Medvedev failed to say how this would work .
Experts have suggested it might make sense to have four zones rather than 11 .
The difference between Moscow and Vladivostok , 4,000 miles ( 6,430 km ) from the capital , could shrink from seven to four hours .
The proposal would allow the Kremlin to keep a tighter grip on Russia 's Far East , the scene of anti - government protests .
It would also see Russia emulate Venezuela .
In 2007 President Hugo Chavez put his South American country 's clocks back permanently by half an hour â€ ” a move apparently designed to distinguish Venezuela from his arch - enemy , the US .
Medvedev 's time zone suggestion was one of few eyecatching elements in an otherwise lacklustre speech , delivered in the Kremlin 's gilded grand palace before Russia 's ruling elite .
He urged the country to modernise the "" primitive "" Soviet - era economy with its reliance on oil and gas .
He also set out modest political reforms â€ “ scrapping rules where opposition parties must collect signatures before they can stand in regional polls .
Typically , local officials exploit the requirement to kick democratic candidates off the ballot , claiming signatures have been forged .
But there was little indication that Medvedev is prepared to liberalise Russia 's political system significantly .
The president praised the main political parties â€ “ which support the Kremlin â€ “ and said he would not allow "" democratic slogans "" to threaten Russia 's stability .
Speaking to an audience including prime minister Vladimir Putin , Medvedev said : "" Any attempts to rock the situation with democratic slogans , to destabilise the state and split society , will be stopped . ""
Police would continue to detain opposition demonstrators , he hinted .
"" Freedom means responsibility .
I hope everyone understands that . ""
His speech will do little to crush speculation that his stint in the Kremlin will be brief .
Most observers expect Putin â€ ” president from 2000 - 2008 â€ ” to get his old job back in 2012 .
Officially , Putin and Medvedev say they have n't decided who will stand .
Most Russians , however , believe it is Putin who runs the country .
David Clark , a former special adviser to Robin Cook and chair of the Russia Foundation , said there were two schools of thought about Medvedev . ""
The first is that he wants to do all the things he says he supports but that his position is n't strong enough inside the Russian elite to push them through .
The alternative cynical view is that he is part of a managed democracy construct and that he is providing a liberal safety valve as a way of legitimising Russia 's authoritarian system . ""
Asked which version he found most credible , Clark said : "" The evidence increasingly points to the second . ""
The speech was a missed opportunity , Clark said .
"" While President Medvedev talks of democratic modernisation , Russia appears to be moving in the opposite direction .
The effect of this contradiction is to provoke cynicism and raise doubts about Medvedev 's sincerity or the extent to which he is actually in charge . ""
Medvedev said little on foreign policy or Russia 's troubled relations with the west .
But he took a tough line on the worsening Islamist insurgency in the north Caucasus , promising to "" exterminate the bandits "" .
He also returned to themes set out in a much - discussed blog â€ ” the need to fight corruption and to improve Russia 's backward justice system .
Medvedev said 4,000 cases of corruption were uncovered in the first half of this year â€ ” in reality , a fraction of the real total .
His failure to come up with specific executive measures â€ ” halfway through his four - year presidency â€ ” has led opposition leaders to deride Medvedev as "" a famous Russian blogger "" .
Yesterday he read out several comments posted in response to his last blog , "" Forward Russia ! ""
He finished his speech with the same slogan ."
2009-11-12,"Any attempt to rank the world 's most powerful people is likely to be a somewhat dry affair , with serried ranks of politicians , businessmen and media magnates .
So it came as a surprise when Forbes magazine launched its first list of the most important international power brokers yesterday with a Mexican drug lord , Joaquin "" El Chapo "" Guzman , at number 41 , ahead of Dmitry Medvedev , Nicolas Sarkozy and Hugo Chávez .
The mere rumour this year that Guzman might make the list was enough to provoke outrage in Mexico , where the president , Felipe Calderon – who has not made the list – said without naming Forbes : "" Magazines are not only attacking and lying about the situation in Mexico but are also praising criminals . ""
Guzman , estimated to be worth $ 1bn and believed to be hiding out in the mountains of northern Mexico with a 30 m pesos ( £ 1.3 m ) price on his head , is considered to be more important than the chatshow queen Oprah Winfrey and the Indian steel billionaire Lakshmi Mittal .
But if he has his BlackBerry turned on in his hideout , he might not be pleased to read that he is not regarded as the most powerful Mexican .
That would be Carlos Slim Helu , in sixth place , not just the richest man in Mexico – where his company owns 90 % of both the fixed telephone lines and wireless market – but the third richest man in the world , with a personal fortune estimated at over $ 68bn ( £ 41bn ) , or roughly 2 % of his country 's GDP .
Barack Obama tops the list , which Forbes said was not just about power but exercising it .
Hu Jintao , the Chinese president , and Vladimir Putin , the Russian prime minister , are in second and third place , with Putin 's frankly terrifying - looking deputy , Igor Sechin , 39 places lower – and both men ahead of their alleged boss , President Medvedev .
In such company Gordon Brown might feel comparatively grateful to make the list at number 29 , all of two places ahead of Bill Clinton , even if well behind the media tycoon Rupert Murdoch , in seventh , Bill Gates , Silvio Berlusconi and the pope at 10 , 11 and 12 respectively , Angela Merkel at 15 ( apparently , with Hillary Clinton at 17 , one of only two powerful women in the world ) , the investment guru Warren Buffett , and North Korea 's Kim Jong - il , in 24th place .
For the sake of his remaining fingernails , it might be as well not to break it to Brown that he is not a respectable third of the way down the list but in fact halfway down .
Forbes reckoned it did n't need 100 places and that 67 would do , representing one in every 100 million people on Earth .
The only other Briton is the BBC director general , Mark Thompson , at 65 .
Chávez , the president of Venezuela , is in last place , but he probably has time to improve his ranking : Forbes noted he "" seems certain to be president for life after winning vote to eliminate term limits "" ."
2009-11-13,"Dmitry Medvedev 's second state of the nation address made headlines .
Russia 's president surprised the world by openly presenting to the public a long list of problems that his country faces , from corruption to poor healthcare and from the legal nihilism of the population to the oil and gas - based structure of the economy .
Contrary to his predecessor , Vladimir Putin , Medvedev said that Russia 's economic problems were not caused by foreign interventions and conspiracies but by Russia 's own backwardness and its inability to manage its affairs better .
A surprise to many in the west was Medvedev 's admission that the state 's excessive control over the economy was counterproductive and conducive to corruption .
None of this was new to the Russians .
Medvedev has been speaking and writing of these problems with increasing intensity , notably in his article Russia , Onward ! which appeared on his website some two months ago .
It was widely read , and Medvedev is said to have received about 16,000 comments and proposals and to have incorporated them into his address .
What keeps the Russians surprised and guessing is Medvedev 's style – the fact that his priorities , accents and cultured manner are in stark contrast to those of his benefactor , Vladimir Putin , who seemed only interested in projecting an image of strength and power .
Are these differences real , or only skin deep ?
Is Medvedev really trying to distance himself from Putin and not merely to create his own image but also to formulate his own policy ?
The latter is hardly on the cards .
Suffice to say that Medvedev 's legal reform was started under Putin , and the plan to privatise a proportion of state corporations ( so far a small one ) in order to help diminish the budget deficit comes from Putin 's government and is supported both by his first deputy prime minister Igor Shuvalov and his finance minister Alexei Kudrin .
Putin is quoted to have said recently that he and Medvedev are "" people of the one blood , of the same political views "" .
Yet Medvedev speaks a different language and appeals to a different audience .
Even his use of the internet seems to be a challenge to Putin , who , according to his own admission , has never sent an email .
And there are some nuances in substance too .
Earlier this year , for instance , Medvedev nullified Putin 's decision to pull Russia out of negotiations with the World Trade Organisation .
The opposition is pleased with Medvedev 's proposals for changes in the electoral system , and his relations with the west are imroving .
So , what 's the trick , the Russians ask .
Why does Putin allow Medvedev , who still does not have his own independent power base , the liberty to appear different ?
Rumours have been circulating in Russian political circles for a while that Medvedev would like to or should create his own political party .
This seemed an improbable proposition , but recently the Just Russia party offered Medvedev the leadership of its organisation .
Just Russia calls itself a social democratic party and is a member of the Socialist International ; it is not a party of power , but it is not a party of the opposition either .
The idea behind the proposal is that a one - party system , created by the dominance of Putin 's United Russia , is detrimental to the country and may lead to the collapse of the state .
Fair enough .
But could it be that a simple thought that a two - party system could be more stable than a one - party system occurred to somebody else before Just Russia ?
Could it be that from the beginning , the creation of such a system was the basis of the Putin - Medvedev tandem – a political project conceived by Putin 's entourage or by Putin himself ?
This would explain the logic of both Putin 's and Medvedev 's political behaviour in the past year , as well as the dynamics of the relations between the two .
Close – but different .
Working towards a shared goal of a strong Russia by slightly different means and power within the confines of the same narrow ( or slightly wider ) political elite .
Putin 's earlier attempts to create a loyal opposition out of a range of rightwing parties come to mind in this connection .
Wherever the idea comes from and whether it succeeds or not , this development certainly changes the political space in Russia .
It presents the Russians with choice , even though of style only – an opportunity they were denied in the last decade ."
2009-12-06,"Russia was coming to terms last night with its most deadly fire since Soviet times after 109 people died and more than 130 were injured in a blaze at a packed provincial nightclub .
Investigators ruled out terrorism as the cause of Friday 's fire , but president Dmitry Medvedev said the club owners would face severe punishment and ordered a national day of mourning tomorrow with flags at half - mast .
He condemned the managers , who had ignored repeated demands from authorities to change the club 's interior to comply with fire safety standards , saying "" they have neither brains , nor conscience "" .
Emergency situations minister Sergei Shoigu told Medvedev the owners had been fined twice in the past for breaking fire safety regulations .
Vladimir Putin ordered a government commission to investigate the causes of the tragedy , saying : "" It is necessary to launch a minute investigation , punish the culprits and discover the causes of this monstrous disaster . ""
The fire broke out at 11.15pm at the Lame Horse nightclub in Perm , in the Urals region some 720 miles east of Moscow .
Survivors said an indoor fireworks display went terribly wrong – setting light to the club 's rustic wooden ceiling and igniting an inferno . ""
The pyrotechnic show caused it , "" Andrei , a survivor , told the radio station Echo of Moscow .
"" There was a cascade of sparks from the floor , one - and - a - half metres high .
It looks as if a spark reached the ceiling .
The whole ceiling is decorated with twigs .
"" The ceiling burst into flames .
The wiring was up there .
The electricity went off instantly , smoke poured out , the lights went out and that was it .
Then the crush [ to escape ] began . ""
Almost 250 mostly young people had crowded into the club for its eighth anniversary party .
Video on TV news channels showed guests watching a floor show seated around small wooden tables .
As the fire broke out , many stayed put .
A host then shouted in a casual tone : "" Ladies and gentlemen , guests of the club , we are on fire .
Please leave . ""
Party - goers stood up – at first nonchalantly – then fled in panic . ""
The fire took seconds to spread , "" witness Svetlana Kuvshinova told Associated Press .
"" It was like a dry haystack .
There was only one way out .
They nearly stampeded me . ""
Another woman , who identified herself only as Olga , said : "" There was only one exit , and people starting breaking down the doors to get out .
Everything was in smoke .
I could n't see anything . ""
Many died in the crush or were quickly suffocated by thick black smoke as they tried to reach the single exit .
Relatives rushed to the scene as news of the disaster spread .
"" People were still trapped inside .
Locals were running around without coats , calling out names and ringing and ringing , "" one witness reported in her blog .
Investigators are trying to establish how a party could have turned into Russia 's worst fire tragedy in its post - communist history .
Local prosecutors arrested the club 's co - owner , Anatoly Zak , and its executive director , Svetlana Yefremova , on suspicion that they had violated fire safety precautions .
Officials were seeking four other suspects .
Tatyana Golikova , Russia 's health minister , said 90 of the 130 injured were in a severe condition , with 59 on artificial lungs .
Aircraft took 19 of the seriously injured to Moscow , with others flown to St Petersburg .
A Reuters photographer in Perm reported seeing groups of distraught relatives and loved ones of those feared dead as they trickled into a local morgue for recognition .
Others – some weeping or smoking nervously – stared blankly at the lists of the dead .
The tragedy is merely the latest to befall Russia , which has been plagued by accidents due to ageing Soviet - style infrastructure and rampant corruption .
Russian fire officials are often accused of being readier to demand bribes than enforce safety rules .
The incident is the second serious one to strike Russia on consecutive Fridays .
Nine days ago 26 people were killed and 100 injured when their express train from Moscow to St Petersburg was derailed .
Investigators claim the train was blown up and Chechen insurgents claimed responsibility .
Russia 's internet , however , has been awash with speculation that it was an accident rather than terrorism , caused by faulty rails or a mechanical malfunction .
One report yesterday suggested that investigators are accepting that a technical error could be the cause .
Despite that , the train derailment has stoked fears that Russia could face a nationwide bombing campaign .
Yesterday , however , Russian officials played down any links between the train and nightclub disasters .
"" There are no factors or signs pointing to a possible detonation of an explosive device , "" interior minister Rashid Nurgaliyev said .
Russia records up to 18,000 fire deaths a year , several times the per - capita rate in the United States and other western countries ; worldwide , nightclub fires have killed thousands of people .
Officials at the emergencies ministry called the fire the worst in the nation 's post - Soviet history .
The previous most deadly blaze killed 63 people at a nursing home in southern Russia in March 2007 ."
2009-12-15,"The Americans and Russians have set the end of this week as the goal for signing Barack Obama and Dmitry Medvedev 's new deal to limit their countries ' deployed nuclear arsenal , so it can be done while the two leaders are both in Copenhagen for the climate change summit .
The accord is already late .
The 1991 Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty ( START ) expired on December 5 , and this is supposed to be its successor , but issues of verification and telemetry have been the sticking point at the Geneva talks .
Diplomats were insisting over the weekend that these were details rather than show - stoppers .
The cuts in arsenals involved are modest - from 2200 each to a range of 1500 - 1675 .
The big question then is whether the negotiators carry on meeting after the signing , with their sights sets on a more ambitious treaty in 2012 .
Meanwhile , some news from the Washington trenches in the battle over the new US Nuclear Posture Review , expected out in February .
President Obama is looking for a radical rethink of the role of nuclear weapons in American defence doctrine .
The Pentagon is generally more cautious , though it is not monolithic .
At the very least , I was told , there will be much more unequivocal negative security assurances ( ie we will never nuke you ) offers to states without nuclear arms .
At most , there could be a declaration that the "" sole purpose "" of the US nuclear arsenal is to deter other states from using their nuclear weapons against the US .
The chances of such a "" sole purpose "" declaration are said to be about 50 - 50 .
There is said to be little or no chance there will be pledge of "" no first use "" of US weapons .
Even the chirpiest doves concede that is probably out of reach ."
2009-12-15,"The United States and Russia are close to a breakthrough on a new treaty to cut their arsenals of nuclear weapons and the missiles , submarines and bombers that would be used to launch them , according to officials and analysts .
Barack Obama and the Russian president , Dmitry Medvedev , could sign the agreement to replace the existing strategic arms reduction treaty ( Start ) – the cornerstone in US - Russian relations for almost two decades – as early as the end of the week .
The two countries , which have been engaged in negotiations in Geneva for months , have already missed a 5 December deadline , the day the existing treaty expired .
The new treaty would allow Obama to end the year with a much - needed foreign policy success , one that would contribute to improving US - Russian relations .
The Pentagon says it has 2,200 nuclear warheads , and 1,188 vehicles to launch them .
Russia is estimated to have well below 4,000 warheads .
The treaty would cut the number of warheads to between 1,500 and 1,675 each , and delivery systems to 700 - 750 , the latter a compromise between Obama 's aim of 1,100 and Medvedev 's 500 .
The agreement on delivery systems puts Russia at a disadvantage as it will have to drop to about 500 anyway in the next seven years , because its Soviet - era missiles and bombers are becoming obsolete .
But Russia has won concessions on what it regards as overly intrusive monitoring and verification systems established by the Start treaty at a time when the country was in a weak bargaining position .
Officials and analysts in both capitals say the two sides are still working 24 hours a day on trying to reach a final agreement .
They say that although it could be signed in Copenhagen on the margins of the climate summit on Friday , it is not signed and sealed yet .
If the two fail to sign the treaty in Copenhagen , Obama – who is due to fly back to Washington on Friday night – could divert to another capital , such as Helsinki , for what would be a historic signing the next day .
Daryl Kimball , one of the leading nuclear weapons specialists in the US and executive director of the Washington - based Arms Control Association , said today : "" In my expectation , it is possible for the two sides to conclude the talks and for the two presidents to sign the new treaty on the margins of the meeting [ in Copenhagen ] .
"" It could be on the 18th or could be somewhere nearby on the 19th .
The point is they are within reach of an agreement and the two presidents are in the same time zone . ""
A Russian source said the two presidents were "" almost certain "" to sign the deal in Copenhagen .
Medvedev is travelling to the Danish capital with Russia 's foreign minister , Sergei Lavrov , which the Russian media has interpreted as an indication that the treaty would probably be signed on Friday .
Russia 's foreign ministry refused to comment on the reports .
But detailed leaks of the technical aspects of the new treaty heightened speculation that the deal is close .
The treaty is to replace the 1991 Start treaty that saw the two countries slash their arsenals , which then stood at 10,000 warheads apiece . ""
As far as I know a deal is quite certain , "" said Fyodor Lukyanov , editor - in - chief of the magazine Russia in Global Affairs .
"" Formally negotiations are still continuing .
But since there are leaks on both sides it would be very strange if the leaks were wrong .
I think a deal is almost certain .
"" If the two leaders sign the treaty it would then have to go to the Senate and the Duma for ratification , which could take several months .
According to today 's Moskovsky Komsomolets newspaper , the new treaty is more "" equal to both sides "" than the previous one .
The US has made several concessions on some of the more "" absurd "" details of the old treaty , the paper reported .
The White House has reportedly agreed that its inspectors will no longer be based at the Russian factory that manufactures inter - continental Topol ballistic missiles , in the town of Votkinsk .
The last US verification team left the factory on 5 December when the terms of Start 1 expired .
Furthermore , Russia 's mobile intercontinental ballistic missile Topol complexes will be able to roam around – unlike under the previous agreement , when they were confined to bunkers .
The Russians successfully argued that this gives them the same potential as the US 's nuclear submarines in terms of mobility and quantity of warheads .
Following Russian arguments , America 's B-52 bombers – which can be nuclear - capable or non - nuclear – will in future be classified as nuclear .
Russia has in return made several significant concessions with regard to the definition of what constitutes a warhead for the purposes of counting .
First Start
The strategic arms reduction treaty opened the way for the biggest cut in nuclear arsenals in history .
Signed in 1991 and implemented in 1994 , it has defined the US - Russian nuclear relationship for almost two decades .
It ran out on 5 December this year , without the two countries having agreed a replacement .
The original treaty ran to only about 25 pages , but its consequences have been far - reaching .
It led to the US and Russia slashing the number of warheads from about 10,000 each to a target of 6,000 .
They have both since cut their numbers further , but still have between them 95 % of the world 's nuclear weapons ."
2010-01-04,"After the shots of him manfully â€ “ and shirtlessly â€ “ tugging fish from a Siberian river and sitting proudly astride a magnificent chestnut steed , the latest pictures of Vladimir Putin are something of a letdown .
Not only is the Russian prime minister riding a snowmobile rather than an awed polar bear , he is also wearing a ski jacket with what looks to be a rather snug red fleece .
His image as a solitary outdoorsman at home in the most inhospitable of environments is further undermined by a photo in which he and the Russian president , Dmitry Medvedev , enjoy an aprÃ¨s - ski cup of tea .
The two men were photographed at the Russian ski resort of Krasnaya Polyana , where Medvedev and his family have spent the new year .
In keeping with the venue , which will host the alpine skiing events at the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics , the two men indulged in a spot of skiing and snowmobiling , as well as meeting other tourists .
Their body language suggests the closeness between the two most powerful figures in Russia .
But shirt or no shirt , it 's plain which one is the alpha male .
Despite Medvedev 's claims that he lifts weights , Putin 's physique , black belt in judo and record in office make him all but unassailable ."
2010-02-01,"Negotiations over a new arms control treaty between the US and Russia resumed in Geneva today amid growing criticism of Barack Obama 's conciliatory policy towards the Kremlin from human rights groups and a newly emboldened Republican party .
Obama and Russia 's president , Dmitry Medvedev , indicated last week that a successor agreement to the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty ( Start 1 ) could be signed within weeks .
The 1972 treaty expired on 5 December , leaving Moscow and Washington without an operational arms control regime for the first time in 40 years .
A spokesman for the US mission in Geneva , Michael Parmly , said today that the delegation hoped "" the remaining negotiations can be concluded quickly , "" but declined to say when that might be .
But even if the sides manage to resolve their outstanding differences over verification and missile defence , serious doubts remain about Obama 's ability to ratify any new treaty ahead of November 's mid - term US elections .
Analysts say that if Obama fails to persuade the Senate to back a deal , the current arms control "" vacuum "" may continue .
Sixty - seven votes are needed in the Senate to ratify the treaty , and the Republican Scott Brown 's victory in the Massachusetts Senate race last week compounded Obama 's difficulties , emboldening the opposition and creating anxiety among centrist Democrats .
When the treaty comes up for consideration , Republicans will be inclined to portray Obama as making concessions on defence .
"" They do n't want President Obama to score a major policy victory that would lend heft to his credentials as a great American statesman in the run - up to the midterm elections , "" said a US official familiar with the treaty talks .
"" They are going to use this as a political football and play this in a political way rather than out of consideration for its merits . "" A year after his inauguration , critics claim Obama has failed to realise many of his major foreign policy goals , including on Iran and the Middle East , with his "" reset "" strategy towards Russia yet to produce tangible results .
One of Obama 's key aspirations was to improve relations with Moscow in return for closer co - operation on Iran and its nuclear programme and the war in Afghanistan .
So far , however , the Kremlin has made no significant concessions towards the Obama White House , either over a sanctions regime against Tehran or anything else .
Obama 's decision to dump the Bush - era missile defence shield in central Europe last summer – an issue that had enraged Vladimir Putin , Russia 's hawkish prime minister – failed to elicit any reciprocal gesture from the Russian side .
Obama 's tactical silence on human rights issues in Russia and other repressive former Soviet republics , meanwhile , has infuriated human rights defenders .
During a visit to Moscow last December , the US secretary of state , Hillary Clinton , made clear that human rights issues would now be discussed "" behind closed doors "" with the Russian government , prompting accusations that Obama had relegated values to third - tier status .
"" I do n't think keeping silent is the way to go .
At this stage , I would express disappointment with the Obama - Clinton approach , "" Allison Gill , the director of the Russia office of Human Rights Watch , said .
"" I do n't think there is any evidence that pragmatic silence has proved particularly effective , certainly in promoting human rights . ""
Russian human rights defenders concur . ""
A more definite approach from the Americans would n't hurt civil society in Russia .
You have to speak the truth , "" Lev Ponomarev , a prominent activist who has met Clinton , said .
Ponomarev complained Clinton had not offered any criticism of the situation in Russia , where journalists are routinely murdered , and said the secretary of state 's short encounter with civil society representatives had been a "" protocol "" one .
Some believe that in its eagerness to improve relations with Moscow , the Obama administration made key mistakes , in particular in its erroneously "" optimistic "" assessment of Medvedev .
During his visit to Moscow last July , Obama held long face - to - face negotiations with Medvedev while snubbing Putin , in an unsubtle attempt to boost Medvedev 's domestic prestige .
Since then , however , it has become clear that Medvedev is not the liberal reformer that some had hoped but part of Russia 's managed democracy construct , in which elections are stage - managed and dissent swiftly squashed .
Few are in any doubt that it is Putin who continues to run the country , and who remains the supreme arbiter of both domestic and foreign affairs .
"" I think the administration had the feeling that more had changed in the Russian political scene with the arrival of Medvedev than was actually the case , "" Sam Greene , deputy director of the Moscow Carnegie Centre , said .
Asked whether the Obama administration had been naive in its assessment , he said : "" I think they were very quickly disavowed of the notion [ that Medvedev was a liberal ] – during the summit itself , in fact . ""
A new Start treaty would face an uphill battle to win Senate approval , he added .
"" The reality is that in a hard - fought election , anything can become hostage with politics .
I think the state department and the administration will be wary of risking a treaty as important as this in a political season as fraught as we are likely to see towards the summer and fall . ""
He went on : "" If they do n't get a treaty soon , it may have to wait until next year to ratify . ""
James Collins , former US ambassador to Russia under Bill Clinton , said ratification entirely depended on whether it was consistent with the US military 's nuclear posture review , currently under way , and the military 's and the intelligence community 's approval of its verification mechanisms .
He said the time was ripe for the eventual treaty language to be judged on its own merits , with few available political "" cheap shots "" .
"" It has been negotiated to serve American interests .
Nobody was playing politics or games with it .
We did n't have artificial deadlines , and it was n't set against Obama 's Nobel prize , "" Collins said .
Over the last month , the Republicans have considerably stepped up their attack on Obama 's Russia strategy , directing their fire in particular at Vladislav Surkov , the Kremlin 's chief ideologue .
Surkov is synonymous with the rollback of democracy during the Putin era .
He visited Washington last week as co - chair of a new US - Russian intergovernmental civil society working group set up by Obama and Medvedev .
On 11 December , more than 60 Republican members of Congress signed a letter urging Obama to boycott the meeting until Surkov , Medvedev 's deputy chief of staff , was replaced by "" someone who has not been involved in establishing oppressive and undemocratic policies "" .
They also expressed concern over Russia 's human rights record .
In an interview with Radio Liberty , Michael McFaul , special assistant to Obama and senior director for Russian affairs at the National Security Council , played down the "" controversy "" over Surkov .
He said it was better to engage with Russia , even if there were "" disagreements "" , than to "" sit in our cubbyholes and not have any real connectivity with those that we think we are disagreeing with "" .
Some believe Obama has brought about a marked improvement in US - Russian relations – at least in tone .
"" There have been positive steps .
It is n't a shouting match any more , "" Sergei Rogov , the director of Moscow 's Insitute for US and Canada Studies , said .
Rogov acknowledged there were disagreements – over Russia 's claim , for example , it is entitled to a sphere of influence in post - Soviet countries .
He also noted that trade and investment were "" going down "" .
The key test , he said , was whether Obama could deliver a new Start treaty .
"" If we sign the treaty , there may be more progress in other areas ; if we do n't sign , we will have a repetition of the old story – a nice declaration but no practical achievements . ""
Others said Obama 's failure to reap any dividends from his rapprochement with Russia was due to a more profound conceptual weakness : his failure to define America 's role in the 21st century . ""
The problem is Obama 's foreign policy .
He is trying to solve complex problems without having a clear strategy of how to position the US in the new world , "" Fyodor Lukyanov , editor - in - chief of Russian in Global Affairs , said .
Start 1 was approved in 1992 on a 93 - 6 vote .
Despite the acrimonious climate in Washington , some analysts hold out hope the new treaty will not get bogged down in domestic electoral politics , and will be judged on its own merits . ""
The concerns about US defence go beyond the party - line divisions , "" said Ariel Cohen , a Russia and Eurasia analyst at the conservative Heritage Foundation .
"" In the past , both Republicans and Democrats were those who approved .
And in things like nuclear weapons , responsible politicians do not trifle . """
2010-02-02,"Dmitry Medvedev sent his special envoy to the western outpost of Kaliningrad ­today after thousands of Russians took to the streets in the largest rally since the fall of the Soviet Union .
The protest , staged at the weekend , saw between 10,000 and 12,000 people gather in Kaliningrad 's main square to demand the resignation of the governor and shout slogans against the ruling United Russia party .
Smaller opposition rallies were held in other towns , including Vladivostok – the scene of regular protests by car drivers over the past 18 months – as well as Moscow and St Petersburg .
Riot police violently broke up a peaceful demonstration in Triumfalnaya Square , Moscow , on Sunday , arresting 100 ­people .
Although opposition rallies have taken place throughout the Vladimir Putin era , the scale of the Kaliningrad protest appeared to have caught the Kremlin off guard .
The region – the former German city of Königsberg , which was seized by Stalin during the second world war – is separated from the rest of Russia and bordered by EU member states Poland and Lithuania .
Medvedev sent his plenipotentiary envoy , Ilya Klebanov , to Kaliningrad to investigate .
Sources suggested that the Kremlin - appointed governor , Georgy Boos , was also likely to be summoned back to Moscow for a dressing down .
Solomon Ginzburg , an opposition leader and independent deputy , said a wide coalition of residents had taken part in the rally , including communists , liberals and ultra - nationalists .
He said people were fed up with rising communal and transport charges and wanted Boos – appointed by Putin in 2005 – to resign . ""
Unlike most Russians , we can compare living conditions here with those in Poland and Lithuania , "" said Ginzburg . ""
Boos promised us the same standards as the EU .
It turned out he was lying . ""
Saturday 's rally was even bigger than the 1991 protests against an attempted putsch by KGB hardliners , he added .
United Russia was now planning a ­counter - rally , bussing in paid supporters from outside the city .
"" This wo n't convince anybody .
We do n't live in Turkmenistan but in Europe .
And it 's the 21st century , "" said Ginzburg .
Analysts said the Kremlin was unlikely to draw the conclusion from Kaliningrad that it needed to liberalise Russia 's tightly controlled political system .
Instead , the authorities , fearful of social unrest spreading to other parts of the country , were likely to snuff out other mass rallies .
"" The scale of this protest is too big not to react immediately .
It 's dangerous [ for the Kremlin ] if something similar is repeated elsewhere , "" said Nikolai Petrov , an expert on regional elites at Moscow 's Carnegie Centre .
The government 's commission in Kaliningrad would see what lessons had to be learned , he added .
Human rights groups called on the authorities today to stop blocking peaceful demonstrations .
Those arrested at Sunday 's demonstration included Oleg Orlov , the chairman of the Memorial Human Rights Centre , and Boris Nemtsov , the leader of the pro - democracy Solidarity opposition movement . ""
Russian law clearly allows for freedom of assembly , "" said Tanya Lokshina , the deputy director for Human Rights Watch in Moscow . ""
But these arrests of human rights leaders and peaceful protesters are a prime example of how blatantly the authorities violate this right . ""
The Obama administration also expressed concern about Sunday 's arrests in Moscow . ""
The detention of at least 100 protestors , including prominent human rights defenders and opposition political leaders , together with reports of mistreatment against some of the demonstrators , constitutes another blow against freedom of speech and assembly , which are universal and fundamental rights that deserve to be protected and promoted , "" the U.S. Department of State said in a statement .
A letter published in today 's New Times magazine , meanwhile , revealed widespread corruption and abuse of office by riot police in Moscow .
The letter , written by Moscow 's OMON police battalion , revealed that officers have quotas for the number of opposition demonstrators they are supposed to arrest , and have pay docked in they fail to fulfil them .
The letter also said OMON police were told by officers that foreign agencies funded anti - government demonstrations , as well as neo - Nazi marches and gay pride events ."
2010-02-23,"Earlier this month Russian president Dmitry Medvedev signed Russia 's new military doctrine .
It was long overdue : the previous doctrine appeared in 2000 , and the next one was supposed to be ready five years ago .
So , what is it that has taken so long to formulate ?
It seems opportune to discuss this on the Day of the Defender of the Motherland that the Russians celebrate on 23 February .
Formerly this holiday was called Soviet Army day .
In many ways Russia 's new military doctrine is reminiscent of the Soviet era .
Unlike the doctrine of 2000 , it clearly defines the potential enemy .
According to the authors of the document , the main danger for Russia stems from Nato – from its enlargement , from "" the movement of its infrastructure closer to the borders of the Russian Federation "" and from the desire of unnamed forces , presumably the US , to endow Nato with "" global functions carried out in violation of the norms of international law "" .
In other words , the main enemy is exactly the same as back in the Soviet days : the US and Nato .
There was nothing unexpected about other listed dangers too , "" the attempts to destabilise the situation in individual states and regions and to undermine strategic stability "" ; the deployment or build - up of foreign troops on the territories adjacent to Russia ; and the "" deployment of strategic missile defence systems "" .
This is all about keeping "" the near abroad "" – the territory of the former Soviet Union and to some extent even of the former Soviet bloc within an internationally recognised Russian sphere of interest – the desire that Russia has made the focal point of its foreign policy in the last decade .
The "" spread of international terrorism "" occupies only 10th place in the list of dangers .
Few Russian observers believe in the possibility of Russian conflict with Nato .
They were also quick to note that such obvious and much more real dangers as the possibility of nuclear weapons falling into the hands of a rogue state or a terrorist group , or a nuclear threat from North Korea or Iran , or the possibility of a conflict with China do not enter the vision of the authors of the document .
There are , however , stranger things than this about the doctrine .
On 3 February , two days before the doctrine was signed , Russia 's Institute of Contemporary Development , widely recognised as Medvedev 's thinktank ( the president is chairman of its board ) , presented to the public another document , Russia in the 21st Century : Visions for the Future .
Among other things the authors offered their vision of Russia 's future foreign policy – and it differs dramatically from that of the Russian military .
They see Russia as a "" prominent member of the WTO and the OECD "" , "" a strategic ally of the EU "" , and possibly its member , and , amazingly , a member of the "" substantially changed Nato "" .
So , which concept really reflects the vision of the Russian leadership ?
It may well be that both do .
The signs of discord among the Russian elite , and even at the very top , are growing .
Only this time it looks like the discord goes right through the mind of the president himself .
Moreover , the doctrine may well be a reflection of the discord among Russia 's military themselves .
It is common knowledge that the Russian army is undergoing a drastic reorganisation which sped up after the 2008 conflict with Georgia .
The reform pushed through by the defence minister , Anatoly Serdyukov , and his few allies , is not popular among the majority of Russia 's top brass – among other things it aims to end conscription and dramatically cut the number of military personnel .
The new doctrine does not take such innovations into consideration and does not mention the reform at all .
The reform will , obviously , continue irrespective of the doctrine , as long as the present sector of the elite is in power .
But the doctrine is a clear reflection of the views and mentality of their conservative opponents and on what might happen if they were to come to the top .
Not that this is a completely impossible prospect – there are many more of such conservatives in the country than one might think .
Medvedev 's signature on the document could be an attempt to placate them ."
2010-03-01,"Russia 's Olympic athletes flew to Vancouver with high hopes of gold medals , world records and glory for the motherland .
But today they faced a chilly reception at home when the president joined in a growing chorus of criticism after the team 's worst performance at the winter games since the break - up of the Soviet empire .
Dmitry Medvedev demanded the resignation of the "" fat cats "" who he said bore responsibility for Russia 's dismal performance , which saw them finish with just three golds .
Despite bold predictions from sports officials it would finish in the top three , the country came 11th , well behind hosts Canada , who scooped a record 14 golds , and trailing South Korea , China and even the tiny Netherlands .
The result is a personal embarrassment for Vladimir Putin , Russia 's judo - loving black - belt prime minister .
Putin is closely linked with Russia 's sporting success and was instrumental in securing the 2014 Winter Olympics for Russia , to be held in the Black Sea resort of Sochi .
President Medvedev said those who trained the Russian team before the Vancouver games should "" have the courage to step down "" as a result of Russia 's woeful medals tally .
If they refused to resign "" we will help them "" , he said bluntly .
Over the weekend Medvedev abruptly cancelled a scheduled visit to last night 's closing ceremony , apparently in disgust .
"" We must drastically change the training of our athletes … We have been living on Soviet resources for a long time .
But that is over now , "" Medvedev told the ruling United Russia Party .
He added : "" Unprecedented investments are being made in sports in Russia .
But money is not everything .
We should think about changing the training methods .
The new training system must focus on athletes rather than on fat cats . ""
Opposition politicians demanded the sacking of the sports minister , Vitaly Mutko , and Russian Olympic committee president Leonid Tyagachyev , both close allies of Putin .
The pair were antiheroes , the Moskovsky Komsomolets newspaper said , ridiculing Tyagachyev 's Panglossian prediction Russia would finish in the top three .
Other commentators pondered the reasons behind Russia 's sporting decline .
Since the 1960s the Soviet Union has performed impressively at the Winter Olympics , dominating disciplines such as ice - skating and hockey .
This year Russia 's ice hockey team lost in the quarter - finals , while in figure skating , the country came second to America .
Under communism , sport was a mass - participation activity , with talented youngsters identified early , dispatched to special sporting academies and given free coaching .
There were also regional centres of excellence among Soviet republics , with wrestlers from the Caucasus , basketball players from Lithuania and footballers and jumpers from Ukraine .
Now sport has become a pastime for Russia 's rich .
"" If you look at the statistics for Russia 's Olympic medals you will see a reduction over the past 20 years , "" Tamara Moskvina , a Russian figure skating coach and former Soviet national champion , told the Guardian ..
"" We are harvesting the results of the dissolution of the USSR . ""
Moskavina said sport collapsed in Russia during the 1990s , with many sportsmen and coaches finding employment abroad or drifting into other professions . ""
Training facilities became obsolete or simply degraded .
Other centres were left behind in newly independent Soviet republics , "" she said .
The Soviet speed skating rink , for example , ended up in Kazakhstan .
In recent years the situation had improved , Moskvina said , thanks to a large injection of funds from the Russian government .
But this was not sufficient to compensate for the exodus of top sportsmen and qualified coaches . ""
In order to prepare a top - level Olympic champion you need from 10 to 20 years , "" she said .
Another reason for Russia 's Olympic failure is that millions of roubles earmarked for preparations may have disappeared .
Sergey Stepashin , chairman of Russia 's accounts chamber , said he was conducting an urgent audit into what had happened to Olympic funds .
"" We need to carry out a thorough assessment before the Sochi games , "" he said .
Not all of the money appears to have gone where it was needed .
Today 's Moscow Times reported that Russia 's luge team had to make its own equipment because of a lack of funds .
Albert Demchenko , 38 , who came fourth in the Olympics , said there was insufficient money for his sport , adding that when his luge broke he had to repair it himself .
At the Turin games in 2006 , Russia performed respectably , finishing in the top five , with 22 medals , including eight golds .
This year , in addition to three golds it scooped five silvers and seven bronzes .
Russia 's Olympic committee was unavailable for comment .
Putin has shrugged off suggestions that Russia faces the humiliating prospect of finishing towards the bottom of the medals table when it hosts the games in four years . ""
Of course we expected more from our team , "" Putin said , while the games were nearing their close on Friday . ""
But that 's not cause to throw up our hands , wear a sackcloth and ashes or beat ourselves with chains . """
2010-03-05,"The new president of Ukraine , Viktor Yanukovych , has promised a dramatic improvement in relations with Russia during his first official visit to Moscow .
Speaking after a meeting with his counterpart , Dmitry Medvedev , Yanukovych said he would perform a sharp U - turn on the polices pursued by his predecessor , Viktor Yushchenko , whose pro - west and pro - Nato stance infuriated the Kremlin .
Welcoming him warmly , Medvedev said Yanukovych 's election victory meant that the "" brotherly ties "" between Ukraine and Russia could now be restored .
He added that the venomous stand - off between Moscow and Kiev following the 2004 Orange Revolution – a "" dark streak "" , as Medvedev put it – was now over .
Yanukovych 's trip followed a visit on Monday to Brussels .
He appears to be engaged in a delicate diplomatic balancing act between Ukraine 's giant western and eastern neighbours .
Asked why he had gone to see the EU first , Yanukovych declared simply that the Europeans had invited him earlier .
Ukraine 's new president was sworn in last week after narrowly defeating Yulia Tymoshenko , the country 's prime minister , who leaned towards Europe and the west .
Her Orange parliamentary coalition collapsed on Tuesday and Yanukovych is attempting to form his own government .
Grinning broadly , and speaking in his native Russian , Yanukovych respectfully referred to Medevdev as "" Dmitry Anatolyevich "" during a joint press conference held in the Kremlin .
At times he came across as a nervous suitor .
"" I 've only been in the job [ of president ] a few days .
I 'm still learning , "" he joked anxiously .
Yanukovych also met Vladimir Putin , Russia 's prime minister .
Putin is said to regard Yanukovych – a former convict – as a provincial thug and serial loser , following Yanukovych 's bungled attempt to fix the vote during Ukraine 's 2004 presidential election .
In 2004 Putin was captured wrinkling his face in disgust when Yanukovych offered him a sweet .
The one - day meeting yielded few concrete results .
But the outlines of a new Russia - friendly Ukraine were clear – with Yanukovych indicating he is ready to renew the lease on Russia 's Black Sea fleet , which expires in 2017 , whereas Yushchenko had pledged to evict the Russians from their base in the historic Crimean port of Sevastopol .
He gave assurances that Ukraine was not contemplating joining Nato , a step that Russia regards as unacceptable .
Asked whether Nato membership was still on the cards , Yanukovych said Ukraine would work with Nato but not join it . ""
Ukraine is a non - bloc European country , "" he said .
The two sides discussed Ukraine 's large gas bill .
Yanukovych promised during his election campaign to renegotiate a controversial gas deal signed by Putin and Tymoshenko last year .
He wants to reduce the price paid by Kiev from $ 305 to $ 205-$210 per thousand cubic metres .
It remains unclear how much the Kremlin is willing to co - operate .
Yanukovych made clear that he shares the Kremlin 's fiercely patriotic view of Soviet history , announcing that Ukrainian and Russian veterans would hold joint celebrations in May to mark the 65th anniversary of the defeat of Nazi Germany .
Medvedev said Yanukovych had come up with the idea of a special train that could bring old soldiers together .
Andrew Wilson , a senior fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations , said Yanukovych was trying to balance Ukraine 's interests with Europe and Russia .
"" Yanukovych is dealing with the new geography of the region .
The US may not have changed its politics but it has downgraded Europe in its priorities .
At the same time he wants a better personal relationship with Russia 's leaders and with Putin .
Things have been seriously bad since the incident in 2004 when Yanukovych offered Putin a sweet . ""
Under Yushchenko , relations between Moscow and Kiev grew so acrimonious that Medvedev memorably described Yushchenko as a "" political corpse "" .
He refused last year to send an ambassador to Ukraine until Yushchenko , a harsh critic of the Kremlin who sought to leave Russia 's sphere of influence , was out of office . ""
Even when our country 's ambassador was not in Kiev I would wake up thinking about Ukraine , "" Medvedev said .
"" Now we have fundamentally different possibilities ...
We will need to reanimate Russian - Ukrainian relations . ""
Oral revolution Viktor Yanukovych 's legendary gaffes have earned him comparison with the patron saint of the foot - in - mouth - prone : George Bush .
Campaigning ahead of last month 's Ukraine election , Yanukovych described the Russian playwright Anton Chekhov as a "" Ukrainian poet . "" .
He referred to Anna Akhmatova – who was a poet – as Anna Akhmetov .
He appeared to be confusing her with Rinat Akhmetov , Ukraine 's richest man and Yanukovych 's billionaire godfather .
During his first foreign trip to Brussels on Monday , Yanukovych came up with a new word for Kosovo – Montenegro .
He also muddled up North Ossetia – which is part of Russia – with South Ossetia , the Russian - backed puppet region at the centre of the 2008 Russian - Georgian war .
Supporters point out that Yanukovych – a native Russian speaker – had little formal education and has at least taken the trouble to learn Ukrainian , a language that many Ukrainians can not speak ."
2010-03-14,"Apologies if you have read this somewhere before many times , but Washington and Moscow are once again saying they are really , really close to a new START nuclear arms control treaty .
Barack Obama and Dmitry Medvedev spoke on the telephone on Saturday and agreed to give their negotiators in Geneva "" new instructions "" to conclude a draft treaty that would cut each sides deployed strategic arsenal from well over 2,000 warheads apiece to somewhere between 1,500 and 1,675 .
Launch vehicles ( missiles and bombers ) would be cut from 1600 to a range of 500 to 1,100 .
Those numbers were agreed by the two presidents in Moscow back in July .
The negotiations have since got bogged down in dense questions of telemetry encryption .
Basically , the old treaty involves lots of sharing of data from new missile tests for the sake of transparency .
But as Russia is in the midst of replacing its old cold war missiles while the US is sticking to its existing arsenal , Moscow has insisted the old rule is unfair .
The two sides seemed to have got past that in the new year , with a fudge on limited data sharing , but then in February the talks were knocked sideways by Romania 's announcement that it would host America 's new SM-3 anti - ballistic missile system .
A week later Bulgaria said it was interested in following suit .
This was a terrible piece of timing , to say the least .
US - Russian relations had been ' reset ' last September by Obama 's decision to junk the Bush missile defence scheme , which was to be based in Poland and the Czech Republic .
For all Washington 's insistence that the missiles were pointed towards a potential Iranian threat , Russia considered the sites to be in its backyard and a direct challenge to its deterrent .
Dumping the scheme may have been essential to making progress on the START follow - on treaty .
It is not clear why the US defence department thought Romania and Bulgaria would be any more palatable to the Russians than Poland and the Czech Republic , especially as the later version of the SM-3 ( the 2B to be deployed by 2020 ) will be close in potential to the Bush missiles .
It may have been the case of Washington 's left hand not knowing what the right was doing , but however it happened , it brought the START talks grinding to a halt once more .
Obama is now running out of time .
April 5 will be the first anniversary of his Prague speech in which he pledged America 's pursuit of a world without nuclear arms , and with three weeks to go , there is no real progress .
No new START treaty , no new nuclear posture review .
Obama is hosting a nuclear security summit in mid - April and the non - proliferation treaty is up for review in May.
He desperately needs some momentum ."
2010-03-18,"Hillary Clinton arrived in Moscow this morning for talks on nuclear arms reduction and the Middle East , amid signs that the Kremlin has raised fresh objections that could further delay the signing of a new US - Russia Start treaty .
The US secretary of state is meeting Russia 's foreign minister , Sergei Lavrov , and will tomorrow attend a meeting iof the peace mediators who comprise the Middle East quartet – the European Union , the United Nations , the US and Russia .
Clinton is also seeing the Russian president , Dmitry Medvedev .
For almost a year , Russian and US teams have been negotiating a historic strategic arms treaty to replace the 1991 Start agreement , which expired in early December .
Despite pronouncements from both sides that a deal is close , and could be signed as early as next month , the Russians now appear to be raising fresh objections .
This morning , Boris Gryzlov , the speaker of Russia 's pro - Kremlin parliament , said Moscow would refuse to ratify any new nuclear treaty unless there was an explicit link between nuclear arms reduction and the US 's revised missile defence plans in Europe . ""
Without it there is no chance the treaty could be ratified in the Duma , "" Gryzlov said .
The White House believes the two issues are separate .
US officials have privately expressed growing frustration with the Russians , who appear to reach agreement on key issues , only to raise fresh problems later .
There is a suspicion that Moscow is deliberately dragging out the negotiating process .
According to the New York Times , Barack Obama has telephoned Medvedev twice in the past three weeks , in a frantic effort to push the long - delayed negotiations over the finishing line .
In the first call , the US president was surprised to hear Medvedev raise several new objections , including over the US 's amended plans for a European missile defence system .
Obama believed negotiators had already settled the issue in Geneva , the paper said .
Last year , Obama announced he was shelving the Bush administration 's plans to deploy a missile system in Poland and the Czech Republic , following fierce Russian objections , and as part of a "" reset "" in relations with the Kremlin .
In January , the White House said elements of the system would be deployed in Romania .
Clinton is hoping to seal a deal in time for a high - profile international summit on nuclear non - proliferation to be held in Washington in mid - April .
Ukraine 's president , Viktor Yanuokvych . has offered Kiev as a venue for the agreement to be signed .
The White House is believed to prefer the Czech capital , Prague , where Obama set out his vision of a nuclear - free world in a major speech last year .
The Middle East quartet is meeting in Moscow tonightfor dinner .
There are formal negotiations tomorrow , to be attended by Clinton , Tony Blair , the quartet 's Middle East envoy , the EU 's new foreign policy chief , Lady Cathy Ahston , and the UN secretary - general , Ban Ki - moon , who is expected to travel to Israel and the Gaza Strip on Saturday and Sunday .
The quartet is likely to offer strong support for US - backed proximity talks between Israel and the Palestinians .
But the negotiations have been overshadowed by the unusual US - Israeli dispute over plans to build 1,600 Jewish homes in part of the occupied West Bank it annexed to Jerusalem .
Clinton has described the announcement – made while the US vice - president , Joe Biden , was in Israel last week – as insulting .
Washington hopes to win Moscow 's backing for tougher sanctions against Iran over its nuclear programme , which the west suspects is intended to produce atomic weapons .
Medvedev earlier this month promised support for "" smart "" sanctions against Tehran which are not aimed at civilians , but Moscow has long been reluctant to agree to punitive measures against a traditional ally and trading partner .
China is also opposed to sanctions ."
2010-03-24,"Barack Obama 's ambitious goal of freeing the world of nuclear weapons won a significant boost tonight when Russia indicated that it had reached agreement with the United States on a historic nuclear arms reduction treaty .
Kremlin officials said that a document to replace the 1991 Start treaty had been agreed with Washington .
A signing ceremony between Obama and Russia 's president , Dmitry Medvedev , is likely to take place early next month in the Czech capital Prague , they said .
White House officials stopped short of announcing a done deal , but confirmed the US was "" very close "" to signing a new treaty with Russia .
They suggested that the last remaining step was for the two presidents to agree a signing date .
"" We are , I think very close to having an agreement on a Start treaty , but we wo n't have one until President Obama and his counterpart , Mr Medvedev , have a chance to speak , "" said White House spokesman , Robert Gibbs .
He suggested that would happen within a few days .
A spokesman for the Czech president , VÃ¡clav Klaus , said a date for the signing had been agreed but would be announced later .
The Americans are likely to prefer 5 April , the first anniversary of Obama 's speech in the Czech capital in which he outlined his vision of a nuclear - free world .
The treaty , which substantially reduces Russian and US nuclear arsenals and delivery systems , is a big achievement for Obama and his attempts to reset relations with Russia .
Negotiators had been trying to reach agreement for nearly a year , and the previous treaty expired last December .
The breakthrough followed US secretary of state Hillary Clinton 's visit to Moscow last week and last minute talks with Vladimir Putin , the prime minister .
Putin had insisted there could only be a new treaty if the US linked nuclear reductions to its revised missile defence shield in Europe .
The White House 's decision to site parts of its missile shield in Romania â€ “ and possibly Bulgaria â€ “ is known to have irked Putin .
But he appears to have allowed Medvedev and Obama a mutual foreign policy success .
Obama must now persuade sceptical Republicans to ratify the treaty .
One nuclear arms expert said the US and Russia may have amended the way nuclear missiles and launchers are counted to arrive at the figures agreed at a US - Russian presidential summit in Moscow last July .
Obama and Medvedev called for a reduction to between 1,500 and 1,675 warheads and 500 to 1,100 delivery systems including missiles and bombers .
The expired treaty permits each side a maximum of 2,200 warheads and 1,600 launch vehicles .
No details had been published , but Yevgeny Myasnikov , a leading Moscow - based defence expert , said the new pact was likely to include a clause allowing the reductions to be reversible , so that both sides could reassemble nuclear warheads in an emergency .
"" There is n't much in the substance of this treaty , "" he said .
The treaty would however allow Russia and the US to discuss more significant further strategic nuclear cuts , he said .
"" I think it 's a good start .
Both sides benefit from this .
But further progress will take time and effort .
"" Anne Penketh , programme director of the Washington - based , independent British American Security Information Council , agreed .
"" If you look at the actual treaty , they are not going to be cutting up weapons .
They are just not going to be deployed .
It is quite a modest treaty .
It is important in what it says about US - Russian relations .
It is a signal of the tangible improvement . ""
A treaty will provide Obama with a much - needed foreign policy success .
He had hoped to have the Start treaty signed and ratified by the Senate before a high - profile nuclear review summit in Washington next month .
He had also hoped to have ratification of a comprehensive test ban treaty in place , but that is unlikely this year .
A framework for the Start deal was agreed in Moscow last July , but final agreement has been held up by differences over the exchange of data on missile performance and defence systems .
The two presidents ' remarks will be as closely scrutinised as the treaty text , for signs on the future of arms control .
"" The question is : What do the presidents say about the next steps , "" said Daryl Kimball , the head of the Arms Control Association in Washington .
"" The two sides share a common goal to pursue further nuclear arms cuts .
A common path has not yet been established .
I would hope the two presidents will say we will continue our consultations on further nuclear arms reductions.""Advocates of multilateral disarmament hope this deal will quickly be followed by talks on a far more reaching treaty that will bring each sides total number of warheads to below 1000 .
Each side may also make unilateral statements on the future of missile defence , which is not part of the treaty , but which held up its signing .
Romania 's agreement in January to host a new US missile defence system almost derailed the START talks .
The Russians could opt to declare a proviso that if the American missile defence scheme grew to the point that it infringed its vital national security interests , it reserved the right to withdraw from the new START treaty .
Some US senators have vowed to oppose ratification of the treaty if that happens , but arms control advocates point out that a similar declaration accompanied the original START .
John Kerry , the chairman of the Senate foreign relations committee said he discussed the agreement with President Obama yesterday was planning to hold hearings on the new treaty in the week beginning on April 4 ."
2010-03-26,"This was supposed to have been the easy part .
The successor to the 1991 START treaty was agreed in principle by Barack Obama and Dmitry Medvedev last July in Moscow .
The negotiators simply had to hammer out the details before the old agreement expired on December 5 .
It turned out to be a tough slog .
The talks ran over the December 5 deadline and then through a succession of later target dates , as the two sides got bogged down in the minutiae of missile telemetry encryption , and the bigger issue of missile defence .
The Obama team scrapped the Bush administration 's missile defence scheme in Eastern Europe , but replaced it with one of its own .
The system is meant to be a shield against a potential Iranian missile threat .
Moscow saw it as an effort to blunt the effectiveness of the Russian nuclear deterrent .
The Russians wanted words in the START preamble banning or limiting the system , and the Americans refused .
By all accounts that disagreement has been shelved for the time being but not resolved .
There is no doubt this treaty gets the arms control ball rolling again , and just in time .
The US will be hosting the review of the nuclear Non - Proliferation Treaty in May , at a time when the nuclear have - nots are , more than ever , questioning the inequity of the status quo and bridling at new controls on their own activities .
The new START on its own will not produce sweetness and light at the NPT review in New York .
What the non - weapons states will be looking for will be solid commitments from the US , Russia and other nuclear weapons powers to significantly more far - reaching cuts .
So a lot rides on what gets said on April 8 in Prague , when this deal gets signed .
Obama 's promises in particular will be mentioned against the visionary speech he made in the Czech capital a year ago .
This line from the White House today gives the disarmers some room for hope : As articulated by President Obama in his Prague speech one year ago , this Treaty is one of a series of concrete steps the United States will take to reduce the number and role of nuclear weapons and to set the stage for further reductions in global nuclear stockpiles and materials ."
2010-03-26,"The US and Russia concluded a deal today to cut their deployed arsenals of nuclear missiles by 30 % , in the biggest breakthrough for arms control for two decades .
The treaty , which Barack Obama and Dmitry Medvedev will sign on 8 April in Prague , lowers the ceiling on the number of operational strategic nuclear weapons from 2,200 to 1,550 .
The total number of launchers ( missiles and heavy bombers ) allowed will be reduced to 800 , half the existing ceiling .
"" We have turned words into action .
We have made progress that is clear and concrete , "" Obama said .
"" And we have demonstrated the importance of American leadership and American partnership on behalf of our own security , and the world 's . ""
Speaking in Moscow , the Russian foreign minister , Sergei Lavrov , said the new treaty was a significant breakthrough in Russia 's strategic relationship with the US and in the non - proliferation of nuclear weapons globally .
Final agreement on the deal , sealed by a telephone call this morning between the two presidents , had been held up by disagreements over the sharing of data on new missiles , and by US plans to develop a missile defence system in eastern Europe .
Russia wanted the preamble to the treaty to ban the deployment of such systems , which Moscow fears will blunt the effectiveness of its nuclear deterrent .
It is understood that the preamble in the treaty agreed today will impose no limits on missile defence but will acknowledge it plays a role in fuelling the nuclear arms race .
Lavrov said the new treaty would include a clause saying that if either side believed the other side 's anti - missile defence capacity had grown too strong then they could review the treaty .
The agreement will replace the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty ( Start ) , signed at the end of the cold war in 1991 , which expired in December .
It also replaces the much looser 2002 Moscow Treaty , which set the existing limit of 2,200 strategic weapons , but lacked any provisions for each side to verify the other was sticking to the bargain .
The treaty is widely seen as restoring some momentum to global arms control , but advocates of disarmament argue it is only a small step on a much longer road .
The cuts in the new Start treaty do not require warheads to be dismantled , but simply removed from the active , deployed missile force to a reserve stockpile .
They represent a small dent in the total number of warheads still in existence – 23,000 , more than 90 % of which are owned by Russia and the US .
The focus of attention now will be on the degree of commitment that Obama and Medvedev show to continuing talks with the aim of more aggressive cuts in their arsenals in a future treaty .
Much will depend on whether Washington and Moscow can resolve their differences over missile defence , and on the political mood in both countries .
The new Start needs to be ratified by the US Senate and the Russian Duma before coming into force .
The Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament strongly hailed the new treaty as a "" major step on the road towards a nuclear - free future "" .
Kate Hudson , Chair of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament , said : "" After almost a year of negotiations , these significant cut - backs are very welcome .
World leaders must now build on this momentum to secure further rounds of cuts , bringing the other nuclear weapon states into the process .
With both Obama 's Nuclear Security Summit next month and the review of the Non - Proliferation Treaty in May , this is a most timely advance which must be exploited to the full . ""
"" All nuclear weapon states , Britain included , must show their commitment to Obama 's worthy aim and push for the biggest strides possible at the upcoming summit meetings , "" she added ."
2010-04-02,"Standing in Prague 's Hradcany Square a year ago , Barack Obama set an ambitious goal : a world without nuclear weapons .
One year later , on 8 April , Obama and Russian president Dmitry Medvedev are expected back in Prague where they will sign a new nuclear arms treaty reducing the limit on strategic stockpiles to 1,550 warheads each .
Although the agreement does not cover tactical nuclear weapons , and includes a new counting regime that attributes only one weapon to each bomber regardless of the actual payload , the treaty is a significant landmark in Russian - American relations and an impressive accomplishment for both leaders .
In little more that one year , Obama and Medvedev managed to rebuild non - proliferation diplomacy damaged by mutual tensions .
They also successfully moved away from the discourse of Munich , where Vladimir Putin 's blunt speech at the February 2007 Munich security conference highlighted the dismal relations between the two powers , to Prague , where Obama 's call for global co - operation was welcomed and reciprocated by Russian leadership .
Not so long ago , Prague 's significance in nuclear diplomacy was far more practical than symbolic .
In June 2007 , just a few months after Putin 's speech in Munich , George Bush touched down in the Czech capital to discuss his proposed ballistic missile defence system , which was to include an advanced radar station in Brdy , just 80 km southwest of Prague .
Although the public was firmly against the plan , Czech leadership , which then included prime minister Mirek Topolánek and President Václav Klaus , was firmly in favour of the proposal in the hope of securing an American presence in the Czech Republic .
This was also the case in neighbouring Poland , which had finally agreed to host a battery of American interceptor missiles after public opinion shifted abruptly following Russia 's military incursion into Georgia in the summer of 2008 .
When Obama cancelled the programme last autumn , choosing to focus on addressing the perceived Iranian missile threat by extending the sea - based Aegis missile defence system instead , many across the region reacted with a mild panic attack .
This was because for Polish and Czech leaders , the missile shield was never about Iran but about installing the Americans within their borders as a hedge against a snarling Russia .
Even before Obama 's cancellation of Bush 's system , nerves were already frayed to the point that a number of political and diplomatic heavyweights , including Václav Havel and Lech Wałęsa , penned a public letter to the new US president imploring him not to forget about the region .
The leaders noted that "" Nato today seems weaker than when we joined , "" and that "" Our hopes that relations with Russia would improve and that Moscow would finally fully accept our complete sovereignty and independence after joining Nato and the EU have not been fulfilled .
"" They also outlined the tensions felt across the region , accusing Russia of using "" overt and covert means of economic warfare , ranging from energy blockades and politically motivated investments to bribery and media manipulation in order to advance its interests and to challenge the transatlantic orientation of central and eastern Europe "" .
With the situation in Georgia still unresolved and with the memory of Yalta still very much alive across the region , the Russian - American negotiations that followed Obama 's call for nuclear disarmament were met with a mixture of curiosity and unease .
For example , after the agreement had been reached , the leading story in Poland 's largest daily newspaper , Gazeta Wyborcza , focused on whether the agreement would "" hit "" the Aegis missile shield which the Poles still hope to host on their soil , and whether Russia could unilaterally withdraw from the treaty in order to rearm .
In the midst of it all , Obama took a number of steps to show America 's eastern European allies that American commitment to their security was never in question .
Last December Polish and US diplomats agreed on a status of forces agreement to govern the legal status of United States military personnel who will man a battery of Patriot air defence missiles that the Americans first promised during Bush 's tenure .
Better still , the Economist reported this January that Nato 's military command would bypass the North Atlantic Council to formulate contingency plans for the Baltic states of Estonia , Latvia and Lithuania .
Finally it is not a coincidence that Prague has become the setting for Obama 's public diplomacy , and that both American and Russian leaders will arrive in the Czech capital to sign their historic agreement .
After 14 months in office , Obama has "" reset "" relations with Russia , successfully reduced some of the tensions in the region , and strengthened Nato guarantees for the alliance 's most insecure members after the 2008 Georgia debacle .
Certainly , Obama could have benefited from the home - town media glare by inviting Medvedev to sign the treaty at the nuclear summit meeting in Washington later this month , but considering his successes in the region thus far , it is no surprise that he has chosen to come back to Prague .
His accomplishments may not be enough to justify his Nobel peace prize , but for Obama , Medvedev and the region , Prague represents a very good start ."
2010-04-08,"Iran appears to have been the ghost at the banquet at the Obama - Medvedev summit here in Prague .
The sanctions currently being negotiated at the UN Security Council occupied much of the two leaders ' time together and seem to have contributed to the half - hour delay in signing the Start treaty .
In his comments after the signing ceremony , Dmitry Medvedev agreed that action had to be taken against Iran which had "" regrettably not responded to a series of constructive proposals "" on its nuclear programme .
"" We can not turn a blind eye to this , "" he said .
But Medvedev said that in a "" straightforward and frank "" discussion with Barack Obama he had "" outlined our limits on sanctions "" .
He said repeatedly that they should be "" smart "" and targeted , and not "" create a catastrophe for the Iranian people "" .
He did not elaborate , but the Russian deputy foreign minister , Sergei Ryabkov , who is travelling with Medvedev , gave the example of an embargo on supplies of refined oil products - petrol and diesel - to Iran , which Ryabkov would trigger a "" huge shock for the whole society and the whole population "" .
A refined oil blockade was being talked about last year but has since appeared to drop off the agenda .
Britain opposed it , in part because it would be almost impossible to enforce and boost the smuggling industry on Iran 's borders .
The real issue now is how far the sanctions go in targeting the Revolutionary Guard .
On one hand the guards have real control over the nuclear programme .
On the other , they control much of the economy , so if you really go after them , you inevitably affect a lot of ordinary Iranians .
Obama said : "" My expectation is that we are going to be able to secure strong , tough sanctions on Iran this spring . ""
European diplomats believe that it will probably take longer , as China wants even milder measures than the Russians .
It depends on how long spring lasts ."
2010-04-08,"The US and Russia said today they had ushered in a new era in their relations with the signing of a treaty placing tighter limits on their nuclear arsenals .
After signing the strategic arms reduction treaty ( Start ) in Prague , Barack Obama and Dmitry Medvedev spoke warmly of their relationship , and looked forward to further arms control negotiations .
It was clear , however , that differences remained , particularly over the issue of US missile defence installations in eastern Europe .
Medvedev called the Start agreement "" historic "" and a "" win - win situation "" for both countries .
But he added the treaty "" can be viable only provided there are no quantitative or qualitative increases in ABM ( anti - ballistic missile ) capabilities "" .
Standing alongside Medvedev in Prague Castle , Obama insisted the US missile defence plans were "" not directed at changing the strategic balance between the US and Russia "" but rather at protecting the American people from emerging threats such as Iran .
A senior American official said that before the signing the two leaders "" talked about missile defence in more substance "" and there were plans for detailed negotiations aimed at removing it as an obstacle to further arms control talks .
The Start treaty limits each side to 1,550 strategic nuclear weapons deployed and ready to fire , and to 700 deployed delivery systems ( missiles and heavy bombers ) .
Obama described the agreement as "" just one step on a longer journey "" which would set the stage for further cuts .
He said he hoped future negotiations would include tactical , short - range weapons , and the thousands of non - deployed weapons which together represent the bulk of both countries ' arsenals .
Before going further , both leaders will have to get the treaty ratified by their national legislatures .
Medvedev said he wanted ratification to be synchronised , implying the Russian Duma would not vote on the Start treaty before the US Senate .
The White House is in the process of negotiating with Republican senators in the hope of mustering the necessary 67 votes to ratify the agreement .
US officials said they were still hopeful Start could be ratified before the mid - term congressional elections .
The two leaders frequently exchanged smiles and comments .
Obama described Medvedev as a "" friend and partner "" and Medvedev talked of a "" personal chemistry "" .
It was a theme US officials reinforced after the ceremony .
"" We 're in a very different place in terms of how the two presidents interact , "" a senior official said .
"" They are both extremely pragmatic men .
I can not emphasise that enough … it 's not always seen as a zero - sum game .
[ Obama ] genuinely feels like they can sit down or call each other and talk things through . ""
The official said Obama and Medvedev spoke about the situation in Kyrgyzstan , and found common ground .
"" We see no evidence that this is an anti - American coup or a ' sponsored by Russia ' coup , "" the official said .
Today 's bilateral talks overran , postponing the signing ceremony by half an hour .
The two presidents and their aides discussed sanctions against Iran aimed at curbing its nuclear ambitions .
Medvedev said it was regrettable that Iran had not responded to a series of "" constructive proposals "" from the international community .
He said sanctions looked inevitable , but added he had set out Russia 's limits on possible UN measures .
He argued they should be "" smart "" and targeted at curbing proliferation , and "" not create a catastrophe for the Iranian people "" .
He did not elaborate , but Russia 's deputy foreign minister , Sergei Ryabkov , gave the example of an embargo on the supply of petrol and diesel to Iran , which is dependent on imports because of its lack of refineries .
Such an embargo , which has been suggested by some US officials , would be "" a slap , a blow , a huge shock for the whole society and the whole population "" , Ryabkov said .
US officials said some sort of energy - related sanctions were still on the table at the security council talks , but that the US agreed with Russia the measures should not be aimed at regime change or widespread economic damage ."
2010-04-08,"On a warm Prague spring day , Barack Obama and Dmitry Medvedev have signed a new Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty ( START ) cutting by about a third the number of long - range nuclear weapons their countries have deployed and ready to fire .
There was a lot of emphasis in the remarks that followed about a new chapter in US - Russian relations after the rocky years of the Bush and Putin eras , but it was clear when both presidents got up to speak after the ceremony in Prague Castle that important differences remain - particularly on missile defence - that could block progress on further reductions in nuclear arms .
Obama was noticeably more effusive in his remarks , saying the treaty was "" just one step on a longer journey "" and would "" set the stage for further cuts "" in the nuclear arsenals of both countries .
Medvedev 's language was more prosaic , stressing the difficulties in reaching an agreement ( it is about four months overdue ) .
He said "" just a couple of months ago it looked like mission impossible "" - a reference to the near - collapse of the talks over US missile defence plans in Eastern Europe .
Medvedev said the treaty "" maintained a balance of interest "" between the two countries and described it as a "" win - win "" outcome but he added that the agreement would only remain "" viable "" if there were "" no quantitative or qualitative "" improvements in anti - ballistic missiles systems .
The Russian president made it clear that Moscow preferred the Obama system , initially based on short - range missiles , to the Bush scheme it replaced .
But the new system is going to be progressively upgraded .
By 2020 it will involve land - based missiles that will in theory be able to intercept long - range ICBMs .
That is unacceptable to the Moscow , who believe they could be used to undermine Russia 's own deterrent , not just block future Iranian missiles .
This treaty will expire at the time those weapons are due to be deployed , but Russia could pull out of START if development work on them continues .
The issue is also a significant obstacle to a follow - on arms control treaty .
Both Obama and Medvedev , however , said they were optimistic the issue could ultimately resolved through dialogue .
The two leaders also acknowledged that the treaty must now be ratified by the Russian Duma and the US Senate .
Medvedev said Russia would insist on synchronicity - ie the Duma would wait for the Senate before ratifying itself .
Obama said he was confident the Senate would ratify , noting pointedly that "" fortunately there is a long tradition of bipartisanship "" on arms control , a bipartisanship that has proved elusive in recent months .
There was also a lot of talk about sanctions on Iran , and clear differences there , about which more shortly .
UPDATE -
The Russians have published the text of the treaty .
A website on Russian nuclear forces , edited by Pavel Podvig , has translated some of it , from which it is clear that Medvedev 's language on missile defence is drawn directly from the formal Russian statement on the treaty NEW UPDATE - the US state department has now published the text of the treaty"
2010-04-08,"The US president , Barack Obama , and Dmitry Medvedev , the Russian leader , today signed an arms treaty that will slash their respective nuclear arsenals by a third .
The two men shook hands to applause after signing what Obama called a historic agreement in the opulent setting of Prague castle in the Czech Republic .
Obama said the new agreement made the US and the world more secure and helped stopped the drift in US - Russia relations . ""
Together we 've stopped that drift , "" Obama said , adding that the agreement was a "" milestone for US - Russia relations "" .
He acknowledged , however , that the new agreement was "" just one step on a longer journey "" and said it has set the stage for further cuts .
There was also a stern message for Iran as Obama said the world would not tolerate actions from countries that flouted the nuclear non - proliferation treaty and threatened collective security .
Medvedev echoed Obama 's concerns , saying that the world could not turn a blind eye to Iran , which he said had not responded to "" many constructive proposals "" .
He hinted that Russia would be open to further sanctions against Tehran .
The new treaty will cut American and Russian strategic nuclear warheads to 1,550 over seven years , about a third less than the 2,200 currently allowed .
Obama returned to Prague one year after he outlined his vision before an enthusiastic crowd for a world without nuclear weapons .
The speech helped him win the Nobel peace prize , but Obama has acknowledged that eliminating nuclear weapons is unlikely to be achieved during his lifetime .
The agreement to reduce nuclear warheads by a third succeeds the 1991 strategic arms reduction treaty ( Start ) , which expired in December .
It will have to be ratified by the US Senate – where conservative Republicans can be expected to give it a rough ride – and the Russian parliament .
In addition to the warhead limit , the US and Russia must cut their total land , sea and air - based launchers to 800 each , and no more than 700 actually deployed within seven years .
While that will leave plenty of nuclear weapons to destroy the world several times over , it marks a big drop from the total of 19,000 strategic warheads both sides deployed during the cold war .
Obama wants to move for even deeper cuts but faces Russian reluctance because of American plans to build a missile defence system in Europe to counter a possible Iranian threat .
Russia argues that antiballistic missile systems could neutralise its smaller arsenal .
Even as Obama pushes for deep cuts in nuclear weapons , the Washington Post reported that the Pentagon is developing a weapon to plug the gap left by nuclear warheads : missiles armed with conventional warheads that could strike anywhere in the world in less than an hour .
US military officials say the intercontinental ballistic missiles , known as prompt global strike weapons , are a necessary new form of deterrence against terrorist networks .
Obama will have to balance his desire for deep cuts against the more immediate goal of keeping Russia on side to ratchet up the pressure on Iran and its suspected nuclear weapons programme .
The US is seeking another round of sanctions against Tehran and Obama is also courting support from China , which recently signalled its willingness to adopt a tougher line towards Iran .
Obama 's trip to Prague is part of an intensive round of nuclear diplomacy .
On Tuesday , the US released the results of a comprehensive nuclear strategy review in which the US committed itself for the first time not to use nuclear weapons against non - nuclear states provided that they are party to the nuclear non - proliferation treaty and in compliance with their nuclear non - proliferation obligations – a caveat that excludes North Korea and Iran .
Next week , Obama welcomes to Washington the leaders of 46 countries , including the Chinese president , Hu Jintao , for a summit meeting on nuclear security ."
2010-04-21,"Ukraine 's president , Viktor Yanukovych , today agreed to extend the lease on Russia 's naval base in the Crimea , in the most explicit sign yet of his new administration 's tilt towards Moscow .
Yanukovych said the lease on Russia 's Black Sea fleet that was due to expire in 2017 will be prolonged for 25 years , until 2042 at least .
His announcement follows a meeting with Russia 's president Dmitry Medvedev in Kharkiv , in eastern Ukraine .
In return , Medvedev said Russia would offer Ukraine a discount on its gas bills : he said Moscow would slash the price Kiev pays for 1,000 cubic metres of Siberian gas by $ 100 ( £ 65 ) from its current rate of $ 330 , with a 30 % discount if the price falls .
The deal is the most concrete sign yet that Ukraine is now back under Russia 's influence following Yanukovych 's victory in February 's presidential elections .
It appears to mark the final nail in the coffin of the Orange Revolution of 2004 .
Yanukovych 's predecessor , Viktor Yushchenko , had vowed to eject Russia 's Black Sea fleet from the port of Sevastopol , arguing that its presence was an affront to Ukraine 's sovereignty and a destabilising factor in Crimea , a majority ethnic Russian region with a strong pro - Soviet mood .
Today , Ukrainian officials insisted Ukraine still plans to join the EU , and to integrate with transatlantic institutions .
"" We want to move towards the west .
But the best way of doing this is to get gas from the east , "" a foreign ministry spokesman said .
"" The Black Sea fleet is n't any threat to Ukraine 's independence . ""
The agreement is a boost for Yanukovych as he tries to lever Ukraine 's economy out of severe recession , and to clinch a $ 12bn bailout loan from the IMF .
Russia currently pays $ 90 m per year for the base .
It was not clear if the rent has now gone up .
But the lease extension is likely to increase opposition to Yanukovych in Ukraine 's western provinces .
Ukraine 's split between the Russian - speaking east and Ukrainian - speaking west also is predominantly a political division , and leaders have always been forced to play a delicate balancing act for fear of upsetting either camp .
Russian gas company Gazprom said in a statement today that it has lifted all penalties for the failure to buy as much gas as contracted and said that the discounts for Ukraine "" will not harm Gazprom 's financials . """
2010-04-28,"Russia today posted documents concerning the massacre of Polish prisoners in Katyn on a government website , and said it would release further archive material dealing with Soviet - era repression .
Russia 's president , Dmitry Medvedev , said he had personally ordered the online publication of the archive on the massacre , which took place 70 years ago when Soviet secret police shot 22,000 Polish officers near Katyn in western Russia .
The documents have been published before in Poland and Russia .
But the decision to publish them online is the latest positive gesture by Moscow to Warsaw after this month 's air disaster that killed Poland 's president , Lech Kaczynski .
The crash provoked an unprecedented Russian reaction , with Medvedev attending Kaczynski 's funeral in Krakow and the prime minister , Vladimir Putin , leading the investigation into why Kaczynski 's plane went down .
Medvedev suggested Russia would now release further classified documents on the massacre . ""
The Katyn archives are open .
[ But ] there are certain materials that have not yet been forwarded to our Polish partners , "" Medvedev said .
Pledging greater openness , he added : "" I have ordered that appropriate work be carried out and materials that are interesting to our Polish colleagues be handed over to them . ""
Human rights groups say that Russia has refused to hand over the most sensitive archive materials – which identify individual officers from the NKVD , the pre - KGB secret police – who carried out the killings .
Today , the head of Russia 's state archives agency , Rosarchiv , Andrei Artizov , said the documents came from the top - secret archive of the politburo .
They include a letter from Lavrenti Beria , the head of the NKVD , written in March 1940 .
In it , Beria describes the Polish PoWs as "" incorrigible enemies of Soviet power "" and urges their liquidation .
The archive includes the signatures of Stalin and other politburo members on a resolution authorising the murders – which Stalin subsequently blamed on the Nazis .
Artizov said all Soviet leaders after Stalin were told the truth about Katyn .
He said the murders were carried out at three distinct sites : Pyatikhatka , near Kharkov ; Katyn , near Smolensk ; and Mednoye in Russia 's Tver region .
The largest number of Polish officers were shot dead in Mednoye , he said .
Historians said that the decision to post the documents on the internet was an important step to enable Russians to come to terms with their past .
Andrzej Kunert , a Polish historian , said the Kremlin 's move was significant .
"" We can call the decision a breakthrough . """
2010-05-04,"Russia 's president , Dmitry Medvedev , today ordered an urgent inquiry into why a prisoner who died last week in custody was refused medical treatment – with doctors advising her to sleep "" standing up "" .
Medvedev said criminal charges would be brought against investigators who permitted the death of Vera Trifonova , a 53-year - old businesswoman .
She was arrested last December and locked up in Moscow 's notorious Matrosskaya Tishina pre - trial detention centre .
Trifonova died on Friday , despite repeated requests for her release .
She had been suffering from severe diabetes and kidney failure .
She was almost blind and only able to breathe with one lung .
When she complained of breathlessness , doctors advised her to sleep "" standing up "" .
The case is a further embarrassment for Medvedev , whose attempts to reform Russia 's callously outmoded penal system have so far had little effect .
This follows the death in the same detention centre of Sergei Magnitsky last November , a 37-year - old lawyer working for Hermitage Capital , the asset management fund .
Hermitage accused the interior ministry of defrauding the company of $ 230 m ( £ 152 m ) in a large - scale tax scam allegedly involving 60 senior Russian officials .
The same officials then arrested Magnitsky and kept him in prison for nearly a year without charge .
He died after he was refused treatment for an embolism .
Medvedev issued guidelines that defendants accused of economic crimes should automatically be given bail .
Prosecutors claim Trifonova , who ran a successful real estate business , tried to sell a seat in Russia 's upper chamber federation council for $ 1.5 m .
Trifonova dismissed the charge as ludicrous .
In a stinging editorial , the business daily Vedomosti dubbed Trifonova 's prison ordeal "" slow torture "" .
"" We are not just talking about subtle mockery here but torment , "" the paper said .
It noted she was so ill at the time of her arrest she was using a wheelchair . ""
She became my client in March and when I visited her in jail her eyesight was about 10 % and her lungs were full of liquid , "" her lawyer , Vladimir Zherebyonkov , told the Moscow Times .
Medvedev ordered criminal charges to be brought against Sergei Pysin , the chief investigator in the case , who had opposed Trifonova 's numerous petitions for bail .
On 6 April he told a court that her medical condition had "" stabilised "" , citing doctors ' reports .
Two other investigators were also disciplined .
It remains doubtful whether any serious punishment will follow .
So far nobody has been prosecuted in connection with Magnitsky 's death . ""
An innocent man who had uncovered corruption was killed with the involvement of officials he implicated .
People are now rising to demand that the individuals behind Sergei 's murder be punished , "" William Browder , Hermitage 's London - based CEO , said today .
The Magnitsky case threatens to heap further PR damage on Russia this week when it is debated at the US congressional Tom Lantos human rights commission .
Last week Benjamin Cardin , a Democratic senator , called on the state department to deny US visas to more than 60 Russian officials allegedly involved in Magnitsky 's death .
The list includes Russia 's deputy interior minister Alexei Anichin , deputy general prosecutor Victor Grin , and other senior law enforcement officials and judges . ""
These visa sanctions will send an important message to corrupt officials in Russia and elsewhere , that the United States is serious about combating foreign corruption and the harm it does , "" Cardin told the US senate committee on foreign relations .
It seems unlikely , however , that Hillary Clinton , the US secretary of state , will heed Cardin 's call .
Any visa ban against top Russian government bureaucrats would imperil the tentative improvement in relations between Washington and Moscow .
It would also almost certainly prompt swift retaliatory action from the Kremlin ."
2010-05-07,"Russian forces have released 10 Somali pirates captured during a military operation to free an oil tanker this week , reversing an earlier pledge by President Dmitry Medvedev to punish them "" under the full force of naval law "" .
The move highlights the legal and logistical challenges faced by foreign navies targeting the pirate gangs who have turned the waters off Somalia into the most dangerous in the world .
The hijackers were captured yesterday aboard the MV Moscow University , which was carrying oil worth $ 52 m ( £ 35 m ) from Sudan to China when it was attacked in the Gulf of Aden a day earlier .
It was the first time a Russian - owned and staffed ship had been hijacked off Somalia .
After the 23-man crew cut the power and barricaded themselves in a safe room , a helicopter launched from a nearby Russian warship exchanged fire with the attackers , who quickly surrendered .
One hijacker was killed .
Medvedev praised the rescue operation , and promised tough action against the attackers . ""
Perhaps we should return to the idea of creating an international court and other judicial instruments , "" Medvedev was quoted by the Interfax news agency as saying .
"" Until we get that , we 'll have to do what our predecessors have done when they have encountered pirates . ""
But today , the Russian defence ministry said that the captives had been disarmed and freed .
Aleksei Kuznetsov , a ministry spokesman , said the release was "" connected to the imperfections in international law "" .
But he also suggested that the cost of prosecution and subsequent imprisonment was a factor .
"" Why should we feed some pirates ? "" he said .
The release of pirates by foreign navies patrolling the Gulf of Aden and Indian Ocean is not uncommon .
Somalia 's lawlessness means handing suspects over for trial there is not possible , while there can also be problems with collecting evidence for trial abroad .
But other foreign governments have prosecuted Somali pirates in cases where their own citizens and vessels were attacked .
The sole surviving hijacker of the US - flagged tanker Maersk Alabama , whose crew members were dramatically freed by American special forces last year , is awaiting trial in New York , while 11 other would - be Somali hijackers were taken to the US in April after firing on American warships on patrol .
Somali pirates also currently face trial in the Netherlands and France .
More often , however , US and European navy ships have offloaded pirates in Kenya under an agreement with the government in Nairobi .
But with its own legal and prison system under strain , Kenya now says it will only accept Somali prisoners on a case - by - case basis .
Instead , the EU is looking for assistance from the Seychelles , whose maritime trade has been hit by Somali hijackings and which has announced plans to establish a regional centre to prosecute pirates .
Roger Middleton , who researches piracy for the Chatham House thinktank in London , said that effective prosecutions were important , but were unlikely to discourage most pirate gangs .
"" I 'm not sure that jail time in the US or Kenya is enough of a disincentive to stop young Somalis who can make $ 20,000 or $ 30,000 in a year at sea , "" he said ."
2010-05-11,"Syria and Russia have discussed nuclear energy co - operation as Moscow seeks to boost its position in a region dominated by the US , Israel 's principal ally .
Speaking after talks with Syria 's president , Bashar al - Assad , Russian president Dmitry Medvedev said today that Russia could build reactors in Syria , but gave no further details .
Assad told reporters they had discussed "" oil and gas co - operation , as well as constructing conventional or nuclear - powered electricity stations "" .
In 2007 Israel bombed what it claimed was a nuclear site in northern Syria â€ “ still the subject of an investigation by the UN 's nuclear watchdog , the International Atomic Energy Agency .
Syria said it was an ordinary military installation .
Medvedev 's two - day state visit to Damascus was the first by a Russian or Soviet president .
The USSR was a strategic ally of Syria but the relationship cooled after the cold war ended .
The visit came amid tensions over Israel 's accusations that Syria has been transferring long - range Scud missiles to the Lebanese militia Hezbollah â€ “ a claim denied by the Syrian and Lebanese governments and the UN .
In Israel , the office of President Shimon Peres said Medvedev had agreed to tell Assad that Israel had no intention of attacking its northern neighbour .
The Russian president said he wanted the US to play a more active role in peace talks between Israel and the Palestinians .
Russia is a member of the Quartet of Middle East peacemakers and the only one not to shun contact with Palestinian Islamist movement Hamas . ""
In essence , the Middle East peace process has deteriorated , "" Medvedev said .
"" The situation is very , very bad .
It 's time to do something . ""
Assad said that "" incentives "" granted by "" superpowers "" to Israel encouraged it to evade the requirements of peace â€ “ an apparent reference to its annual $ 3bn of US aid .
The Russian and Syrian leaders issued a joint call for a nuclear - free Middle East â€ “ a coded attack on Israel 's undeclared nuclear arsenal .
"" Any other development will mean a regional and probably global catastrophe , "" Medvedev warned .
Assad , a close ally of Iran , said : "" It is every country 's right to develop nuclear energy for peaceful purposes . ""
A Russian - built nuclear power station in Iran is due to start operating later this year .
Russian officials made clear before the visit that no arms deals would be announced .
Syria is rumoured to be interested in acquiring Russian - made Iskander surface - to - surface missiles , to which Israel would object .
The warm reception for Medvedev contrasted with the chill in relations between Washington and Damascus after US president Barack Obama said last week he was renewing economic sanctions against Syria because it posed a threat to US interests .
Obama accused Assad of "" supporting terrorism , pursuing weapons of mass destruction and missile programmes and undermining US and international efforts with respect to the stabilisation and reconstruction of Iraq . ""
The US Senate is also delaying the dispatch of a new ambassador to Syria ."
2010-05-30,"The United States is sending a succession of envoys to engage with Hamas but lacks the bravery to talk to the Islamist movement openly , its leader , Khaled Meshal , said in an interview with the Guardian .
Meshal praised President Dmitry Medvedev of Russia for meeting him in Damascus and the Syrian president , Bashar al - Assad , for hosting the discussion 10 days ago .
He told Medvedev that the US was also talking to him . ""
I thanked him for that meeting and told him the Americans contact us , but are not brave enough to do so openly , "" said Meshal .
"" I am confident that in the very near future , everyone will realise that they will have to deal with Hamas . ""
The claim that the US is engaging with a group it lists as a terrorist organisation will upset the Palestinian president , Mahmoud Abbas , whose security forces have locked up and allegedly tortured leading Hamas members in the West Bank ..
But four years into Israel 's blockade of Gaza , the revelation could be seen as a sign that cracks are opening up in the western consensus that Hamas should remain isolated .
Russia is a member of the Middle East Quartet , which demands recognition of the state of Israel as a precondition to a seat at the negotiating table .
Hamas says that recognising Israel was one of the Fatah leadership 's biggest mistakes , and resulted in 17 years of fruitless negotiation .
Meshal predicted that the conditions , which he called a trap for the Quartet itself , would change .
The Hamas leader claimed many western officials recognised that the blockade of Gaza had failed and the time had come to end it .
This , he said , was the significance of efforts by a flotilla of eight ships , including four cargo vessels carrying construction and medical supplies and a Turkish passenger ferry carrying 600 people , heading for a confrontation with the Israeli navy off Gaza tomorrow .
Meshal said the tectonic plates in the Middle East were shifting , with Iran , Turkey and Syria emerging as regional powers .
Egypt was in the throes of a battle for succession that would paralyse it as a regional player .
As a result , Israel was losing its power to impose conditions on a weakened Palestinian leadership in Ramallah .
As it felt its power ebbing , Israel needed a new war but was crippled by self - doubt , Meshal said .
He claimed the attacks on Hezbollah in Lebanon in 2006 , and against Hamas in Gaza in 2009 , left both organisations stronger politically and militarily . ""
Israel is conducting exercises threatening Hamas , Hezbollah and Syria .
It needs a war , but choosing the front to fight on will not be a picnic and this reflects the crisis in Israel .
It does not want peace , but the option of war is not easy for it , "" he said .
The Hamas leader added that Israel might be tempted to strike Gaza again . ""
A war in Gaza might appear the easy option .
But that would be an illusion , not because we have adequate weapons , but because Israel this time would be fighting against a people with nothing to lose .
Gaza is small in size but it has become a large symbol for the rest of the world .
This has become very clear in the last week . ""
Senior Hamas officials said they had conducted a study of their military tactics in Israel 's attack on Gaza in 2009 and were now working with rockets that could hit tanks effectively at longer range .
Meshal said Barack Obama had made a brave speech in Cairo , but within months had retreated , with administration officials actively vetoing efforts to seek agreement between Fatah and Hamas on a national unity government .
Citing senior Fatah sources , he claimed George Mitchell , the US negotiator , told the Palestinian Authority and Egypt that the US would cut off aid to the PA if it formed a national unity government with Hamas and the other militant Palestinian factions . ""
Palestinian reconciliation is not on the table at the moment , because the priority for America is to resume the proximity talks .
Mahmoud Abbas is better for America 's purpose without reconciliation , because he is weak and a deal with Hamas would strengthen the Palestinian position in the negotiation .
America prefers a weak Palestinian negotiating party , because it believes this is the best chance for a deal with an intransigent [ Israeli prime minister Binyamin ] Netanyahu . ""
Hamas claims that nine or 10 of the 22-member Arab League now either publicly or tacitly back its formula for a unity government , not least Saudi Arabia , a country still thought to be furious with Hamas about its takeover of Gaza in 2007 , which tore up an agreement with Fatah .
Meshal said that four days before the last Arab League summit in Sirte , Libya , the Saudi foreign minister , Saud al - Faisal , took a one - page Hamas document to Egypt , containing its latest proposal .
The document called for the creation of a Palestinian leadership representative of all factions , a high security council to reform the security forces of Gaza , and a committee to organise new elections .
Palestinians outside the occupied territories would also take part in the vote .
The Egyptians came back with three additions : that the new Palestinian unity government would recognise a two - state solution , the borders of 1967 and the Arab Peace Initiative .
Meshal said that these demands were tantamount to a recognition of Israel . ""
What Mahmoud Abbas is seeking is to restore his authority over Gaza and to draw Hamas into an electoral process in conditions in which it would lose .
Egypt 's position is a real obstacle , too .
It raises the question what is reconciliation for , to exclude Hamas , or to bring it into the process to participate ? ""
Nonetheless , Meshal said he would pursue negotiations , now being brokered by Libya .
He rejected the claim that Hamas was on the sidelines of efforts to find peace in the Middle East , refusing to lay out its vision of solution .
He said the Palestinians and Arabs were ready to accept a state within 1967 borders , with its capital in Jerusalem , and the return of its refugees , but that Israel was not prepared to pay the price . ""
After 17 years of negotiations , it has given nothing to those Palestinians who recognise it .
It just demands more concessions like security co - operation .
It is only when Israel is forced to make concessions that peace will come , but that will only happen when it is faced with a strong Palestinian partner .
So Hamas will continue to reserve the right to resistance until Israel returns to the ' 67 borders . """
2010-06-12,"A desperate Kyrgyzstan today asked Russia to send its army to the south of the country after another day of clashes in the city of Osh , where at least 65 people have been killed and 850 wounded in three days of ethnic rioting .
Kyrgyzstan 's interim leader , Rosa Otunbayeva , called on Russia 's president , Dmitry Medvedev , to intervene militarily .
Admitting that her government had lost control of the situation in the volatile south , she said outside forces were needed to restore order .
The Kremlin said it had no immediate plans to send troops , describing the riots as an internal conflict .
Any prospect of a large - scale Russian military intervention is likely to concern the White House , whose Manas airbase near Kyrgyzstan 's capital of Bishkek is a crucial supply post for US forces fighting in nearby Afghanistan .
Moscow has its own military airbase near Bishkek .
Russian officials said Moscow would consult its regional allies on Monday over what measures it might take .
They said Russia – which regards central Asia as its backyard and is keen to limit US influence in the region – would only act in conjunction with the United Nations .
Yesterday witnesses described scenes of horror and said thousands of terrified ethnic Uzbeks were fleeing to the nearby border with Uzbekistan .
An Associated Press reporter who visited the border witnessed people fleeing in panic and saw bodies of children who had been killed in the stampede .
Much of Osh , the country 's second biggest city , was today in flames – with Kyrgyz youths carrying out bloody pogroms against Uzbek residents , who are a large minority in the city .
Witnesses said Kyrgyz gangs armed with firearms , sticks and metal rods were roaming the streets , burning Uzbek homes and property .
The Uzbek cinema , supermarkets and several shops were destroyed .
Many residents were hiding in their cellars , food was running out and large parts of the city reported to be without gas and electricity .
The interim government has sent troops and armoured vehicles into the city , but they have failed to stop the rampages . ""
The sky above Osh is black .
The army is n't at all in control .
We do n't know what to do , "" one resident told Kyrgyzstan 's AKIpress news agency .
"" The authorities in Bishkek simply do n't know what 's going on here .
We 're not just talking about looting but total destruction .
By the time troops arrive there will be no one left to save . ""
"" It 's a real war , "" said Omurbek Suvanaliyev , a leader of the Ata - Zhurt political party that tried to organise local militia , "" Everything is burning , and bodies are lying on the streets , "" Reuters reported Suvanaliyev as saying .
He said the warring parties were using armored vehicles in their fighting .
Witnesses said the city 's bus station was wrecked , and that 30 Uzbeks were massacred and 70 injured in an overnight pogrom in Cheremushi district .
Motorists were daubing "" KG "" in red paint on their vehicles to show they were ethnic Kyrgyz , they said .
In contrast , Uzbeks were painting SOS outside their houses .
Passengers who flew in to Osh 's airport yesterday were trapped there as gunfire was exchanged at an Uzbek village near the airport 's ring road .
The disturbances are the most serious since April 's street revolution ousted Kyrgyzstan 's former leader Kurmanbek Bakiyev .
The president fled the country after his troops opened fire in Bishkek , killing at least 85 unarmed protesters .
He is now in Belarus .
His supporters in the south of the country seized several government buildings last month .
Analysts said the pro - Bakiyev counter - revolutionary movement in southern Kyrgyzstan had rapidly evolved into a ferocious ethnic conflict .
The region was the scene of inter - ethnic rioting in the 1990s during the breakup of the Soviet Union .
Some 1000 people were killed when Kyrgyzstan 's Uzbek minority tried to gain autonomy and join neighbouring Uzbekistan .
The fear now is that ethnic tensions might erupt across the region .
Lilit Gevorgyan , an expert with Global Insight , said the territorial dispute "" seems to be coming back to life again "" . ""
The Osh Uzbeks have found unlikely partners in ousted president Bakiyev 's Krygyz supporters who are happy to join forces with any group antagonistic towards the northern revolutionary government in the capital Bishkek . ""
The collapse of the Bakiyev regime had also ignited a fight between rival criminal gangs , Gevorgyan said , with one Uzbek mafia boss in Osh recently shot dead .
Opponents of the new government said it had failed to impose political stability , and was letting the country drift towards civil war .
"" We have our own resources .
We have our own armed forces .
We do n't need to ask the Russians to deal with the situation , "" Miroslav Niyasov , former head of the country 's security council , told the Observer . ""
Unfortunately our government is n't up to the job . ""
Otunbayeva – Kyrgyzstan 's former ambassador in London and a veteran English - speaking diplomat – telephoned Russia 's prime minister , Vladimir Putin , last night to discuss the crisis .
She admitted today : "" The situation in the Osh region has spun out of control .
Attempts to establish a dialogue have failed ...
We need outside forces to quell confrontation . ""
Russia dominates a security pact of several ex - Soviet nations that includes Kyrgyzstan .
Both its obligations under the Collective Security Treaty OrganiSation and its interests in the strategically placed central Asian nation suggest it will be open to Otunbayeva 's call for help ."
2010-06-23,"There are few greater honours in Silicon Valley than a personal gift from Steve Jobs of a yet - to - be - released iPhone 4 .
Or a crash course in micro - blogging from the founders of Twitter .
Technology chiefs in California prepared to lay out the red carpet today for a VIP guest in the shape of Russia 's president , Dmitry Medvedev .
Kicking off a US visit , Medvedev embarked on a tour of Silicon Valley in a search for tips on establishing a similar technological hub , dubbed an "" innograd "" , outside Moscow . ""
My purpose is not just to see what is going on there , "" said Medvedev at a reception in San Francisco hosted by California 's governor , Arnold Schwarzenegger .
"" I would like to have my visit be translated into full - fledged relations and into co - operation with those companies . ""
In addition to visiting Apple and Twitter , Medvedev 's itinerary includes meetings with top executives from Cisco and Google .
A Russian warship , the Varyag , docked in San Francisco in co - ordination with the trip .
Known to be a technology buff , Medvedev has made it a pet project to create a Russian version of Silicon Valley .
His administration has earmarked Skolkovo , a city southwest of the Russian capital , as the site of the proposed centre of innovation , earmarking $ 500 m ( Â£335 m ) of public investment for the next year alone .
Schwarzenegger , who described the Russian president 's visit as "" very , very beneficial "" for California , joked with Medvedev that he had fond memories of Moscow from filming a 1988 police movie , Red Heat , in the Russian capital .
The California governor pledged to put together a trade mission of technology experts to Moscow to help with the Skolkovo venture .
Medvedev 's delegation was due to meet Google 's chief executive , Eric Schmidt , today after the search engine boss agreed to join the board of Skolkovo .
But industry observers noted that the Russian president had no plans to meet one of his country 's most successful emigres , the billionaire co - founder of Google , Sergey Brin .
The Wall Street Journal noted that in a 2002 interview Brin had been scathing about the land of his ancestry , describing Russia as "" Nigeria with snow "" .
After his trip to Silicon Valley , Medvedev will move on to Washington to meet the US president , Barack Obama , before attending this weekend 's G20 international summit in Toronto .
Part of Medvedev 's economic strategy is build innovative industries to try to ease Russia off its financial dependence on oil ."
2010-06-23,"So much for an emergency hotline .
Next time Russian president Dmitry Medvedev wants to get in touch with his American counterpart , he has a new way to do it - if he can keep to 140 characters .
Medvedev , 44 , has become the latest world leader to begin tweeting , after a tour of Twitter 's San Francisco headquarters .
His visit was also the first time the microblogging site had been visited by a head of state . ""
Hello everyone , I 'm at Twitter and sending my first message , "" Medvedev said in his inaugural tweet .
The Russian president , who met Ev Williams and Biz Stone , the site 's co - founders , on his whistlestop tour , has registered two official Twitter accounts for the Kremlin - @kremlinrussia in Russian , and @kremlinrussia_e in English .
It was a busy day for the Russian president .
He also found time to try out video conferencing at Cisco Systems as part of a fact - finding visit to US technology hub Silicon Valley .
Medvedev was clearly impressed with the technology .
"" This is amazing , "" he said in English , surrounded by Cisco executives .
Medvedev has said Silicon Valley could be used as a possible model for Russia to follow . ""
This experience is not definitive , but it is quite interesting , "" he said before he left Russia .
The president has said he wants to build a high - tech hub outside Moscow , with tax breaks and special rules for investors . ""
He [ Medvedev ] is remarkably open .
I mean , business leaders go back and forth with him , "" said Cisco chief executive John Chambers .
"" It took me almost off guard . ""
Medvedev 's whirlwind itinerary also includes visits to meet Steve Jobs , the Apple chief executive , and Russian web search firm Yandex .
And if the White House and 10 Downing Street are not sufficient to fulfil Medvedev 's political Twitter - related desires , he will also be able to follow Israeli prime minister Binyamin Netanyahu and Hugo ChÃ¡vez , the Venezuelan president .
But Medvedev probably needs to widen his net if he 's to make the most of the Twitter experience : so far , he 's only following Barack Obama and the White House ."
2010-06-24,"President Dmitry Medvedev this week stepped up his campaign to convince the west that Russia is changing and can now be counted on as a reliable political and business partner .
But even as he toured California and talked of creating a Russian equivalent of Silicon Valley backed by foreign investment , the senior partner in Kremlin Inc , prime minister Vladimir Putin , was up to his old tricks .
While continuing to deny Russia uses its energy exports as a geopolitical weapon , Putin , a former two - term president , warned neighbouring Belarus that it could face a total shutdown in gas supplies unless it knuckled under . ""
Strictly speaking , Gazprom [ the state - controlled gas monopoly ] has the contract right to cut supplies by 85 % or more , "" Putin said ominously .
The row is ostensibly about Belarus 's unpaid debts .
But the context is Kremlin displeasure at Minsk 's decision to offer refuge to the deposed president of Kyrgyzstan , Kurmanbek Bakiyev , ousted in a Moscow - backed coup earlier this year .
Relations with the Belarus president , Alexander Lukashenko , have been further strained by other political and trade disputes .
The Russian action recalled similar rows with Ukraine that caused energy shortages across Europe .
Ukraine has since elected a more amenable government that recently agreed to extend the Russian Black Sea fleet 's lease on port facilities in Sevastopol .
As if by magic , Gazprom found itself able to lower gas prices for Kiev .
Undaunted by this contentious backdrop , Medvedev took his message of a modernising , reforming , dependable Russia to the White House today where he and Barack Obama were expected to discuss economic co - operation , including Russia 's long - delayed attempt to join the World Trade Organisation .
Medvedev is also due to meet David Cameron tomorrow at the G8 summit in Canada .
But Obama and Cameron face a similar dilemma .
The US has tried to "" reset "" relations with Moscow since George Bush left office , successfully cutting deals on the reduction of nuclear weapons and Iran sanctions .
Yet it remains concerned about authoritarian trends within Russia , its weak legal and judicial systems , and strategic issues such as the Putin government 's uncompromising stance towards Georgia and other former Soviet republics within its "" sphere of influence "" .
Recent moves to drastically enhance the surveillance powers of the FSB , attempts to block distribution of a book about Putin authored by opposition politician Boris Nemtsov , the highly politicised trial of former tycoon Mikhail Khodorkovsky , and the failure to solve more than a dozen murder cases involving human rights advocates and investigative journalists such as Anna Politkovskaya all appear at odds with Medvedev 's vision of a transformed , go - ahead Russia .
Speaking last week , Mikhail Gorbachev , the reformist former Soviet leader , said Russia was still only half way through the transition from communist monolith to modern state . ""
Modernisation can be carried out but only if the people , the entire population , are included in the whole process
â€
¦
We need democracy , we need improvement of the electoral system and so on .
Without that , it will not succeed , "" he said .
British officials say Cameron is hoping for a "" substantive "" meeting with Medvedev , while the Russian ambassador to London suggested this week a fresh page could be opened in bilateral relations .
But a sudden , new dawn is not in prospect after the dark chill of recent years .
Britain shares many of Washington 's concerns and has some of its own , notably Russia 's continuing refusal to extradite Andrei Lugovoi , a former KGB officer sought in connection with the 2006 murder in London of another ex - spy , Alexander Litvinenko .
All the same , both Obama and Cameron are likely to encourage Medvedev 's modernisation campaign , hoping perhaps to strengthen his hand in what may become a power struggle with Putin ahead of the 2012 presidential election .
Putin has so far refused to say whether he will stand for president again .
Working in Medvedev 's favour is the apparently growing realisation that a more diversified economy , less state control , and more private sector businesses are essential for the country 's long - term health .
Russia 's economy contracted last year by a huge 7.9 % , following worldwide falls in commodity prices , boosting Medvedev 's argument that it is too reliant on energy exports .
Medvedev 's ability to influence the way Putin runs the country is clearly limited .
Critics say he has changed little so far .
But he may be gaining in confidence .
Earlier this month , he called for a 20 % cut in the state bureaucracy to reduce costs and curb corruption .
He has championed judicial and civic reforms .
And speaking in St Petersburg last week , he said tax cuts and further economic liberalisation measures were on the way .
"" Creating a comfortable environment for investors , in essence , is our greatest challenge , "" he said .
"" We have changed .
We are really modernising Russia . """
2010-06-24,"America 's highest - ranking military officer confessed he was "" nearly sick "" when he saw General Stanley McChrystal 's controversial comments in a Rolling Stone article , as President Obama vowed the US effort in Afghanistan would "" not miss a beat "" after McChrystal 's removal as US commander . ""
What we saw yesterday was a change in personal , not a change in policy , "" Obama said at a press conference after his meeting with Russia 's president Dmitry Medvedev .
On Wednesday McChrystal was summoned to Washington to explain the remarks he and his aides had made that appeared in Rolling Stone .
McChrystal 's offer to resign was accepted by Obama , who announced that General David Petraeus would replace McChrystal as commander of the International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan .
At a press conference at the Pentagon , Admiral Michael Mullen , the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff and the highest ranking member of the US military , described how he was shocked to read the disparaging remarks by McChrystal , who he described as a friend .
"" I was nearly sick , "" Mullen said .
"" Literally , physically , I could n't believe it ...
I was stunned . ""
Mullen and Gates made it plain they supported Obama 's decision to remove McChrystal , saying they supported the president 's action .
Mullen said McChrystal bore responsibility not only for his own remarks but also for those of his staff quoted in the article : "" He has just as much responsibility for what his people said as for what he said .
"" "" It was clear that , in its totality , it challenged civilian control , which is a fundamental principle for us that is not challengeable .
It was n't , it is n't , and it wo n't be in the future , "" Mullen said .
Earlier , Mullen had said : "" We do not have the right to cast doubt on the ability or mock the motives of our civilian leaders , elected or appointed , "" adding : "" If we lose their trust and confidence for any reason , it is time to go . ""
But Mullen took some responsibility for the demise of McChrystal .
"" I was proud one year ago to support him for the position , "" Mullen said .
"" But I can not excuse his lack of judgment in the Rolling Stone article or a command climate he was evidently responsible for . ""
Asked if the McChrystal saga reflected poor management within the Pentagon , Mullen said : "" I strongly recommended General McChrystal to the secretary of defence and the president to assume this command .
Certainly , from my vantage point I feel some responsibility here .
That said , General McChrystal has been given guidence from here , from Central Command , that was clear .
I have expectations that a general with four stars would follow the guidance .
He really made a significant error of judgment and the President rightly so relieved him for that . ""
Mullen said he will soon be traveling to Afghanistan and Pakistan .
"" My message will be clear : nothing changes about our mission there . ""
Gates said : "" I fully support President Obama 's decision to accept General McChrystal 's resignation . ""
He damningly describing McChrystal 's comments as "" contemptible "" and "" unacceptable "" : "" They were inconsistent with the high standard expected of military leaders . ""
Later , Obama denied there was any contradiction between the White House 's stated aim of withdrawing US troops from Afghanistan from mid-2011 , and comments by others , including Gates , that suggested otherwise .
"" We did not say ... suddenly there would be no troops , "" Obama said , adding that the US will not be "" switching off the lights and closing the door behind us "" next year .
Gates and Mullen described their meeting with McChrystal on Wednesday morning , saying that the disgraced general did n't go into any detailed discussion of his remarks . ""
He really , in the meeting , did n't try to explain it .
He just acknowledged he 'd made a terrible decision , "" said Gates .
"" I have spoken with General McChrystal many times since the article hit the streets , but it really is in the category of someone who feels he made a grievous mistake . """
2010-06-29,"It was the trip that had everything : a tour of Silicon valley , a friendly chat and a cheeseburger with Barack Obama , and even a fancy new iPad .
But three days after leaving the US on his most successful foreign tour to date , Russia 's president , Dmitry Medvedev , was this morning facing a major headache : how to respond to the arrest of 11 alleged Russian spies working deep undercover in the United States ?
Yesterday , the FBI claimed to have broken up one of the largest and best concealed spy rings of recent years .
It has arrested 11 people who allegedly spent years adopting American identities and gathering intelligence for Russia .
It 's unclear whether the material collected by the spy ring posed a danger to the secret workings of the US state or – as seems more probable – was merely an amateurish cut - and - paste job designed to fool Moscow .
The Kremlin 's initially subdued response has become gradually more vehement : Russia 's foreign ministry dismissed the allegations as groundless and unseemly .
Sergei Lavrov , Russia 's veteran foreign minister , hinted that the arrests may be part of an internal US plot to undermine US - Russian relations .
"" They have not explained anything to us .
I hope they will do so .
The moment when all this was done was chosen quite smartly , "" Lavrov observed , with his trademark sarcasm .
Plot or no plot , Medvedev now has to weigh up whether he is willing to jeopardise the new and genuine rapprochement he has built up over the past year with the Obama administration .
Relations between Washington and Moscow have improved significantly since the dark semi - cold war days of the Bush era , with both leaders having invested heavily in their personal friendship .
And there have been results : a new , if modest , Start treaty on nuclear arms reduction , and a deal on civilian nuclear co - operation .
The US has backed Russia 's long - delayed application for the World Trade Organisation ; Russia has taken a tougher line on Iran .
Hardliners on both sides will welcome the scandal as an opportunity to sabotage improving US - Russian ties – and to put the boot into Obama and Medvedev .
Russia intimated it believes Obama 's enemies are behind the arrests .
"" I do n't think this is a very big scandal , "" said Fyodor Lukyanov , editor - in - chief of Russia in Global Affairs .
"" The main concern is that it will give ammunition to US politicians in the Senate who are against ratification of the Start treaty and the one - on - one agreement on nuclear co - operation . ""
Sam Greene , deputy director of Moscow 's Carnegie Centre , said : "" They [ the Russians ] are going to have to make a calculation .
"" It would be unthinkable for Moscow not to respond , Greene said , but it was unclear what form this might take .
None of the alleged Russian spies were diplomats or consular officials – making a classic tit - for - tat expulsion unlikely .
Russia might claim to have uncovered a spy ring of its own , possibly made up of Russian citizens working for US companies .
Or it could target Americans .
The timing of the arrests , following Medvedev 's US trip was blatantly unfortunate , Greene said .
Either way , the FBI arrests appear to be further evidence of the explosion in Russian intelligence activity abroad over the past 10 years .
Since Vladimir Putin became president in 2000 , western governments have reported a dramatic increase in spying activity by Moscow – in Europe , the US , Africa , and Latin America .
Putin , a former KGB agent in east Germany , tripled the budget for the FSB , the KGB 's domestic successor , which he led until 1999 .
Former intelligence officers now make up a huge proportion of Russia 's ruling elite .
The US department of justice has so far not revealed when the alleged spy ring began its activities – which , potentially , may pre - date the Putin era .
But it is clear they were in position before Obama became president .
Despite the recent thaw in relations , the US and Russia continued to spy on each other , said Mark Urnov , dean at the political science department of Russia 's Higher School of Economics .
"" This [ spy scandal ] is an issue dating from previous years , "" he said .
"" The security services ca n't stop their activities immediately .
Until recently , there was a semi - cold war between US and Russia .
So why not spy ? ""
According to Urnov , Moscow was unlikely to drop its positive attitude to Washington . ""
Of course there are some groups inside the [ Russian ] political elite who would prefer to continue with more or less cold relations .
But the dominant tendency now is to be friendly .
"" I do n't see any forces on both sides who could be interested in intensifying this scandal , or in stirring up aggravation now between our countries . """
2010-06-29,"Three days after sharing a cheeseburger with Barack Obama , and an iPhone 4 with Steve Jobs ( an hour before the model went on sale in US stores ) , it is back to business as usual for Dmitry Medvedev , the man who presents himself as Russia 's moderniser but struggles to convince .
Moscow 's reaction to a 55-page indictment facing 11 alleged Russian spies , who are said to have been working under deep cover , was to accuse America of resorting to the tactics of the cold war .
But the indictment could not have made comfortable reading for anyone in Moscow who prides themselves on guarding the secrets of the nation .
In it , Russia 's external intelligence service , the SVR , appears to show a professional ineptitude worthy of Inspector Clouseau .
Peter Sellers could not have done better .
The computers through which intelligence whizzed from one agent to the van waiting outside did not work .
The advice given to one agent to "" build up , little by little , relations "" with a New York financier with powerful political connections is laughable .
Their intelligence , computer passwords , emails , encrypted codes , mobile phone calls and even their embarrassing doubts over houses and expenses – all became an open book to the FBI .
The accused have not been charged with espionage , but with conspiracy to act as unregistered agents of a foreign government .
What could be more humiliating than spies who spill the beans before they could even get going ?
The British secret service should be the last to crow .
It has been caught with its fingers in the till in 1994,1996 and 2006 –
the last occasion when one of its agents was filmed ducking into the bushes to touch a rock containing a transmitter .
British recruitment drives for Russian agents have had devastating consequences for their targets , not least when a junior diplomat with mental health problems was used to spy on his father .
Every country is at it .
The larger question is whether these attempts to penetrate political and military secrets are not , in the long run , self - defeating .
Typically spies make hay while the sun shines .
The Soviet Union placed some of its highest - level spies in the British establishment in the 1930s when it was awash with sympathy with communism .
We did it to Russia in the 1990s when anything that was not screwed down in Russia could be bought and towed away to the west .
The ease with which western intelligence operated in Russia in the 1990s was one of the reasons , although not the only one , for Vladimir Putin 's decision to reconstitute the FSB as an instrument of control at home and to increase spying activity abroad .
The tragedy is that neither the liberalism and then collapse of Boris Yeltsin 's corrupt regime nor its polar opposite , the "" managed democracy "" under Putin , answers the underlying question that the nation faces : how to modernise without losing control ?
Is it doomed by fate , history and weather to be authoritarian ?
Can any institution be allowed to work independently of a self - perpetuating clique in the Kremlin ?
For a moderniser like Medvedev , who talks about corruption and lawlessness but fails to do anything about either , the spy affair is especially troubling .
Not because it might affect bilateral relations with Washington .
It will not : the reset button has produced tangible benefits for both sides .
It started with missile defence , a new Start treaty and a tougher Russian attitude to Iran .
But it is continuing in all sorts of ways , from the US backing Russia 's application to join the WTO to the idea that American companies , like Cisco , should spearhead Medvedev 's pet project of setting up a Silicon Valley outside Moscow .
The atmosphere has warmed and it is in neither Obama 's nor Medvedev 's interests for it to freeze up again in a state of "" cold peace "" .
No , the spy affair reminds all sides just how far there is to go before relations between Russia and the west become normal ."
2010-07-07,"Hillary Clinton has spent the last few days trying to show that Barack Obama 's administration can walk a tightrope and balance its foreign policy goals and democracy , where George W Bush ultimately fell flat on his face .
The US secretary of state 's trip to Ukraine , Poland , Azerbaijan , Armenia and Georgia – soon after President Dmitry Medvedev 's visit to Washington – is designed to reassure their governments of American support , and also answer criticism that Washington is ignoring democracy and human rights in its pursuit of a strategic understanding with Russia .
Yet just how reconcilable these goals are remains to be seen .
At the weekend , Clinton was the star attraction in Krakow , where international dignitaries and NGOs gathered and tried to breathe new life into the Community of Democracies ( CoD ) , a little - known international body marking its tenth anniversary .
It describes itself as "" an intergovernmental coalition of countries , operating on a global scale , with aim to promote the rules of democracy and to strengthen the democratic norms of institutions throughout the world "" .
Considering its almost non - existent achievements set against its ambitious mission , the CoD has lived in deserved obscurity since its launch in 2000 , the brainchild of then secretary of state Madeleine Albright and Polish foreign minister Bronislaw Geremek .
It was virtually stillborn , a late Clinton - era US initiative that found little purchase from America 's allies among the world 's largest democracies .
The Bush administration 's attitude also accounts for much of the CoD 's lack of progress .
For eight years , it veered between neglect and the temptation to enrol the CoD in support of Bush 's "" freedom agenda "" .
Clinton 's attendance in Krakow , the highest level US presence at a CoD ministerial meeting since Condoleezza Rice went to Santiago in 2005 , is noteworthy in itself .
So too is her speech that focused on the protection of civil society from authoritarian governments for what it reveals about the Obama administration 's thinking on democracy promotion .
"" We must be wary of the steel vice in which many governments around the world are slowly crushing civil society , "" Clinton said .
Thus continues the effort to redefine American democracy promotion away from the Bush legacy .
Talk of regime change and electoral revolutions remains firmly banished , replaced by governance for development , grassroots NGO support , freedom of the media , and the rights of women and girls . ""
Broad - based prosperity "" is one catchphrase gaining currency as summation of the Clinton approach .
Clinton 's words , echoed in her remarks in Ukraine , Azerbaijan and Armenia , show that the United States still very much sees itself as being in the democracy promotion business – but it wants to be seen as practicing a soft version in contrast to Bush 's hard kind .
Clinton has also reinforced the impression that Obama and his advisers do not really view democratisation as a primary driver of international politics , with the democratic status of countries no barrier to their usefulness to US foreign policy .
This is hardly news to friends and critics of America , but it is interesting that the Obama administration has little time for the usual pretence to the contrary .
Talking up soft democracy promotion may therefore also be designed to help Washington counter accusations of hypocrisy in its dealings with less - than - democratic governments .
The approach on offer can be summarised as "" Deal with the governments on pressing issues , deal with civil society on democracy "" .
As Obama told the Russian media recently , "" The best way to advance these common values [ of human rights and democracy ] is through engagement , specifically dual track engagement – interaction with the Russian government and with Russian society . ""
In this calculation , democracy does not get in the way of engagement on vital US goals while engagement can be said to assist democracy .
Like cats always landing on their feet , when it comes to the question of democracy in foreign policy , American leaders have a long history of arguing that they have produced a "" win - win "" policy that can fulfil all their ambitions in one go .
How realistic is this ?
Can Obama and Clinton do better than their predecessors and walk this tightrope without jettisoning democracy and human rights when they clash with important foreign policy goals , as they usually do ?
This is always difficult in relations with a major power such as Russia , but also even with the likes of Ukraine ( which Washington would not want to drift too far into Moscow 's orbit under President Viktor Yanukovych ) or Azerbaijan ( which is needed for US military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan ) .
Witness , therefore , Clinton 's diplomatic reticence when questioned about Azerbaijan 's notoriously poor democratic record at a press conference in Baku .
Witness also the relatively muted US reaction to recent events in Kyrgyzstan , which despite the lease of the air base at Manas is not a vital country for US foreign policy .
Or compare Clinton 's announcement in Krakow that the United States would sponsor with $ 2 m the launch of a new fund to support NGOs around the world with , for example , the $ 60 m paid in annual rent to the government of Kyrgyzstan for the Manas air base .
Walking that tightrope while balancing foreign policy and democracy is still not as easy at is made out to be in Washington ."
2010-07-08,"It 's been a rocky road for US - Russian relations over the past few weeks .
The light - hearted images of Presidents Barack Obama and Dmitry Medvedev chomping on cheeseburgers in Washington brought some hope of a new era of reconciliation .
Yet the arrest of 10 alleged Russian spies in the US only days later and the US secretary of state 's tour of eastern Europe and the South Caucasus have done more than enough to question whether relations have truly been "" re - set "" .
Arms control was one of the most controversial issues raised throughout Hillary Clinton 's recent five - day tour of the Ukraine , Poland , Azerbaijan , Armenia and Georgia .
Last April , as a sign towards improved US - Russian relations , Obama and Medvedev signed an arms control treaty that would see both countries cut their nuclear arsenals by a third by 2017 .
However , Russia said then that it was prepared to withdraw from the treaty if the US increased its missile defence system in any way – even to counteract a potential threat from Iran – that would pose a direct threat to Russia 's strategic nuclear forces .
It is certain that the missile - shield pact that Clinton signed with Poland during her visit will not sit well with the Kremlin .
Despite her protestations that the move is not a direct attack on Russia , it will certainly make Russia less willing to collaborate with the US on this issue .
During her visit to Poland , Clinton also broached the idea of exploiting the country 's shale gas supplies , thus reopening the gaping wound that is Europe 's ongoing energy power struggle .
According to the Baker Institute , American moves to expand and develop shale production in Europe would "" strengthen the hand of European consumers in dealing with Russia "" and thus pose a threat to Gazprom 's monopoly , forcing it to make concessions and co - operate with other countries .
Few will see these developments as a bad thing given Russia 's recent track record , which has seen numerous power struggles over gas supply and overdue payments with the Ukraine , Belarus and other Baltic states paralysing supplies as far west as Poland and Germany .
Yet it also ruins any previous Russian notion of brokering a gas deal with Poland .
Clinton 's pitstop in Azerbaijan also highlighted the geopolitical tensions over energy disputes in the region and American interest in curtailing Russia 's overriding control in the sector .
The Nabucco pipeline project , which aims to diversify gas suppliers across Europe and thus mitigate Russia 's supply monopoly , will provide energy to the EU from the Caspian region and the Middle East .
Azerbaijan lies crucially along this line and Nabucco has been seen as a key threat to the Russian - sponsored South Stream gas pipeline .
Although a deal signed between Russia and Austria earlier this year will see Gazprom work in tandem with Nabucco 's developers –
Austrian energy supplier OMV and Italian energy company
ENI –
the ongoing tensions between the two pipeline projects will surely be exacerbated if the US is seen to be having talks with Azerbaijan .
Russia is resolute in stopping the Nabucco project going ahead in an effort to maintain its dominance , particularly after its gas flow "" stranglehold "" in the region was broken earlier this year following separate gas deals between the EU and Turkey , and China and Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan , respectively .
The US secretary of state 's visit to the Ukraine and Georgia will also worry the Kremlin .
Russia enjoys a certain element of control over Ukraine , particularly in the energy sector .
However , following the election of the pro - Russia president Viktor Yanukovych in February , and his subsequent decision to drop the Ukraine 's bid to join Nato , the US has actively sought to consolidate ties between the two countries under the US - Ukraine strategic partnership .
Clinton also made the position of the Obama administration on the Russo - Georgian conflict very clear : she criticised Russia 's military presence in the country , but hastened to add as an afterthought that Georgia should not "" provoke "" Russia .
Her comments on "" occupation "" also upset the renegade regions of South Ossetia and Abkhazia , who deny Russian occupation .
The timing of Medvedev 's visit , the "" spy ring "" arrests and Clinton 's tour could n't have been more telling about the veracity of US - Russian relations .
Russia 's bid to join the WTO still seems a long way away but the US should be warned , as history has shown that the bear , when threatened , will only fight back harder ."
2010-07-29,"Russian citizens can be issued official warnings about crimes that they have not yet committed under powers granted to the security services today .
President Dmitry Medvedev signed off on a new law giving the FSB , the successor agency to the KGB , the right to caution people suspected of preparing acts of extremism , or to jail them for obstructing the agency 's work .
The powers appear similar to those enjoyed by Precrime , the police unit in the 2002 Hollywood film Minority Report .
"" This is a draconian law reminiscent of our repressive past , "" said Boris Nemtsov , a leader of the Solidarity opposition movement .
Rights activists had hoped Medvedev would rein in the security services , after his predecessor , Vladimir Putin , a former KGB colonel , stuffed his administration with hawkish veterans .
The Kremlin 's tough stance comes against the backdrop of a disparate but emergent civil movement protesting against corruption and authoritarian government .
Under the new provisions , the FSB will be able to echo Soviet practices .
The punishment for ignoring a warning was unclear , but 15-day jail sentences are envisaged for "" obstructing an FSB officer 's duties "" .
Sergei Ivanenko , a leader of the Yabloko party , called it "" the law of a police state "" .
He said : "" If such a law exists in a democratic country then it is limited by a very powerful system of civil , public and parliamentary control .
In our conditions it will mean absolute power for the security services . ""
Rights activists , who fear the measures could be used to stifle civil disobedience , had expressed optimism that Medvedev might step in to quash the legislation .
There have been signs of democratisation under Medvedev , while Putin , whom he replaced two years ago , has continued to promote a hardline image from his post as prime minister .
But during a meeting with Germany 's chancellor , Angela Merkel , a fortnight ago , Medvedev said : "" Each country has the right to perfect its own legislation , including that which affects its special services . ""
He added : "" What 's going on now –
I would like you to know this
– was done according to my own direct instructions .
"" Russia 's police and security services have looked increasingly clumsy as they try to deal with inventive grassroots activists or single - issue protest groups .
One group wears blue buckets on their heads in mimicry of the flashing blue lights on the cars of bureaucrats who terrorise the roads : police arrested several activists but had to let them go because they had committed no crime .
Another organisation has been attacked while trying to stop destruction of a protected forest near Moscow . ""
Medvedev may smile more than Putin but the face of power has n't changed , "" said Eduard Limonov , an opposition politician who plans to run for president in 2012 .
"" The Kremlin is still terrified there will be an Orange Revolution in Russia if people are allowed to gather on the streets . ""
This Saturday will be the first anniversary of protests started by Limonov and a coalition of activists known as Strategy 31 .
They meet in Triumfalnaya Square in Moscow at 6 pm every 31st of the month to demonstrate in favour of Article 31 of the constitution : the right to free assembly .
Despite each rally being broken up by riot police , the protests have grown steadily , attracting more than 500 people in May.
About 180 of them were arrested . ""
Instead of thinking of new ways to suppress us , the authorities should listen to our concerns , "" said Limonov .
Yet democracy activists are often demonised as traitors or extremists in the state - dominated media .
This week at its summer camp the Kremlin - backed Nashi youth movement put up a photograph of 83-year - old Lyudmila Alekseyeva , one of the organisers of Strategy 31 , on a dummy wearing Nazi insignia .
On Saturday she will go to Triumfalnaya .
The protest movement , she said , "" will only grow in the face of repression . """
2010-08-07,"What 's black , squidgy and exhausting to walk on ?
The answer is peat , the gunk that gives malt whisky its smoky taste and burns sweetly when it 's dried out .
Dmitry Medvedev is busy just now , having cut short his holiday to deal with Russia 's terrifying forest fires , but when he 's done the president should think about his country 's peat for a while .
Why ?
Because alongside dozens of forest fires , there are another 56 peat fires , many of them around Moscow , threatening Russia 's most densely populated areas .
Thanks to extraction and drainage , peat bogs in central Russia have over recent decades dried out , becoming a tinder - box threatening destruction and appalling air pollution .
And while winter rains will douse forests , peat fires can burn underground , all winter long .
Not surprisingly , Russian officials are already looking at ways to make their peat wet again , like the project run successfully by Wetlands International in a national park in Moscow 's neighbouring Vladimir region .
It 's a lot cheaper than sending in the fire brigade .
Fixing Russia 's peat bogs will do us all a favour because even when it is n't burning , dried - out peat is a disaster .
Clearing , draining and setting fire to peatlands for forestry and agriculture releases more than 3bn tons of carbon dioxide each year , equivalent to a gigantic 7 % of global emissions from all fossil fuels .
There 's more carbon locked away in the world 's bogs and mires than in all the trees put together .
Yet somehow peat remains the global environment 's Cinderella .
It has n't caught the public 's imagination in the same way rainforests have .
In some countries with peat bogs there is n't even a word for the stuff .
This has got to change .
Environment correspondents often say coal is the worst fossil fuel for releasing carbon into the atmosphere .
Technically that 's true , because neither the European Union or the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) recognise peat as being a fossil fuel , even though under the right conditions it will turn into lignite .
In a cynical act of sophistry , Finland , one of a handful of countries that burns the stuff to generate electricity , calls peat "" a slowly renewing biomass fuel "" .
It sure is .
A peat bog can take anywhere from a thousand to 5,000 years to regrow .
And in the meantime , burning a ton of peat releases more CO2 into the atmosphere than a ton of coal .
Even more insane is draining tropical peatlands in southeast Asia to grow palm oil to turn into biofuel .
Studies show this costs more carbon than it saves .
Thankfully , the EU and the IPCC have finally woken up to this scandal , but both Indonesia and Malaysia plan to double their palm oil production , most of it on drained peatlands .
Aside from carbon capture and reduced fire risk , healthy peat bogs are great for biodiversity and absorb lots of water , reducing the threat of flooding downstream in heavy rainfall .
My hometown of Sheffield suffered badly from floods in 2007 , part of the reason
there 's so much focus on restoring peat moors in the Peak District through the Moors for the Future project .
Far from destroying what was once seen as wasteland , restoring damaged peat bogs offers an easy win in the fight against climate change .
Wetlands International has funded the blocking of drainage canals in Indonesia , restoring water levels and reducing fire risk .
Average costs of â‚¬1 a ton of CO2 make their approach far cheaper than carbon credit schemes .
That 's something for President Medvedev to think about as Russia faces up to the appalling cost of this summer 's fires .

2010-08-13,"A Russian arms control researcher who was sent to Britain as part of the "" spy swap "" for a team of sleeper agents who were exposed in the United States said today that he yearned to go home .
Igor Sutyagin , who spent 11 years behind bars for allegedly passing military secrets to the CIA , has been living in London since he and three other men jailed for treason were swapped for Anna Chapman and nine other Russian agents at an airport in Vienna in July .
He was pardoned by President Dmitry Medvedev but remains a hate figure for ultra - nationalists and security service veterans in the Russian government .
Speaking to Ekho Moskvy radio station , Sutyagin said he intended to return to his wife and two daughters in Obninsk near Moscow , although he feared arbitrary punishment .
"" I 'm not happy here , "" he said .
"" I 'm without my family , I 'm not in my country , not on my own earth .
As soon as everything becomes clear , I will try to return [ to Russia ] .
I need to find work , to feed my family .
You ca n't just sit around .
I need to get going . ""
But he added : "" It 's unlikely I 'll be accused of state treason again , but there are 270 other articles of the criminal code .
And for a lot of them you can get a pretty long sentence . ""
Sutyagin , who worked at the prestigious USA and Canada Institute in Moscow , has always insisted on his innocence .
He was arrested by the federal security service ( FSB ) in 1999 and accused of passing secrets on atomic submarines and nuclear missile deployment to a British security risks consultancy , Alternative Futures , which was allegedly a front for the CIA .
While he admitted meeting representatives of the consultancy in Birmingham , London and several European capitals , Sutyagin claimed his reports were compiled from open sources such as the military newspaper Red Star .
After he was found guilty and later sent to a subarctic prison camp , his wife , Irina , and his parents , Vyacheslav and Svetlana , campaigned to get him released .
Vyacheslav Sutyagin said last month that his son would stay in London while he gained his bearings , and hoped to look for work .
But in a plaintive statement issued via his brother late last month , Sutyagin wrote : "" I plan to finally return to Obninsk and fix the by - now completely rickety porch of our little house beyond the Protva river . ""
It seems certain Sutyagin will face animosity if he goes back .
Commenting on the spy swap last month , Russia 's prime minister , Vladimir Putin , said : "" It always ends badly for traitors : as a rule , their end comes from drink or drugs , lying in the gutter . ""
But Sutyagin , who is staying with friends in London , said : "" I have n't asked for political asylum here , that would suggest I am running away .
And I do n't want to run away from my own country . """
2010-08-16,"The Russian president , Dmitry Medvedev , has ordered an immediate inquiry into the potential destruction of the world 's oldest seed bank following a court case and a Twitter campaign by Guardian readers and others .
The fate of the station appeared to be sealed last week when a court ruled in favour of the Pavlovsk research station and its surrounding farmland being turned into private housing .
It holds the world 's largest fruit collections and was protected by 12 Russian scientists during the second world war who chose to starve to death rather than eat the unique collection of seeds and plants which they were guarding during the 900-day siege of Leningrad .
More than 90 % of the plants are found in no other research collection or seed bank .
Its seeds and berries are thought to posess traits that could be crucial to maintaining productive fruit harvests in many parts of the world as climate change and a rising tide of disease , pests and drought weaken the varieties farmers now grow .
At stake , say campaigners for the station , are more than 5,000 varieties of seeds and berries from dozens of countries , including more than 100 varieties each of gooseberries and raspberries .
As it is predominantly a field collection , Pavlovsk can not be moved .
Experts estimate that even if another site were available nearby , it would take many years to relocate the plants .
The court ruling was instantly appealed , giving the station one month before development plans for a housing estate that would destroy the station can move forward .
This judgment means the order can only be revoked through a direct command of the president or prime minister , Vladimir Putin .
The Civic Chamber , a Russian state institution with a remit to monitor parliament and the government , then sent a telegram to Medvedev to request a formal appeal to protect the collection .
And numerous supporters of the research station have made their feelings felt on Twitter ( using the # pavlovsk hashtag ) .
On Friday , following a week of lobbying Medvedev tweeted back : "" Received the Civic Chamber 's appeal over the Pavlov Experimental Station .
Gave the instruction for this issue to be scrutinised . ""
The campaign may have already achieved more than the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation which last year appealed unsuccessfully to the Russian government to include Pavlovsk in the global network of gene banks .
However , the ongoing heatwave is thought to have also put pressure on the government .
Russian agricultural minister , Elena Borisovna Skrynnik , had fought for the station to be saved on the grounds that its heritage was crucial for food security as climate change grew more serious .
Much of the Russian wheat harvest has been destroyed in the last month by the heatwave , which has been linked to climate change .
Yesterday , the Crop Diversity Trust , which has been leading western attempts to save the station , urged people to continue to petition the Russian authorities .
A statement on the trust 's website said : "" Over the next four weeks , we will continue our fight to save Pavlovsk , and we need your help .
We need to persuade the political authorities of the importance of the irreplaceable crop diversity growing at Pavlovsk station , and request that the judgment be revoked . """
2010-08-18,"Ivan the Terrible ramped up its production , Mikhail Gorbachev banned it and Boris Yeltsin wandered the streets of Washington in his underpants after consuming too much of it .
Now President Dmitry Medvedev has become the latest leader to step on to the floor in Russia 's eternal and deadly dance with vodka .
City authorities in Moscow have announced a ban on the sale of spirits between 10 pm and 10 am , in the most recent of a series of measures designed to break the country 's drinking habit .
The average Russian drinks a litre and a half of pure alcohol every month , a habit that kills half a million people a year and is a major factor in population decline .
An estimated 51 % of production is on the black market , with factories running illegal night shifts and huge supplies of moonshine called samogon distilled in villages , where it acts as a second currency .
Medvedev announced a war on alcohol last summer saying he was shocked by the "" colossal "" level of consumption .
He ordered the government to draw up measures to discourage excessive drinking and cut off supplies of bootleg liquor .
Russia has since increased excise on beer , raised the minimum price of a bottle of vodka to 89 roubles ( Â£1.87 ) and announced plans to cut sales at kiosks .
Legal changes to make it a criminal rather than an administrative offence to sell alcohol to minors are also in the pipeline and last month police began enforcing a zero drink - drive limit .
Shops and other outlets in Moscow had been banned from selling alcohol over 15 % in strength between 11 pm and 8 am but a legal loophole allowed them to acquire permission for 24-hour sales from district authorities .
Establishments serving food are not affected .
"" We can only welcome this law , "" said Yevgeny Bryun , the ministry of health 's chief specialist on alcohol and drug addiction .
Bryun admitted that hardened drinkers could still down vodka during the day and "" catch up "" late at night by purchasing beer , "" but overall the alcohol burden will be lower "" .
Martin McKee of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine , who has studied alcohol trends in Russia , said : "" It will depend on enforcement but this is a good thing . ""
The experience of the Nordic countries shows us that any measure which makes it difficult to access alcohol has a positive effect . ""
However , he added : "" What is most effective is higher excise taxes and limiting the number of outlets selling alcohol . ""
Alcohol was prohibited in the Russian empire between 1914 and 1917 but reintroduced by the Bolsheviks when they realised its earning power .
In the 1980s Gorbachev also banned booze , tearing up huge vineyards in Crimea and other southern climes of the Soviet Union .
Mortality rates dropped as a result but there was a spurt in use of dangerous "" surrogate "" alcohols such as aftershave , boot polish and window cleaner .
Vodka â€ “
both legal and illegal â€ “ remains the chief killer in Russia , where it accounts for up to 70 % of consumption , despite the rising popularity of beer and mixed drinks such as gin and tonic in cans .
Alkashi â€ “ alcoholics
â€ “ are still a common sight on Moscow streets .
A collection of wild - eyed and grubby men sprawled at one notorious hangout outside the entrance to Belorusskaya railway station is a common sight .
"" Vodka 's got more expensive so sometimes we chip in to share a bottle , "" said one of the group , echoing a practice in Soviet times , when three men would contribute a rouble each to buy half a litre .
Andrey Demin , a public health expert who drew up a recent report on alcohol abuse , said future measures would face stiff opposition in parliament .
"" The alcohol lobby and foreign producers in Russia are so strong and ruthless , "" he said .
Demin said higher prices , tougher legislation and stricter control on production and distribution were the only solutions . ""
Otherwise this extermination by alcohol will continue . """
2010-08-26,"It had seemed like a relationship that was destined to be long and even meaningful , but now it appears to have gone wrong very quickly .
Against a balmy Black Sea backdrop , U2 's frontman , Bono , and Russia 's president , Dmitry Medvedev , had swapped views on poverty , ecology and music on Tuesday .
Bono even made fun of Medvedev 's devotion to Deep Purple .
"" I come here to cross the great divide between me , a Led Zeppelin fan and you , the Deep Purple fan , "" Bono joked , strolling next to Russia 's leader at his summer residence .
A day later , U2 's first concert in Russia ended in political controversy .
The Moscow authorities took a dim view when activists from Amnesty and Greenpeace put up tents at the concert venue and invited fans to sign petitions .
Officials detained five Amnesty volunteers hours before the show started and ordered others to remove their Amnesty T - shirts and to tear down their headquarters .
"" We were collecting signatures to support prisoners of conscience and to call on the [ Russian ] authorities to investigate the murders of Anna Politkovskaya and Natasha Estemirova , "" Sergei Nikitin , the director of Amnesty Russia , said today .
"" We 'd been doing this for about three hours .
At 5 pm the riot police turned up .
They told us we were holding an unlicensed picket , and took away all our placards .
We were also strongly recommended to strip off our T - shirts . ""
The Kremlin 's heavy - handed tactics provoked howls of outrage from Moscow 's liberals , who pointed out this was the first time a country had prevented U2 's partner organisations on its 360 Degree tour from taking part in a concert .
The activists had been due to join Bono , a longtime Amnesty supporter , on stage during Walk On , dedicated to the jailed Burmese dissident Aung San Suu Kyi . ""
The police officers even asked us if we were planning some kind of rebellion .
We did n't go on stageIt was very disappointing , "" Nikitin said .
Russia 's celebrated rock critic Artemy Troitsky told the Moscow radio station Echo Moskvi : "" These organisations take part in every concert in every city in the world .
They are an organic part of the U2 tour .
It always goes off peacefully .
Unfortunately our law enforcement agencies have a kind of allergy or sickness towards people and their human rights . ""
Activists said they had agreed their campaign with U2 's management and administrators at the venue , the Luzhniki stadium .
The five detained activists were released after two - and - a - half hours without charges , Nikitin confirmed .
Bono made no mention of the incident on stage .
Before a 50,000-strong crowd he instead thanked Medvedev for the "" gracious "" reception he had received .
He went on to praise the former Soviet president Mikhail Gorbachev , an unpopular figure blamed by the regime and many others for destroying the Soviet Union .
In a move that will have further irked Russia 's leadership , Bono invited the Kremlin 's least favourite singer , Yury Shevchuk , to take to the stage .
The pair belted out a duet of Bob Dylan 's Knockin ' on Heaven 's Door , to an ecstatic response from rain - drenched fans .
Shevchuck , who speaks no English , managed the refrain but reportedly sang the other bits in his native tongue .
Shevchuk led protests on Sunday against the demolition of the ancient Khimki oak forest north of Moscow to make way for a new highway to St Petersburg .
He had asked Bono to raise the subject with Medvedev , and today the pro - Kremlin United Russia party also urged the president to take another look at the controversial scheme .
There are signs that the Kremlin may be preparing to back down ."
2010-09-28,"One of the most captivating political soap operas in Russia has come to an abrupt end with the sacking of Moscow 's embattled mayor , Yuri Luzhkov .
In the boldest move of his presidency so far Dmitry Medvedev announced he had lost confidence in Luzhkov and named the deputy , Vladimir Resin , as a temporary stand - in .
But in a show of defiance Luzhkov proclaimed he was resigning from United Russia , the pro - Kremlin ruling party he co - founded in 2001 , and said he would campaign for the restoration of direct mayoral elections , which were abolished by Vladimir Putin .
The dismissal of the 74-year - old mayor brought the curtain down on weeks of feuding between the Kremlin and Moscow 's city government , and followed an unprecedented Kremlin - ordered pincer movement against him by state - controlled federal TV channels .
A series of muckraking TV documentaries accused Luzhkov of fleeing Moscow during August 's devastating forest fires and caring more about his bees than the city 's smog - choked residents .
They also attacked his property developer wife , Yelena Baturina , saying her $ 2.8bn fortune had been acquired thanks to her husband 's job , a claim she denies .
Luzhkov spent last week on holiday in Austria and Kremlin sources made clear they expected him to fall on his sword and announce his voluntary resignation .
Yesterday , however , a defiant Luzhkov – who has run Russia 's capital since 1992 – returned home .
Looking relaxed , and unrepentant , he declared : "" I am not going to resign of my own accord . ""
Tonight it emerged that Luzhkov wrote to Medvedev yesterday , complaining of the "" unprecedented "" campaign against him .
In his letter , leaked to the New Times magazine , he likened his fate to that of dissidents under Soviet rule .
Medvedev 's response was to get rid of him .
Today opposition leaders said it was absurd for Luzhkov to portray himself as a crusading anti - Kremlin democrat given his record in controlling federal and city elections , including last autumn 's vote for Moscow 's city Duma .
Luzhkov 's political opponents have accused him of rigging the poll , with opposition candidates wiped off the ballot . ""
[ Luzhkov ] has been an integral part in the vertical of authoritarianism under Putin , "" said Vladimir Kara - Murza , an opposition candidate and commentator .
"" He was the one who manipulated all the elections on behalf of the regime . ""
Analysts said Medvedev 's decision could not have been made without the agreement of Putin , Russia 's powerful prime minister .
Putin said today that Luzhkov had "" ' done a lot for the development of Moscow "" and was "" to a certain degree a symbol of modern Russia "" .
But Putin went on to say that Luzhkov 's removal was inevitable once a "" conflict "" arose between the mayor and the president .
Luzhkov 's many enemies , meanwhile , today expressed delight at the dismissal .
Alexander Lebedev , owner of the Independent and Evening Standard newspapers in the UK , who stood against Luzhkov for mayor in 2003 , said : "" It 's a great day for people who live in Moscow .
The city could n't sink any lower . ""
Nikolai Alekseev , a Russian gay rights activist whose parades Luzhkov repeatedly banned also welcomed the news .
"" I think it 's a very positive step by the president .
He showed today he is capable of strong decisions .
He listened to the views of the majority of people who were fed up . ""
Luzhkov 's fate is now unclear .
In a seething letter to United Russia 's leadership today he complained of suffering "" violent attacks from the state - owned media "" .
He had been subjected to "" wild harassment that went beyond the limits of decency and common sense "" , he said .
Luzhkov was once an immovable feature against the protean backdrop of Russia 's domestic politics .
Since his mayoral election in 1992 he has seen three changes of president , six parliaments and 10 prime ministers , not to mention two Chechen wars and a financial default .
He clocked up 18 years in power , outdoing Leonid Brezhnev .
Fans say he transformed Moscow from a crumbling communist shell into a vibrant metropolis .
He paid pensions promptly , ensured hot water , even rebuilt Christ the Saviour 's , the gold - domed orthodox cathedral knocked down by Stalin .
His backers included Putin .
Critics however point to his refusal to allow opposition rallies and the way he sent in riot police to break up anti - Kremlin demonstrations .
They accuse him of taking a wrecking ball to Moscow 's unique architectural heritage and replacing it with sham replicas and tacky pseudo - historical palaces .
The decision to remove him comes ahead of Duma elections next autumn and a presidential poll in 2012 .
The sacking consolidates the Kremlin 's grip over the third most important post in the country but also presents a new headache : how to administer a megalopolis of 10 million at a time of growing civic uprisings and as Medvedev 's own regime loses its appeal ."
2010-09-29,"Moscow 's sacked mayor Yuri Luzhkov is facing the possibility of criminal prosecution after federal investigators announced that they were examining allegations of corruption against him .
A day after President Dmitry Medvedev dismissed Luzhkov from office , the investigators indicated that they were looking at two cases of possible corruption involving Luzhkov and his property developer wife .
It is so far unclear , however , whether the Kremlin genuinely plans to launch a full - blown criminal investigation against the ousted mayor or , as seems more likely , is using the threat of prosecution as a tool in negotiations over Luzhkov 's future .
For his part , Luzhkov told friends that he planned to challenge the legality of his sacking in court .
But his action contesting Medvedev 's decree issued two days ago stands virtually no chance of success .
Kommersant newspaper , citing sources inside the investigative committee of the prosecutor general 's office , said prosecutors were scrutinising a land deal involving Inteko , the construction company belonging to Luzhkov 's billionaire wife , Yelena Baturina .
In a petition sent to the British , Russian and US governments , as well as to Transparency International , Alexander Lebedev also called for an investigation into Baturina 's business activities .
Lebedev , the owner of the Independent and Evening Standard newspapers , is a long - standing Luzhkov critic .
Lebedev urged the authorities to examine recent claims made by Chalva Tchigirinski , Baturina 's former business partner .
In a deposition to the high court in London he alleged : "" Ms Baturina 's sphere of influence is such that no major business project can succeed [ in Moscow ] without her backing . ""
Tchigirinski said he paid bills for the maintenance of Baturina 's private jet , and said that she hid sensitive documents in a Swiss deposit box .
She has issued a blanket denial of all Tchigirinski 's claims , calling them "" the exact opposite of reality "" .
Meanwhile , Luzhkov visited his old Moscow city government office to collect his personal belongings , agencies reported .
Photos of the mayor departing from the same building , head bowed , after his sacking , graced the front pages of all major Russian newspapers .
The investigative committee said it was conducting inquiries based on several allegations of graft inside Luzhkov 's administration .
"" Probes are continuing ... into alleged corruption - related crimes by a number of officials in the Moscow government , "" a spokesman said ."
2010-10-05,"Forget the sacking of Moscow 's mayor or Russia 's chances of beating England to host the 2018 world cup .
Russia 's blogosphere was today buzzing with a discussion of president Dmitry Medvedev 's state - of - the - art stereo system .
On Friday Medvedev invited Vladimir Putin to his Moscow residence for a simple breakfast of milk and brown bread .
The meeting was meant to reinforce the two leaders ' unity and their humble love of patriotic dairy products .
Sharp - eyed bloggers , however , spotted Medvedev 's extraordinary stereo lurking in the background .
Experts estimated it was worth up to $ 200,000 ( Â£130,000 ) .
It includes giant speakers , a CD player , amplifiers , and other expensive gadgets .
It is not clear whether the stereo belongs to Medvedev himself â€ “
a Deep Purple fan and keen vinyl enthusiast â€ “ or is the property of the state , in this case the Russian Federation .
Either way , it is a tantalising clue in a country where any mention of Putin or Medvedev 's personal wealth is strictly taboo .
Bloggers seemed unimpressed by Medvedev 's choice of audio equipment , much of it made in Britain ( including a bespoke Avid Acutus Reference SP turntable , made in Huntingdon , Cambridgeshire , and two Swiss - made Daniel Hertz M1 speakers , costing a cool $ 75,000 a pair , it was estimated . )
One blogger , yarosh , declared : "" The experts I 've talked to tell me this is a bit of a vulgar stereo complex .
There 's nothing special about it .
You can find something cooler and cheaper in Russia and , most crucially , with a superior sound . ""
Others wanted to know why Medvedev had not bought a Russian model and whether he had paid for it himself or used taxpayers ' cash . ""
If the stereo belonged to Obama , or any European leader , this would be a scandal rather than a joke , "" one blogger , westernstorm , pointed out .
Official photos from the meeting show Medvedev crouching down to change the CD .
It is not clear , though , whether the meeting took place against a backdrop of Deep Purple and British rock from the 1970s .
Putin , for the record , is said to prefer listening to patriotic ballads ."
2010-10-13,"William Hague said that Britain 's troubled relations with Russia had taken a positive "" step forward "" but insisted that Andrei Lugovoi – accused of murdering Alexander Litvinenko – should be tried in the UK .
During his first trip to Moscow as foreign secretary today , Hague met with President Dmitry Medvedev – a sign of Russia 's keenness to move on from the Litvinenko affair .
Hague also spent more than three hours in talks with his Russian counterpart , Sergei Lavrov .
Speaking in Moscow , Hague said that the British coalition government would not "" shy away "" from discussing difficult issues , including the unresolved Litvinenko case , adding that Britain and Russia "" have had some serious differences "" following the Kremlin 's refusal to extradite Lugovoi , charged in 2007 with Litvinenko 's murder .
But Hague also hailed Russia as an important partner in international security , and signalled the coalition wanted a business and trade driven partnership with the Kremlin .
He gave Medvedev a letter from David Cameron , laying out areas in which both countries could co - operate , such as Iran , Afghanistan and the Middle East .
British officials today said it would be an exaggeration to describe Hague 's trip as a "" reset "" .
But they hinted the Russians were glad to see the back of Gordon Brown . ""
Medvedev was visibly disposed to seeing more of the new UK government , "" one said , claiming that Cameron 's meeting with the president during the G8 summit in Canada in June "" had an impact "" .
During today 's press conference , Hague was reminded by a journalist of Cameron 's remark during Russia 's 2008 war with Georgia that "" Russian armies ca n't march into other countries while Russian shoppers carry on marching into Selfridges . ""
( Cameron also called for Russia to be suspended from the G8 . )
Lavrov came to Hague 's rescue , pointing out that Cameron had not said anything similar "" as prime minister "" .
Lavrov will now travel to London early next year at his counterpart 's invitation .
British officials said a visit by Hague to Moscow in January as shadow foreign secretary had paved the way for more constructive relations . ""
[ The Russians ] have responded to that opening of the door .
But that does n't mean they are throwing open the windows , "" one official suggested .
The foreign secretary also confirmed that Britain was not prepared to lift punitive measures against Russia taken in the wake of Litvinenko 's polonium assassination .
In 2007 , the then foreign secretary , David Miliband , severed co - operation with the Federal Security Service ( FSB ) , the successor to the KGB , and imposed visa restrictions on Kremlin officials visiting London .
"" There is no change in the UK position on this issue , "" Hague said .
In an interview with the Guardian on Tuesday , Lugovoi , a former FSB officer turned Russian businessman , said he would never travel to Britain to stand trial .
He suggested it was time for the UK to "" move on "" from Litvinenko 's agonising death four years ago , and to give up its attempts to extradite him , saying : "" The only trial I 'll accept is one in Russia . """
2010-10-15,"Russia has agreed to help Venezuela build its first nuclear power station , in a move that is likely to raise concerns in Washington about the increasingly close co - operation between Moscow and Caracas .
President Dmitry Medvedev announced the move at the end of a two - day visit to Moscow by Venezuela 's president , Hugo ChÃ¡vez .
Venezuela 's economy is overwhelmingly reliant on oil and ChÃ¡vez has said he wants the nuclear power station to diversify energy supply .
A senior US administration spokesman said the White House was not planning to respond .
A state department spokesman , PJ Crowley , said this week that there were no specific concerns about Venezuela 's nuclear ambitions . ""
Certainly nothing that rivals Iran , "" he said .
The official US position is that it is not opposed to civilian nuclear technology , only to the proliferation of nuclear weapons programmes .
Medvedev implicitly acknowledged the deal was not likely to be popular with the US administration but defended Venezuela 's right to seek access to peaceful nuclear technology .
The station is likely to be built over the next 10 - 15 years .
Its cost has not yet been revealed . ""
An agreement has just been signed on co - operation in the atomic sphere .
I do n't know who will shudder at this , "" Medvedev said , speaking at a press conference following talks with ChÃ¡vez .
He added : "" The president [ of Venezuela ] said there will be countries in which this will provoke different emotions .
But I want to say especially that our intentions are absolutely pure and open . ""
Russia wanted Venezuela to have a "" full range of energy choices , "" he said .
ChÃ¡vez 's visit is his ninth to Moscow and is the first stop on a 12-day European tour that includes Belarus and , for the first time , Ukraine â€ “ now once again within Moscow 's sphere of influence .
On previous occasions ChÃ¡vez has bought billions of dollars worth of military hardware from Russia including submarines , helicopters and attack aircraft .
Both leaders today reaffirmed their plans to continue co - operating on technical and military issues .
Viktor Semyonov , an economist at Moscow 's Institute of Latin American Studies , said it was logical for Venezuela to seek civilian nuclear technology since its economy was even more dependent on oil than Russia 's .
Russia is already building a nuclear power station in Iran , and is also holding talks with other Latin American countries including Brazil and Argentina , he pointed out .
"" We are a country that exports nuclear technology around the world .
Venezuela 's economy is 94 or even 95 % made up of oil .
Russia 's is 65 % , which is already a lot .
They [ the Venezuelans ] want to widen their sources of energy so they are less dependent on it . ""
Sergei Kirienko , the head of Rosatom , Russia 's state nuclear corporation , said that Russia could build a VVER â€ ” or pressurised water reactor â€
” for the ChÃ¡vez regime .
"" It could be in 10 years .
It could be earlier , "" he said .
Kirienko said practical nuclear co - operation would start soon , including "" training staff for Venezuela 's nascent atomic sector "" and help with drawing up new legislation in line with International Atomic Energy Agency rules .
Russia would also carry out "" geological prospecting "" to study the possibility of extracting natural uranium inside Venezuela , he said .
Speaking in Moscow on Thursday night , ChÃ¡vez offered assurances that Venezuela had no interest in building a nuclear bomb , and only wanted to pursue peaceful nuclear technology .
He also described the collapse of the Soviet Union as a "" catastrophe "" and launched a familiar attack on the United States , denigrating it as a "" Yankee empire "" .
ChÃ¡vez went for a spin in a Lada car , causing miles of gridlock on Moscow 's already traffic - clogged streets .
Before heading to the airport , he handed Medvedev several gifts .
They included three bars of chocolate , some banana jam and a tin of cocoa .

2010-10-21,"A top Kremlin official dubbed a "" faceless bureaucrat "" by critics became the mayor of Moscow today , three weeks after his charismatic predecessor , Yuri Luzhkov , was unceremoniously sacked .
Moscow 's rubberstamp city council confirmed Sergei Sobyanin as the capital 's mayor .
Last week President Dmitry Medvedev selected Sobyanin â€ “ a trusted aide of the prime minister , Vladimir Putin â€ “ from a notional shortlist of four candidates .
The appointment consolidates the Kremlin 's takeover of Moscow and its prodigious resources , and marks the formal end of the Luzhkov era .
The pugnacious Luzhkov , who ran Moscow from 1992 , was dismissed after apparently growing too powerful and falling out with Russia 's ruling Putin - Medvedev duumvirate .
Sobyanin , 52 , had been the Kremlin chief of staff since 2005 , when Putin was president , and stayed with Putin when he became prime minister after steering Medvedev into the presidency in 2008 .
Born near the town of Khanty - Mansisk , he has spent most of his administrative career in Siberia and the Urals .
In a Brezhnev - like speech , delivered in an uninspiring monotone , Sobyanin described his new job as a "" great honour and responsibility "" .
He hailed Moscow as one of the world 's leading megalopolises : "" A great deal of work has been done in Moscow over the past decades .
The city has changed for the better . ""
Sobyanin , however , laid into his predecessor 's legacy , saying he would look again at the city 's budget and development plan .
He acknowledged there was "" serious corruption "" in the housing sector and said he wanted to make life more comfortable for the capital 's 10.5 million citizens .
He promised to keep social benefits for Moscow 's pensioners .
Critics were distinctly unimpressed .
"" He 's a faceless bureaucrat .
He 's part of the Putin system , "" said Eduard Limonov , an opposition leader , dissident and writer who is frequently detained during anti - Kremlin rallies .
"" He has no distinctive threads .
He 's an obeying official .
He will be boring and absolutely flat , square .
Luzhkov at least was a picturesque guy . ""
Asked why the Kremlin decided to sack Luzhkov , Limonov said : "" Luzhkov became too powerful .
He accumulated a lot of might , appointing himself to royal , almost feudal power .
The other reason was Moscow 's wealth .
The federal government wanted all this wealth for itself . ""
Others said Sobyanin would have a more progressive attitude on issues such as opposition rallies and gay rights .
The European court of human rights today ruled that Luzhkov 's repeated ban on gay parades in Moscow was illegal . ""
He [ Sobyanin ] has to be completely different from the last mayor , "" a gay rights activist , Nikolai Alekseev , said .
"" He has no other choice . ""
Asked what he thought of Sobyanin , Alekseev said : "" I do n't know who he is .
I ca n't say anything about him . ""
Moscow 's city Duma confirmed Sobyanin as mayor in a 34 - 2 vote .
( The council 's two attending communists opposed , while another did n't turn up . )
Deputies from the pro - Kremlin United Russia party dominate the council after last year 's elections , which the opposition allege were rigged .
Sobyanin was this afternoon inaugurated as mayor in a short ceremony attended by Medvedev , Russia 's patriarch Kirill and other Kremlin luminaries .
Medvedev told Sobyanin he faced a difficult job but his regional and federal experience made him the right man for the post .
Sobyanin 's most urgent tasks would be to sort out Moscow 's traffic problems and improve its business climate , Medvedev said .
"" I have no doubt you will work round the clock to deal with Moscow 's problems . ""
Putin abolished gubernatorial elections , including those for the Moscow mayor , in 2004 .
He reappointed Luzhkov to the job in 2007 .
Moscow is now the only capital in Europe apart from Minsk , in next - door authoritarian Belarus , where citizens do not have a say in who leads their city .
Since his sacking , Luzhkov has expressed his support for the return of direct elections and has â€ “ not very plausibly â€ “ reinvented himself as an opposition figure .
Today , though , he made clear he does n't intend to stand in elections for the federal Duma next year , or in the 2012 presidential poll .
Journalists were barred from listening to a lecture delivered by Luzhkov , who has taken a job at a management university .
In his speech Luzhkov bitterly attacked United Russia .
He resigned from the party in disgust last month after an unprecedented Kremlin - ordered attack on him by Russia 's TV channels .
"" I have always told the [ United Russia ] party chairman , Boris Gryzlov , that we do n't have discussions or debates .
We have always obeyed the [ Kremlin ] administration on everything , "" he said .
"" This is a servile party and I quit it . """
2010-10-25,"Speculation is growing that Moscow 's sacked mayor Yuri Luzhkov is preparing to begin a new life of exile in London after he was allegedly spotted queueing up for a visa at the British Embassy in Moscow .
Luzhkov – unceremoniously booted out by President Dmitry Medvedev late last month – was seen at the embassy last week , the internet portal lifenews.ru said today .
He received no VIP treatment , stood quietly in a line with ordinary Russians and even had his fingerprints taken , it added , before handing in his documents .
It was not immediately clear whether Britain had decided to grant Luzhkov a visa .
The embassy today declined to comment , saying it never gave information on individual applications .
But the reports fed a frenzy of speculation that the former mayor is about to become the latest high - profile Russian to head to the UK after falling out with the Kremlin .
Friends , however , denied that the pugnacious Luzhkov , a conservative nationalist who ran Moscow from 1992 until four weeks ago , was prepared to move permanently to the UK . ""
He 's a patriot .
There is no way he would abandon our country , "" said legendary Soviet - era crooner Iosif Kobzon , according to the Interfax news agency .
Since his ignominious dismissal Luzhkov has sought to reinvent himself as a semi - opposition figure , an attempt that has provoked scorn from Russia 's sceptical liberal establishment .
He has criticised Medvedev , querying the president 's so - called "" modernisation agenda "" and called for the return of direct mayoral elections .
In 2004 , then - president Putin abolished mayoral elections , later reappointing Luzhkov to the job .
Few analysts , however , believe that the Kremlin is planning to file corruption charges against Luzhkov , a common tactic used against fallen bureaucrats , since in the former mayor 's case charges like this might lead to allegations against Putin and Medvedev ."
2010-10-26,"Nato 's Lisbon summit next month is in danger of becoming the stage for a triumphal procession by Russia 's leather - jacketed president , Dmitry Medvedev .
The mystery is what , exactly , Moscow has done to deserve this sudden burst of western camaraderie .
It is hardly a new script : Russia comes in from the cold , again .
It 's true that Medvedev appears to be about to douse Russia 's previously combustible opposition to US missile defence plans .
When the Bush administration first suggested the idea , co - opting Poland and the Czechs , Medvedev 's patron and possible future nemesis , Vladimir Putin , was fit to be tied , as the Americans say .
Clever Barack Obama defused Moscow 's objections by revising the Bush - Rumsfeld plan , switching missiles and platforms , and spinning it as an unthreatening European - Nato initiative with which the Russians were welcome to co - operate .
This is what Medvedev now appears ready to do , albeit in a limited , vague sort of way â€ “ which is a significant victory for Obama .
It 's true , also , that the Russian army has not invaded anybody lately , which is an advance on the situation that confronted Georgia in 2008 .
Not invading other people 's countries is certainly a policy the Nato allies would like to encourage â€ “ unless of course it is them doing the invading , in which case it 's different .
Russia has also earned favour by playing a straighter - than - usual bat on nuclear proliferation issues .
It recently cancelled a missile sale to Iran and , as far as it is possible to tell , is supporting the latest round of UN sanctions against Tehran .
Increasingly , its Middle East perspectives , on linked issues such as Syria 's rejectionism , the rise of Lebanese Hezbollah , and stability in Iraq and the Gulf appear to resemble those of the west .
A coincidence of view is evident , too , in nervousness about the implications of China 's rise .
Moscow and Beijing have been making nice of late .
But longer - term , nobody knows .
As one European diplomat put it : "" The future demographic push of China against Russia is very important . ""
The two countries have fought in the not too distant past â€ “ and that was when they were supposedly ideological stable - mates .
Moscow peers south as well as east .
"" The Russians are what they are , "" the diplomat said .
"" We do n't like their record on human rights , on governance , on the Politkovskaya case , on Chechnya .
But look at their Muslim south .
There are 25 million Muslims in Russia .
Russia has no interest in a nuclear - armed Iran .
In the long run , they [ Russia ] want what we want .
In the long run , they are allies .
We are rejoicing they are coming to Lisbon . ""
A growing consensus on 21st - century security threats , including terrorism and insurgencies , is one strong magnet .
Growing economic and financial interdependence , most of all in the energy sector , are among the other factors pulling Europe and Russia together .
So , too , perhaps is a sense that American power , long the guarantor of European freedom and Russian good behaviour , is weakening .
Both sides think : in this uncertain world , better the devil you know than the devil you do n't .
This is hardly new either .
Nineteenth - century Russian literature is full of debates about whether Russia is a European country .
The answer then , as now , is that it is , albeit wayward .
So perhaps the feting of Medvedev is justified ; perhaps the stars are finally aligned and Russia 's anticipated agreement to do more to help the Nato effort in Afghanistan is an earnest sign of better things to come .
Even so , European leaders might reflect on two points .
First , the US will work to temper this Euro - Russia crush with world - weary caution , backed by muscle and spurred by self - interest .
Thinktanks pronouncing that the US is no longer
a European power forget there is no escaping the American embrace , unless and until the Americans choose to let go .
Second , if the forthcoming Nato knees - up is Europe 's not so subtle way of boosting Medvedev in a coming 2012 electoral showdown with Vladimir Putin , it is unlikely to work .
Putin and the siloviki , the Kremlin 's powerful ones , are Russia 's hard men .
They wo n't surrender the reins willingly , any more than Putin will suddenly swallow his visceral distrust of the west .
Medvedev 's leather jacket makes him look tough .
But Vlad is the real thing ."
2010-10-27,"Mikhail Gorbachev , the former leader of the Soviet Union , has issued a sharp criticism of Russia 's president , Dmitry Medvedev , and the prime minister , Vladimir Putin , saying they are "" doing everything they can to move away from democracy , to stay in power "" .
Gorbachev , 79 , accused the two leaders of eroding civil liberties by crushing opposition parties and cancelling direct elections for regional governors .
"" I am very concerned , we 're only halfway down the road from a totalitarian regime to democracy and freedom , "" he told the BBC . ""
And the battle continues .
There are still many people in our society who fear democracy and would prefer a totalitarian regime . ""
Gorbachev has been critical of his Kremlin successors in the past â€ “ reserving special bile for Boris Yeltsin â€ “ but these comments were his most cutting yet about Medvedev and Putin .
In a separate interview with the New York Times , Gorbachev said Putin believed "" democracy stands in his way "" .
Gorbachev , the last Soviet leader , who resigned in 1991 , claimed there had been signs of friction between Putin and Medvedev , but ultimately the pair acted as a team .
"" I am afraid that they have been saddled with this idea that this unmanageable country needs authoritarianism , "" Gorbachev said .
"" They think they can not do without it . ""
The comments come amid a slow ratcheting - up of tension over who will stand for the presidency in 2012 .
Western diplomats say Putin is still the dominant figure , but that he has not yet decided whether to return to the fray or to stay out of the race and allow his protÃ © gÃ © , Medvedev , to run for a second term .
Putin was forced to step down in 2008 after serving eight years as president , but the Russian constitution would allow him to come back for a third , non - consecutive stint .
Opposition candidates , who command few resources and who are excluded from appearing on state television , stand little chance .
Gorbachev 's comments will have little effect inside the country , where he is widely derided as a spent force , but they could dampen Washington 's optimistic view of Medvedev as the US attempts to "" reset "" relations with Moscow .
The Nobel peace prize - winner reserved special criticism for the pro - Kremlin United Russia party that props up Medvedev , saying it had become "" a bad copy of the Soviet Communist party "" whose aim was to exclude ordinary citizens from politics .
That contrasted with Gorbachev 's endorsement of the party at the 2007 parliamentary elections , when he said it was supported by 80 % of the population .
Asked about the situation in Afghanistan , the former Soviet leader â€ “ who now heads a thinktank
â€ “ predicted that Nato could never beat the Taliban . ""
Victory is impossible in Afghanistan , "" he told the BBC . ""
[ Barack ] Obama is right to pull the troops out .
No matter how difficult it will be . ""
Yesterday it emerged that Russia could be drawn back into the Afghanistan theatre for the first time since the Red Army was forcibly expelled by US - backed mujahideen fighters in 1989 .
Nato and Russian officials are discussing plans for Russian forces to contribute helicopters , train Afghan pilots and security forces and step up co - operation on counter - narcotics and border security ."
2010-11-10,"The World Association of Newspapers and News Publishers ( WAN - IFRA ) and the World Editors Forum have jointly called on Russia 's president to ensure that widespread attacks on journalists are aggressively prosecuted .
Their letter to Dmitry Medvedev follows the attempted murder of newspaper reporter Oleg Kashin and the fact that there have been 19 unsolved murders of journalists in Russia ( as I wrote about at length on Monday ) .
"" We are alarmed at the culture of impunity that surrounds attacks on journalists , which stifles criticism and can lead to self - censorship .
We respectfully remind you that it is the duty of the state to provide an environment in which journalists are able to carry out their professional duties without fear of violence . ""
Kashin , a reporter for the business daily Kommersant , suffered a fractured jaw , broken legs and injuries to his skull after being beaten outside his Moscow apartment building on Saturday .
His editor , Mikhail Mikhailin , said that the attack was retribution for articles written by Kashin , who had recently covered anti - Kremlin protests and extremist rallies .

2010-11-14,"Barack Obama today promised to push the New Start treaty on cutting US - Russian nuclear arsenals through the lame duck session of Congress , which begins this week .
Obama , speaking to reporters after a meeting with the Russian president , Dmitry Medvedev , on the sidelines of an Asian economic summit in Seoul , said : "" I reiterated my commitment to get the Start treaty done during the lame duck session , and I 've communicated to Congress that it is a top priority . ""
But it is likely to be a cliffhanger , with the fate of the treaty dependent on only a handful of Republican senators and with less than four weeks of the congressional session left .
The Democrats have 59 votes in the 100-member Senate , but need eight Republicans to secure the necessary two - thirds majority to ratify the treaty .
The critical figure in deciding whether New Start lives or dies will be Senator Jon Kyl , the Republican whip , who has threatened to block the treaty until the administration spends more on modernising the existing arsenal .
The White House is trying to buy him off , offering him $ 4bn ( £ 2.4bn ) more late last week on top of billions already pledged for modernisation .
But Kyl , like other Republicans , is torn between doing a deal and all - out opposition to Obama .
The New Start treaty , signed by Obama and Medvedev in April , is prized by the Obama administration as one of its most important foreign policy achievements .
It set the seal on Obama 's initiative to "" reset "" US - Russian relations , and has been the principal practical step so far towards "" a world without nuclear weapons "" , which Obama declared to be the ultimate goal of US policy in a 2009 speech in Prague .
Once ratified , the treaty would reduce the number of long - range nuclear warheads each side deployed to 1,550 , roughly one - third down from current levels .
It would keep delivery systems – missiles and bombers – below a ceiling of 700 .
But when administration officials , Pentagon generals and arms control advocates join forces to lobby the senate for ratification over the next few days , they will focus not on the numbers but on the cost of having no treaty at all if ratification is shelved .
The previous Start treaty expired last December , along with its verification procedures .
As a consequence , the Pentagon has pointed out , there have been no US inspections of Russian nuclear sites .
The head of US nuclear forces , General Kevin Chilton , told the Senate : "" If we do n't get the treaty , [ the Russians ] are not constrained in their development of force structure and … we have no insight into what they 're doing .
So it 's the worst of both possible worlds . ""
The Republicans ' public position is that they are prepared to back the treaty so long as the remainder of the nuclear arsenal is modernised .
The White House sees the issue as a test of whether the Republicans are serious about a deal or whether their overriding priority is ensuring Obama is not re - elected in 2012 .
It is adopting a carrot and stick approach .
As well as offering the carrot of $ 4bn towards modernisation , it is hinting that , if the Senate fails to ratify the treaty , billions already pledged towards modernisation could also be withdrawn .
Even if Kyl was to come round , there is the problem of a crowded Congressional session , with members facing votes on the budget and tax cuts , and possibly issues such as the repeal of the ban on out gay people serving in the military .
If the treaty is not ratified in the remainder of this session , the White House sees it becoming even harder in the new Congress – scheduled to start in January , when the Republicans will have more senators , elected earlier this month .
Daryl Kimball , the head of the Arms Control Association , said Kyl 's position was "" irresponsible and unnecessary "" , arguing that the administration has already earmarked $ 80bn on a weapons modernisation programme and another $ 100bn on delivery systems over the next 10 years . ""
Senate failure to approve the treaty would directly harm US national security by denying the US military information about Russian nuclear forces and plans , and force both nations to rely on worst - case assumptions for planning , increasing the risk of miscalculation and mistakes , Joe Cirincione , the president of the Ploughshares Fund , which finances research on nuclear weapons policy , said .
"" But the treaty 's impact goes far behind the modest cuts it makes in US and Russian forces . ""
The Senate failure would undermine global confidence in US leadership , weaken the president in any future treaty talks and weaken efforts to stop other states from getting nuclear weapons . """
2010-11-16,"Barack Obama 's hopes of reshaping US foreign policy stand on the brink of failure tonight , after two of his most cherished initiatives â€ ” nuclear disarmament and better relations with Moscow â€ ” were dealt serious setbacks .
According to a leaked Nato document seen by the Guardian , a move to withdraw US tactical nuclear weapons from Europe has been omitted from the alliance 's draft strategic doctrine , due to be adopted by a summit this weekend in Lisbon .
Meanwhile in Washington , a Republican leader in the Senate signalled that the nuclear arms control treaty Obama signed in April with Russian president Dmitry Medvedev is unlikely be ratified this year .
Most observers say that if the treaty â€ “ known as New Start â€ “ is delayed until next year , it will be as good as dead , as the Democratic majority in the Senate will be even thinner by then , following the party 's losses in the midterm elections .
Together the setbacks mark a new low point for Obama 's ambitions , set out in a landmark 2009 speech in Prague , to set the world on a path to abolition of nuclear weapons .
They also rob the president of the main concrete achievement so far in his bid to "" reset "" US - Russian relations .
In the absence of progress in the Middle East or Iranian compromise over its nuclear ambitions , the developments threaten to eclipse Obama 's legacy in foreign policy .
"" All this stuff was integrated â€ “ the nuclear package and the Russian relationship , "" said Steven Clemons , policy analyst at the New America Foundation .
"" In terms of the long - term international significance it 's the most important thing Obama has done , and it has just come apart .
"" In the latest draft of Nato 's "" new strategic concept "" , seen by the Guardian , nuclear weapons remain at the core of Nato doctrine , and an attempt to withdraw an estimated 200 American B-61 nuclear bombs from Europe , a legacy of the cold war , is not mentioned .
Germany , the Netherlands and Belgium â€ “ who all have B-61 bombs on their soil
â€ “ had pushed to have the tactical weapons removed , with the encouragement of supporters of disarmament in the Obama camp including the US ambassador to Nato , Ivo Daalder .
However , in a victory for France , which led a rearguard action against diluting nuclear deterrence in Nato doctrine , the draft strategic concept states that the weapons would only be removed as a trade - off with Moscow . ""
In any future reductions , our aim should be to seek Russian agreement to increase transparency on its nuclear weapons in Europe and relocate these weapons away from the territory of Nato members , "" the draft states .
"" Any further steps must take into account the disparity with the greater Russian stockpile of short - range nuclear weapons . ""
Advocates of disarmament still hope the door to withdrawal could be left open in another strategic review , possibly next year .
But Daryl Kimball , the head of the Arms Control Association , said the Lisbon document represented a lost opportunity for the alliance .
"" Nato does not need these weapons against any of the 21st century threats we face , "" Kimball said .
"" The weapons raise the risk of nuclear terrorism , and their presence makes it harder to convince Russia to cut its own tactical arsenal . ""
US and Russian negotiators had been expected to discuss tactical weapons in the next round of arms control talks , but those talks will almost certainly not take place if the New Start treaty is shelved .
The White House had hoped the Senate would ratify the treaty in its lame - duck session currently underway , before newly - elected Republican senators take their seats in January .
However , the administration still needed some Republican support to get the 67 votes required for ratification .
In a last - ditch move last week , it offered to spend an extra $ 4 bn ( Â£2.5 bn ) on modernisation of the existing nuclear arsenal â€ ” an effort to placate the Republican whip , Jon Kyl .
However , Senator Kyl issued a statement tonight saying he still did not think the treaty could be passed in the lame - duck session , "" given the combination of other work Congress must do and the complex and unresolved issues related to Start and modernisation .
"" Some Democrats were still hoping tonight the statement could be a bluff aimed at extracting yet more funding for America 's nuclear labs .
Others , however , saw it as a slammed door , and a reflection of Republican determination to make Obama a one - term president and erase his legacy .
Paul Ingram , head of the British American Security Information Council ( Basic ) , said Obama 's radical vision of "" a world without nuclear weapons "" laid out in his Prague speech was now fading .
"" I would n't say it was dead .
It 's in emergency resuscitation , "" Ingram said .
"" If there is hope no , it 's not coming from Washington .
The leadership of this is not going to come from Washington . """
2010-12-01,"Vladimir Putin still pulls the strings in Russia , with President Dmitry Medvedev a more junior figure who "" plays Robin to Putin 's Batman "" , US diplomats have said in frank dispatches from Moscow released by WikiLeaks .
Since Putin stepped down as president in 2008 , political analysts have been scrambling to assess whether he â€ “ or his handpicked successor , Medvedev â€ “ is Russia 's real leader .
After leaving the Kremlin , Putin immediately became prime minister .
Secret diplomatic cables seen by the Guardian reveal the US emphatically believes Putin to be in charge .
They also suggest Putin will decide whether Medvedev serves a second term , whether he will return to the presidency himself or give the job to someone else .
In a dispatch sent in February 2010 , the US ambassador in Moscow , John Beyrle , dubbed the pairing "" Russia 's bicephalous ruling format "" .
He made clear that he saw Putin as the more important of the two heads .
"" Medvedev and Putin work well together , but Putin holds most , and the best , of the cards in the tandem relationship .
His return to the Kremlin is not inevitable , but should things remain stable , Putin remains in a position to choose himself , Medvedev , or another person as Russia 's next president . ""
In a separate cable the Azeri president , Ilham Aliyev , is recorded telling a top US official that he personally witnessed Medvedev taking decisions that then required further approval .
Some were stymied at that stage , presumably in the prime minister 's office . ""
Many high - ranking officials do n't recognise [ Medvedev ] as a leader ...
There are signs of a strong confrontation between the teams of the two men , although not yet between Putin and Medvedev personally . ' ""
Aliyev continued : "" We have a saying in Azeri : two heads can not be boiled in one pot . ""
The writer of the cable explained that this was "" crude street slang suggesting that two leaders are spoiling for a fight "" .
Putin and Medvedev have left pundits guessing as to their intentions before an election in the spring of 2012 .
Both have indicated they may stand again as president .
Putin stepped down after two four - year terms , in accordance with Russia 's constitution .
This has now been changed , giving the next president a six - year stint .
The cables reveal how the US embassy industriously canvassed views from a range of Moscow experts on Russia 's unusual political duopoly .
In a November 2009 cable , the deputy ambassador , Eric Rubin , lumped the experts ' opinions into three "" very divergent camps "" .
The first group , he reported , believed Medvedev was ascending and "" slowly accruing power "" .
The second , more sceptical group "" argues that Medvedev continues to play Robin to Putin 's Batman "" .
And the third saw "" no essential difference "" between the two .
In reality , however , nobody knew what was going on in the Russian corridors of power , the cable admited .
"" All are hindered by the impenetrable nature of Kremlin politics and the fertile field of speculation and rumour that the information vacuum creates , "" Rubin said .
The US ambassador illustrated Putin 's supremacy by retelling a joke doing the rounds in Moscow . ""
Medvedev sits in the driver 's seat of a new car , examines the inside , the instrument panel , and the pedals .
He looks around , but the steering wheel is missing .
He turns to Putin and asks : ' Vladimir Vladimirovich , where is the steering wheel ? '
Putin pulls a remote control out of his pocket and says : ' I 'll be the one doing the driving . '
""
US officials advised that looking for splits in the Putin - Medvedev tandem was a waste of time .
They also said gullible Europeans and Americans who believed Medvedev was more enlightened than Putin were probably fooling themselves . ""
A search for evidence of dissonance between the two leaders is either the forlorn hope of western - leaning liberals ... or a legacy of ' Kremlinology ' that presupposes inter - leadership conflict as the sine qua non of Russian politics , "" Rubin said .
Two years after Putin left the Kremlin he was a "" mythic figure "" for many Russians and enjoyed high popularity ratings , the cables said .
Putin engaged with "" meat and potatoes "" issues and was easier to understand than the sometimes waffle - prone Medvedev , they suggested .
The cables noted the weak nature of Medvedev 's electoral base , estimating he enjoyed the support of 20 % of "" urbanites "" â€ “ voters in Moscow and St Petersburg .
Putin , by contrast , had the backing of 80 % of "" ordinary Russians "" .
During a question and answer session on live TV last December , Putin "" highlighted his role as Russia 's dominant political figure "" , the cables said .
He fielded questions on a wide range of questions and demonstrated a populist flair that had so far eluded the more cerebral , ex - lawyer and Deep Purple fan Medvedev .
But it is n't just the Americans wondering who is in charge of the world 's largest country and its formidable nuclear arsenal .
Russian government ministers have also expressed confusion .
A secret telegram sent by the US embassy in Azerbaijan revealed how Russia 's defence minister , Anatoly Serdyukov , gave his own views after a boozy evening in February 2009 with his Azerbaijani counterpart , Safar Abiyev .
Abiyev told the Americans that "" after the second bottle of vodka "" the Russians opened up .
The cable went on : "" In an interesting side note , Abiyev quoted Serdyukov as saying : ' Do you follow the orders of your president ? ...
Well I follow the orders of two presidents . """
2010-12-01,"The Russian prime minister , Vladimir Putin , has condemned as "" slanderous "" a US cable describing him and Russia 's president , Dmitry Medvedev , as Batman and Robin .
Speaking in a candid but frosty interview with talkshow host Larry King , the Russian prime minister dismissed suggestions that his tandem style of leadership with his protÃ
© gÃ
© , Medvedev , resembled the uneven power share between the two characters .
"" The truth of the matter is , this is about our interaction , which is an important factor of the domestic policies in this country , "" he said .
"" But to be honest with you , we did n't suspect that this would be done with such arrogance , with such a push and , you know , being so unethically done .
"" Several messages between US embassies and the state department released by WikiLeaks this week have included salty characterisations of Russia 's leaders .
Putin is described as an "" alpha dog "" running a state dominated by the security services , while Medvedev is pale , hesitant and "" Robin to Putin 's Batman "" .
Putin also dismissed an assessment by the US defence secretary , Robert Gates â€ “ revealed in the WikiLeaks documents â€ “ that "" Russian democracy has disappeared "" .
He pointed out that presidential elections in the US sometimes produced a winner who did not gain a majority of the popular vote . ""
When we are talking with our American friends and we tell them there are systemic problems in this regard , we can hear from them ' Do n't interfere with our affairs .
This is our tradition and it 's going to continue like that , ' "" he said .
"" We are not interfering .
But to our colleagues , I would also like to advise you , do n't interfere either [ with ] the sovereign choice of the Russian people . ""
In the pre - recorded interview with King â€ “ to be shown on CNN this evening â€ “ Putin echoed the dominant perception in Russia that the embassy cables were deliberately leaked by a faction in the US government or military . ""
Some experts believe that somebody is deceiving WikiLeaks , that its reputation is being undermined in order for it to be used for political purposes , "" said Putin , apparently speaking from an office in Moscow .
"" Such an opinion is being expressed here .
"" Putin said that if the leak had not been deliberate , then US information security needed to be beefed up .
In a more conciliatory comment , he added : "" There have been leaks before .
This is not such a catastrophe . ""
In a separate move , Turkey 's prime minister today accused US diplomats of slander after other leaked cables said he had accounts in Swiss banks , painted him as an authoritarian who hates Israel and said he leads a government with Islamist influences . ""
The United States should call its diplomats to account , "" Tayyip Erdogan told an audience in Ankara in his first comments on the leaks , which received wide coverage in Turkish media . ""
The US is responsible in first degree for the slanders its diplomats make with their incorrect interpretations .
There are lies and incorrect information in those documents , "" he said .
In 2004 , the then US ambassador , Eric Edelman , portrayed Erdogan , whose AK party swept to power in 2002 , as a politician with "" unbridled ambition stemming from the belief God has anointed him to lead Turkey "" .
Another cable by Edelman in 2004 said : "" Inside the party , Erdogan 's hunger for power reveals itself in a sharp authoritarian style and deep distrust of others : as a former spiritual adviser to Erdogan and his wife Emine put it , ' Tayyip Bey believes in God â€ ¦ but does n't trust him . ""
Writing about alleged corruption in the AK party , Edelman said : "" We have heard from two contacts that Erdogan has eight accounts in Swiss banks . ""
Erdogan said he did not have "" a penny in Swiss banks "" and said he would resign if such accusations were proved .
"" We will continue the process on these diplomats within international law , our officials are working on this , "" he added ."
2010-12-01,"The US ambassador to Russia claimed that Moscow 's veteran mayor Yuri Luzhkov sat on top of a "" pyramid of corruption "" involving the Kremlin , Russia 's police force , its security service , political parties and crime groups .
The 74-year - old has subsequently been sacked as mayor by President Dmitry Medvedev , after the Kremlin - controlled media broadcast allegations of corruption aimed at him and his billionaire wife , Yelena Baturina , who heads a construction company called Inteko .
The couple have vehemently denied the accusations as "" total rubbish "" designed to make Luzhkov "" lose his balance "" .
In a leaked secret cable sent in February , the US ambassador John Beyrle gives a forensic account of Moscow 's "" murky "" criminal world , alleging a shadowy connection between bureaucrats , gangsters and even prosecutors .
According to Beyrle corruption in Moscow was "" pervasive "" .
"" Luzhkov is at the top of the pyramid , "" he claimed .
He told the US state department : "" Luzhkov oversees a system in which it appears that almost everyone at every level is involved in some form of corruption or criminal behaviour . ""
Russia 's well - developed system of bribe - taking was ubiquitous , Beyrle said .
In the absence of laws that worked , Luzhkov – as well as other mayors and governors – paid off "" key insiders in the Kremlin "" .
Officials had even been spotted entering the building carrying large suitcases , presumed to be "" full of money "" .
The ambassador wrote his cable in response to speculation that Luzhkov , the capital 's charismatic mayor since 1992 , was about to lose his job .
When Medvedev ignominiously dismissed him in September , the Russian president said he had lost confidence in Luzhkov .
Most analysts believe the firing had little to do with the allegations of corruption but was linked to a power struggle between Luzhkov and Russia 's federal leadership , which Luzhkov eventually lost .
In a section called "" Background on Moscow 's criminal world "" , Beyrle asserted bluntly : "" The Moscow city government 's direct links to criminality have led some to call it ' dysfunctional ' , and to assert that the government operates more as a kleptocracy than a government "" . ""
Criminal elements enjoy a ' krysha ' [ a term from the criminal / mafia world literally meaning ' roof ' or protection ] that runs through the police , the federal security service ( FSB ) , ministry of internal affairs ( MVD ) and the prosecutor 's office , as well as throughout the Moscow city government bureaucracy . ""
Analysts identify a three - tiered structure in Moscow 's criminal world .
Luzhkov is at the top .
The FSB , MVD and militia are at the second level .
Finally ordinary criminals and corrupt inspectors are at the lowest level . ""
Under this system , all businesses in Moscow were forced to pay bribes to law enforcement structures , in a virtual parallel tax system : "" Police and MVD collect money from small businesses while the FSB collects from big businesses . ""
An FSB krysha was the most sought after , Beyrle said , with the FSB protecting Moscow 's top organised crime gang .
This sleaze went all the way to the top of Russian power , Beyrle said .
Bribes were distributed upwards under the "" power vertical "" , Vladimir Putin 's bureaucratic hierarchy .
He quoted one source who said : "" Everything depends on the Kremlin … Luzhkov , as well as many mayors and governors , pay off key insiders in the Kremlin . ""
The same source alleged that officials went into the Kremlin "" with large suitcases and bodyguards "" , and speculated that the "" suitcases are full of money "" .
Another source disagreed .
He pointed out it was simpler to pay bribes "" via a secret account in Cyprus "" – an offshore route popular with rich Russians .
The ambassador offers the most detailed and apparently authoritative account so far of corruption in the Russian state and its security agencies .
He cites Transparency International 's 2009 survey which confirms Russia as the world 's most corrupt major economy .
The report estimates bribery costs Russia $ 300bn ( £ 190bn ) a year , about 18 % of its gross domestic product .
Beyrle also reported allegations about Baturina , who heads the largest construction company in Moscow .
After Luzhkov entered office , his wife became Russia 's wealthiest woman , amassing a fortune put at $ 1.8bn .
Since her husband 's sacking she has spent most of her time abroad , with the couple 's teenage daughters moving to London .
Luzhkov 's dubious friends and associates , the US alleged , included Vyacheslav Ivankov – a recently murdered and notorious Russian mafia boss known as Yaponchik – and other "" reputedly corrupt "" Duma deputies . ""
[ Source removed ] said that the Moscow government has links to many different criminal groups and it regularly takes cash bribes from businesses . ""
According to Beyrle , the same system of bribery worked in Russia 's provinces : "" The governors collect money based on bribes , almost resembling a tax system , throughout their regions . ""
As in Moscow , businesses paid off the FSB , the interior ministry and the militia who "" all have their distinctive money collection systems "" .
( Moscow police heads also reportedly had a "" secret war chest of money … used to solve problems that the Kremlin decides , such as rigging elections "" . )
Deputies in Russia 's parliament generally had to buy their seats in government , Beyrle 's cable suggested .
"" They need money to get to the top , but once they are there , their positions become quite lucrative money - making opportunities . ""
His allegations are likely to be most embarrassing for the Kremlin , after a high - profile campaign by Medvedev against corruption .
So far it has shown few results .
Beyrle noted that Putin and Medvedev faced a tricky dilemma when deciding Luzhkov 's fate .
He was a "" trusted deliverer of votes "" for United Russia , Putin 's pro - Kremlin party , Beyrle suggested .
Against this , the Kremlin had to weigh up what the ambassador claimed to be "" Luzhkov 's connections to the criminal world "" .
Another cable sought to lift the lid on Luzhkov 's business empire , much of it acquired using city funds to invest in "" less than transparent "" projects sealing agreements with former Soviet countries including Moldova , Uzbekistan , Georgia , Armenia and Azerbaijan .
The projects deliberately promoted Luzhkov 's "" nationalist foreign policy "" , it reported .
Luzhkov channelled cash to separatist pro - Russian movements in Ukraine and the Baltics .
"" This was ' at the behest of the Russian government , thereby giving the government of Russia plausible deniability when accused of funding certain political parties . ""
He also struck deals in the separatist regions of neighbouring countries , including South Ossetia and Abkhazia in Georgia , and Transnistria in Moldova .
In Kosovo he used Moscow city funds to build housing for ethnic Serbian refugees , while in Bulgaria he bought beach resorts on the Black Sea for city hall staff . ""
The Moscow city government has cultivated its influence in far - flung Russian regions as well as in foreign countries , ostensibly for the benefit of its citizens but to a greater extent for the city 's well - connected business elites , "" the cable concluded ."

A L SECTION 01 OF 02 LONDON 001837 SIPDIS STATE FOR EUR / RUS
, EUR / WE EO 12958 DECL : 07/09/2018 TAGS PGOV , ECON , ENRG , PREL , UK , RS SUBJECT : FOREIGN OFFICE SEES BROWN - MEDVEDEV TALKS LEADING TO WARMER UK - RUSSIAN RELATIONS
Classified By :
Political Counselor Richard M. Mills Jr. for reasons 1.4 ( b ) and ( d ) 1 .
( C ) Summary .
Prime Minister Gordon Brown and Russian President Dmitry Medvedev used their first one - on - one meeting at the G8 summit to build a friendly rapport rather than "" score points "" on smaller contentious issues , said the Foreign Office ( FCO ) to members of the diplomatic community .
According to the FCO , Brown and Medvedev both expressed frustration at the stalled dialogue between the two governments , and pledged to reopen top - level lines of communication .
They agreed on several issues , including support of a post - Kyoto framework , reformation of international institutions , and increased dialogue on climate change .
At the same time , the pair did not dwell on more controversial issues , such as Kosovo 's independence and the Litvinenko murder .
The FCO , s overall assessment of the meeting was positive , and the FCO 's Russian Office sees in Medvedev a leader more open to domestic liberalization and cooperation with Britain and the West than was his predecessor .
2 .
( SBU ) Summary continued .
Though the Brown - Medvedev meeting touched on important international issues , the FCO said the most important outcome were signs of a thaw in top - level UK - Russian relations .
As an example , they pointed to conversations with the Russian government regarding Zimbabwe and progress in gaining Moscow 's support for some G8 action .
Encouraged by the prospects of improving relations under Medvedev , the FCO believes that now may not be the time to renegotiate items such as the Russia - EU Partnership and Cooperation Agreement ( PCA ) , and that better agreements with Moscow may be reached later , if Medvedev can successfully liberalize parts of Russian society .
End Summary .
Litvinenko ----------
3 .
( C / NF )
PM Brown briefly brought up the Litvinenko murder case and the extradition request , and Medvedev apparently sought to bury the matter by referring to it as a "" legal issue . ""
Medvedev said that it was a "" sad affair , "" but that it should be a matter left to the courts .
FCO reported that no transformative dialogue occurred , and that no progress was made on the issue .
4 .
( C / NF )
In a separate meeting on the day of the briefing , Cabinet Office Director General Margaret Aldred confirmed to the DCM that the Brown meeting had been "" fairly relaxed "" and not strained .
Aldred said the cost of the fall - out to HMG from the Litvinenko issue was an end to close cooperation with Russian intelligence ( FSB ) on counterterrorism and other global issues .
Visas and Diplomatic Relations
------------------------------ 5 .
( C / NF ) Brown and Medvedev made little progress on the issue of diplomatic visas , which are still being restricted by both countries as part of the fall - out from the Litvinenko case .
The FCO reported that Medvedev was apparently upset over reports in the British media , appearing the same week as the G8 meeting , on Russian espionage activities in the UK .
6 .
( C / NF )
According to the FCO , HMG has had good reasons to refuse many Russian visa requests .
HMG officials see a real "" intelligence threat from "" Russia ( in addition to China ) , and regret a "" missed opportunity "" in the late 1990s and early 2000s to assess these intelligence threats .
FCO officials explained that the Russian government is still restricting visas to UK diplomats , that HMG is not be able to fully staff its embassy in Russia , and that local Russian hires have been harassed by the FSB .
Accordingly , HMG is restricting the number of visas issued to Russian officials .
The FCO reports that HMG had proposed a deal on easing visa restrictions , but that Russia is requiring that HMG consult with the FSB on any mutual visa agreement .
HMG continues to refuse to engage directly with the FSB , pending resolution of the Litvinenko murder case .
British Petroleum ----------------- 7 .
( SBU ) Medvedev confirmed to Brown that he had met with Russian shareholders of TNK - BP , and indicated to them that they could seek legal recourse through Russian courts , if they had concerns with how the joint venture was operating .
International Institutions LONDON 00001837 002 OF 002 -------------------------- 8 .
( SBU ) Medvedev brought up the need for major reform of international institutions , one of the PM 's main international initiatives .
Medvedev told Brown that international financial institutions need to be more engaged in managing the global credit crunch .
British Council
--------------- 9 .
( SBU ) Medvedev told Brown that while Russia no longer views the British Council in Russia as a "" den of spies , "" there still exist legal issues regarding the British Council , s activities in Russia .
Medvedev implied that politicians are not in a position to discuss what is or is not legal , and that Russian courts will make the final decisions regarding the British Council , s Russian operations .
Kyoto Protocol
-------------- 10 .
( SBU ) Medvedev indicated to Brown that Russia might be willing to support a 2012 post - Kyoto framework , but expressed concerns about the rapid industrialization of China and India and its potential to undermine any international agreement on carbon emissions .
FCO , s
Analysis : Medvedev is not Putin ------------------------------------- 11 .
( C / NF )
FCO officials expressed optimism that Medvedev will bring a partial liberalization to Russian political life .
They see signs of a slow break with Putin , including the former President , s failure to attend the G8 summit , the retirement of several high - ranking Putin - appointed generals , and the appointment of Antoly Chubais , a liberal and close Medvedev ally , to the presidency of Rosnanotech , which FCO views as a huge "" Kremlin slush fund .
""
On the other hand , several of Putin , s men are still in the upper echelons of the Kremlin , though the FCO believes that they will be removed over the next few years .
12 .
( C / NF )
FCO officials said that the EU should hold off on signing a new PCA , which expires at the end of 2008 , and wait to see if Medvedev liberalizes parts of Russian society before agreeing to long - term commitments .
The FCO stressed that the next few years should be geared towards improving upper - level UK - Russian relations , and that high - level visits are the way forward .
HMG is planning several visits to Russia in the fall , and will receive high - level Russian officials early next year .

2010-12-02,"At last , the Wiki - worm today turns on the seriously bad guys , correcting a little of the distinctly asymmetrical and frequently glib anti - Americanism of so much of what we have all read so far .
Seatbelts time in the Kremlin , and no trip to the Fifa World Cup showdown in Zurich for thin - skinned Tsar Vlad , Batman to President Dmitry Medvedev 's Robin ...
The UK being snowbound , it 's a good morning to be reminded just how much post - Soviet Russia has become a lawless state â€ “ not that Russia has ever been much of a constitutional society
â€ “ because these lawless forces now control a big slice of the oil and gas needed to stop rich western Europeans freezing on days like today .
That strategic dependence may explain why Luke Harding 's gripping account of what US diplomatic cable traffic says about Vladimir Putin 's "" mafia state "" includes alarming but unsurprising evidence
â€ “ like so much in the Wiki download â€ “ that France and Germany back off from offending Moscow too much .
After all , Paris ( 1814 and again in 1815 ) and Berlin ( 1945 ) have both been occupied by Russian troops , just as Moscow has been occupied by French troops ( 1812 ) , but ( narrowly ) not by German ones , who have occupied Paris at least three times on my calculation : 1814 - 15 , 1870 and 1940 .
And I 'm not even including assorted Goths , Huns and Vandals who reduced the mighty Roman Empire to an agricultural backwater .
People remember these things .
Not that it is likely happen that way next time .
The Russians just have to turn the gas down â€
“ as they do in Ukraine and other near - neighbours when they get uppity .
Will the Yanks step in to help out ?
Not so sure next time ; they 're no longer so Atlantic - minded
and they do n't think much of their European Nato allies ; they 're mostly not loyal â€ “ or even grateful .
Yet American military protection is so much more wholesome than the Mafia variety .
Yes , I do know about postwar Italy .
Lots of good details surface in Harding 's reports , points that highlight the dilemmas that daily face statesmen and lesser official mortals .
Remember that unsavoury Anglo - Scottish deal to release the Libyan Lockerbie bomber on "" humanitarian grounds "" , which so annoyed Washington ?
It makes sense â€ “
it always did â€ “ to think in terms of better access for BP to nasty Colonel Gaddafi 's carbon treasures that may help keep us warm .
The cable revelations today again make a link between policy and votes .
David Miliband is reported to have been especially concerned about atrocities in Sri Lanka because of UK Sri Lankan votes .
Yesterday Liam Fox , the coalition 's accident - prone defence secretary , was found to be assuring Washington he could be tougher on Pakistan because â€ “ unlike Labour â€
“
the Tories do not rely on British - Pakistani votes .
Labour pandering to Muslim voters , eh ?
You could have fooled me .
That Iraq war , who 'd have thought it ?
But all politicians make such calculations
â€
“ Irish , Scots , Jewish , Sri Lankan Tamils â€ “ and why not ?
It 's part of their job .
Lyndon Johnson knew he 'd lose the white southern working class if he gave American blacks full voting rights .
Ditto Tony Blair with Muslims over Iraq .
Believe it or not , politicians sometimes do what they think is right .
In the hands of reporters such as Harding , who can drill down into the cables and provide proper context , the Wiki dossiers illuminate the world as it often is , not as we might like it to be .
It 's not that Moscow 's mayor 's office is the only corrupt regime in a capital city .
Washington 's mayor in my time there ended up in jail .
Jacques Chirac 's mayoralty in Paris 20 years ago is still the subject of speculation and unsavoury allegation .
The late Harold Washington , a good mayor of Chicago , humorously boasted he was the first mayor to go to jail ( tax evasion ) before he became mayor .
It 's one of those Spanish investigative judges who provided much of today 's Russian dossier â€ “ an odd thing to do , but life is like that â€ “ and Spain too has its issues .
Russia , of course , has always been an autocracy .
Reading Alexander Herzen 's memoirs , Childhood , Youth and Exile , as I mentioned doing recently , is a moving and humane but jaw - dropping account of the corrupt incompetence in tsarist Russia , mitigated by countless examples of human kindness , courage and honourable conduct .
I think of the old general , a hero of 1812 , who went to the tsar and explained that his life was his monarch 's to command , but that he could not join a rigged panel to condemn Herzen and his hot - headed , idealistic young friends because "" it offends my honour "" .
The tsar accepted his refusal â€ “ as Stalin , building on his autocratic , Romanov inheritance , would not have done .
So fresh light shed on the poisoning of dissident Alexander Litvinenko in a London hotel in 2006 â€ “ German intelligence found polonium contamination everywhere the prime suspect went en route to Britain , but thought better of making trouble â€ “ is hardly surprising .
It 's what unaccountable tsarist secret services do , always have done , often not very well precisely because they are unaccountable .
The difference between them and us is that our intelligence services â€ “ like our ministers and our mayors
â€ “ are constrained by enforcible law .
It gets bent
â€
“ see today 's account of how the Yanks got to keep their cluster bombs â€ “ and sometimes broken .
But the lines of accountability are many and generally solid .
I sometimes think that British judges â€ “ pretty silly , some of their observations suggest â€ “ give elected politicians too hard a time .
Do n't you cringe when one of them likens a problematic policy to those of Hitler or Stalin ?
Foolish judge .
But foolish judges , like reckless or dishonest newspapers , are better than not having either in any meaningful sense of independent authority .
The much - vaunted independence of the US courts is likely to be tested in coming days as Washington exerts pressure on WikiLeaks via the closure of Amazon 's hosting function â€ “ and by other means .
We 'll see .
The Obama administration has been angry ( it 's another blow ) but pretty level - headed so far , unlike some Republican loudmouths who seem to think that Julian Assange , WikiLeaks 's quixotic founder , can be convicted of treason in the US , even though he 's a boy from smalltown Australia .
We 're told he 's in Britain â€
“
so I assume he 's not .
As I keep saying here , what WikiLeaks is inadvertently demonstrating both the relative impotence of the United States â€ “ for all its wealth and power â€ “ and â€ “ for all its misconduct
â€ “ its generally well - intended attempts to uphold law and an open international system .
Today 's Guardian 's editorial catches that balance better than does today 's column by my colleague Seumas Milne who , as he occasionally does , sees only American arrogance and imperial reach .
But even Seumas sees that US power "" has begun to flounder "" â€ “ as it has .
What WikiLeaks reveals today about one of the emerging BRIC â€ “ Brazil , Russia , India and China â€ “ economies , gives pause for thought before we assume that the post - American future is certain to be an improvement ."
2010-12-02,"All the newspapers , television channels and radio stations owned by members of the Russian government will be put up for sale .
Presidential aide Arkady Dvorkovich made the announcement following a speech by President Dmitry Medvedev in which he said that public figures should not be the owners of "" factories , newspapers and steamships . ""
"" They are to be sold , but the date has n't been established yet , "" Dvorkovich was quoted as saying .
That would be some sell - off because it is estimated that around 80 % of Russia 's regional press is currently owned by the corresponding local authorities .
Though Dvorkovich talked of the need to focus on nurturing an independent media , sales may be triggered because of the high cost of running papers and TV channels .

2010-12-02,"Indian defence officials are scrambling to finalise the details of a series of arms contracts worth tens of billions of pounds to be signed during presidential visits by Nicolas Sarkozy of France and Dmitry Medvedev of Russia this month .
The emerging south Asian power has embarked on a huge and ambitious modernisation of its military that will see up to Â£100bn spent on weapons systems , technology , planes , ships and submarines over the next five years , according to some estimates .
Indian strategists , historically focused on their western frontier with Pakistan , now fear being outgunned by the Chinese military .
The size of the Indian market has sparked a scramble among western leaders to win lucrative deals for their ailing economies .
India 's state news agency reported that Russia had offered its latest low - noise Amur-1650 class submarines to India in an estimated Â£6bn deal .
The Indians are already building French - designed submarines and Paris is keen to persuade Delhi to expand the current programme rather than opt for a new contract with Moscow .
By far the biggest deal is a Â£22.5bn joint agreement between Delhi and Moscow to develop a "" fifth - generation "" advanced fighter jet .
Likely to be signed during Medvedev 's pre - Christmas visit , it will see Indian and Russian engineers collaborating on the design of the aircraft and production split between the two nations .
During Sarkozy 's visit next week , the French hope to lobby Delhi to buy more than 120 Rafale fighter jets for about Â£8bn next year .
A Russian company also hopes to win the contract .
The two aircraft projects together will cost India the equivalent of its entire education budget for the next seven years .
At least a third of Indian adults are illiterate .
During the recent visit of President Barack Obama , deals for transport aircraft and other military equipment worth several billion pounds were concluded .
American officials said they had created thousands of jobs ."
2010-12-04,"It was as if WikiLeaks had turned a black and white photo of prime ministers and presidents into a Technicolor carnival fizzing with candour and comedy .
Leading the parade on Monday were Batman and Robin , aka Vladimir Putin and Dmitry Medvedev , the prime minister and president of Russia who were compared to the characters by the US embassy in Moscow , leading Putin to accuse the US of slander in an interview with Larry King on CNN .
Meanwhile Turkmenistan 's president , Gurbanguly Berdymukhamedov , donned a "" navy blue sailing cap , a French - style white - and - blue striped shirt and binoculars hanging around his neck "" to hold a cabinet meeting on his new yacht , donated by a Russian company .
He had wanted a vessel the size of Roman Abramovich 's , but had had to settle for something smaller to get into the Caspian Sea .
And step forward , Silvio Berlusconi , whose "" frequent late nights and penchant for partying hard mean he does not get sufficient rest , "" Giampiero Cantoni , the then chairman of the Italian senate 's defence committee , told the US embassy in Rome .
Berlusconi reportedly laughed at the leaks .
It sounded like he might get on well with Kim Jong Il who was , according to the cables , "" a good drinker "" who liked to indulge in wine and spirits after talking shop with Chinese diplomats .
The president of Chechnya , Ramzan Kadyrov , also likes a celebration , according to William Burns , then US ambassador to Moscow , who attended a Dagestani wedding and watched as Kadyrov "" danced clumsily with his gold - plated automatic stuck down the back of his jeans "" .
Kadyrov showered dancers with $ 100 notes and gave the happy couple an unusual wedding present – "" a five kilo lump of gold "" .
But this was just the start of a the revelations from the cables , thanks in part to the reporting skills of many of the diplomats writing back to Washington , who time and again pithily combined anecdote with subtle judgment .
The Paris embassy neatly skewered Nicolas Sarkozy , the French president , as having "" a thin - skinned and authoritarian style "" and illustrated it with an account of how aides had diverted his presidential plane to avoid him seeing the Eiffel Tower illuminated in the Turkish colours for the state visit of Turkey 's prime minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan .
They worried it would offend him because he is strongly opposed to Turkey 's application for EU membership .
For plain speaking , you need look no further than Britain .
Prince Andrew could be found speaking in Kyrgzstan at a business hotel , where he "" verged on the rude "" , lashing out at "" those ( expletive ) journalists … who poke their noses everywhere "" and accusing corruption investigators of "" idiocy "" .
Sir Jock Stirrup , Britain 's then chief of defence staff , branded Pakistan president Asif Ali Zadari a "" numbskull "" .
And talking of speaking , George Osborne 's "" high pitched vocal delivery "" suggested he "" lacked the necessary gravitas "" , according to a report of the 2008 Conservative party conference by Richard LeBaron , deputy head of mission at the US embassy in London .
Cameroon 's president , Paul Biya , described as running government finances "" like a petty cash fund "" , booked himself and his entourage a $ 1.2 m three week holiday by chartered jet to the French resort of La Baule .
They took 43 rooms in two luxury hotels costing $ 60,000 a night , went on shopping sprees and splashed cash on casino nights .
"" We have received first - hand accounts of Biya 's entourage paying to refuel his airplane with suitcases filled with hundreds of thousands of dollars in cash , "" reported the US embassy in Cameroon .
"" When Biya traveled to the United Nations general assembly in September 2008 , a member of his entourage was caught as he tried to escape from Biya 's Geneva hotel with a bag filled with 3.4 m Swiss francs ( about $ 6.8 million ) in cash . ""
Sultan Qaboos bin Said of Oman just beat Muammar Gaddafi of Libya to the award for world leader with biggest entourage .
The sultan took off on a two month Mediterranean holiday in 2008 on his yacht with 700 people in tow , according to the Italian embassy in Muscat , who processed the visas .
Gaddafi , who was branded "" just strange "" by one of Sultan Qaboos 's advisers , wanted to go one better and travel with 800 acolytes to perform the Hajj in Mecca .
The Saudi Arabians declined his request , leading to bizarre recriminations involving Gaddafi trying to change the date of Eid because he said his scientists could see the crescent moon better than other authorities ."
2010-12-09,"Russia has suggested that Julian Assange should be awarded the Nobel peace prize , in an unexpected show of support from Moscow for the jailed WikiLeaks founder .
In what appears to be a calculated dig at the US , the Kremlin urged non - governmental organisations to think seriously about "" nominating Assange as a Nobel Prize laureate "" . ""
Public and non - governmental organisations should think of how to help him , "" the source from inside president Dmitry Medvedev 's office told Russian news agencies .
Speaking in Brussels , where Medvedev was attending a Russia - EU summit yesterday , the source went on : "" Maybe , nominate him as a Nobel Prize laureate .
"" Russia 's reflexively suspicious leadership appears to have come round to WikiLeaks , having decided that the ongoing torrent of disclosures are ultimately far more damaging and disastrous to America 's long - term geopolitical interests than they are to Russia 's .
The Kremlin 's initial reaction to stories dubbing Russia a corrupt "" mafia state "" and kleptocracy was , predictably , negative .
Last week Medvedev 's spokesman dubbed the revelations "" not worthy of comment "" while Putin raged that a US diplomatic cable comparing him to Batman and Medvedev to Robin was "" arrogant "" and "" unethical "" .
State TV ignored the claims .
Subsequent disclosures , however , that Nato had secretly prepared a plan in case
Russia invaded its Baltic neighbours have left the Kremlin smarting .
Today Russia 's foreign minister Sergei Lavrov said Nato had to explain why it privately considered Russia an enemy while publicly describing it warmly as a "" strategic partner "" and ally .
Nato should make clear its position on WikiLeaks cables published by the Guardian alleging that the alliance had devised plans to defend Poland , Latvia , Lithuania and Estonia against Russia , Lavrov said .
"" With one hand , Nato seeks agreement with us on joint partnership , and with the other , it makes a decision that it needs to defend .
So when is Nato more sincere ? ""
Lavrov asked today .
"" We have asked these questions and are expecting answers to them .
We think we are entitled to that . ""
Lavrov said his attitude towards the leaked US state department cables was "" philosophical "" .
"" It is interesting to read , including what ambassadors write to provide a stream of information to their capitals , "" he admitted .
Dmitry Rogozin , Russia 's hardline ultra - nationalist ambassador to Nato , also today voiced his support for the embattled Assange .
He tweeted that Assange 's arrest and incarceration on Monday at the City of Westminster magistrates ' court demonstrated that there was "" no media freedom "" in the west .
Assange 's "" fate "" amounted to "" political persecution "" and a lack of human rights , the ambassador said .
In London , meanwhile , Russia 's chargé d'affaires and acting ambassador in the UK , Alexander Sternik , said relations with Britain had improved since the coalition came to power .
He complained , however , about the hostile reaction in the British media after Fifa 's executive committee voted that Russia – and not England – should host the 2018 World Cup .
In a briefing to journalists this morning , Sternik said : "" While the English bid was technically a strong one , the Russian bid was in line with the well - known Fifa philosophy of opening new frontiers for world football .
The vote result was therefore quite logical , and while the disappointment of many in England is understandable , the media outrage was a step too far .
It 's not cricket , as the English say . """
2010-12-23,"MPs in Russia could approve a new strategic arms reduction treaty with the US as early as tomorrow after President Dmitry Medvedev welcomed the pact .
The country 's overwhelmingly pro - Kremlin parliament is likely to push the agreement through swiftly , despite doubts over Washington 's desire to station a missile defence shield in Europe .
Medvedev 's office said today he was "" pleased to learn that the United States Senate has ratified the Start Treaty and expressed hope that the State Duma and the Federation Council [ lower and upper houses of parliament ] will be ready to consider this issue shortly and to ratify the document "" .
The US Senate voted 71 to 26 in favour of the treaty yesterday , despite expectations that Republican members might try to block its passage .
The speaker of the State Duma , Boris Gryzlov , said the Kremlin - controlled United Russia party , which dominates the chamber , was ready to approve the treaty at a parliamentary session scheduled tomorrow .
The speaker of the Federation Council , Sergei Mironov , said he could push it through the same day .
Under New Start , as the agreement is called , strategic nuclear warheads deployed by each country will be reduced to 1,550 within seven years .
Deployed missile launchers would be cut to 700 .
Mikhail Margelov , head of the Federation Council 's foreign relations committee , said the treaty "" represents a shift away from cold war mentality and demonstrates that Russia and the US are focused on achieving 21st - century global security "" .
Its ratification in both countries will be seen as step forward after a difficult period in bilateral relations since Medvedev and Barack Obama signed the treaty in Prague in April .
Two months after that meeting , the US exposed 10 Russian sleeper agents living in New York and Washington , although the fallout was partly defused when they were exchanged for four men jailed in Russia who had allegedly worked for western intelligence agencies .
Relations appeared to be warming last month when the Nato military alliance invited Russia to participate in a US - led missile defence system about which Moscow is deeply suspicious .
But the thaw came under threat when WikiLeaks revealed US diplomatic cables suggesting Russia is a "" mafia state "" .
Analysts say the treaty overrides such irritants , showing progress in the attempts to improve ties with Russia , which began after Obama came to power .
Sergei Rogov , head of the influential US and Canada Institute in Moscow , told the RIA Novosti news agency : "" It is , of course , a positive step and it shows that the ' re - set ' in Russian - American relations is bringing real results , but the question now is , what next ? ""
Top of the agenda for the Kremlin will be hammering out details of its role in the missile defence project .
Vladimir Putin , the prime minister , warned this month that Russia would be obliged to deploy "" new strike forces "" on its borders if talks with Nato over the system failed to show progress ."
2010-12-23,"The Russian government today welcomed the US Senate 's decision to ratify a groundbreaking nuclear arms control treaty between the two countries .
However , Russian legislators said they need to study the document before following suit , despite an agreement between President Dmitry Medvedev and President Barack Obama when they signed the New Start treaty in April that the ratification process should be conducted simultaneously .
Medvedev 's spokeswoman Natalya Timakova said the president hoped that both houses of the Russian parliament would ratify the pact , but added they would need to analyse the Senate 's conditions before making their decision .
The New Start treaty aims to limit each country 's strategic nuclear warheads to 1,550 , down from the current ceiling of 2,200 .
It would also establish a system for monitoring and verification , after US weapons inspections ended last year after a previous arms control deal expired .
The US Senate yesterday voted overwhelmingly in favour of a new strategic arms reduction treaty with Russia to reduce their nuclear arsenals .
The treaty has been Obama 's main foreign policy achievement despite his struggling against Republican opposition in the Senate , where a two - thirds majority was needed for ratification .
With only hours of the Senate left before members headed off for Christmas , senators voted 71 to 26 in favour , a much bigger majority than had been widely predicted .
In the end , 13 Republicans defied their own leadership to vote for the treaty .
The vote topped off a series of legislative victories for Obama over the last few weeks .
Before heading off tonight to join his family in Hawaii for the Christmas holiday , Obama trumpeted these successes at a White House press conference .
He noted that a lot of people in the aftermath of the November congressional elections , which proved to be a disaster for the Democrats , had predicted stalemate in Washington DC .
But "" it has been a season of progress "" , Obama said , adding : "" We are not doomed to endless gridlock . ""
Obama ran through the legisation that had been passed , of which the most important were the repeal of the ban on gay personnel serving openly in the military , which he signed into law earlier today , and the extension of tax cuts , a messy compromise with the Republicans but which he hopes will help stimulate the economy .
Other legislation includes one on food safety and another , which due for approval within the next few hours , will provide financial help for police , fire officers and others suffering respiratory problems from the 9/11 attack on New York .
On top of the health reform legislation earlier this year , the legislation passed in ""
lame - duck "" Congress â€ “ the session between the 2 November election and the new Congress in January , traditionally a dead zone
â€ “ provides Obama with a substantial legacy less than two years into his presidency .
He described the legislation passed in the last few weeks as "" the most productive post - election period we 've had in decades "" .
He said the Start treaty was important for US national security but also for maintaining good relations with Russia .
The treaty will reduce strategic nuclear warheads deployed by each country to 1,550 within seven years .
Deployed missile launchers would be cut to 700 .
John Kerry , chairman of the Senate foreign relations committee , said : "" This historic Senate vote makes our country safer and moves the world further away from the danger of nuclear disaster .
The winners are not defined by party or ideology . ""
The winners are the American people , who are safer with fewer Russian missiles aimed at them , and who benefit knowing that our co - operation with Russia in curbing Iran 's nuclear ambitions and supplying our troops in Afghanistan can be strengthened . """
2010-12-28,"Vladimir Putin said , earlier this month , that a thief must be in jail .
After his president , Dmitry Medvedev , said no official had the right to comment before a verdict had been reached , Putin said he was referring to the first conviction of the oligarch Mikhail Khodorkovsky , not the second , which took place yesterday .
Even if we discount the flagrant breach of due process that Putin 's comment constituted – it is only one of a lengthy list – his words rang hollow .
As everyone who lives there knows , thieves in Russia do n't exclusively belong in a jail .
They belong in government .
They are in and around the Kremlin .
Every official , high and low , steals .
Whether you end up in jail , in government or owning a chunk of Cyprus , London or Nice , stems ultimately from a political calculation .
Get the politics right and you stay a very wealthy man , whether you have stolen assets or not .
The second trial against Khodorkovsky is not about theft .
It is about fear : the fear of what would happen if this particular victim of misjustice were to be released now .
Even before the prime minister spoke , the guilty verdict was a foregone conclusion .
It will raise no eyebrows .
But the length of sentence will , because on that hinges the personal political and business fortunes of the people who own Russia .
It 's not that Khodorkovsky is a popular man , or that Russians have forgotten his past as a Kremlin insider during Yeltsin 's period of office .
Nor is there any immediate risk that the several hundred who braved arrest outside the Moscow court house yesterday would become hundreds of thousands chanting "" freedom "" and "" Russia without Putin "" outside the prime minister 's office .
With this verdict the prosecution has stopped becoming merely farcical .
It has ceased being a prosecution at all .
It has become a persecution and Khodorkovsky has entered the ranks of politically repressed .
As such , whenever he is released , he will be a magnet for all the other injustices suffered under this regime .
No one will believe President Medvedev when he talks about the rule of law in Russia .
With Khodorkovsky sitting in jail , the president 's words remain empty rhetoric .
But outside it , Khodorkovsky will be even more difficult for the Kremlin to deal with .
And so the real question of this trial has yet to be answered .
More likely it has yet to be decided on .
The prosecutors have called for a six - year sentence , which could keep the man in jail until late 2017 , near the end of the six - year term of the next president .
The timing of his release will not be decided by an independent judge weighing the evidence , the severity of the crime , and the danger posed by his release to the public .
It will be decided by the president who will be weighing up the political danger posed to him by the clans who sent Khodorkovsky down .
With Putin sitting on the fulcrum of power , balancing competing political , commercial and ministerial clans , the length of sentence Khodorkovsky receives will be the key indicator of which clan is currently calling the shots .
This is why it was important for the US secretary of state , Hillary Clinton , to weigh in last night .
By saying that the case raises serious questions about selective prosecutions and about the rule of the law being overshadowed by political considerations , she was stating the blinding obvious .
But as someone who pushed the reset button , and as a representative of an administration who pushed Start through congress , her words should resonate inside a Kremlin that has factored in the relationship with America as a foreign policy priority for Russia .
President Barack Obama or Chancellor Angela Merkel are as good an ally as an unreformed Russia is likely to get .
All the alternatives are worse , and the generation of toadies , like Silvio Berlusconi , are on their way out .
This should not be lost on Putin as he plots his next move ."
2011-01-18,"Dmitry Medvedev today reiterated Russia 's endorsement of an independent Palestinian state , amid mounting concern in Israel over a push for wider international recognition .
The Russian president , on a visit to the West Bank , stopped short of explicitly recognising a Palestinian state based on 1967 borders but repeated the position the then Soviet Union adopted in 1988 .
"" Russia 's position remains unchanged , "" he said .
"" Russia made its choice a long time ago ...
We supported and we will support the inalienable right of the Palestinian people to an independent state with its capital in East Jerusalem . ""
His comments will boost a Palestinian drive to win recognition of a state based on all territory in the West Bank , Gaza and East Jerusalem occupied by Israel in 1967 .
In the past two months a string of Latin American countries have recognised a Palestinian state , including Brazil , Argentina and Ecuador .
Palestinian officials , frustrated at the stalled peace talks , are considering submitting a resolution on recognition to the UN security council â€ “ a move that would be vetoed by the US .
Israel has publicly dismissed the recent spate of endorsements , but some officials are concerned that it reflects growing sympathy for the Palestinian cause .
More countries are expected to recognise a Palestinian state ahead of the UN general assembly in September .
Israel has warned that a unilateral declaration of statehood would be a harmful step and that a Palestinian state can only be achieved through negotiations .
Medvedev 's comments carried additional weight because Russia is a member of the Middle East quartet of peacemakers , which also includes the US , the UN and the European Union .
The Russian president backed Palestinian demands that Israel renew a freeze on settlement building before talks can resume .
At a press conference in Jericho with the Palestinian president , Mahmoud Abbas , Medvedev said : "" We discussed the conditions for resuming talks with Israel , which include continued self - control and strictly abiding by commitments and , before anything else , freezing all Israeli settlement activities in the West Bank and East Jerusalem . ""
Abbas said : "" There are two options , either peace or terror and violence .
We shall not choose terror and violence . ""
The Palestinians claim that continued settlement activity is fast making a viable state impossible .
There are around half a million Israelis living in settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem , which are illegal under international law .
In 1988 the Soviet Union backed a declaration of statehood by Yasser Arafat , the leader of the Palestine Liberation Organisation , a move that gained little traction outside the Soviet bloc .
The planned Israeli leg of Medvedev 's trip fell victim to long - running industrial action by staff at the foreign ministry over pay .
As a result , the Russian president entered the West Bank across the historic Allenby bridge from Jordan , which was shut to normal traffic ."
2011-01-25,"Dmitry Medvedev today accused government officials of allowing security checks at Domodedovo airport to slip into "" a state of anarchy "" , amid reports that a Black Widow suicide bomber detonated the bomb that killed 35 people there yesterday .
The Russian president told chiefs of the federal security service ( FSB ) that those responsible for transport security "" could be dismissed or face other sanctions "" as a result of the negligence .
"" We will have to put in place a much tougher inspection system , total inspections .
It will likely take passengers longer , but it 's the only way out , "" he said .
"" The information available to us [ from Domodedovo ] suggests that it was simply a state of anarchy .
People were able to enter [ the airport ] from any place .
Control over people 's movements was partial and did not apply to those waiting for passengers . ""
Medevedev said earlier in the day : "" What happened shows that there were clear security violations . ""
The massive blast took place at about 4.30pm beside the international arrivals hall at Moscow 's busiest airport .
The bomb , packed with nuts , bolts and ball bearings , ripped through the area , wounding up to 180 people .
A Briton killed in the attack was named today as Gordon Campbell Cousland .
A second victim thought to be British turned out to be a Russian with dual Hungarian nationality .
James Barbour , a spokesman for the British embassy in Moscow , said : "" We are checking all hospitals to establish if there are any British citizens among the injured . ""
A source close to the investigation told the RIA Novosti news agency that the bomb was detonated by two people . ""
The blast occurred when a suspected female terrorist opened a bag .
She was accompanied by a man whose head was ripped off by the explosion , "" the source said .
Investigators had earlier suggested that a man aged 30 - 35 , whose remains they had collected , was the bomber .
The source added : "" It can not be ruled out that the terrorists wanted to leave the explosive device in the hall but the bomb was detonated inadvertently or by a remote control device . ""
The terror attack was carried out according to a scheme that is used by terrorists from the north Caucasus region , "" he said .
"" The blasts at the Rizhskaya subway station [ in 2004 ] and other explosions in the Moscow metro [ in 2010 ] were carried out similarly , when the terrorists were accompanied by militants . ""
The so - called Black Widows are women who become suicide bombers , often after their husbands and brothers are killed by security forces in Chechnya and other southern Russian republics gripped by Islamist insurgency .
It appeared the attackers were able to move freely to the point of detonation because there were no metal detectors at entrances to the airport .
Medvedev said it was "" our misfortune "" that increased security measures introduced after two planes that took off from Domodedovo were blown up in mid - air in 2004 had failed to prevent yesterday 's blast . ""
It is not so easy to carry such a large amount of explosives [ into an airport ] , "" he told reporters .
"" Everyone who has anything to do with the company who is in charge of making decisions there , as well as the management of the airport should be held to account for it . ""
Gennady Gudkov , a KGB veteran who is deputy head of the Duma 's security committee , said the attack showed the failure of the Kremlin 's anti - terrorism efforts .
"" There is now a queue of suicide bombers in the north Caucasus who are ready to blow themselves up wherever you like , "" he told the Kommersant newspaper .
Law enforcement agencies "" think they can ensure greater security by increasing the number of block - posts , passport checks and constant searches , but that 's not the case , "" he added .
"" The most important thing is to establish a network of agents and informers . ""
Vladimir Ovchinsky , a former head of Russia 's Interpol bureau , said the attack was enabled by "" criminal negligence "" on the part of commercial and state security agencies . ""
In reality , we need to admit that we have been at war with separatists and terrorists in the north Caucasus for almost 20 years , "" he told the Guardian . ""
After the wave of suicide and other attacks in Russia last year there was a desperate need to increase security at all points where the public concentrates in high numbers , including airports .
That did n't happen . ""
Referring to Moscow 's other main air hub , he said : "" I fly often from Sheremetyevo and Domodedovo myself and I would call the security system in both disastrous . ""
There were reports today that the Domodedovo blast may be linked to an incident in eastern Moscow on 31 December when a bomb exploded in a house , killing a woman .
Police later established she was a suicide bomber sent by Dagestani militants to attack the capital and who had mistakenly activated the device .
Russian media said the militants may have sent other bombers to Moscow in December , who could have targeted the airport yesterday ."
2011-01-25,"Russian President Dmitry Medvedev said today that officials at Moscow 's busiest airport must bear responsibility for security lapses which allowed a suspected suicide bomber to blow himself up , killing at least 35 people , including at least one Briton .
The bomber entered the ground floor of Domodedovo airport 's terminal building apparently unchallenged yesterday .
He then made his way to the crowded international arrivals zone .
At 4.32pm local time he set off a massive explosive device , possibly hidden in a suitcase , causing a blast equivalent to 7 kg of TNT .
There have been claims that law enforcement officials were tipped off about a possible airport bombing â€ “ Russian opposition bloggers demanded to know why security measures had not been enhanced in response . ""
What happened shows that obviously there were violations in guaranteeing security .
And it should be answered for by those who make decisions there and by the management of the airport , "" Medvedev said .
He has postponed his departure to Switzerland for today 's World Economic Forum in Davos .
The dead Briton was named today as Gordon Campbell Cousland .
Russia 's emergencies ministry had said that two Britons were among the eight foreign citizens who died in the attack , but the UK foreign office said it could confirm only one death .
A Foreign Office spokesman said : "" Initial indications are that one British national was killed in the explosion at Domodedovo airport .
We are in contact with next of kin and providing consular assistance . ""
The consular team is continuing to investigate reports that a second British national was killed but we have no information to confirm this at this time .
"" Two flights from London Heathrow arrived at the airport shortly before the explosion .
British national Jeremy Spencer , who was on the BA flight which landed around 45 minutes before the fatal blast , was less than 100 metres away from the bomb blast .
Describing the moment the device detonated , he told BBC Radio 5 Live : "" There was a very loud boom that shook the floor and ceiling and then there was dust falling down from the ceiling .
We were told it was a car bomb by some fellow travellers , but initially I thought it was a construction accident as there was some work being done inside the terminal . ""
Spencer , who was travelling alone , was making his way through passport control when the blast happened . ""
After the explosion people were reaching for their mobile phones to find out what had happened , "" he said .
"" It was quite calm where I was and there was no evacuation notice or anything like that . ""
Up to 168 people were injured , many of them critically .
Relatives waiting to meet family members and arriving passengers were killed instantly .
Witness Artyom Zhilenkov , 30 , who survived the blast , told the Guardian : "" There was a massive boom and then a wave of heat and pressure that swept along the floor , bent my legs and flung me aside .
"" I was looking toward a dark - skinned man when it happened .
I think it was the suitcase standing next to him that exploded . ""
According to unconfirmed reports , investigators found the head of a man aged 30 to 35 , who is thought to be the suicide bomber .
Video footage from the airport showed bodies seemingly piled in a heap , fires burning , and abandoned luggage .
Rescuers were shouting through the smoke .
Some of the wounded were transported to ambulances on baggage trolleys .
The blast was the worst terrorist attack in Russia since two female suicide bombers from the volatile Dagestan region blew themselves up on Moscow 's metro last March , killing 40 people .
The Kremlin insists the situation in Russia 's north Caucasus has stabilised after two brutal federal wars against Chechen rebels in 1994 - 1996 and 1999 - 2005 .
But the attack appears to show a renewed capacity by Islamist radicals to hit soft civilian targets in the capital .
The attack also comes at a time of political uncertainty for Russia .
The question of who will lead the country after presidential elections next year is so far unresolved .
It is unclear whether Vladimir Putin , Russia 's prime minister and pre - eminent political figure , will return to the Kremlin , or allow President Dmitry Medvedev , in effect Putin 's deputy , another term .
Domodedovo is the most modern and efficient of Moscow 's three airports , and is a hub for British Airways and BMI .
Both operate daily flights between London and Moscow , popular with Russians travelling to London and British expats based in the Russian capital .
BA 's flight 872 , with 165 passengers , landed at 3.46pm , followed by BMI flight BD891 , carrying 103 passengers and crew .
It touched down at 4.33pm , seconds after the blast .
The next BA flight , 874 , was halfway to Moscow when it turned round and returned to Heathrow .
Russian investigators were analysing CCTV footage from the scene , amid claims they had been warned a week ago about a possible airport bombing .
According to a law enforcement official , quoted by Russian news agencies , police were tracking three men and had been told an attack "" could take place "" .
One of the three could have been the suicide bomber , it was suggested .
Another source told the news agency Interfax : "" According to intelligence , three men may have been involved in organising the explosion , men who have been living in the region of the capital for some time .
They have been put on the wanted list . ""
He said the three suspects were believed to be militants from the north Caucasus .
They allegedly had connections to a woman who blew herself up in Moscow on 31 December and another who was later arrested in Volgograd .
"" It ca n't be ruled out that one of the three blew himself up at Domodedovo , "" the source said .
The attack is likely to be blamed on Islamist radicals .
Across its mountainous southern frontier the Russian state is fighting a group of determined and well - organised insurgents who want to establish a pan - Islamic caliphate .
The republics of Ingushetia , Chechnya , and Dagestan â€ “ where the insurgents operate â€ “ are gripped by conflict , with daily attacks on police and local security forces .
The Kremlin has responded to this threat to its integrity with characteristic brutality .
It has launched a series of special operations .
Last year , its special forces killed Said Buryatsky , a senior rebel and Russian - born Islamist convert , in a village in Ingushetia .
Another insurgent leader , Egyptian - born Saif Islam , was killed in Dagestan .
These killings may have prompted the two women to set off to Moscow last spring on a revenge suicide mission .
In 2008 , Doku Umarov , Chechnya 's most senior surviving rebel leader , promised to take his violent campaign to Russia 's towns and cities .
He indicated he had reconstituted the suicide brigades used to devastating effect during the second Chechen war â€ “ which involved the bombing of the Moscow metro in 2004 , as well as the hijacking of a Moscow theatre and the siege of Beslan , a school in south Ossetia in which 300 people , mainly children , died .
It appears that the rebels have once again demonstrated a capacity to hit deep into the heart of the Russian state ."
2011-01-26,"Dmitry Medvedev today sacked a senior transport official over the Domodedovo airport bombing as speculation over the identity of the suicide attacker who killed 35 people grew .
The Russian president instructed the interior ministry to "" shake up the entire transport police service "" , saying officers at airports had been "" absolutely passive "" about ensuring security , and dismissed Andrei Alekseyev , the chief of the ministry 's transport department for the central federal district .
Yesterday , Medvedev accused the airport 's management and senior government officials of negligence , saying security checks at Domodedovo were in "" a state of anarchy "" .
Investigators said all the dead had been identified except the presumed bomber , whose remains were being examined .
The Russian media published photographs of the man 's severed head .
About 110 people remain in hospital , 50 of them seriously injured .
Forensic evidence and the extent of the casualties suggest the device was detonated above floor level .
Speaking to the lifenews.ru website , which has strong links to the security services , a source close to the investigation said : "" The proportions of the head suggest it was a man of 175 cm to 182 cm , so the bomb exploded at a height of about 110 cm to 140 cm above the ground .
There is no doubt the head belongs to the bomber . ""
The source said the man 's features suggested he was from one of the North Caucasus nations , but an anthropologist argued that the features resembled those of an Arab .
No one has claimed responsibility for the attack , but police believe the attacker was probably linked to Islamist insurgents in Chechnya and neighbouring Muslim republics who have orchestrated previous attacks , including a dual bombing which killed 40 people on the Moscow metro last year .
Witnesses gave conflicting accounts of the moment the airport bomb was detonated on Monday .
Some said a woman was involved , some saw a suitcase explode and one man claimed he saw the bomber throw open his jacket and press a button on an explosives belt around his waist .
Several said the bomber shouted his name and the words : "" Now I 'm going to kill you all . ""
Earlier reports had suggested that a so - called Black Widow shakhidka ( suicide bomber ) , accompanied by a man , set off the explosion by opening a bag .
Images from surveillance cameras in the building show a sheet of flame ripping through the waiting area near the airport 's international arrivals hall , but the exact source of the blast is unclear ."
2011-01-27,"It has two whirlpool baths , a cinema and a range of 5,000 nautical miles .
At Â£26 m the 54-metre Sirius may look a little ostentatious for a world leader whose people have an average salary of Â£400 a month .
But it seems Dmitry Medvedev , the president of Russia , has thrown caution to the wind with his administration 's purchase of a "" trawler super - yacht "" .
Reports in Moscow say the Kremlin bought the boat last year from the Proteksan - Turquoise company in Istanbul , changing its name from Leo Fun .
The craft 's "" sophisticated and luxury interior features "" include a large salon , a master suite and five guest cabins , quarters for 12 crew and an artificial waterfall encased in glass .
Twin staircases lead to a bathing platform with "" a wide array of water toys and diving equipment "" .
Medvedev 's administration confirmed it had acquired a new yacht but refused to verify the price , or whether it was the Sirius .
Viktor Khrenikov , a spokesman , told the Vedomosti newspaper it had bought a second - hand craft late last year .
Khrenikov said it was still being fitted out .
"" Everything necessary for a president for work and relaxation has been thought of , "" he said .
"" The president could use her during the 2014 Olympics [ in the Black Sea port of Sochi ] , "" he added .
It is thought the Sirius will replace the presidential yacht , Kavkaz , which is already overdue for decommissioning .
Roman Abramovich , the owner of Chelsea FC , owns the world 's largest private yacht : a Â£288 m , 164-metre "" floating mansion "" with a helipad and a disco , called Eclipse .
Analysts believe it was no coincidence that Medvedev 's purchase emerged this week as he visited the World Economic Forum in Davos , Switzerland .
Behind a public mask of unity , business and political clans in the Kremlin and government are engaged in a struggle for power as the 2012 presidential election approaches .
Some want the supposedly more progressive Medvedev to continue , while others are behind Putin , the hawkish prime minister who is expected to return to the presidency .
Earlier this month , Russian websites published photographs of a secluded Â£600 m palace on the Black Sea coast which a businessman alleged was constructed secretly on Putin 's orders using money donated by oligarchs to develop Russia 's economy .
The prime minister 's spokesman has dismissed the claims.""When we hear about a yacht or a palace
it 's clear that someone has n't just walked past and noticed it by chance , "" said Nikolai Petrov , an expert on internal politics at the Carnegie Centre , Moscow .
"" We practically do n't have investigative journalism in Russia , we have different forms of leaks , "" he added ."
2011-02-01,"The Russian president , Dmitry Medvedev , has unveiled a huge monument to former president Boris Yeltsin , the latest stage in a campaign to revive the image of the country 's first post - Soviet leader . ""
Yeltsin 's strength helped us live through a difficult period when the foundation of Russia 's statehood was being created , "" Medvedev said at the ceremony in Yekaterinburg , the Urals city in which Yeltsin was born and launched his political career .
The monument â€ “ a white marble obelisk imprinted with Yeltsin 's image
â€ “ stands 33 ft ( 10 metres ) tall and is the first major political statue to be unveiled since the Soviet Union 's collapse .
"" The monument expresses determination and will â€ “ the traits that were most characteristic of Boris Yeltsin , "" Medvedev said .
Most Russians remember Yeltsin otherwise .
While he rode to the Kremlin in 1991 as the man who challenged Communist attempts to hold onto power , he is better known for the drunken antics and failed economic policies that marked his later years as president .
Until recently , the Russian leadership remained largely quiet about Yeltsin 's legacy .
His hand - picked successor , Vladimir Putin , has decried the 1990s as a time of chaos and built his own popularity on crafting a tough and controlled image that contrasts sharply with Yeltsin 's .
Putin was notably absent from the ceremony , which was attended by Yeltsin 's widow and two daughters .
It was timed to coincide with what would have been Yeltsin 's 80th birthday .
He died from heart failure in 2007 , having long been out of the public eye .
Events have been staged around Russia to celebrate his birthday , with a memorial concert due to be held at the Bolshoi Theatre tonight .
State - run media have widely reported the celebrations .
That may shock most Russians , with some 56 % continuing to think Yeltsin did more harm than good for the country , versus 20 % who remember the Yeltsin years as a good era , according to 2009 research by Russian pollster VTsIOM .
Yet his legacy is an important one for the Russian leadership .
Putin came to the presidency on New Year 's Eve 1999 , when Yeltsin went on national television to resign .
In an interview , Valentin Yumashev , Yeltsin 's son - in - law and former chief of staff , has hinted that the former president came to question that decision in later years .
Asked by Moskovsky Komsomolets whether he had been disappointed in Putin , Yumashev said : "" I wo n't say that 's not true . ""
I think he would have thought , with the resources and opportunities that exist now , with the favourable economic conditions Russia has found itself in , Russia could have done more than it did . """
2011-03-24,"Russia 's former ambassador to Libya has stoked new tension between President Dmitry Medvedev and Vladimir Putin , the prime minister , after calling the Kremlin 's acquiescence to air strikes targeting Libya a "" betrayal of Russia 's interests "" .
Putin and Medvedev , who are close political allies , appeared to clash on Monday after the former condemned support for the bombing as "" a medieval call for the Crusades "" .
Medvedev , who is responsible for setting the country 's foreign policy , responded by saying it was "" inadmissible to use expressions like the Crusades that , in essence , can lead to a clash of civilizations "" .
Aides to the two men have moved quickly to downplay the disagreement , but Vladimir Chamov has reignited it after flying home to Russia on Wednesday night .
Chamov , who was sacked as ambassador to Tripoli by Medvedev earlier this month , told reporters that Moscow 's failure to oppose the bombing raids would lose Russian companies huge sums of money in arms and other contracts .
He denied rumours that he wrote a telegram to Medvedev calling him a traitor , but said : "" I wrote a telegram in which I underlined that I represent the interests of Russia in Libya .
Recently , our countries have aimed at close co - operation , and it is not in the interests of Russia to lose such a partner . ""
He added : "" Russian companies have signed very advantageous contracts for billions of euros for several years ahead that could be lost or have already been lost .
In a certain way , that can be considered a betrayal of Russia 's interests . ""
Russia abstained last week during the UN security council vote which approved military intervention in Libya .
Chamov , who was reportedly greeted at Moscow 's Sheremetyevo airport by Russian nationalists bearing bunches of flowers , declined to comment on Medvedev personally .
However , he said Gaddafi was "" a very adequate person "" and , when asked to comment on Putin 's Crusades comment , he replied : "" Vladimir Vladimirovich , and this is something I particularly like about him , gave a very precise , short and profound definition .
And here , I think , he is not far from the truth . ""
Analysts said Putin 's comments reflected his desire to please patriotic voters , while Medvedev had acted shrewdly to preserve respect in the west while bolstering Russian interests .
"" Russia took a pragmatic decision by abstaining in the security council vote , "" said Alexei Fenenko , an international security expert at the Russian Academy of Sciences .
"" If the United States wants a third war , let them have it .
There was already fighting in Libya even without the intervention , so our companies will lose out , bombing or not .
Plus Russia 's past experience shows that the US is ready to act without UN support â€ “
a veto does n't stop them .
"" Medvedev and Putin have both said they will agree together who contests the Russian presidency next March .
Some observers think any disagreements between the two are cosmetic .
However , Gleb Pavlovsky , an analyst with close ties to the Kremlin , said discord in the ruling tandem had "" become a generator of nervousness "" in the political elite .
"" We need to enter a regime of certainty , when we know exactly who will run in the presidential elections , "" he told the daily newspaper , Moskovsky Komsomolets ."
2011-03-31,"Sources close to BP deny that its strategic alliance with Rosneft will be jeopardised by Kremlin moves to force the resignation of the Russian energy group 's chairman , Igor Sechin .
Russia wants to remove government representatives from the helm of state - run companies to improve corporate governance and the country 's investment climate , president Dmitry Medvedev said in a speech in the Urals .
Sechin , Russia 's deputy prime minister , was one of the architects of a $ 16bn ( Â£10bn ) share swap deal signed in January that involves BP and Rosneft teaming up to explore the Arctic seabed for oil .
That venture is already facing obstacles after BP 's current Russian partners , TNK - BP , won a temporary court blocking order last month .
The oligarchs behind the joint venture argued that under the terms of a shareholder agreement any new business initiatives in Russia should come through TNK - BP .
Although BP refused to issue a formal comment about Sechin , people close to the company said his departure would not make any difference to plans to ally itself with Rosneft ; BP was confident the venture would be waved through .
Medvedev is calling for the resignation of all government ministers from state - run firms ahead of shareholder meetings in June .
During his speech , the president criticised the government 's increasing role in the economy , which could put him on a collision course with prime minister Vladimir Putin , who is viewed as more hardline .
It is not certain yet whether the two will stand against each other in upcoming presidential elections .
Sechin is a former aide to Putin and has been dubbed Russia 's energy tsar after building up Rosneft as the country 's pre - eminent oil company via a merger with Yukos .
Chris Weafer , chief strategist at Russian bank UralSib , said Sechin 's resignation would not change the Russian landscape for BP : "" The deal is a strategic one for Russia and transcends the personalities involved .
It 's something Russia wants to do .
Rosneft is the country 's largest oil company , but everyone knows it needs western know - how and expertise to find and extract the huge deposits that lie beneath the Arctic shelf . ""
Russian analysts played down the idea of a possible rift between Putin and Medvedev saying that when it came to strategic issues such as exploration and production in the Arctic , they "" were singing from the same hymn sheet . ""
BP 's investors expressed concern the removal of Sechin would mean the British company no longer had a hotline to the Kremlin , but others were more circumspect .
Russia 's Alfa Bank said : "" The move is unlikely to change anything , as the exclusion of ministers and deputy prime ministers from boards of directors does not necessarily mean they will lose their influence over the companies ' actions or ability to support them . ""
Alfa said the state woud still retain majority stakes in its leading companies even after the planned sell down of government shares to 51 % over the next three years .
One analyst said : "" Ministers will still be able to influence events by issuing binding directives . ""
But Prosperity Capital , which manages Norway 's sovereign oil fund investments in Russia , welcomed the initiative , saying it would give a major boost to Russia 's investment case .
If implemented , Medvedev 's proposals will affect finance minister Alexei Kudrin , who sits on the supervisory board of VTB bank , transport minister Igor Levitin , who is chairman of airline carrier OAO Aeroflot , and energy minister Sergey Shmatko , a board member of Gazprom .
During his speech to a modernisation commission , Medvedev said state involvement in the economy was holding Russia back . ""
The grip of corruption is still strong , "" he said .
"" It holds the whole economy by the throat . """
2011-04-12,"Russian president Dmitry Medvedev has set a 1 July deadline for prime minister Vladimir Putin to oust ministers from the boards of large public companies , renowned for their poor governance and lack of transparency .
"" Replacing members of the government with independent directors may affect the quality of management , "" said Arkady Dvorkovich , the Kremlin 's economic adviser .
At present 17 members of the Putin government have seats on the boards of top companies .
Igor Sechin , Putin 's number two and energy minister , heads Rosneft , which became the top Russian oil producer after taking over Yukos assets .
He was behind the projected tie - up with BP involving a $ 16bn share - swap .
A court has blocked the deal .
The finance minister , Alexei Kudrin , chairs the supervisory council of VTB Bank .
His counterpart at the transport ministry runs Aeroflot , the national airline , and the first deputy prime minister , Viktor Zubkov , heads the energy conglomerate Gazprom and the agrarian Rosselkhozbank .
The president , unveiling his plan on 30 March in Magnitogorsk , said the investment climate in Russia was very bad .
He put the blame on state involvement in business and corruption .
From last September to February this year , Russia suffered a record flight of foreign capital , losing $ 45bn .
Investors are wary of the increasing political risks linked to the general and presidential elections in December and next March , respectively .

2011-04-13,"It 's sweaty work being a bodyguard to Dmitry Medvedev â€ “
or so it seems after members of the president 's security detail ordered a Â£6,500 luxury bathtub .
In Russia 's latest scandal over free - spending bureaucrats , the Federal Protective Service ( FSO ) asked for a German Burg Crono 2.0 mineral - cast tub costing more than the country 's average annual wage .
The request could embarrass Medvedev , who has tried to forge an image as a crusader against corruption .
Under Russian law , all government procurement orders must be published online .
Medvedev tightened the system this year , but there have been a series of outrages over officials ' excessive tastes .
This month clerks in Irkutsk ordered 25 fur hats at a cost of 500,000 roubles ( Â£10,000 ) .
A spokesman said the "" classic chocolate - brown sable ushankas for men "" were intended for a "" gift fund "" rather than to warm the ears of chilly bigwigs in the Siberian town .
Things were no better in the impoverished southern republic of Dagestan , where the finance minister , Abdusamad Gamidov , hastily retreated from an order for a Â£180,000 Audi saloon in February .
He had second thoughts after the anti - graft campaigner Alexei Navalny published a blogpost on the subject .
"" I 'm sure that most world presidents get around in more modest automobiles , "" Navalny said .
In 2009 the federal interior ministry offered to pay up to Â£87,000 for a hand - carved cherrywood bed with a headboard covered in 24-carat gold .
The purchase caused an outcry but did not deter the finance ministry from ordering Â£50,000 of gilded furniture last summer .
( It later said it would spend only half that amount . )
Many of the prices named on the zakupki.gov.ru website are thought to be inflated to allow for kickbacks .
Medvedev said in October that Russia lost Â£20bn in bribes every year .
A spokesman for the FSO denied the 336,000-rouble bathtub was overpriced , telling a Russian newspaper it was "" not some kind of short , sit - up job , like people buy for khrushchevki [ Soviet - era apartment blocks ] . """
2011-04-15,"The secretary general of Nato has insisted its Libyan mission does not exceed the UN mandate to protect civilians from Muammar Gaddafi 's forces .
Anders Fogh Rasmussen was responding to criticism from the Russian president , Dmitry Medvedev , who on Tuesday claimed the situation in Libya had "" already spun out of control "" and that the plan to enforce a no - fly zone over the country had been reduced to the straightforward use of force .
Rasmussen said Nato 's forces were acting "" in strict conformity with both the spirit and the letter of the UN security council motion "" , which established a no - fly zone and authorised member states to take "" all necessary measures ... to protect civilians and civilian populated areas under threat of attack "" .
The Nato leader admitted he had not yet had any firm offers from any members to "" step up to the plate "" and offer more precision warplanes , which the Nato commander in charge of Libya requested on Thursday at the start of the meeting of Nato foreign ministers in Berlin .
But , said Rasmussen , "" we have indications that nations will deliver what 's needed â€ ¦ in the very near future . ""
A British official said on Friday that the foreign secretary , William Hague , did not see the meeting as a failure , even though it had not prompted any extra member nations to join the French and British - led mission . ""
[ Hague ] never expected to get this sort of commitment overnight .
He has been talking to different members and will be following up with them in the days and weeks to come , "" said the British diplomatic source .
Fourteen of the alliance 's 28 members are actively participating in the operation â€ “ joined by other nations such as Qatar , the United Arab Emirates and Sweden â€ “ and six of them are striking targets in Libya .
The Russian foreign secretary , Sergey Lavrov , has insisted Libya needs a political solution led from within the region , particularly by the African Union , rather than from outside .
"" There is no magic bullet , "" he said .
Asked whether Nato should increase its military operation in order to oust Gaddafi , Lavrov said : "" The UN has not authorised regime change . """
2011-05-01,"President Dmitry Medvedev is pushing to extend his tenure in the Kremlin against the wishes of Russia 's powerful prime minister , Vladimir Putin , a senior politician from the country 's ruling party has told the Guardian .
Konstantin Zatulin , a prominent MP with United Russia , which dominates parliament and is headed by Putin , said Medvedev 's allies were waging a campaign to undermine the prime minister behind a public facade of unity between the two men .
Until recently it was widely assumed that Medvedev would not run in presidential elections next March , so that Putin could return to his old job and serve two more terms to 2024 .
Most analysts had presumed that Putin would put himself forward while Medvedev would bow out meekly after a single term .
However , Zatulin said in an interview that the president 's aides were jockeying to keep him in the Kremlin by eroding Putin 's support in parliament . ""
Medvedev wants to stay , he has broken the agreement and now Putin will have to persuade him to back off , "" he said .
His words highlight a deepening rift between Russia 's ruling duo .
Putin has emphasised his credentials as a conservative statist who rejects "" liberal experiments "" , in what analysts interpreted as a bold pitch for the presidency .
Medvedev , by contrast , has pushed his image as a tech - savvy moderniser and anti - corruption crusader .
He recently removed top members of government from the boards of state companies such as oil giant Rosneft in favour of independent directors , a move seen as a blow to Putin 's "" Kremlin Inc "" view of the economy .
The split extends to foreign policy , where Medvedev promotes the "" resetting "" of relations with Washington , while Putin has nurtured his image as a hawk who rejects US unilateralism .
When Putin likened western military intervention in Libya to "" medieval calls for crusades "" last month , the president condemned the phrase a few hours later as "" unacceptable "" .
While Medvedev has no party , Putin leads United Russia , which he uses to exert control over parliament , regional leaders and the bureaucracy .
The party has said that Putin is its preferred candidate , and that it will consider supporting Medvedev only if the prime minister does not run .
Medvedev , on the other hand , wields clout through his huge presidential administration , and via influential aides who can manipulate party politics and state media .
Zatulin , the MP , was drawn into the conflict last month when he was removed from his post as deputy chairman of a Duma committee , in what he says was a punishment by Medvedev 's political fixers inside United Russia for statements he made in the chamber supporting Putin 's "" Crusades "" comments .
He said that Kremlin aides â€ “ including the powerful ideologue , Vladislav Surkov â€ ” were also secretly cultivating a minor party , Fair Russia , as a potential vehicle for Medvedev .
The party could be given a new leader such as the popular nationalist and representative to Nato , Dmitry Rogozin , and then be boosted with huge administrative support in the run up to parliamentary elections in December , Zatulin said , providing Medvedev a platform for his bid to the presidency three months later .
Zatulin said : "" Medvedev has decided to put himself forward [ as a presidential candidate ] .
He feels inspired and he senses a certain support . ""
Asked if Putin and Medvedev might go head to head , the politician replied : "" Yes , I think so . ""
The view that both men will compete is rare , but other observers are also putting their money on Medvedev as the preferred candidate .
The president , a lawyer , took up his post in 2008 after he was endorsed by the outgoing Putin , 58 , who had spent eight years in the Kremlin but could not stand for a third consecutive term .
Putin , a former KGB officer , then stepped into the prime ministerial role , from which he has appeared to take the lead in Russia 's ruling tandem , known collectively to wags as either "" PutiMed "" or "" MedvePut "" .
Stanislav Belkovsky , a well - connected political commentator said that differences between the pair were "" no more than between man and wife "" .
He believes they have already decided together that Medvedev will be the one to go forward . ""
For both of them , Medvedev is the best choice for the elections , "" he said .
"" The ruling elite have many business interests and they want to legalise their capital abroad .
They need to feel at home in New York and London , so nobody points a finger when they walk into the lobby bar at the Lanesborough or the Dorchester . ""
Medvedev is seen overseas as western - leaning and liberal so he is better placed than Putin to finish this cynical process . ""
The choice of candidate will almost certainly determine who becomes Russia 's next president .
Political forces opposing the Kremlin have been systematically marginalised , so the emergence of a popular competing figure is practically impossible .
Putin and Medvedev have respectable , if slipping , popularity ratings which can also be shored up by falsifying election results , a common practice over the past decade .
Yet intrigue remains .
On a visit to Sweden last week Putin was asked by journalists whether he intended to run .
"" It is still too early to tell , "" he replied .
"" The time will come , and we will make the appropriate decision .
You will like it .
You will be satisfied . ""
That response prompted fresh speculation that either Medvedev â€ “ seen to be the favoured candidate in Washington and many European capitals
â€ “ will run , or that both men will go to the polls , in a show of democratic competition .
In another sign of nervousness in the ruling elite last week , Gleb Pavlovsky , a veteran spin doctor and adviser to the presidential administration , had his pass to the Kremlin revoked .
Pavlovsky told reporters he was ousted for being too vocal in his support of the president at a time of tension in the tandem , and for saying â€ “ in a criticism of Putin â€ “ that Medvedev 's first term should not become "" some recess in one person 's endless governance "" .
In spite of Medvedev 's ambitions , many Russians remain convinced that it is Putin who will muscle his way back to the Kremlin .
They say that he is desperate to regain the top job , whatever his partner 's wishes .
"" I 'm 80 % certain that Putin will be the candidate , "" said Vladimir Ryzhkov , a leader of Russia 's small democratic opposition , in an interview at his basement office in southern Moscow .
"" These three years he has kept up a pre - election campaign , driving yellow Ladas around the country , kissing snow leopards , firing crossbows at whales , putting out fires .
And that 's allowed him to remain the most popular politician in the country . ""
Ryzhkov agreed that Medvedev was agitating to preserve his position , but argued that had only succeeded in firing up his opponents . ""
His recent behaviour has begun to irritate and frighten the people around Putin , "" he said , predicting that the prime minister would stand alone .
Zatulin , however , said he was convinced that Medvedev would run for the presidency .
Asked if Putin could talk his protege out of competing in the election , he said : "" Personally , I do n't think so .
The point of no return has already been passed . """
2011-05-18,"Dmitry Medvedev , the president of Russia , has promised to reveal soon whether he will run for a second term , saying at his first major press conference that "" silence can not last forever "" on the subject .
There had been intense speculation that Medvedev would use the conference on Wednesday to give a strong signal on whether he or his ally , Vladimir Putin , the prime minister , will stand in elections to the presidency next March .
Moscow is thick with rumours that there is friction between the two men over who should stand , although some analysts think the ruling elite is promoting talk of a rift to hide the lack of true political competition in Russia .
Medvedev , 45 , refused to say which of the pair would be a candidate , but indicated he would make his intentions known in the near future .
"" You can expect an announcement soon , "" he told more than 800 journalists in an auditorium at the Skolkovo business school near Moscow .
In a wide - ranging question - and - answer session , which seemed tailored to boost his ratings in an election campaign , Medvedev said Putin , 57 , was his close ally .
However , he made remarks which set him apart from his mentor .
Asked if the release of the jailed oil tycoon , Mikhail Khodorkovsky , would present a danger to society , he replied : "" Absolutely no danger at all , "" in marked contrast to Putin 's statement about the businessman in December that "" a thief should sit in jail "" .
When he came to power in 2008 , Medvedev said that he preferred meetings with small numbers of journalists .
Then he abruptly announced last month that he would hold his first large - scale televised news conference , something that Putin did annually as president .
The decision came after Putin gave a bravura performance in his annual prime - ministerial speech to parliament on 20 April , which contained a raft of social measures and was seen as a pitch for his own return to the presidency .
Medvedev 's two - and - a - quarter - hour conference followed the Putin mould : Hundreds of Russian journalists waved signs with the names of their regions and pleaded to pose a question .
One woman held up a sheet of paper with a red love heart drawn on it .
Several reporters prefaced their queries with adulatory waffle about the president , and a correspondent from the Arctic in a traditional felt jacket asked about the prospects for reindeer herders .
Asked about Moscow 's relations with Nato , Medvedev said they were "" not the worst "" and "" a lot of water has flowed under the bridge "" since the two clashed over the war in Georgia in 2008 .
However , he sent a warning to the US not to push ahead with a missile defence system in eastern Europe without including Russia as a partner .
"" If we do n't work out a model of co - operation on missile defence then we [ Russia ] will have to take measures in response and then we 're talking about speeding up the development of nuclear strike potential , "" he said .
' That would be a very bad scenario that would throw us back to the cold war epoch . ""
Medvedev seemed assured as he answered questions and repeatedly stressed his passion for Russia 's modernisation , but he lacked Putin 's salty phrases and demagogic touch .
Putin sent a subtle reminder of his superior image with the publication of an interview in Outdoor Life , a US magazine , in which he discussed his macho photo shoots .
He dismissed suggestions that a US leader would not pose with a bare chest or a weapon .
He said Theodore Roosevelt had been pictured with a lion he shot , and Barack Obama was filmed bathing in the Pacific last year when he was "" not wearing a tie , to put it mildly "" ."
2011-05-18,"The reputation of BP boss Bob Dudley took a heavy blow on Wednesday when the Russian president , Dmitry Medvedev , accused the top brass at BP and Rosneft of failing to do proper due diligence in their failed tie - up .
Dudley is already under fire from City shareholders over the collapse of his plans for a share swap and Arctic exploration partnership deal with Rosneft , which was meant to give BP a new start after the problems in the Gulf of Mexico last year .
Medvedev did not mention Dudley by name and is also believed to have been aiming his remarks at former Rosneft chairman Igor Sechin , but his words will hit home at BP London headquarters . ""
Those who prepared the deal should have paid closer attention to the nuances of the shareholder agreement , "" said Medvedev , adding : "" It would have been necessary to conduct more careful due diligence inside the government .
"" The Kremlin power politics that helped blow a hole in BP 's proposed partnership with Rosneft were on display ahead of an attempt on Thursdayto heal the rift with existing Russian partners inside TNK - BP .
Medvedev ordered Sechin to step down as chairman of Rosneft last month as part of a wider demand that ministers give up top jobs on the boards of large state - controlled companies .
Sechin is deputy prime minister and a key ally of prime minister Vladimir Putin , with whom Medvedev has a prickly relationship .
There has also been speculation that the Russian shareholders inside TNK , grouped together inside the Alfa Access Renova ( AAR ) consortium , were being tacitly supported by Medvedev in their attempts to derail the proposed $ 16bn share swap and joint Arctic exploration by BP and Rosneft .
They point out that during Putin 's eight - year presidency , resistance by any business oligarch to the government 's wishes could have landed them in jail , as was the case with Mikhail Khodorkovsky .
Despite the turbulence and the formal end to a period of partnership talks , Rosneft said some kind of cooperation with BP was still possible .
The British company has a TNK - BP board meeting in Cyprus on Thursday with the break - up of the Rosneft deal an inevitable point of discussion .
Rosneft said : "" As a result of the negotiating process between BP and AAR , Rosneft has received proposals which go beyond the previous agreements and do not require the extension of the deadline which expired on 16 May.
These proposals make it possible to discuss our further cooperation outside the agreements which have already expired . ""
But Rosneft sources said have also suggested that it is also talking to other firms such as Exxon , Chevron and Royal Dutch Shell as well as Chinese companies about the Arctic opportunity .
Industry experts said it was unlikely that any of these companies would want to go as far as a share swap with the Russian company .
Rosneft added it would soon announce its own plans to develop the Arctic Kara Sea blocks it had planned to develop with BP ."
2011-05-20,"BP chief executive Bob Dudley has been warned that he must break up his huge oil business into three separate parts to increase its stock market value or face the possibility of a takeover by the Russians or Chinese .
The advice came from a leading City investment house days after the Russian president , Dmitry Medvedev , criticised Dudley for messing up a proposed share swap with Moscow - based Rosneft .
Shares in BP rose 4 % on the back of takeover talk from Investec Securities and an announcement from the embattled oil group that it had secured a $ 1bn ( Â£620 m ) cash injection from a Japanese partner for its part in last year 's Gulf of Mexico accident .
The valuation of BP plunged 30 % last year after the Deepwater Horizon crisis but 12 months on under the new leadership of Dudley it continues to underperform by 14 % the oil sector led by Shell and ExxonMobil .
The research note from Investec analysts calls for a "" radical , full demerger of BP "" to close the acute discount by speeding up the sale of assets and the move into new developing markets . ""
Bob Dudley should go the whole hog and hive off the US ( Amoco ) and North Sea ( Britoil ) businesses to renew BP â€ “ no longer ' Beyond Petroleum ' but as ' Bric - ish Petroleum ' â€ “ a higher growth global player focused on the investment challenges of 2030 â€ “ not 1930 , "" they argue .
( Bric is a reference to Brazil , Russia , India , and China . )
"" If BP does not close the discount , we think the Russians , Chinese or Indians will look hard at the sub 6x multiple "" , which denotes it is underpriced .
The analysts say that a break - up strategy would not damage "" BP 's Glencore - esque trading business "" nor the synergies of integration in markets like US mid - West refining .
Such a move would take BP back to its earlier days before it bought Britoil in the UK and then expanded much more dramatically with a massive takeover of Amoco in America .
Meanwhile BP , which has put $ 20bn of its own money into a special escrow account to pay for clean - up and other costs emanating from the Macondo well , said Mitsui 's exploration arm , MOEX , which owned 10 % of the well , had paid out $ 1.1bn .
Mitsui originally argued that it should not have to pay its share of the costs on the grounds that the problem was caused by BP negligence .
MOEX has now dropped this claim and analysts said this weakened the case of 25 % well shareholder Anadarko Petroleum , which has also used the same argument .
"" This is the first recognition by one of the partners that actually ... blame is shared and should be shared and therefore the costs should be shared as well , "" Societe Generale analyst Irene Himona said , adding : "" It is very significant because clearly now it means that BP can try and ensure that everybody else who is involved will also meet their obligations . """
2011-06-22,"President Dmitry Medvedev 's attempts to portray Russia as a flourishing democracy were dealt another blow when a liberal opposition party was barred from taking part in forthcoming elections .
Medvedev has promised to increase political competition but the justice ministry announced in a statement that it was refusing to register the People 's Freedom party ( PFP ) , a coalition whose leaders include the former prime minister Mikhail Kasyanov , and activist Boris Nemtsov .
The ministry said that the party could not be registered because some listed members were under - age , some were "" dead souls "" â€ “ already deceased at the time of the party 's founding conference in December â€ “ and some did not live at the addresses provided in documents filed by the party .
It also identified other alleged violations .
Kasyanov accused the prime minister , Vladimir Putin , of engineering the refusal because the PFP posed "" serious risks "" for him . ""
It 's clear that Putin has taken the decision not to allow our party to take part in the elections , "" Kasyanov said , adding that as a result the parliamentary poll this December "" can not be considered fair "" .
Vladimir Ryzhkov , another leader of the party , said that launching an appeal would be pointless . ""
To apply to the courts now would mean going in a vicious circle and like a sheep running again and again into the same gate , "" he said .
The polls are expectedto be a pallid affair .
Last month , Putin created the All - Russia People 's Front to boost the flagging fortunes of his United Russia party , which dominates the duma and should preserve a large swath of seats .
Also last month , the billionaire metals tycoon Mikhail Prokhorov agreed to head Right Cause , a small party that appears to support Medvedev 's modernising agenda .
The Communist party , the misleadingly named Liberal Democratic party headed by ultra - nationalist Vladimir Zhirinovksy , and the Fair Russia party will also compete as nominal opponents to United Russia .
Critics say the Kremlin has consistently quelled sharply oppositionist parties in recent years by refusing registration and imposing other legal obstacles to participation in elections .
In April , the European court of human rights ruled that the dissolution of Ryzhkov 's Republican party in 2007 was unjustified ."
2011-07-14,"Russian officials have announced plans to more than double Moscow 's territory in a bid to alleviate the city 's crippling traffic and overcrowding , but critics worry the move could prove to be an environmental fiasco and leave thousands displaced .
The plan to increase Moscow 's size from the current 264,000 acres to 620,000 acres was given initial approval on Monday by Dmitry Medvedev , Russia 's president , in a meeting with the city 's mayor , Sergei Sobyanin , and Boris Gromov , governor of the surrounding Moscow region .
The plan will see Moscow expanding to the south and south - west , taking in forestland , small communities and dachas or summerhouses .
It foresees much of the heart of Moscow â€ “ its government offices and big businesses
â€ “ moving to the new neighbourhood , forever changing the spirit of the city 's historic centre .
The first to move are due to be the offices of the prime minister and cabinet , as well as the presidential administration , Sobyanin said in a meeting with the editors of Russia 's leading newspapers this week .
Russian officials are looking at a 20-year timeline to complete the city 's growth .
They have yet to announce a budget for the venture .
The move is Moscow 's boldest attempt yet to deal with the notorious bottlenecks that often bring movement in the city to a standstill .
It is part of Medvedev 's vision to turn Moscow into a global financial centre as the country seeks to attract investment and boost its international standing .
He first floated the expansion idea during a speech to foreign investors during an international forum in St Petersburg last month .
The plan , published on the Moscow city government website , says the city 's southern and south - western outskirts were chosen in part because they comprise "" a relatively weakly urbanised sector of the Moscow region , "" counting some 250,000 people .
Alexei Yaroshenko , of Greenpeace Russia , said he believed the number was much higher .
It also does not include those who maintain dachas in the region .
"" We do n't know the exact borders yet , "" Yaroshenko said .
"" If it is moved this way or that , hundreds of thousands of people will be added . ""
The concern comes from precedent â€ “ locals in and around the Black Sea resort of Sochi , the site of the Winter Olympics , have protested over forced relocation as the government takes over prime real estate in the region .
Five years ago residents of Butovo , a village on the outskirts of southern Moscow , had a face off with authorities for weeks as they attempted to fight the razing of houses to make way for construction .
Residents of Khimki , in northern Moscow , continue to battle controversial plans to build a road through their forest .
"" They do n't care at all about the people , "" Yaroshenko said .
"" The officials decide and then start to build and what people think makes no difference to them . ""
He worried that the lush forestland in the region would be the first affected , since it is federal property .
Yet even critics like Yaroshenko admit something has to be done .
Moscow 's population has grown by 200,000 a year since 2002 , he noted , citing census results .
Aside from the potential effects on residents and the forests that line Moscow 's southern outskirts , Yaroshenko worries that the expansion â€ “ which city officials say will add housing for 2 million Muscovites and more than 1 m jobs â€ “ will only increase Moscow 's dominance over the country .
While preliminary results from a 2010 census showed that the overall population of the country decreased by 1.2 % , Moscow 's population increased from 10.4 million to 11.5 million .
"" The country is emptying and Moscow is growing , "" he said .
"" All resources are going to Moscow â€ “ first money and then people follow . """
2011-09-12,"Russia has rebuffed western attempts to increase the pressure on the Syrian regime , led by Bashar al - Assad , as new United Nations figures show at least 2,600 people have been killed since anti - government protests erupted in March .
President Dmitry Medvedev said after talks with David Cameron that additional pressure was "" absolutely not needed "" because existing UN and European Union sanctions were squeezing the regime .
Britain , the US and France have been pushing for tougher action by the UN but have met opposition from Russia and China , veto - wielding permanent members of the security council , and others .
The latest UN casualty figures â€ “ 400 more than previously given â€ “ were announced on Monday by the UN high commissioner for human rights , Navi Pillay , who called the situation "" dire "" and again complained that Syria had refused access for a UN humanitarian assessment team .
Syria has banned almost all journalists from entering the country but new images have emerged of killings , injuries and funerals of victims .
One clip , [ WARNING :
Contains explicit images ] posted by the Local Co - ordination Committees , appeared to show the final moments of a 14-year - old boy , Izzat al - Babidi , reportedly shot in the head during a demonstration in the Damascus suburb of Douma on Monday morning .
Other pictures showed hundreds of people attending the funeral of another boy , Subhi Salam , who was fatally wounded by a sniper during protests last Friday .
Pillay 's figure of 2,600 dead was immediately contradicted by a senior aide to Assad , Bouthaina Shaaban .
"" There are 700 casualties among the army and the police , and 700 among the rebels , "" she said in Moscow .
"" We have a list [ of the victims ' names ] , and we can provide it . ""
Shaaban 's visit was part of an attempt by Syria to stave off any danger that its Russian ally would abandon it .
Medvedev appeared to show that he would stand firm , calling for a "" well - balanced position between both parties to the conflict , the Syrian government and the rebels "" .
This was a far cry from the now firm western position that Assad has lost all legitimacy .
Russia 's support brought a call from Syrian opposition activists for a "" day of anger "" .
Al - Arabiya TV quoted opposition sources as claiming that Syrian military aircraft had been flying low over the central city of Homs , where many have died in recent weeks .
Syrian activists describe fighting in the nearby Rastan area between army defectors and loyalists , and an incipient "" low - intensity civil war "" , with Islamists smuggling in weapons from abroad .
The Saudi - owned channel also reported three clergymen from the Assad family 's Alawite sect in Homs as distancing themselves from the "" atrocities "" carried out by the regime .
This week , opposition figures plan to unveil the final makeup of the Syrian National Council , a broad coalition of different anti - Assad groups ."
2011-09-12,"The Russian president , Dmitry Medvedev , has turned the tables on David Cameron on his first visit to the country as prime minister , raising doubts about the UK 's court system and the level of corruption in British business .
In the first bilateral meeting on Russian soil since a diplomatic row damaged relations following the murder in London in 2006 of former KGB spy Alexander Litvinenko , the pair trumpeted agreements reached on British - Russian business .
They made it clear they were determined to build a better relationship while leaving unresolved major differences , instead focusing on the Â£215 m of deals that had already been struck during Cameron 's trip .
The one - day bout of intense diplomacy will later see Cameron afforded the first face - to - face contact for a British prime minister with his Russian counterpart , Vladimir Putin , since 2007 .
The press conference between Cameron and Medvedev saw much banter between the two men , with the Russian president saying he thought Cameron could have been a "" very good "" KGB spy â€ “ a reference to an earlier anecdote Cameron had told about travelling to the country in 1985 as a teenager and apparently being courted by Russians .
Cameron 's joke suggested he had narrowly missed possible recruitment to the KGB .
Though Cameron and Medvedev said publicly they had agreed to disagree on what should become of the man Britain suspects of murdering Litvinenko â€ “ Andrei Lugovoi , whom Russia refuses to extradite â€ “ Medvedev went further in questions put to him during the press conference .
"" You have to learn to respect our legal framework , "" he said .
"" I would like to remind you article 65 of the Russian constitution says a Russian citizen ca n't be extradited for legal proceedings .
We should understand it and respect it .
"" We have questions about how court decisions are come to in the UK
but we are not raising these issues .
"" Cameron has been under pressure to raise concerns about human rights and the conditions for operating in Russia during his first official visit to the country .
Today he rejected suggestions he was "" parking "" human rights in favour of a trip to win business .
Referring to the Litvinenko case , he said : "" This is not being parked .
The two governments do n't agree .
We are not downplaying it in any way .
We have our own position .
But I do n't think that means we should freeze the entire relationship â€ “ we need to build a relationship in our mutual interest . ""
Both of us want to see progress .
We are not parking the issue , just realising there is an arrangement that has n't changed .
"" But he was pushed to explain how he could call for British business to invest in a country with unstable conditions .
On 31 August , BP 's Moscow offices were raided by bailiffs one day after the company lost a bid for a major Russian oil exploration contract .
Earlier in the morning in a speech delivered to students at Moscow 's state university , Cameron had carefully acknowledged how hard British businesses found it to operate in Russia .
Then he said : "" I 've talked to many British businesses .
I have no doubt about their ambition to work in Russia â€
¦
but it 's also clear that the concerns that continue to make them hold back are real .
"" They need to know that they can go to a court confident that a contract will be enforced objectively â€ ¦ and that their assets and premises wo n't be unlawfully taken away from them .
In the long run the rule of law is what delivers stability and security . ""
But later , when asked at the press conference why more British businesses should do business in Russia when corruption appeared to be unchecked , Medvedev said : "" It is very difficult to deal with most states on our planet because corruption is a central element that exists everywhere .
The open secret to you is that corruption exists in the UK as well .
It does n't mean we are not prepared to deal with the UK too . ""
Cameron 's broad aim is to "" rebuild "" the relationship and put an end to the "" tit - for - tat "" behaviour of the two countries .
He said : "" I accept that Britain and Russia have had a difficult relationship for some time .
And we should be candid about the areas where we still disagree .
But I want to make the case for a new approach based on co - operation .
"" There were "" sceptics "" in both countries , he said , "" who will doubt whether we can ever get beyond the competitive ideological instincts of our past "" , but he said he would take on those groups .
In his speech to Moscow state university he set out the British government 's position on Litvinenko for the first time on Russian soil .
He said : "" Our approach is simple and principled .
When a crime is committed that is a matter for the courts .
It is their job to examine the evidence impartially and to determine innocence or guilt .
The accused has a right to a fair trial .
The victim and their family have a right to justice .
It is the job of governments to help courts to do their work and that will continue to be our approach . ""
Describing his first visit , Cameron said at the beginning of his speech : "" I first came to Russia as a student on my gap year between school and university in 1985 .
I took the Trans - Siberian railway from Nakhodka to Moscow and went on to the Black Sea coast .
There two Russians â€ “ speaking perfect English â€ “ turned up on a beach mostly used by foreigners .
"" They took me out to lunch and dinner and asked me about life in England and what I thought about politics .
When I got back I told my tutor at university and he asked me whether it was an interview .
If it was , it seems I did n't get the job !
My fortunes have improved a bit since then .
So have those of Russia . """
2011-09-24,"Vladimir Putin has agreed to run for the presidency of Russia again in a move that could see him lead the country until 2024 .
In what could be the ulimate political job swap , his United Russia party also approved his proposal that the current president Dmitry Medvedev will take over Putin 's role as prime minister .
Putin ruled Russia as president for two terms 2000 to 2008 with a steely command that was widely criticised in the west as a retreat from democracy .
Constitutional rule changes have subsequently extended the presidential term from four years to six , Putin , if he won the election , could be in power for 12 years from next year .
It would also mean he would have lead the country for almost quarter of a century .
Confirmation that Putin would run was announced today at the United Russia party conference .
Speaking to thousands of flag - waving delegates in Moscow 's Soviet - era Luzhniki stadium , Medvedev first accepted Putin 's suggestion that he head the party 's federal party list in December 's parliamentary vote .
The crowd erupted into a gasp of surprise and then applause when he said : "" I think it 's right that the party congress support the candidacy of head of the government , Vladimir Putin , in the role of the country 's president .
"" Russia has been gripped by months of speculation regarding the decision .
Putin 's return â€
“
he is all but assured to win the March vote â€
“ will raise further concerns about the lack of democracy and growth of soft authoritarianism in the country .
The prospect of Putin in power again does n't come as a surprise but will cause concern in the west .
US diplomats believe that Putin always pulled the strings with Medvedev playing "" Robin to Putin 's Batman "" , according to frank dispatches released by WikiLeaks last year .
Putin took the stage after the announcement , launching into a pre - electoral diatribe addressing concerns over unemployment and corruption , and promising to improve the situation in the country . ""
Huge tasks lie before us , "" Putin said .
"" The focus of our attention must always be the people â€ “ the citizens of Russia . ""
Medvedev addressed the long waiting game over the decision . ""
Vladimir Vladimirovich [ Putin ] and
I were always asked : when will you decide ?
Sometimes we were asked , have you two fought ?
I want to entirely confirm what was just said : what we propose to the congress , is a deeply thought - through decision . ""
"" I hope you 'll understand why we waited so long to publicly reveal our position , "" he said .
As the head of United Russia 's party list , Medvedev said he would be ready to head the government â€ “ the role of the prime minister â€ “ if the party were to win , as is widely expected .
Political opposition is either banned or co - opted by the Kremlin .
That could mean , in effect , that he and Putin would simply switch roles .
"" Our loved country , our Russia , she must belong to free , orderly and responsible people , "" Medvedev said .
"" I 'm sure it will be that way . """
2011-09-24,"The announcement by the Russian president Dmitry Medvedev that he favours taking a back seat and recommending his predecessor , Vladimir Putin , to succeed him in 2012 should hardly come as a surprise .
The reality is that Putin , the macho former KGB officer , has never gone away since he stood down in 2008 after serving two terms .
Putin 's current break from the president 's office as Medvedev 's prime minister â€ “ a break required by constitutional rules that forbade him standing for a third term â€ “ was widely seen as no more than a mechanism to keep Putin in the public eye until he could stand again , an arrangement Medvedev said yesterday was "" agreed a long time ago "" .
Indeed , Putin has long been regarded as the real power behind his compliant ally .
That odd interregnum has not seen Putin behave in an any less "" presidential "" way .
He has stayed at the forefront of the nation 's imagination through his regular media appearances that have cast him as the shirtless action man .
While there is no denying his real popularity â€ “ or that of his United Russia party â€ “ that support has been gained at the expense of a genuine opposition or a free media , both of which have been targeted by Putin and his supporters .
Indeed , Medvedev 's announcement follows months of political manoeuvring , which has included the unopposed appointment of Putin ally Valentina Matvienko as speaker of the upper house of the Russian parliament to replace the leader of the Just Russia party , who was removed after criticising United Russia .
Putin will benefit too from constitutional changes pushed through by Medvedev , which critics suggested at the time were designed to bolster Putin 's power should he run again to ensure that the new term â€ “ which Putin will certainly win â€ “ will be for six years rather than four .
All of which confirms a country slipping from democracy back towards autocracy .
And that should be a cause for serious concern ."
2011-09-24,"Vladimir Putin is to run for president of Russia next year in a move that could keep the powerful leader at the helm of the country until 2024 .
Prime minister Putin and head of state Dmitry Medvedev ended months of speculation on Saturday during the ruling United Russia party congress .
"" I think it 's right that the party congress support the candidacy of the head of the government , Vladimir Putin , in the role of the country 's president , "" Medvedev said .
Thousands of flag - waving delegates inside Moscow 's Soviet - era Luzhniki stadium gasped before breaking into applause .
Russia has been paralysed by months of speculation regarding the decision , though signs had recently emerged that Putin would announce his intention to return to the Kremlin seat .
Putin , who has worked hard to prevent a credible opposition from forming , is all but certain of winning the presidential vote that is set for March , raising further concerns over the growth of soft authoritarianism in the country .
The announcement is also likely to dismay the combative prime minister 's numerous critics in the west .
In a surprise twist , Medvedev said he was ready to serve as prime minister under Putin .
Medvedev will head the party list of United Russia as it readies for parliamentary elections in December , paving the way for the premiership .
"" I 'm ready to head this government and work for the good of the country , "" he said , adding that such a move was dependent on United Russia sweeping the parliamentary vote , he said .
United Russia has seen its popularity decrease sharply since the financial crisis hit , but it remains the country 's most influential party , created with the aim of supporting Putin .
The swapping of roles would be the clearest illustration yet of Russia 's so - called "" managed democracy "" , a term coined by Kremlin ideologues to describe Russia 's political system .
Putin , who served as president from 2000 to 2008 , remains the country 's most popular leader , albeit with the help of a carefully controlled media .
Under constitutional changes adopted by Medvedev upon coming to office as Putin 's hand - picked successor , Putin will serve for another six years .
A possible second term after that would keep him in the Kremlin beyond his 71st birthday .
The former KGB agent appeared to enjoy the acclaim yesterday .
"" I want to thank you for the positive reaction to the proposal for me to stand for Russian president , "" Putin said .
"" For me this is a great honour . ""
He launched into an electoral programme that focused on addressing the stagnant economy .
A return to the Kremlin will hand Putin back formal control over foreign policy .
Relations with the west plummeted when he was president .
Russia 's opposition denounced the move , despite having expected it . ""
All authoritarian regimes are the same , "" said Lyudmila Alekseyeva , the 82-year - old doyenne of Russia 's human rights community .
"" Either they have to modernise or they come crashing down , as happened with Gaddafi . """
2011-09-25,"Spare a thought for poor Dmitry Medvedev .
It was US diplomats who back in November 2008 cruelly dubbed him Robin , to Vladimir Putin 's Batman .
The phrase stuck .
Over the past four years Medvedev has done nothing to dispel the impression that he is anything other than a useful seatwarmer , his time in the Kremlin a legalistic blip in an epoch of endless Putin rule .
It was n't always like this .
At the start of Medvedev 's presidential term there were faint hopes that he might preside over a partial liberalisation of Russian society .
The president himself spoke of ending "" legal nihilism "" .
Commentators , meanwhile , scrambled to make sense of Russia 's historically anomalous ruling arrangement â€ “ the "" tandem "" , as it became known .
In the shadow world of Kremlin politics it was hard to work out what was going on behind the scenes .
Some looked in vain for signs of an intra - leadership struggle .
Others speculated that Medvedev might eventually escape from Putin 's gravitational pull , or even fire his mentor .
The Obama administration tried to reach out to Medvedev in the hope this would nudge Russia 's foreign policy away from its hawkish Putin vector towards a more constructive approach .
By 2010 , however , US diplomats had concluded that Project Medvedev was hopeless .
Medvedev 's position became one of humiliation .
I heard one expert describe Russia 's ruling model not as a tandem but as "" a bicycle with a child 's seat in the front "" .
US diplomats even cabled back to Washington the following joke :
Medvedev sits in the driver 's seat of a new car , examines the inside , the instrument panel , and the pedals .
He looks around but the steering wheel is missing .
He turns to Putin and asks : "" Vladimir Vladimirovich , where is the steering wheel ? ""
Putin pulls a remote control out of his pocket and says : "" I 'll be the one doing the driving . ""
Medvedev 's announcement on Saturday that he was stepping down to allow Putin a third presidency came as a surprise to no one , then .
Medvedev 's only significant act as president was to extend Russia 's presidential term from four years to six , hardly a democratic step forwards .
This was seen , rightly , as teeing up the conditions for a triumphant comeback during elections in the spring of 2012 :
Putin 's .
So what now ?
Putin 's return means the west faces another decade of difficult relations with Russia .
During his first two stints as president , the former KGB agent demonstrated his gift at G8 gatherings and other international get - togethers for sardonic repartee mixed with snide remarks about western hypocrisy and double - dealing .
We can expect more of this .
There is no prospect of any real improvement in UK - Russian relations .
David Cameron did manage to meet Putin this month during his trip to Moscow , the first contact with him for four years .
But until Downing Street caves in to the Kremlin 's demand that it resumes co - operation with Russia 's FSB spy agency
â€ “ suspended after Alexander Litvinenko 's polonium murder â€ “
no "" reset "" is possible .
The prospects for Russia itself are equally gloomy .
The country now faces a long period of political and economic stagnation and single - party rule .
Increasingly the Putin era resembles that of the Soviet Union under Leonid Brezhnev , another too - long authoritarian period sustained by a commodities boom , which left ordinary citizens frustrated .
Increasing numbers of talented but Disenfranchised Russians are voting with their feet and moving abroad .
In theory Putin could go on until 2024 , when he will be 72 .
Or longer .
This week , however , the blogger and anti - corruption campaigner
Alexey Navalny predicted that Russia 's kleptocractic system would collapse well before that .
"" People now realise it does n't work .
It worked between 2000 - 2005 .
There was stability up until 2008 , "" he said .
"" But now it 's useless , even for the corrupt people who benefit from it . ""
With no political mechanism for removing Putin from power , Navalny said , another Russian revolution was inevitable .
At some point , he said , frustrations would boil over . ""
Maybe in five months , maybe in two years , maybe in seven years , "" he said .
Asked what would spark it , he suggested : "" The Caucasus . ""
Many observers have plausibly argued that Putin is tired of being leader .
So why did he come back ?
The Kremlin , of course , is more prestigious that then prime minister 's office , and gives Putin an international platform .
More than this , though , it allows Putin to protect his own alleged secret assets and those of his team , US diplomats believe .
And it allows him to avoid potential law enforcement prosecution â€ “ inevitable , once he steps down from power ."
2011-09-26,"Russia 's finance minister has left the government following a public row with President Dmitry Medvedev which blew apart the idea that Vladimir Putin 's return to the presidency would entail a smooth transition .
A visibly angry Medvedev asked Alexei Kudrin to step down on Monday after the minister said he would refuse to serve once Medvedev swapped the presidency with Putin in May.
Medvedev called the liberal official an "" irresponsible chatterbox "" and denounced Kudrin 's claim that he would consult with Putin before making a decision on whether or not to leave the government . ""
You know what , you can consult with whomever you want , but as long as I 'm president , I take these decisions myself , "" Medvedev said .
"" I will take all necessary decisions until 7 May next year â€ “
I hope everyone understands that . ""
Kudrin told RIA - Novosti news agency that he handed in his resignation late Monday .
Medvedev 's spokeswoman , Natalia Timakova , claimed that the president fired Kudrin .
Kudrin is the highest - ranking liberal official in the Russian government , credited with easing the country 's ride through the global financial crisis and challenging hardline elements in the regime that hope to buy popularity through increased social spending .
His departure will rile foreign investors , who have relied on his commitment to reforms and fiscal discipline .
Russia 's economy has yet to truly recover from the financial crisis and has faced renewed challenges in recent weeks .
The rouble fell to a two - year low on Monday ."
2011-09-30,"The outgoing Russian president , Dmitry Medvedev , agreed to step down because he believes Vladimir Putin is more popular , he has said .
"" I note that Prime Minister Putin , without a doubt , is currently the most authoritative politician in our country , "" Medvedev said in an interview with the country 's three state - run television stations . ""
His rating is slightly higher . ""
Medvedev has been the target of ridicule in Russia since Putin announced that he would return to the presidency next year .
The interview is to be aired on Friday , but a transcript was pre - released by the Kremlin .
Putin has said he will make Medvedev his prime minister . ""
My main ambition is to be of use to my country and my people , "" Medvedev said .
He stressed that he and Putin represented "" the same political force "" , and dismissed the idea of competition between them . ""
Can you imagine a situation where , for example , Barack Obama started competing with Hillary Clinton ? ""
he asked , apparently forgetting the rivalry that divided the two in the run - up to the 2008 US presidential election .
Medvedev brushed off a question from the head of the state - owned NTV television channel , Vladimir Kulistikov , when he asked : "" What 's the point of elections if everything is already decided ? ""
The ruling United Russia party 's support for Putin and Medvedev was "" merely a party recommendation on who to support in the elections , and nothing more , "" he said .
"" The vote is exercised by the people â€ “ and these are not empty words .
Any politician can ' fly ' in the elections .
No one is insured from anything â€ “ what predictability ?
"" Let the people decide whom to vote for , who has more authority , "" Medvedev said .
"" And only people , only our citizens , are able to place the final emphasis , voting for this or that person or political force , or rejecting it .
That 's democracy .
"" Putin is likely to win the presidential election , to be held in March 2012 . .
Russia 's main liberal opposition , the People 's Freedom party , has been refused registration for a parliamentary vote , due in December .
Other opposition parties , including the communists and the far - right Liberal Democratic party , are considered Kremlin - friendly ."
2011-10-07,"The Russian president , Dmitry Medvedev , has urged his Syrian counterpart , Bashar al - Assad , to reform or leave office â€ “ the first time the allies have publicly diverged during Syria 's six - month uprising .
The surprise statement , reported by Russian news agencies , came as Turkey â€ “ a former ally of Damascus â€
“ said again that it would consider all options in dealing with the ongoing violence in Syria .
When pressed on what those options were , the Turkish foreign minister , Ahmet Davutoglu , conceded that military measures would be considered if the situation threatened his country 's security . ""
Every domestic crisis in Syria will affect Turkey , Iraq , Lebanon , Israel , Palestine and Jordan .
It affects the whole region , "" he said .
"" In this regard , there is no other country more important than Syria today .
So , when an internal conflict in Syria poses a risk to Turkey , we will take all necessary measures . ""
Turkey has been weighing a response to the Syrian crisis , which its leaders now say is being caused by a regime crackdown on protesters , some of whom have taken up arms .
Ankara has said it will impose a range of cultural and economic sanctions on Assad 's regime , which insists it is battling terrorists backed by foreign states .
The latest Russian intervention has added to mounting pressure on the Syrian leader .
Earlier this week Moscow helped to veto a US - led resolution before the UN security council , which had threatened further sanctions on Damascus .
Furious lobbying by the US , Britain and Syrian opposition figures appeared to have done little to sway Russia , which has maintained a strategic relationship with the Ba'athist state since the cold war . ""
If the Syrian leadership is incapable of conducting such reforms , it will have to go , "" Medvedev was reported to have said .
"" But this decision should be taken not in Nato or certain European countries .
It should be taken by the Syrian people and the Syrian leadership . ""
Meanwhile , activists claimed 21 people were killed across Syria on Friday .
Protesters in Homms said Syrian security forces were targeting mosques in an attempt to stop public gatherings from forming .
Friday prayers have acted as a lightning rod for anti - regime dissent for the past six months and there were clashes on most Fridays throughout the summer .
A Kurdish leader and member of the newly formed Syrian National Council , which sees itself as an alternative government to the Assad regime , was reportedly shot dead by security forces in the northern town of Qaboun .
Mesha'al Timmo , the spokesperson for the Kurdish Future party , was meeting activists inside a private home when armed men burst in and killed him , activists said ."
2011-10-24,"Vladimir Putin uses the odd tussle on the judo mat to burnish his rugged image , but Dmitry Medvedev likes to display his own sporting prowess in a less macho activity â€ “ badminton .
Since Medvedev revealed last month that he would not run for a second term as Russia 's president , he has become the butt of unkind jokes suggesting he is twiddling his thumbs while he waits to hand over his job to prime minister and former president Putin in March .
The launch of Medvedev 's Facebook page last week was seen by some as a sign of him having too much free time on his hands .
That impression may have gained ground on Monday after the he used his Kremlin video blog to present an extollment of badminton 's virtues .
Dressed in a sports shirt with a Russian tricolour badge and clutching a racquet , Medvedev said the game "" develops your physical form , eye co - ordination , accuracy and reactions "" , adding : "" Those who play badminton well take decisions quickly . ""
He also noted that the first man in space , Yury Gagarin , had been a keen player .
The video then showed several clips of the 46-year - old president and Putin , 59 , swatting a shuttlecock back and forth in a large hall , in what could be described as a less than competitive encounter .
While both players looked far from expert , commentators suggested that Putin â€ “ as in politics , so in leisure â€
“ had the upper hand .
David Nowak , a sports writer with the RIA Novosti agency in Moscow , tweeted : "" For an almost 60-year - old Putin 's not bad .
But yeah , Medvedev plays like my mum . ""
Last week , Russia 's education ministry signed an agreement with the national badminton federation to introduce the game into the PE curriculum .
Medvedev 's clip will be used as the introduction to a series of videos on how to play it ."

2011-10-28,"Right from an opening extravaganza of workers in hard hats toiling away to the tune of a drill , on through to a penultimate act featuring a horse and donkey , the entertainment was a gala evening managing to combine the Bolshoi 's long history of grand performance with modern Russia 's supposed cultural vacuity .
Stretched over two hours , Friday night 's over - the - top medley of ballet and opera , with enough theatrics to rival any Eurovision gathering , gave Russia a show to remember to celebrate the opening of the Moscow theatre 's doors .
Not that Dmitry Medvedev , dwarfed on the Bolshoi 's enormous stage , was going to let the assembled supermodels , politicians and ballerinas be in any doubt of the significance . ""
Today is a very happy day for our country , "" the president said , kicking off the evening with a speech extolling the theatre 's symbolism .
"" We have , of course , a very big country , but one with a small number of unifying symbols , so - called ' national brands ' .
The Bolshoi is one of our greatest national brands .
"" A brand name appeared a crass way to describe a magnificent world - class historic theatre that has given the world some of its best ballerinas , opera singers and choreographers .
Broadcast round the world , the opening was intended as a cultural event to mark a six - year renovation costing half a billion pounds .
Medvedev and his wife , Svetlana , in silver lace top and deep blue skirt , took the main box , which has welcomed tsars and Soviet premiers since the theatre first opened in 1825 .
The president spent much of the evening whispering to Yelena Obraztsova , one of several Bolshoi legends invited to his box .
When a standing ovation was needed , it was Medvedev 's wife who nudged him with the back of her hand .
Supermodel Natalia Vodianova and Italian actress Monica Bellucci were there , as were former Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev , Naina Yeltsin , widow of the former president , and Patriarch Kirill , head of the Russian Orthodox Church .
In a nod to Kremlinology , ex - finance minister Alexei Kudrin , fired last month by Medvedev , was relegated to the last row .
Former president Vladimir Putin , now prime minister , was notably absent .
As the curtains parted on the famous stage for the first time in six years , the grand hall , outfitted in lush red fabric , ubiquitous gold and opulent chandeliers , filled with a pounding squeal of drilling and repairs .
New acoustics , a goal of the renovation , ensured it was deafening .
After several minutes , a choir of many dozens dressed as building workers launched into Mikhail Glinka 's Ivan Susanin , singing "" Glory to the Russian people ! ""
An all - Russian programme followed , with arias from Tchaikovsky and Rachmaninoff , and a Shostakovich 's tango from the Golden Age ballet was only outdone by an elegant adagio from Tchaikovsky 's Swan Lake , featuring principal ballerina Svetlana Zakharova .
French soprano Natalia Dessay and Lithuanian soprano Violeta Urmana were invited to perform .
Nearly all the pieces showcased the Bolshoi 's famous traditional style .
Walking down a long red carpet after the end towards the dogs and riot police cordoning off the square in front of the Bolshoi , attendees seemed pleased .
"" I liked it , "" said Vitaly Mutko , the sport minister .
"" It 's culture .
It 's the country . """

Mario Monti
It would be hard to think of anyone more unlike the flamboyant , scandalous and erratic outgoing prime minister than Mario Monti .
His chief claim to fame lies in economic and financial circles , where he is impressively known for lending his name to the Klein - Monti model of monopolistic competition in the banking industry .
The affable Monti is decidedly a technocrat 's technocrat .
Born in Varese north of Milan , he studied in Italy 's financial capital at its business - oriented Bocconi university , and then did graduate studies in economics at Yale under a Nobel winner , the late James Tobin , another otherwise obscure economists whose name is also in the news , for his advocacy of a "" Tobin "" tax on foreign currency transactions .
While Tobin was a neo - Keynesian , Monti is self - avowedly not .
His liberal credentials are doubtless among the qualities that make him the markets ' preferred choice as prime minister .
After returning from the US , he taught economics in Turin before going back to the Bocconi , where he was rector for five years from 1989 .
In 1994 , after Berlusconi led his new party to electoral victory , the TV magnate chose Monti as one of Italy 's two EU commissioners .
He took up his post in Brussels the following January , one day after the fall of Berlusconi 's government .
For four years , Monti was responsible for the internal market and held a range of financial portfolios .
He made such a success that in 1999 the then government of Massimo D'Alema , a former Communist , asked him to stay on in Brussels .
Until 2004 , Monti 's was competition commissioner .
One of his initiatives was to launch monopoly proceedings against Microsoft .
Monti is married with two children .
He is a long - standing contributor to the Milan daily Corriere della Sera ; his first article was published back in 1978 .
He is also a member of the influential but secretive Bilderberg conference of world business and political leaders ."
2011-11-12,"Russia 's prime minister , Vladimir Putin , admitted that his government had lost of the trust of its people and pledged to introduce what he called "" direct democracy "" to refresh it , when he is returned for a third presidential term next March .
Challenged during a meeting with foreign academics and journalists to admit that power in Russia was too centralised , that 80 % of President Dmitry Medvedev 's decrees were ignored or not fully implemented by the regions , and that no one trusted the power structure he had created , Putin astonished everyone by agreeing .
He said : "" I tell you , I agree .
I do n't object to anything you have said . ""
He said when he first became president 11 years ago the country was in so much chaos it was on the verge of civil war .
He established a system of "" manual control "" over the regions , abolishing elections and appointing governors himself .
Speaking to a meeting of the Valdai Club , Putin said it was time to devolve certain powers and taxation back to the regions : "" I have every intention to do that , but we have to act carefully .
We have certain ideas about how to expand direct democracy , but it would be premature to announce them now .
The British say it took 400 years for a lawn to be made , but we have not got that time .
"" Putin was speaking after a survey conducted by the Kremlin about the unpopularity of regional governors was leaked to Gazeta.ru .
It showed that a large number of governors , many of whom were heading Putin 's United Russia party 's regional lists â€ “ had poll ratings below 20 % .
In Moscow , St Petersberg and Kaliningrad , voters were deserting the party that has nominated Mr Putin as their presidential candidate .
While this is not expected to change the fact that United Russia will get the majority in the forthcoming parliamentary elections in December - because United Russia is a party of bureaucrats and is infamous for strongarming teachers , students and millions of public sector workers to vote for them - it is a clear indication to Mr Putin that he has to act .
He is not expected to return to reintroduce elections for governors , but two commissions are currently looking at ideas on how to devolve more power and money to the governors , and devising measures to make them more accountable locally .
In a two - and - half - hour session with academics in the bizarre setting of the restaurant of Moscow 's richest equestrian club , New Century , Putin spoke as if his own election as president was a foregone conclusion .
He bemoaned the resignation of his "" great friend "" Silvio Berlusconi , who he called one of the "" last of the Great Mohicans of European leaders "" .
Putin said : "" [ Berlusconi ] is a very open person , which is rare in European politics .
Gerhard SchrÃ¶der [ the former German chancellor ] told me that Silvio was a very good person , but not much of a politician .
But when SchrÃ¶der himself resigned and Silvio went on and on , I remembered what he said , where he is and where you are . ""
Putin criticised the US for its plans to place missile defence units on Russia 's borders and said no one was listening to Russia 's concerns that missile defence would make the balance of strategic nuclear forces unstable .
He also repeated his criticisms of the intervention in Libya , and called on the Syrian opposition to meet President Bashar al - Assad .
All three positions will complicate attempts by the US administration to keep their policy of resetting relations with Russia on track .
Putin scorned criticism that March 's presidential election would be a fix after his decision to swap places with Medvedev .
He said Gordon Brown had taken over from Tony Blair without any election and no one had said that had deprived the British people of a vote ."
2011-11-14,"Once feared around the world , the Russian army has spent recent years fighting a losing battle to keep its reputation intact â€ “ playing down tales of soldier abuse , rotting armaments and a plan to replace tanks with inflatable weapons .
The campaign may have reached a low point on Mondaywhen the defence ministry was forced to deny a report that the latest weapon in its army 's once mighty arsenal was little more than a badminton racket .
According to a report in Izvestiya newspaper , the ministry was preparing to implement an army - wide programme to boost soldier skill through games of badminton , a sport recently elevated to new heights in Russia following official sanction from the ruling duo , President Dmitry Medvedev and the prime minister , Vladimir Putin .
The ministry was planning to buy 10,000 badminton rackets and tens of thousands of shuttlecocks to ensure that soldiers were properly armed , Izvestiya said .
"" The same muscles are used during a game of badminton as those used when throwing grenades , knives and other objects , "" Colonel Alexander Shchepelev , the head of the defence ministry 's physical preparation department , told the newspaper .
"" That 's why this sport is very useful for all servicemen without exception . ""
"" But it will be especially useful for riflemen and snipers , since following the shuttlecock trains the eye muscles , strengthens the cardiovascular system and develops reaction speed , "" he added .
The article quickly went viral , eliciting mocking laughter in a country that has grown increasingly tired with the antics of its ruling duo .
Medvedev began promoting the sport last month with a video blog that hailed the sport 's virtues and showed him playing a quick match with his mentor , Putin . ""
Badminton is not a military applied sport in the Russian armed forces , and its development is not included in the physical training programme for military personnel , "" the ministry said , adding that it was "" surprised "" by the report . ""
The passage about snipers ' beginning to be obliged to study ' badminton is the personal opinion of the journalist , "" it said .
Izvestiya stood by its story . ""
The defence ministry is a very closed organisation and deny any information that is not got through official channels , "" said the report 's author , Denis Telmanov .
He added that two other sources had confirmed the existence of the badminton plan .
"" We know it 's true .

There are rackets . """
2011-11-20,"Ignore Vladimir Putin 's return to the Kremlin .
Set aside Dmitry Medvedev 's badminton fetish .
Forget the recent gangland murder of Chechnya 's best - known poet .
Instead , ordinary Russians have been transfixed by another news story taking place in a small island country far away .
It is a quintessentially Russian tale of greed , skulduggery , and betrayal .
But it is being played out not on the grey streets of Moscow but in the improbable , autumnal setting of an English court .
The $ 5bn legal battle between Boris Berezovsky and Roman Abramovich has offered Russians a fascinating peek into the opulent lifestyles of the mega - rich .
Luxury cruises in the Caribbean , mansions in France , deals at the Dorchester , Chechen gangsters , and billions funnelled through opaque offshore companies â€ “ all have been uncovered in what is the UK 's biggest private litigation bust - up .
But for Russians the case has been a unique opportunity to hear about the murky events that befell post - communist Russia .
It has become a compelling oral history lesson from the 1990s in which the secrets of Boris Yeltsin 's court have been brought to light .
Abramovich and Berezovsky were beneficiaries of Yeltsin 's dubious privatisation programme , under which state assets were practically given away to a small group of powerful businessmen â€ “ the oligarchs .
At issue is whether Berezovsky owned a share of Abramovich 's oil company Sibneft ?
Or did he , as Abramovich insists , simply receive $ 2.5 billion for providing political services ?
"" Whatever happens we will know much more about what was going on in these years than before , "" Yuli Dubov â€ “ a friend of Berezovsky 's , watching the hearings , pointed out .
"" Everyone wants to know what was happening in 1995 and 1996 from the horse 's mouth . "" Back in Moscow , a segment of Russian society has followed proceedings avidly .
Some , like the opposition newspaper Novaya Gazeta , have likened the trial to Russia 's version of WikiLeaks , an insider look into events recounted by the very people that lived them .
"" I became an adult when this stage of the country 's history seemed to be left in the past , "" the paper 's correspondent Vera Chelischeva wrote , in an article titled "" Berezovsky + Abramovich = Russian Assange . ""
"" And it 's only here , at this mad trial in the court of a foreign government , that I 've been explained the ' why s ' .
Crudely explained .
Under oath .
"" Her dogged reports from the case run under the rubric "" Trial of the Century "" .
The country 's leading newspapers â€ “ Vedomosti , Kommersant , online portal Gazeta.ru
â€ “ have been live - blogging each day of the trial , directly translating the questions and testimony given in the courtroom .
Kommersant has illustrated its coverage with a cartoon , showing Berezovsky , Abramovich and the judge underneath Big Ben and the Houses of parliament .
Abramovich looks like a bearded geography teacher.""The political elite is interested [ in the trial ] as a collection of fantastic details , "" said Gleb Pavlovsky , a well - connected political analyst .
"" Stories about Abramovich and Berezovsky are like the story of the Trojan War , of Odysseus , and how everything was done . ""
That 's particularly true when it comes to Abramovich .
Despite his enormous wealth , close links to the Kremlin and political involvement â€ “ first as governor , today as a deputy in the far eastern region of Chukotka â€ “
the 45-year - old oligarch remains a mystery in his own country .
After his seventh day of testimony in the trial , TV Rain , a new television channel , led its report with the fact that Abramovich managed to utter a few words of English .
Russia 's official media outlets have been less enthralled , and the country 's leadership and political elite have avoided the subject altogether .
The story has received intermittent coverage on the federal level , with oligarchs still widely reviled .
Not surprisingly , the ruling United Russia party has launched a slow campaign to discredit the whole affair .
Last week , it released a video featuring Vladimir Solovyov , a leading Kremlin - friendly journalist who hosts a debate show on Rossiya , one of the country 's main state - run channels .
The video was titled : "" Russia is not an English colony . ""
"" That they 're talking about our government there , is that not a disgrace ? ""
Solovyov asks , staring down the camera .
He expresses amazement that his fellow Russians have accepted "" English jurisdiction "" over events that happened in Russia "" at the end of the last century and at the start of this one "" .
Most of the British journalists covering the litigation battle have drifted away , as the trial entered its second month .
But their Russian counterparts are still filing .
Mary Timohova , a UK correspondent for the Russian portal Slon.ru , says that her readers can not get enough of London . ""
For them , London is a paradise , "" she said .
"" If you take a normal story and put London in it , the interest goes up . ""
Observers have drawn comparisons between Abramovich with his fellow oligarch Mikhail Khodorkovsky , serving a 14 year jail sentence after two trials in Moscow .
In the 1990s both used third - party entities to reduce their oil companies ' tax bills .
Khodorkovsky â€ “
Putin 's foe â€ “ is in prison ;
Abramovich â€
“
Putin 's friend â€ “ is not . ""
The same methods and explanations used against Khodorkovsky were never brought against other companies , "" Pavlovsky said .
"" The most interesting thing is why Berezovsky and , even more so Abramovich , suddenly started to tell the truth about their pasts , "" political analyst Stanislav Belkovsky , wrote in a column for Moskovsky Komsomolets , Russia 's most popular daily .
Belkovsky said that the Russian elite were "" very scared "" of the London court , but no longer feared its Russian equivalent â€ “ with Russia 's legal system known for its susceptibility to political influence . ""
They tremble before this [ English ] court , "" Belkovsky wrote .
He added : "" They want to live [ in London ] no matter what . """
2011-11-24,"A Russian TV newsreader has been fired after apparently raising her middle finger to Barack Obama live on air .
REN TV , a privately owned Russian channel , dismissed Tatyana Limanova after a video clip of her gesture went viral .
Limanova was reading a report on the Asian - Pacific Economic Co - operation ( Apec ) summit held in Hawaii earlier this month when she noted that Dmitry Medvedev , Russia 's president , had taken up its rotating presidency . ""
Before , this post was held by Barack Obama , "" she read , before looking up at the camera , lowering her eyes again and raising her middle finger .
Debate raged inside Russia over whether Limanova 's gesture was aimed at Obama or someone inside the studio , but REN TV took no chances . ""
On 14 November , on the News 24 programme , anchor Limanova , on live TV , allowed the use of an inappropriate gesture ( a synonym for an obscene expression ) , "" the channel said in a statement on Thursday .
"" This gesture was addressed to members of the production team , had no subtext , and was not linked to the information Limanova was reporting at the time . ""
The channel decided to fire her anyway , stating : "" Since this does not detract from her guilt and is not an excuse , the leadership of the REN TV channel considers this act a gross violation of discipline and a manifestation of unprofessionalism . ""
REN TV is one of the few privately owned federal TV channels inside Russia and broadcasts to 120 million people .
The row came a day after US - Russia relations faced their latest test .
On Wednesday , Medvedev issued a harsh statement warning the US over its missile defence plans â€ “ a move said to have "" spoiled Thanksgiving "" for the Americans ."

Now the country 's ruling duo has begun to target that most fickle of demographic â€ “ the music fan .
President Dmitry Medvedev , who has agreed to step down next year in favour of Prime Minister Vladimir Putin , kicked off the campaign on Thursday during a visit to a school in the north - western city of Petrozavodsk .
Entering the school 's gymnasium , he at first tried to resist calls he join a group of young ballerinas in a traditional dance .
"" I will not dance , I still have meetings to run , "" Medvedev said , according to tabloid Life News .
The president was likely still smarting from the ridicule he faced after a video of his awkward dance to the single "" American Boy "" leaked online in April .
Medvedev eventually gave in , dancing arm - in - arm with a young ballerina in a black leotard before attempting to engage in a game of patty - cake . ""
The dance was really straightforward , but anyway the president constantly messed up the patty - cake , which looked rather absurd , "" online news portal NewsRu reported .
Videos of the dance have been viewed more than 50,000 times on YouTube .
Perhaps attempting to revive his image a little , the president on Friday talked up his love for "" hard rock "" during a meeting with a women 's group in honour of Russia 's Mother 's Day . ""
When I was a young student , I only listened to foreign music , mainly rock music and hard rock , "" Medvedev told the forum , as Putin sat by . ""
Then I surprised myself by discovering ethnic music .
Now I like to listen to music from different places , and in many situations .
Even when you work , some ethnic music calms the nerves .
"" Putin , who has consistently sought to appeal to Russians while more liberal Medvedev has presented a kinder face to the west , answered succinctly : "" I am Russian and I love Russian music . ""
Putin and Medvedev are expected to swap job roles after the country 's presidential election in March ."
2011-12-07,"It was a late - night tweet that shook the Russian internet â€
“ did President Dmitry Medvedev really retweet a post implying jailed opposition activist Alexey Navalny
was a "" cocksucking sheep "" ?
According to the Kremlin , he did not .
Russian internet users are not so sure .
The tweet came hours after riot police and pro - Kremlin youth activists put down a second protest against disputed parliamentary election results and Vladimir Putin 's rule . ""
Today it became clear that a person who writes in their blog the words ' party of crooks and thieves ' is a stupid , c*cksucking sheep : ) , "" said the tweet , written by Konstantin Rykov , a media - savvy Duma deputy .
It was a clear reference to Navalny , who coined the popular phrase "" party of crooks and thieves "" , disparaging Putin 's United Russia .
A short clip of Navalny yelling the "" cocksucking sheep "" insult at a first protest against Putin 's rule on Monday had already gone viral .
Medvedev 's official Twitter account promptly retweeted Rykov 's note , sending the Russian blogosphere into a frenzy .
It was quickly deleted â€ “ but caches of the act spread far and wide .
The Kremlin was forced to admit the retweet . ""
Tonight an incorrect retweet of an entry appeared on Dmitry Medvedev 's Twitter account , "" the Kremlin press office said .
"" A check revealed that during a routine password change , an employee in charge of technical support for the account made an inadmissible interference in @MedvedevRussia 's feed .
The guilty will be punished , "" it warned .
Liberal Russians took it as a sign that whoever it was that retweeted the remarks intended to make Medvedev look foolish , showing that opposition also existed within the Kremlin . ""
Dear Kremlin !
You just admitted that our people also exist in the Kremlin .
Thank you , "" tweeted Andrew Ryvkin , a user in St Petersburg , with a link to the statement ."
2011-12-07,"Russia 's anti - government protest movement has gathered momentum as tens of thousands of people said they were prepared to take to the streets this weekend in the biggest challenge to Vladimir Putin 's rule .
With concern inside the Kremlin growing , Putin and Dmitry Medvedev , Russia 's president , met their security council , including the interior and defence ministers , the head of the federal security service ( FSB ) and the country 's foreign intelligence chief , to discuss the situation .
Helicopters hovered in the skies over Moscow , while the police presence on the streets of the Russian capital remained strong following two protests that led to hundreds of people arrested .
The movement was triggered by a disputed parliamentary election result that protesters say wildly overstated the popularity of Putin 's United Russia party .
Mikhail Gorbachev , the former premier who oversaw the end of the Soviet Union , on Wednesday called on the Russian authorities to annul the election result and hold a new vote . ""
More and more people are starting to believe that the election results are not fair , "" he told the Interfax news agency .
"" I believe that ignoring public opinion discredits the authorities and destabilises the situation . ""
The authorities "" must admit that there have been numerous falsifications and ballot stuffing "" , he added .
More than 16,700 people indicated on Facebook their intention to gather in Revolution Square , a stone 's throw from the Kremlin , this Saturday .
Another 5,500 said they would attend a similar protest in St Petersburg .
Protests were also being organised in more than 80 cities across Russia , including the Urals city of Yekaterinburg and the Siberian city of Surgut .
But there was growing fear that the Russian authorities would step up their action against protesters .
Yevgenia Chirikova , an environmental activist turned opposition leader , said she feared the Kremlin would move beyond the haphazard arrests and the deployment of pro - Kremlin youth groups that have so far marked its response to the protests .
She noted that the government had recently approved a pay increase for the army , a move designed to ensure its loyalty . ""
Putin has no other choice than to hold on to power , shoot himself or sit in jail , "" she said .
"" The system he has built is so corrupted , and there have been so many crimes , that there is no other path .
He will fight for his power .
"" Two of the opposition 's leaders , Alexei Navalny and Ilya Yashin , remain jailed .
Vladimir Milov , another opposition leader , warned people to stay away from Saturday 's protest .
"" All this can end in big blood , "" he wrote on the website of Ekho Moskvy , a liberal radio station .
"" This is the most dangerous thing in today 's situation . ""
He urged those protesting over the election result to direct their anger at the 4 March presidential vote , which is expected to sweep Putin back into the Kremlin . ""
Blood and unrest can throw the ' Russian spring ' far back , "" Milov wrote .
"" We do n't need that now . ""
Anger has been galvanised in the wake of a parliamentary election on Sunday which saw United Russia slip below 50 % â€ “ despite reports of fraud which indicate its support has fallen much further .
Opposition activists appeared to be taken aback by the swell of popular support .
"" It 's hard to predict what will happen further , "" Chirikova said .
"" This is the first time we 've seen such events after an election .
That people are grabbing on to these falsifications is a new trend in Russian society . ""
Dmitry Finikov , a 31-year - old small - business owner who volunteered as an election monitor , uploaded his tale to LiveJournal on Tuesday morning and it was viewed more than 150,000 times by Wednesday .
His photographs and video show how election officials at his polling site in central Moscow threw away the official result of the vote , which showed United Russia coming in third with 128 votes , behind the Communists ( 202 ) and liberal Yabloko ( 134 ) .
In the final tally , United Russia won the vote at the site .
Yabloko failed to pass the threshold to enter the Duma ( lower house of parliament ) , and members of the party have joined the protest movement .
"" I wrote everything I saw , I just did what I had to do , "" said Finikov , who will attend his first ever anti - government protest on Saturday .
"" No one in Russia thinks elections are honest .
But it should n't be this way .
It must not be this way . ""
Officials continued to reject the charges of fraud .
Vladimir Churov , head of the elections commission , said in an interview published on Wednesday that the videos of fraud were themselves fraudulent .
"" There is a lot of rubbish on the internet about violations now , "" he told Itogi magazine .
"" Even before the vote , I knew of several fake ' polling sites ' in flats , where they shot these movies .
I think we 'll see more of them . ""
On Wednesday Putin filed papers declaring his candidacy for the presidential vote , failing to deliver any of the blustery comments for which he has become known .
Putin 's widely expected return to the presidency has hit a nerve with many of Russia 's urban , well - educated youth , who are dismayed at the prospect of him potentially running the country for another 12 years ."
2011-12-22,"The Russian president , Dmitry Medvedev , has proposed a host of liberal reforms in an apparent attempt to appease anti - government protesters two days before a big demonstration against a disputed parliamentary vote .
Medvedev called for the reinstatement of gubernatorial elections , an easing of political party registration rules and entertained the possibility of loosening the Kremlin 's grip on television in his final state of the union address .
Yet critics treated the proposals with suspicion , noting that Medvedev has long engaged in liberal rhetoric while yielding few results .
Medvedev is due to step down in May following a 4 March presidential vote in which he has agreed not to run , ceding his nomination to Russia 's longtime leader and current prime minister , Vladimir Putin .
Medvedev first denounced Russia 's protesters before acknowledging their concerns .
"" We will not allow provocateurs and extremists to pull society into their adventures or allow foreign interference in our internal affairs , "" he said , opening his speech , mirroring Putin 's repeated accusations that the west has provoked people on to the streets .
"" People are tired of having their interests ignored , "" he added later , while outlining a series of proposals apparently designed to address some of the protesters ' concerns . ""
I hear those who talk about the need for change and understand them . ""
Medvedev said he was proposing "" a comprehensive reform of our political system "" , starting with an initiative first proposed by Putin : a return to the direct election of Russia 's governors .
Putin cancelled the practice â€ “ which includes the election for the mayors of protest centres Moscow and St Petersburg â€ “ in 2004 .
During a televised question - and - answer session last week , Putin entertained the possibility of returning the direct vote , but repeatedly said that the process would be controlled by a "" presidential filter "" , meaning the Kremlin would still have to approve candidates .
Medvedev also called for an easing of the rules required to register parties .
Liberal parties have repeatedly been denied the chance to register , often on technicalities that often appear to reflect the Kremlin 's political concerns .
He said the number of signatures required to run for president â€ “
2 m â€ “ should be reduced to 300,000 .
Medvedev also said the creation of a public TV channel should be considered â€ “ the Kremlin currently controls all main channels , one of Putin 's first moves after coming to power in 1999 .
Other proposals included scrapping rules that require candidates for federal and regional legislatures to gather signatures in order to participate in elections , and a move to have half the deputies in the Duma elected directly rather than via party lists .
Medvedev did not address the protesters ' main demand â€
“ the throwing out of the 4 December election result that saw United Russia take a majority in the Duma despite widespread allegations of fraud .
"" On the one hand , it 's clear that the people , via these protests have been heard and that is good , "" said Ilya Ponomaryov , a Duma deputy involved in organising the protests .
"" But what 's bad is there were no concrete methods proposed .
And most of what he has proposed he wo n't have to answer for â€
“ his term is ending .
It looks like nothing more than PR . ""
The Duma 's new speaker , Sergei Naryshkin , said the political reform proposals had nothing to do with a 10 December anti - government protest attended by up to 50,000 people .
Protesters have promised to gather on Saturday in the latest show of discontent , and have increasingly turned their focus on Putin 's expected return in the upcoming presidential vote .
Medvedev attempted to make the case for continuing stability , the word that has become code for Putin 's continued leadership . ""
Russia needs democracy , not chaos , "" he told the gathering of cabinet ministers and parliamentarians seated in a gilded Kremlin hall .
"" We must learn to listen to one another , we must respect public opinion and not impose solutions from above , "" he said , before adding : "" We are required to continue what we have begun . """
2011-12-30,"The Russian president , Dmitry Medvedev , has ordered an investigation after a nuclear submarine caught fire during repairs in the Arctic , injuring at least nine people .
The blaze , believed to have been started by a welding lamp igniting rubbish and wooden scaffolding next to the craft , raged for nine hours at a shipyard in the Murmansk region .
Up to 30 crew members remained inside the submarine , although it was unclear if they were trapped .
Russian officials were quick to announce there had been no radiation leak from the nuclear sub , named Yekaterinburg , after the flames were extinguished .
Conflicting reports said between nine and sixteen people were treated for smoke inhalation .
Bellona , a respected Norwegian NGO which monitors Russia 's nuclear fleet , said the number of casualties may have been higher .
Friday 's fire was the second blow for Russia 's military this week after it emerged a blogger had published photographs of a night visit to a secret rocket engine factory near Moscow .
It is also the latest in a string of accidents to befall Russia 's fleet of nuclear submarines in recent years , the most notorious being the explosion that sent the Kursk to the bottom of the Barents Sea in 2000 , killing all 118 crew on board .
A K-159 submarine sank in the same waters three years later with the loss of nine men , and 20 people died after the leak of a fire suppressant gas on a K-152 Nerpa off Russia 's Pacific coast in 2008 .
The K-84 Yekaterinburg , launched in 1984 , is normally equipped with up to 16 missiles and 12 torpedoes .
It was reportedly unarmed and in dry dock when the fire started Friday afternoon and spread to the rubber shell around the craft .
About 400 emergency workers struggled to contain the blaze using helicopters and tug boats , partially submerging the vessel in order to put it out .
The 18,200-tonne , 167-metre Yekaterinburg was reportedly used twice this year to successfully test - fire the Sineva ballistic missile , also known by its Nato designation Skiff .
Igor Konashenkov , a defence ministry spokesman , said the Yekaterinburg 's reactor was out of operation at the time of the accident , which happened at the Roslyakovo dock , one of the main port 's for Russia 's northern fleet , situated about 900 miles north of Moscow close to the city of Murmansk .
"" There is no danger of a radioactive leak , "" he said .
Prosecutors have launched a criminal investigation into the accident .
Medvedev ordered deputy prime ministers Dmitry Rogozin and Igor Sechin to examine the causes of the fire and ensure the craft is restored .
The fire will embarrass Medvedev , who this year approved Â£400bn of arms spending to 2020 .
The desolate region around Murmansk contains the biggest concentration of old nuclear reactors in the world and , since the cold war ended , has become the world 's atomic dustbin .
Murmansk is home to the old Soviet Union 's northern fleet of nuclear submarines , many of Russia 's atom - powered icebreakers and several 40-year - old civil reactors .
Alexander Ruzankin , head of economic development for the Murmansk region , says it has around 200 working nuclear reactors and 20,000 separate stores of waste , ranging from containers full of radioactive water to decrepit buildings full of fuel rods .
Nearly 20 % of the world 's reactors and nuclear fuel is concentrated in the region .
A few obsolete nuclear submarines are decommissioned each year with the help of US and Norwegian aid , but the nuclear legacy is growing as Germany and former Soviet states send their radioactive research reactors and nuclear waste there for decommissioning and eventual shipment to the Urals .
Many of the stores are in a dangerous condition and are leaking water and radioactive substances into the soil and water ."
2012-01-03,"Led Zeppelin riffs set his heart racing and the booming chords of Deep Purple are said to shake the walls of his chintzy living room .
Now Russia 's president , Dmitry Medvedev , has revealed a new passion for British rock after inviting veteran Bradford band Smokie to appear at an exclusive Kremlin dinner .
The West Yorkshire outfit , who had hits such as Living Next Door to Alice in the 1970s , performed four songs at an invitation - only new year jamboree in Moscow on 30 December , it has emerged .
The band , whose song Pass it Around was banned from Radio One in 1975 because of alleged references to drugs , played to Medvedev and several hundred guests , including politicians and military figures .
Vladimir Putin , the prime minister , was also said to be present .
Guests were treated to octopus carpaccio , baked veal with tuna sauce and panna cotta with a raspberry topping .
Bassist Terry Uttley , 60 , said he was honoured to take part .
"" I think Medvedev and Putin were at the first table in front of the guitar player , although I could n't be certain , "" he said .
"" It was very highbrow .
There was n't any dancing in the aisles . ""
The event was controversial in Russia because several opposition figures attended after criticising recent election results allegedly manipulated by the Kremlin .
Smokie have a large following in eastern Europe and had just finished a Russian tour when they got the invitation last month , said their manager John Wagstaff .
"" Their number , What Can I Do , is especially popular , "" he said .
"" I 've even heard that Russian students turned it into a drinking song called Vodka I Do . ""
The Kremlin has become a regular spot for big western acts .
Medvedev invited his ultimate hard rock heroes Deep Purple for tea and buns when they visited last year and Putin met Paul McCartney when he played in Red Square in 2003 .
Putin 's spokesman denied reports in 2009 that an Abba tribute band had performed for the prime minister and a "" glamorous "" woman at a theatre 200 miles north of Moscow .
Bono of U2 held a meeting with Medvedev in 2010 but upset the Kremlin by inviting Yury Shevchuk , a popular Russian singer who has criticised the ruling elite , to join him on stage at Luzhniki stadium .
Uttley said the State Kremlin Palace , where the new year concert was held , looked smarter than when he had visited it in 2004 , although there were some signs of austerity . ""
Back then , they served us wines from Joseph Stalin 's personal cellar , "" he said .
"" This time it was Australian Shiraz . ""
Medvedev announced in September that he would not run for a second presidential term , preferring to step aside â€ “
some believe reluctantly â€ “ to allow Putin to return to the Kremlin this spring .
Smokie may have wisely avoided performing their hit , Changing All the Time , at the gig .
It contains the line : "" We both knew there 'd be things we 'd have to face
but it is true that I can never take his place . """
2012-03-02,"Vladimir Putin 's growing rivalry with his one - time protege Dmitry Medvedev led to him seeking re - election as president , a former Kremlin insider said .
Gleb Pavlovsky , who was sacked as a Kremlin adviser on the personal orders of Putin after lobbying for Medvedev to stay as president , said that the two men ended up not speaking to each other on the central issue that divided them .
Pavlovsky said : "" By the end of 2010 there was a great deal of tension .
And it was exacerbated by the fact that they did not talk about it .
They talked about everything
but .
And Putin thought : ' Ah , he 's not talking to me because he 's got some kind of plan ' and Medvedev thought the same about Putin .
And moreover , he is the president , why does he have to discuss such things with the prime minister ? ""
The more forceful Medvedev became in his pronouncements about his support for western intervention in Libya , the less Putin trusted him .
Pavlovsky said : "" In the White House [ the seat of the Russian government ] there was a constant fear that Medvedev would sack the government , suddenly .
And that would create a completely different situation .
This fear reached its height in the spring of 2011 .
"" The problems started in 2010 when the ruling elite began to migrate towards Medvedev . ""
That was what really put Putin on guard , "" the former adviser said .
Private polling for the Kremlin showed that the elite , as well as broader social groups such as pensioners , were starting to go over to Medvedev . ""
Putin had the feeling that Medvedev was eroding his popularity rating and that it was time for him to walk on to the stage .
Sociologists were telling him that as soon as he even hinted that he would return , then his rating would rise to the heavens .
But he could not say that because it would have broken the rules of the ' tandem ' , "" Pavlovsky said .
Pavlovsky claimed that the Vladislav Surkov , dubbed Putin 's ' grey cardinal ' , agreed with him .
He said : "" Surkov saw Medvedev staying as the preferable option .
I never had the impression that Surkov wanted Putin to experiment with his return .
He felt the limits of the system .
He was the last person in the Kremlin who understood what the Kremlin could withstand and what it could n't .
And now there is no one left to feel that .
"" Surkov was ousted from his role as key Kremlin strategist and reassigned to another role in government after the first major wave of protests in December .
Pavlovsky said Putin had lost so much support that he would literally have to pay his way out of trouble .
He said : "" The vertical of power is a system of accreditation , that 's all .
You literally have to pay to get things done .
In 10 years the readiness of people to love Putin and agree with everything he does has changed fundamentally .
It 's no longer there . ""
"" Before no one could risk going into confrontation â€ “ a governor , for example â€ “ because he would certainly lose .
But now a space for dissent has opened up .
Everybody has resources .
And Putin can keep on giving money so that he is loved , but each separate love will need to be paid for .
When I say payment , yes , I mean financial bonuses .
"" As for Medvedev , he has effectively been turned into a lame duck , even though he has been promised the job of prime minister .
On the internet , he has picked up the moniker zhalky , or "" pitiful "" .
Even his once greatest supporters , members of the liberal - leaning elite who hoped the president would prove himself to be more than a seat - warmer between Putin terms , have abandoned him , raising doubts that he will indeed take up the premiership . ""
That he will become prime minister is something that is talked about less and less , "" said Alexei Mukhin , head of the Political Information Centre , a Russian thinktank .
"" Even members of his circle have begun to express doubts . ""
Last week , Igor Yurgens , an adviser to Medvedev , said he would not be very successful in the job .
Putin 's allies in the cabinet would "" tear him apart "" , he told Bloomberg .
Observers have long speculated that Alexei Kudrin , a former finance minister and close Putin ally whom Medvedev fired after he criticised the job swap , could become prime minister instead .
"" Kudrin would be an ideal prime minister for an interim period because he 's a highly regarded professional and obviously enjoys the trust of future President Putin , "" Yurgens said .
Kremlin insiders say Igor Shuvalov , a first deputy prime minister who focuses on investment issues , is another potential candidate , as is Igor Sechin , a deputy prime minister who is believed to head the Kremlin 's siloviki faction , a clan of former defence and KGB officials .
"" If he does n't become prime minister , then Dmitry Medvedev will become head of the ' justice vertical ' "" , Mukhin said , referring to the corrupt legal system .
Medvedev , a lawyer , made justice reform a key plank of his presidency , but his rhetoric was backed up by little action .
He himself once mused on a life outside politics , starting with teaching at his pet project , an international business school in Moscow called Skolkovo . ""
If everything there is working well , I would certainly like to teach there , "" Medvedev said last April .
"" I would like to do that not only at Skolkovo , but in other places because it seems to me that any politician who has headed the state simply must speak about his experience , negative and positive . """
2012-03-04,"Vladimir Putin has claimed a resounding victory in Russia 's presidential election , provoking a furious response from opposition activists who alleged that the vote was marred by widespread fraud .
At a rally in front of the Kremlin an emotional Putin , with tears running down his face and flanked by the outgoing president , Dmitry Medvedev , said : "" I promised you we would win .
We have won .
Glory to Russia .
"" Putin congratulated his supporters for preventing unidentified outside forces from determining the country 's fate , angrily reiterating his charge that the unprecedented protests against his rule that have rocked the country since a contested parliamentary vote in December have been curated by the west . ""
We showed that no one can direct us in anything ! ""
Putin said .
"" We were able to save ourselves from political provocations , which have one goal : to destroy Russian sovereignty and usurp power . ""
The central election commission gave Putin 63 % with 22 % of votes counted .
The state - run VTsIOM polling agency said its exit polls predicted that Putin would take 58.3 % of the vote .
But as with the December vote , independent election monitors and opposition activists presented evidence of widespread falsifications , including ballot stuffing and "" carousel voting "" â€ “ packing vans with voters and bussing them to several polling sites to cast numerous votes .
The Kremlin set up webcams in polling sites to combat fraud .
One camera caught a man stuffing voting papers into a ballot box in Dagestan .
Putin 's supporters rejected claims of voting irregularities .
"" This is the cleanest election in Russia 's entire history , "" said his campaign chief , Stanislav Govorukhin .
"" The violations our rivals and the opponents of our president will now speak of are laughable .
"" Some in Moscow said their support for Putin was a vote for stability .
"" I voted for Putin because there are no other candidates , "" said Elena , a 50-year - old teacher voting at a school in western Moscow .
Many opposition activists had hoped to force Putin into a second round and questioned his landslide victory .
"" Putin has named himself the emperor of Russia for the next 12 years , "" said the protest leader Alexey Navalny .
"" We announced earlier that we will not recognise these elections .
The powers here are illegitimate â€ “
this is their only way to remain in power .
"" Thousands were due to take to the streets on Monday to express their discontent with the result . ""
Can [ Putin ] hold on to power for the full six years ?
I think not , "" Navalny said .
"" My supporters and I will use various peaceful means to ensure that this person , who has no legitimate right to hold this post , will not hold it for six years . ""
Putin , who has already served as president from 1999 to 2008 , will return to the presidency following an inauguration in early May.
Constitutional changes instituted by Medvedev extended the presidential term from four to six years .
Beyond the election day reports of fraud , Putin 's critics said the vote was illegitimate before it began .
They accused him of unfairly using administrative resources , including state - run television , to advance his candidacy and to refuse to register candidates such as the liberal Yabloko leader , Grigory Yavlinsky .
Putin 's official opponents lagged far behind .
The Communist leader , Gennady Zyuganov , came in second with early results showing he took 17.37 % of the vote .
The billionaire latecomer Mikhail Prokhorov took nearly 8 % , while the far - right nationalist firebrand Vladimir Zhirinovsky took nearly 7.5 % .
Sergei Mironov , who abstained from throwing his support behind Putin , unlike in previous elections , came in last with 3.67 % .
Several regions reported huge support for Putin .
More than 76 % of voters in the far - eastern region of Chukotka , formerly governed by Chelsea FC 's owner , Roman Abramovich , voted for Putin , the election commission said .
The troubled Caucasus region , in accordance with what has already become tradition , also presented near unanimous support for Putin .
In Moscow , the Kremlin was on high alert as thousands of police and interior ministry troops deployed in the centre .
Tens of thousands of members of the pro - Kremlin youth group Nashi were bussed in from around the country to attend a victory rally .
Despite the Kremlin 's insistence that the vote was not decided in advance , a stage was constructed as early as Sunday morning in anticipation of the victory rally .
The protest movement against Putin has found its greatest strength in Moscow , launched after a 4 December parliamentary vote marred by widespread evidence of fraud .
Some 370,000 Russians signed up to act as independent election monitors after the vote , an unprecedented show of civic activism born of the growing protest movement against Putin 's rule .
Putin voted alongside his rarely seen wife , Lyudmila Putina , at the Russian Academy of Sciences .
Fifteen minutes after he left the polling site , three women tore off their shirts and began shouting "" Putin is a thief "" .
They were dragged away by police and one activist was later sentenced to 10 days in jail ."
2012-03-09,"The new consensus is that Vladimir Putin 's regime is finished .
And yet last week the former KGB spy was overwhelmingly "" re - elected "" as Russia 's president .
By May he will be back in the Kremlin for the third time â€ “ poor old Dmitry Medvedev booted into the job of prime minister , and soon to shuffle off the stage .
By this summer Putin will be in Britain , his least favourite European country , sitting in the Olympics VIP box .
As Masha Gessen acknowledges in her luminous study of Russia 's forever leader , getting rid of Putin will be tough .
For sure , over the past three months , middle - class Russians have risen up against him in unprecedented numbers .
The trigger was December 's blatantly falsified Duma elections ; on Monday thousands gathered again in Pushkin Square to protest against his election victory .
Russia is now divided into three camps : those who passionately oppose Putin ; those whose support him , seeing not much of an alternative ; and those who do n't care .
The problem for the demonstrators , as Gessen writes , is that there is no simple mechanism for forcing Putin out , no "" obvious cause - and - effect relationship between street protests and the ultimate fall of the regime "" .
Like the Soviet Union , Russia lacks independent institutions such as a supreme court that could conceivably broker a deal between the ruling camp and the swelling opposition .
Over the past 12 years democracy in Russia got squashed .
And yet Gessen is an optimist .
In her book 's epilogue she describes the sudden snowballing of December 's protests .
She is convinced the regime is "" doomed "" and that "" Putin 's bubble will burst "" .
It "" may take months or it may take a few years , "" she writes , predicting that the street movement will continue "" until those in power realise that they are a tiny and despised minority "" .
Well , maybe .
But for the moment nobody knows when , or indeed how , Putin will be forced out .
In his tearful victory speech he made out he had just foiled a western - backed coup .
Nor is there agreement on what is the best metaphor to evoke the dramatic events underway in Moscow .
( It 's too cold to chatter about a "" Russian Spring "" ; the "" Snow Revolution "" is better .
But there 's no revolution : the mood among the crowds is more playful and mocking than tear - down - the - barricades . )
And there are plenty of depressing reasons to think that Putin will boa - constrict his enemies .
Gessen is an accomplished Russian - American journalist who lives in Moscow , and was 24 when Putin 's beloved Soviet Union collapsed .
A dogged researcher , she has written a brave book , demolishing the numerous myths and legends that have accumulated around her subject .
Grey , ordinary and seemingly incorruptible , Putin is the man without a face , on to whom others can project whatever they want .
Boris Berezovsky , the country 's former shadow ruler , picked Putin almost at random from a series of possible candidates to lead Russia , believing him to be malleable .
Western leaders thought him at first to be a liberal reformer .
And after the doddering Yeltsin , many ordinary Russians saw Putin as a saviour who would rescue the country from its foes .
But according to Gessen , Putin 's real compulsions are quite primitive .
He was born to a working - class family in Leningrad that only just survived the Nazi siege .
This "" miracle child "" determined from an early age to join the KGB .
In a fascinating chapter Gessen sheds light on what Putin was really up to in Dresden , where he worked in the late 1980s as an undercover spy .
In East Germany Putin was a "" pen - pusher "" ; he added to the useless mountain of information produced by the KGB .
But Gessen also tracks down a former member of the Red Army Faction who met Putin during this murky period .
The radical West German presented Putin with gifts : a state - of - the - art Grundig radio , and a Blaupunkt stereo for his car .
The Stasi spooks who received similar goods were grateful .
But Putin never said thank - you â€ “ an early example of his "" strikingly selfish "" relationship with money .
Gessen digs up further examples of Putin 's personal corruption .
These date back to the immediate post - Soviet period when Putin â€ “ now home with only some cash and a second - hand washing machine to show for his East German adventures â€ “ worked as an assistant to the glamorous mayor of St Petersburg , Anatoly Sobchak .
Sobchak is usually seen as a "" democrat "" .
But he hedged his bets when KGB hardliners tried to topple Gorbachev ; he talked about democracy not because he believed in it but because he realised it was the key to the good life .
As deputy mayor for international relations , Putin masterminded a scheme whereby the city exported raw materials to Germany in return for badly needed food imports .
The materials were delivered , but the food mysteriously never arrived .
Money from the Germans â€ “ at least $ 92 m
â€ “ also disappeared .
From this early stage , Gessen alleges , Putin was embezzling state funds , and by the end of the 90s he was no doubt "" a millionaire "" .
Sobchak , meanwhile , abolished the city council and bugged the offices of leading St Petersburg journalists .
He developed a fierce hatred for democratic politics .
All this provided Putin with a model of authoritarian governance he would put to good use later .
Once in the Kremlin , he wheeled out his own "" closed system "" , Gessen argues , built on "" total control "" â€ “ particularly over the flow of money and information .
Much of the second half of Gessen 's book covers familiar territory : the smashing up of Yukos , the country 's largest private oil company ; the jailing of its owner , Mikhail Khodorkovsky ; and the polonium murder of Alexander Litvinenko .
By this point , most people had woken up to what Putin actually is â€ “ a "" small and vengeful man "" , in Gessen 's words , prone to furious vendettas , fond of helping himself to other people 's property , and the "" godfather of a mafia clan ruling the country "" .
Gessen remains optimistic that Putin will soon be receding into Russia 's tsar - and - despot littered history .
My sense is that he will be with us for some time yet .

2012-03-11,"A luxury Tuscan spa hotel which has hosted the likes of Giuseppe Verdi , Paul CÃ
© zanne and Arnold Schwarzenegger during its 142-year history has rolled out the red carpet for an unexpected arrival from the world 's new capital of bling â€ “ Moscow .
Svetlana Medvedeva , the wife of outgoing Russian president Dmitry Medvedev , has hitherto avoided a reputation for rock star living , but made a start this month by booking out the entire Hotel La Pace in Montecatini Terme for a week and showing up with her son and a 30-strong entourage , including bodyguards and translators .
In a move worthy of an oil sheikh 's wife , Medvedeva , 46 , arrived while the 140-room hotel was shut for the winter , prompting staff to hurriedly throw open the shutters and plump up the pillows as Italian police set up a security operation in the small town .
As Vladimir Putin retakes the reins in Russia from her husband , Medvedeva may have wanted a breather from hectic years of opening art festivals , meeting Japanese orphans and visiting crisis centres for underage mothers .
With rooms going for â‚¬600 a night and suites at up to â‚¬1,300 â€ “ plus the price of saunas and massages â€ “ the elegant , Liberty - style Hotel La Pace clearly looked the right place to splurge .
Clark Gable , Grace Kelly and Audrey Hepburn have all checked in to sip the local water over the years , and discreet staff have handled smoothly guests with peculiar requests or capricious behaviour , including the Polish count who insisted on clearing the restaurant for a game of tennis to a British lord who was ticked off for flicking cherry stones at other guests during dinner .
Medvedeva 's visit followed promotional trips made to Moscow by hotel managers , reported Italian daily Corriere Fiorentino .
Her stay , the hotel hopes , will trigger an onslaught of Russian oligarchs and their wives , just as Roman Abramovich 's visit to the Tuscan resort of Forte dei
Marmi turned it from a genteel hideaway for Milan industrialists into Moscow - on - sea , and Putin 's stay at Silvio Berlusconi 's Sardinian villa
helped clog the island 's Emerald coast with Russian yachts .
Massimo Giovannetti , a local official in Montecatini Terme , told Corriere Fiorentino the effects of Medvedeva 's visit "" will be seen in the coming months when Russian tourists who love classic spas will turn up in ever greater numbers "" .
Mixing Russian millionaires and Italian lifestyle has not always proved easy .
The mayor of Forte
dei
Marmi has made plans to keep new local housing back for locals after prices spiralled , while in Sardinia bottles were reportedly thrown by rich Russians at pop star Zucchero after he objected to a woman texting while he sang .
The Hotel La Pace has its own experience of high maintenance Russians .
In 1908 the Russian ambassador to Italy complained the buzz of crickets was ruining his afternoon nap , prompting a resourceful manager to send two guitarists to his room to play "" sweetly and without stopping "" .
Giuseppe Bellandi , the mayor of Montecatini Terme , appeared to welcome the prospect of a Russian invasion , promising that from this season signs in the town will be written in Cyrillic as well as English and Italian ."
2012-03-26,"Republican leaders have jumped on Barack Obama after the president made unguarded comments to Russian leader Dmitry Medvedev , appealing to him to allow Obama space on the contentious European missile defence issue â€ “ and claiming he could be more flexible after the November general election .
Obama 's comments were caught on a microphone during what the two leaders believed was a private conversation during a nuclear summit in South Korea .
Within minutes , rightwing blogs in America were full of accusations that Obama 's comments offered fresh evidence of weakness , of kowtowing again to foreign governments .
Others claimed his comments provided a glimpse of what Obama planned if he wins the general election : a much more radical second term .
Mitt Romney , almost certain to be Obama 's Republican opponent in the general election , quickly sought to exploit the gaffe , describing it as "" an alarming and troubling development "" .
In an earlier statement , Romney said : "" President Obama signalled that he 's going to cave to Russia on missile defence , but the American people have a right to know where else he plans to be ' flexible ' in a second term . ""
In the comments caught by the mic , Obama urged Medvedev to tell incoming Russian president Vladimir Putin to give him time : "" On all these issues , but particularly missile defence , this , this can be solved â€ “ but it 's important for him to give me space . ""
Medvedev replied : "" Yeah , I understand .
I understand your message about space .
Space for you .
"" Obama then elaborated : "" This is my last election .
After my election I have more flexibility . ""
Medvedev responded : "" I understand .
I will transmit this information to Vladimir .
"" It is the second time in six months that Obama has been caught unawares on microphone .
In November , he was caught with the French president , Nicolas Sarkozy , criticising the Israeli prime minister , Binyamin Netanyahu .
The White House , responding to reporters about the exchanges with Medvedev , acknowleged the reality that progress on the missile issue â€ “ which Russia claims is aimed at itself but which the US contends is to protect Europe from Iran â€ “ is unlikely in an election year .
Ben Rhodes , the White House deputy national security adviser , said : "" Since 2012 is an election year in both countries , with an election and leadership transition in Russia and an election in the United States , it is clearly not a year in which we are going to achieve a breakthrough . ""
Romney , in a tweet , proposed a game in which people could predict other issues on which Obama might be flexible in a second term . ""
Fill in the blank .
@BarackObama :
I 'll have more flexibility to _ _ _ _ _ _ _ after the election .
# ObamaFlexibility . ""
Such a strategy could be risky for Romney , with memories still fresh of last week 's ' Etch a Sketch ' gaffe by his campaign spokesman Eric Fehrnstrom .
Fehrnstrom said Romney 's campaign was like an Etch A Sketch , which was interpreted by many as Romney being ready to adopt different policies in the White House race from those he espouses in the Republican race .
The Republican chairman of the House armed services committee , Mike Turner , issued a statement asking the White House to clarify the president 's remarks to Medvedev . ""
Congress has made exquisitely clear to your administration and to other nations that it will block all attempts to weaken US missile defences , "" Turner said .
Conservative pundit Jennifer Rubin of the Washington Post , wrote : "" It 's remarkable , actually , that Obama could be any more flexible with Russia after the election than he 's already been under the ' reset ' that is indistinguishable from appeasement . """

2012-05-30,"Vladimir Putin will not be coming to the London Olympics , diplomatic sources have said , in an apparent signal of the Russian president 's continuing displeasure and irritation with Britain .
Putin will not attend the London 2012 opening ceremony on 27 July , sources confirmed , despite the fact that Moscow will host the Winter Olympics in 2014 in the Black Sea resort of Sochi .
Instead , the Russian president is likely to dispatch his prime minister , Dmitry Medvedev , to London .
The snub follows Putin 's controversial decision earlier this month to boycott the G8 summit hosted by the US president , Barack Obama .
Putin claimed he was too busy forming his new government to attend , and sent Medvedev instead .
He has accused the US of inciting street protests against him and is unhappy with Washington 's missile defence plans in Europe .
Putin has a long list of grievances against Britain .
As well as the unresolved Alexander Litvinenko affair â€ “ a source of smouldering tension â€
“
the Kremlin has been infuriated by calls to ban senior Russians accused of human rights abuses .
In March , a group of backbench MPs voted to refuse visas to officials implicated in the death of Sergei Magnitsky , a Russian lawyer who died in prison in 2009 .
The Foreign Office has so far ignored the non - binding vote and ruled out a Magnitsky ban .
Putin was inaugurated for a third time as president on 7 May.
Soon afterwards , he announced that one of Moscow 's top foreign policy priorities was to prevent government and other officials from being placed on visa blacklists abroad .
Campaigners say visa bans are one of the few effective measures against bureaucrats who enjoy visiting London and other EU capitals and typically hold bank accounts in the west .
On Wednesday , Denis MacShane , the former Labour Europe minister , said he welcomed Putin 's decision to avoid the Games .
Earlier this year , the MP said Downing Street should make it clear Putin was not welcome at the Olympics .
The threat of Magnitsky sanctions has received "" phenomenal coverage "" in the Russian press , he said , probably contributing to the decision to stay away .
"" I think Putin does n't want to come to Britain and face difficult questions , "" he said .
He went on : "" This is further evidence of the turning inwards of Putin towards a more nationalistic authoritarianism and a rejection of western values .
He does n't want to come to a democratic country and realise how unpopular he now is , because of his refusal to uphold the rule of law and justice back in Russia . ""
Putin attended the opening ceremony of the Beijing Games in August 2008 .
At the time Putin was prime minister , having installed his protege Medvedev as president .
The ceremony was dramatically overshadowed by events in Georgia , which came under Russian air and artillery bombardment after Georgian troops briefly seized back the rebel province of South Ossetia .
Putin and Bush were seen having a heated conversation about who was to blame for the unfolding war .
Since David Cameron 's coalition government took over in 2010 there has been a modest improvement in bilateral relations , with foreign secretary William Hague â€ “ who was in Moscow on Monday â€
“ keen to promote bilateral trade .
But Putin remains incensed about Britain 's refusal to extradite leading Kremlin critics based in London , including the fugitive oligarch Boris Berezovsky and the Chechen separatist leader Akhmed Zakayev .
There are also major differences on international affairs , with the west exasperated by Moscow 's stalwart support for Syria 's President Bashar al - Assad and its spoiling role at the UN security council .
Russia , for its part , sees US and UK support for Syria 's rebels as part of a western - engineered plot to force regime change in Damascus .
Since returning to the Kremlin this month , Putin has kept a surprisingly low profile .
There have been none of the stunts or photo opportunities that characterised his election campaign .
Kremlin minders are apparently keen to avoid spontaneous â€ “ and potentially risky â€ “ encounters with ordinary Russians .
Street protests in Moscow that began last December continue , with anti - Kremlin activists organising an Occupy - style camp and holding spontaneous mass walks .
Some 120 heads of state have said they will attend the London 2012 opening ceremony .
It will be the largest top - level international gathering in diplomatic history , the Foreign Office believes .
The number far exceeds the 87 leaders who travelled to Beijing in 2008 .
Several controversial leaders on an EU blacklist will also not be coming : they include Assad , Zimbabwe 's Robert Mugabe , and Belarus 's Alexander Lukashenko .
But other authoritarian rulers not on the list are likely to travel to London .
They include Uzbekistan 's despotic leader , Islam Karimov , and his counterpart from Turkmenistan , Gurbanguly Berdymukhamedov .
Both visited the Beijing Olympics in 2008 ."
2012-08-08,"At 22 , Nadezhda Tolokonnikova has a long history of political activism , often in concert with her husband , Pyotr Verzilov , who has championed Pussy Riot 's cause in Russia and abroad .
The duo , members of the radical art collective Voina , shot to underground fame in 2008 after being photographed taking part in an orgy in Moscow 's biological museum to protest against the election of Dmitry Medvedev , the man Putin handpicked to hold his place in the Kremlin .
She also took part in the group 's most famous art performance â€ “ drawing a giant phallus on a drawbridge across from the FSB headquarters in St Petersburg .
Tolokonnikova was in her final year of philosophy studies at Moscow State University , Russia 's most prestigious university , when she was arrested .
Verzilov is caring for their four - year - old daughter .
She has received much attention for her striking looks .
The prosecution often made her out to be the evil genius behind Pussy Riot , questioning witnesses who knew the other two women about whether their behaviour changed after they met her .
In her opening statement , read by a lawyer , Tolokonnikova apologised for those who were insulted by Pussy Riot 's performance in the Cathedral of Christ the Saviour .
"" We had no intentions to offend anyone , "" she said .
"" We wish that those who can not understand us can forgive us . ""
She spelled out the group 's intent : "" The words we spoke and our entire punk performance aimed to express our disapproval of a specific political event : the patriarch 's support of Vladimir Putin , who has taken an authoritarian and anti - feminist course .
Our performance contained no aggression towards the audience , but only a desperate desire to change the political situation in Russia for the better . ""

2012-09-12,"Dmitry Medvedev , the Russian prime minister , has called for the three jailed members of the feminist punk band Pussy Riot to be freed .
But Pussy Riot 's supporters quickly dismissed the prime minister 's statements , noting his long history of appealing to Russia 's more liberal demographic while failing to follow through on delivering results .
In televised remarks about the band on Wednesday , Medvedev said he was "" sickened by what they did , by their looks , by the hysteria that followed what had happened "" .
Three members of the radical anti - Kremlin punk collective were sentenced to two years in prison last month on charges of hooliganism motivated by religious hatred after performing a song criticising Vladimir Putin in Russia 's official cathedral .
The case sparked a global outcry and highlighted the crackdown on the opposition inside Russia .
But Medvedev said he believed the women should be freed early . ""
The prolongation of their incarceration in the conditions of jail seems to me to be unproductive , "" he said .
"" A suspended sentence , taking into account time they have already spent [ in jail ] , would be entirely sufficient .
""
The three women â€ “ Maria Alyokhina , Yekaterina Samutsevich and Nadezhda Tolokonnikova â€ “ have been jailed since their arrest in early March .
They remain in a pre - trial detention centre in Moscow as they wait for their appeal to be heard .
The appeal is due to start on 1 October . ""
This well - known group of girls has been in jail long enough , "" Medvedev said , calling the time they had already spent in detention a "" very serious punishment regardless of the sentence "" .
Medvedev â€ “ who forwent seeking a second term as president to allow his mentor , Putin , a free run â€ “ has long sought to portray himself as a liberal reformer .
As president , he had vowed to reform Russia 's culture of "" legal nihilism "" , building on his career as a lawyer .
Yet critics of the government note that his numerous statements on various legal cases â€ “ including the need to fully investigate the death in custody of the lawyer Sergei Magnitsky â€ “ have yielded no results .
He ceded the presidency in May to Putin amid unprecedented anti - government protests .
"" Medvedev has already spoken about several criminal cases and we know what the results have been , "" said Nikolai Polozov , a lawyer for Pussy Riot .
"" I agree with what he said â€ “ that they should be let out .
But considering all the other awful propaganda against our clients , it seems his voice will not be heard .
This is an attempt to save face . ""
A popular programme on state - run television said in a broadcast late on Tuesday that the Pussy Riot women were doing the devil 's work , and were the brainchild of the London - based oligarch and Kremlin foe Boris Berezovsky .
Berezovsky denied the accusation .
Pussy Riot 's supporters accuse Putin of personally orchestrating the campaign against the band .
The women sang a song that begged the Virgin Mary to rid the country of the powerful leader .
During the trial , Putin called for the women not to be judged "" too harshly "" .
The court handed them a two - year sentence instead of the maximum seven years or the three years requested by the prosecution .
Both Putin and Medvedev said they had no intention of interfering in Russia 's notoriously politicised court system ."

it 's all in a day 's work for Facebook 's chief executive , Mark Zuckerberg , who met Dmitry Medvedev , the Russian prime minister , on Monday during a visit to Moscow .
Shedding his usual hoodie for a suit and tie , Zuckerberg exchanged easy grins with the famously tech - loving premier on a visit to his official residence outside Moscow .
Medvedev could barely contain his excitement at meeting the co - founder of the world 's largest social network .
"" I have a Facebook page myself , "" he told his guest .
Zuckerberg was in Moscow to boost Facebook 's presence in Russia , where it competes with local social networking sites .
He was also due to attend a programming symposium in a bid to attract Russians to work for his firm .
Not all Russians were happy with the visit .
Oleg Kozyrev , a prominent opposition blogger , launched a Facebook group called "" Zuckerberg , do n't be friends with a dictator !

2012-10-17,"Millions of drivers who daily spend hours trapped in traffic on Moscow 's notoriously gridlocked roads are finally to get some respite as the brake goes on the motorcades of Vladimir Putin and Dmitry Medvedev and they are left "" parked at home "" .
Normally as the president and his prime minister travel each day from their suburban homes to work at the Kremlin and White House , police empty the roads of traffic , forcing drivers to wait as the men 's glamorous motorcades drift by .
For years , drivers took the daily event in stride .
About a year ago , they felt they could take no more .
Moscow is generally noisy with the sounds of thousands of drivers honking horns as they wait for the passing of these motorcades , which often involve a dozen cars with blue sirens wailing .
Videos of the honkfests have gone viral on YouTube .
Now , Putin and Medvedev seem to have taken notice .
According to Dmitry Peskov , Putin 's spokesman , the president has decided to work from home as much as possible , keeping off the streets entirely except when official functions require his presence in the Kremlin . ""
The president is minimising his meetings in the Kremlin and is preferring to hold them in Ogaryovo to avoid disturbing Muscovites , "" Peskov told the Interfax new agency .
"" There is no substantive difference â€ “ if the meeting does not require any kind of ceremony , it is held in the suburban residence .
He really has cut the use of motorcades to the minimum in Moscow . ""
Medvedev has gone a step further and has begun taking to the skies in a helicopter , according to his spokeswoman , Natalia Timakova .
A secure flight scheme has been developed by Russia 's security services , Timakova said , and Medvedev had already taken his first heli - commute in Moscow , visiting an electricity station in the capital .
Pyotr Shkumatov , head of Blue Buckets , a drivers ' rights group , said : "" The situation on Moscow 's roads is truly horrible , and when the heads of government travel in the style to which they 've become accustomed it turns into total transport collapse .
God forbid anyone gets sick â€ “ not even ambulances can get through . ""
He added : "" Maybe they have finally understood .
"" Medvedev 's decision to give up his motorcade for a helicopter came several days after the prime minister 's cortege was subjected to sustained honking during a visit to his hometown of St Petersburg .
Georgy Poltavchenko , the city 's governor , publicly criticised drivers .
"" When we were driving with our country 's prime minister down the streets of our glorious city , only the lazy did n't honk , "" he said .
"" People stood by , raising all sorts of fingers .

2012-11-15,"Russia 's prime minister Dmitry Medvedev might have eased the nerves of the country 's dairy cows by scrapping daylight saving but it is stressing out the nation 's traders .
Trading on the Russian stock exchange has dropped 15 % since London put the clocks back an hour last month and Moscow did not follow suit .
Medvedev took the decision to scrap daylight saving last year after farmers complained that it upsets the rhythm of dairy cows .
But traders complain that the increase in the time difference between London and Moscow from three to four hours is hampering plans to expand Russia 's role in global finance .
Trading on Russia 's Micex exchange fell to an average 37bn shares a day in the 11 days following London 's switch to GMT on October , compared to 43bn in the previous 11 days , according to data from Bloomberg .
Foreigners own about two - thirds of all Russian shares available for trading , according to Citigroup . ""
The time difference is responsible for the low volumes , "" Andrey Vashevnik , chief investment officer at R&amp;B Investment Fund told Bloomberg in Moscow .
"" It prevents people from doing business in the morning . ""
Dmitry Ryzhkov , vice - president of equity sales at Moscow 's Alfa Bank , said : "" Traders are stressed out .
I would very enthusiastically support the return to time changes . ""
Tatyana Rybalova , head of the research centre of Russia 's National Union of Milk Producers , explained that cows are much more sensitive to the changing of the clocks than humans .
"" I remember when daylight saving time was introduced in the Soviet times , there were protests by milkmaids in Novosibirsk and Omsk .
It seemed to particularly upset the cows in Siberia , "" he told the Guardian last year .
The time change is also said to adversely affect Russian people . ""

2013-01-23,"The Russian prime minister , Dmitry Medvedev , has swatted aside warnings that his government faces a middle class revolt if it does not embrace deeper economic and political reforms .
A session on Russia at the annual World Economic Forum in Davos on Wednesday heard that the Russian Federation faces several negative scenarios , including the potential threat of civil unrest .
A straw poll of WEF associates in the audience found nearly 80 % saw better governance as Russia 's biggest challenge .
But the warning was dismissed by Medvedev , who was in the audience and tried to reassure Davos that Russia was on the right path and was a good place to invest .
Alexey Kudrin , a professor at Saint Petersburg State University , said there were "" serious , negative "" warnings coming from Russia 's business community .
He outlined a scenario in which falling oil prices send Russia 's budget forecasts off track , forcing the government to hike taxes and slash spending on social programmes , and freezing reform efforts .
Russia should reform itself now , Kudrin argued , to negate the impact .
"" Failure to make reforms will eventually mean a burden on businesses through higher taxes , and also hit small businesses and the middle classes .
That leads to the stagnation of the Russian economy . ""
Sergei Guriev , the rector of the New Economic School , warned that high oil prices could equally lead Russia into a deeper mess , as those in power would be too complacent to maintain reforms .
"" That is not sustainable in the long term , as Russia 's middle classes will demand reforms .
They are too well - educated and too determined to enjoy increases in their quality of life [ not to protest ] "" , said Guriev .
"" They will demand that the Russian government is less corrupt , and more accessible . ""
With Vladimir Putin not present , Medvedev sat through the arguments before delivering his own address in which he told the WEF delegates they were wrong as meaningful reforms were already in hand .
He also insisted that the gloomy visions outlined by Guriev and Kudrin would not come to pass , pointing to new funds and development agencies designed to stimulate economic growth and a stronger private sector in Russia .
Russia , Medvedev insisted , was "" ready to be partners "" with global investors , and was "" an open country "" whatever its critics claimed .

Higher prices would not be welcome as it would hit global demand .

2013-03-01,"Bob Dudley , the BP boss , is poised to make a triumphant return to Moscow after being nominated to the board of state - owned Rosneft by the country 's prime minister , Dmitry Medvedev .
It is an astonishing change of fortunes for the BP chief executive , who was chased out of Russia in 2008 amid speculation in the west that the Kremlin was supporting a campaign of harassment .
The nomination of Dudley , a US citizen who was chief executive of Moscow - based TNK - BP , was contained in a decree published on the government 's website and was immediately declared "" welcome "" at BP 's headquarters in London .
BP needs a success as it fights US government charges in a New Orleans court that it acted with gross negligence during the Deepwater Horizon accident in the Gulf of Mexico three years ago .
The British oil group is finalising a Â£35bn merger with Rosneft under which the Russian group will take over BP 's 50 % holding in TNK - BP and subsume that business into the wider Rosneft operation , which will control 40 % of the country 's oil .
BP will in turn be handed a 20 % stake in Rosneft under an agreement still awaiting approval from competition authorities in the European Union but which is expected to be completed by the summer .
The nomination â€ “ at this stage â€ “ has taken BP by surprise , but the British oil company still expects to obtain two seats on the board of Rosneft , which is run by chief executive Igor Sechin .
Rosneft will not finalise the Dudley post until June at the earliest , when shareholders approve the final composition of the board at the company 's annual general meeting .
The merger is not without controversy because some Rosneft assets were obtained in unusual circumstances from rival Yukos , whose chief executive , Mikhail Khodorkovsky , languishes in a Siberian jail .
Dudley left Moscow just under five years ago complaining about a "" campaign of harassment "" during a dispute with the other private shareholders of TNK - BP , a group of Russian oligarchs .
Even on Friday BP was unwilling to reveal the secret location where Dudley holed up after leaving Russia before resurfacing in London .
The billionaire Russians led by Mikhail Fridman who have since themselves sold out to Rosneft had accused Dudley of poor performance and favouring BP 's interests â€ “ charges he has always denied .
The TNK - BP chief executive was already having trouble renewing his visa and there were also raids on the offices .
Dudley insisted soon after that he would return to run the business but he was found another job by BP .
He was later appointed group chief executive when Tony Hayward stood down as a consequence of the Deepwater Horizon blowout .
Though very lucrative in financial terms , the half - share in TNK - BP brought a string of disputes with the partners .
Some have warned that the integration with Rosneft could take two years .
Analysts from investment bank Renaissance Capital said in a research note released yesterday : "" We are concerned that Rosneft 's future integration of TNK - BP may be even more challenging â€ “ a concern we think current Rosneft shareholders may share . """
2013-06-17,"American spies based in the UK intercepted the top - secret communications of the then Russian president , Dmitry Medvedev , during his visit to Britain for the G20 summit in London , leaked documents reveal .
The details of the intercept were set out in a briefing prepared by the National Security Agency ( NSA ) , America 's biggest surveillance and eavesdropping organisation , and shared with high - ranking officials from Britain , Australia , Canada and New Zealand .
The document , leaked by the NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden and seen by the Guardian , shows the agency believed it might have discovered "" a change in the way Russian leadership signals have been normally transmitted "" .
The disclosure underlines the importance of the US spy hub at RAF Menwith Hill in Harrogate , North Yorkshire , where hundreds of NSA analysts are based , working alongside liaison officers from GCHQ .
The document was drafted in August 2009 , four months after the visit by Medvedev , who joined other world leaders in London , including the US president , Barack Obama , for the event hosted by the British prime minister , Gordon Brown .
Medvedev arrived in London on Wednesday 1 April and the NSA intercepted communications from his delegation the same day , according to the NSA paper , entitled : "" Russian Leadership Communications in support of President Dmitry Medvedev at the G20 summit in London â€ “ Intercept at Menwith Hill station . ""
The document starts with two pictures of Medvedev smiling for the world 's media alongside Brown and Obama in bilateral discussions before the main summit .
The report says : "" This is an analysis of signal activity in support of President Dmitry Medvedev 's visit to London .
The report details a change in the way Russian leadership signals have been normally transmitted .
The signal activity was found to be emanating from the Russian embassy in London and the communications are believed to be in support of the Russian president .
"" The NSA interception of the Russian leadership at G20 came hours after Obama and Medvedev had met for the first time .
Relations between the two leaders had been smoothed in the runup to the summit with a series of phone calls and letters , with both men wanting to establish a trusting relationship to discuss the ongoing banking crisis and nuclear disarmament .
In the aftermath of their discussions on 1 April , the two men issued a joint communique saying they intended to "" move further along the path of reducing and limiting strategic offensive arms in accordance with the treaty on the non - proliferation of nuclear weapons "" .
A White House official who briefed journalists described the meeting as "" a very successful first meeting focused on real issues "" .
The official said it had been important for the men to be open about the issues on which they agreed and disagreed .
Obama had stressed the need to be candid , the official noted .
While it has been widely known the two countries spy on each other , it is rare for either to be caught in the act ; the latest disclosures will also be deeply embarrassing for the White House as Obama prepares to meet Vladimir Putin , who succeeded Medvedev as president , in the margins of the G8 summit this week .
The two countries have long complained about the extent of each other 's espionage activities , and tit - for - tat expulsions of diplomats are common .
A year after Obama met Medvedev , the US claimed it had broken a highly sophisticated spy ring that carried out "" deep cover "" assignments in the US .
Ten alleged Russian spies living in America were arrested .
Putin was withering of the FBI - led operation : "" I see that your police have let themselves go and put some people in jail , but I guess that is their job .
I hope the positive trend that we have seen develop in our bilateral relations recently will not be harmed by these events . ""
Last month , the Russians arrested an American in Moscow who they alleged was a CIA agent .
The new revelations underline the significance of RAF Menwith Hill and raise questions about its relationship to the British intelligence agencies , and who is responsible for overseeing it .
The 560-acre site was leased to the Americans in 1954 and the NSA has had a large presence there since 1966 .
It has often been described as the biggest surveillance and interception facility in the world , and has 33 distinct white "" radomes "" that house satellite dishes .
A US base in all but name , it has British intelligence analysts seconded to work alongside NSA colleagues , though it is unclear how the two agencies obtain and share intelligence â€ “ and under whose legal authority they are working under ."
2013-09-24,"â€¢ Some world leaders just do n't learn their lesson .
In March 2012 Barack Obama was caught on microphone telling the Russian leader , Dmitry Medvedev , that "" after my election I have more flexibility "" during what the two leaders thought was a private conversation .
On Monday , the US president was caught off guard again , this time while chatting to a UN official .
Not realising that a CNN microphone was in the vicinity , he said he hoped the official had given up smoking .
After the official appeared to ask Obama about his own smoking habits , Obama said he had n't had a cigarette in probably six years .
He added , with a broad grin : "" That 's because I 'm scared of my wife . ""
The exchange was caught on camera and aired on CNN .
He may be even more scared of his wife now .

The former president also said that it would be difficult to Russia to work with people with â€œblack masks and Kalashnikov riflesâ€ � .
The Russian foreign ministry later echoed his comments and accused the west of encouraging neo - Nazi and anti - Semitic extremists .

An arrest warrant for ousted President Viktor Yanukovych has been issued for â€œmass murder of peaceful citizensâ€ � .
Announcing the warrant on Facebook , the countryâ€ ™ s interim minister , Arsen Avakov , said Yanukovych was seen in Balaclava on the Crimean peninsula on Sunday and had left by car for an unknown destination .
â€¢ Ukraine needs $ 35bn of assistance over the next two years , the countryâ€ ™ s interim finance minister said today .
Yuriy Kolobov expressed hope that the US and Europe could help .
An European Commission official told Reuters the EU has had contact with several countries outside Europe on coordinating aid for Ukraine and a possible donorsâ€ ™ conference .
â€¢ The UK foreign secretary , William Hague , said he would visit Ukraine shortly as he warned that the countryâ€ ™ s financial situation â€œwithout outside assistance may not be sustainableâ€ � .
He said he would be travelling to Washington tonight to discuss Ukraine with the US secretary of state , John Kerry , and the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) .
He said the IMF was best placed to provide financial support and advice to Ukraine .
The head of the European security organisation is proposing the establishment of an international contact group to support Ukraine in its difficult transition period , AP reports .
Didier Burkhalter , Switzerlandâ€ ™ s president and the chair of the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe , said the group â€œthrough its impartiality and inclusivity , has the necessary attributes to host and moderateâ€ �
the international contact group .
The 57-member body includes all European Union members as well as Russia and the United States .
Burkhalter told the UN security council that the proposed contact group would coordinate and share information on international assistance and projects in Ukraine .
Burkhalter said violence and instability in Ukraine showed that â€œsecurity in Europe can not be taken for grantedâ€ � .
Ukraineâ€ ™ s parliament has appointed Stepan Kubiv , a member of parliament with experience in banking , as the new chairman of the central bank .
A total of 310 deputies in the 450 seat chamber backed Kubiv after his predecessor , Ihor Sorkin , resigned following the overthrow of President Viktor Yanukovych .
It comes amid several warnings about the precariousness of the countryâ€ ™ s financial situation .
Harriet Salem , reporting for the Guardian in central Kiev , says the mood in Independence Square or Maidan , which was the heart of the protests against Viktor Yanukovych , is much calmer today .
She writes : The mood on the Maidan was relaxed today , with but people continued to flock to pay their respects to the dead , bringing flowers and lighting candles .
There is a cautious optimism but people know there is a long way to go .
Reflecting this the Molotov cocktail making equipment has all been cleared to a safe area and is cordened off under the guard of two members of Euromaidan defence unit guards .
Nataliya Stepanyuk coordinator of Spilna Sprava said that this was just the beginning of the hard work .
â€œWe are not waiting we are working .
We are working to ensure that this interim government does not return to the old ways .
We will continue our pressure to ensure that next elections are free fair and transparent , not just presidential elections but also parliamentaryâ€
� she said .
Stepanyuk also said that Spilna Spravaâ€ ™ s leader Danilyuk , who fled to London after being placed on the Interior Ministryâ€ ™ s wanted list , will be returning to Kyiv shortly , but that the details of his return are secret .
â€œHe was only removed from that list today , so it is only today safe for him to returnâ€
� she said .
In response to a question from shadow foreign secretary Douglas Alexander , William Hague says any money provided to Ukraine must be accompanied by reform .
He says the EU - Ukraine association agreement is still on the table but the priority is to achieve an end to violence and free elections .
William Hague said he will travel to Washington tonight to speak to the US secretary of state , John Kerry , and the IMF about the situation in Ukraine UK foreign secretary Hague says Ukraine will struggle to cope financially without outside intervention .
He says it is not about a choice between the EU and Russia , it is about democratic accountability .
With that he moves onto Syria .
The UK foreign secretary , William Hague , is giving a statement in the House of Commons .
He sends condolences to the families of those who died or were injured in Ukraine .
He states that it is clear that Yanukovychâ€ ™ s â€œauthority is no longer acceptedâ€ � Ukraine has a pressing need for political reform and an end to corruption , says Hague .
He calls for â€œreconciliationâ€ � but also for â€œaccountabilityâ€ � for those responsible for human rights violations .
The Polish foreign minister , Radoslaw Sikorski , and a European Commission spokesman have both been speaking about the prospects for the EU - Ukraine association agreement .
It was Yanukovychâ€ ™ s refusal in November to sign the political and trade pact bringing Ukraine closer to the west that triggered protests .
Sikorski , in Budapest at a meeting of the foreign ministers of the Visegrad Group ( V4 ) uniting four Central European States - Czech Republic , Hungary , Poland and Slovakia - on Monday , said : After setting Yulia Tymoshenko free Ukraine has fulfilled all the terms of signing the Association Agreement .
The treaty waits for signing and , as soon as Ukraine forms a stable government , it can be signed .
Olivier Bailly , a spokesman for the EUâ€ ™ s executive arm , said : We are ready to sign this agreement once Ukraine is ready .
But he added that prior to signing â€œour idea is that we must let a transition process go to its final pointâ€ � of elections set for 25 May.
Russia Today has some more details of the statement by the Russian foreign ministry .
It quotes the ministry as saying neo - Nazi and anti - semitic extremists in Ukraine are being encouraged , pointing the finger at western countries motivated by â€œgeopolitical self - interestâ€ � .
The ministry is quoted as saying : The position of some of our Western partners doesnâ€ ™ t show genuine concern , but a desire to act out of geopolitical self - interest .
There is no condemnation of criminal actions by extremists , including manifestations or neo - Nazism and anti - Semitism .
In fact , these are being encouraged ...
We urge those embroiled in the crisis in Ukraine to show responsibility , and to prevent further deterioration of the situation , to return to the rule of law , and to stop the extremists in their bid for power .
The Russian foreign ministry has joined prime minister Dmitry Medvedev in criticising the westâ€ ™ s interference in Ukraine and casting doubt on the legitimacy of the new Ukrainian regime .
From Reuters : Russia said on Monday that a western - backed peace deal in Ukraine is being used a cover for a power grab and interim authorities were using â€œterrorist methodsâ€ � to put pressure on dissenters in regions , including Crimea and eastern Ukraine .
The foreign ministry criticised western support for a snap presidential election in May following Viktor Yanukovychâ€ ™ s ouster and said constitutional reforms rushed through parliament should instead be widely debated and put to a national referendum .

Sikorski , one of the European Unionâ€ ™ s mediators in the Ukraine crisis , told a news conference in Budapest : As you know in Ukraine we have a long record of agreements that have not been honoured .
There is a huge amount of macroeconomic assistance available for Ukraine as soon as Ukraine concludes an agreement with the IMF .
The one positive that Ukraine may take from the comments by Russian prime minister Dmitry Medvedev is that he said that any legally - binding Russian - Ukranian agreements â€œmust be honouredâ€
� :
Those agreements which are legally binding must be honored .
We are not cooperating with personalities or isolated individuals .
These are inter - state relations .
We are neighbors , close nations , and we can not run away from one another .
Whatever has been signed must be honored .
For us , Ukraine remains a serious and important partner .
There are fears about the future of a gas deal agreed in December under which Russia reduced the gas price for Kiev to $ 268.50 per 1,000 cubic metres , from the $ 400 which Ukraine had paid since 2009 .
However , his other comments were less encouraging for the Ukranian authorities .
He said : If people crossing Kyiv in black masks and Kalashnikov rifles are considered a government , it will be difficult for us to work with such a government .
He added :
Some of our foreign , Western partners think otherwise , considering them to be legitimate authorities , I do not know which constitution , which laws they were reading , but it seems to me it is an aberration of perception when something that is essentially the result of a mutiny is called legitimate .

Ukraineâ€ ™ s
acting energy minister Eduard Stavytsky has told Reuters he is hoping the overthrow of Viktor Yanukovych will not lead to an increase in the price of gas supplied by Russia .
Russia agreed in December to reduce the gas price for Kiev to $ 268.50 per 1,000 cubic metres , a cut of about one third from around $ 400 which Ukraine had paid since 2009 .
The reduction was part of a wider financial deal Moscow signed with Kiev after Ukraine spurned an EU trade deal .
â€œWe hope that the price ( of Russian gas ) will be stable ,
â€ �
Stavytsky told Reuters by telephone .
Ukraine consumes about 55bn cubic meters of gas each year , and more than half of this amount is imported from Russia .
Gazprom exported 161.5 billion cubic metres of gas to Europe last year .
The last dispute over gas pricing between Russia and Ukraine caused shortages in Europe over the winter of 2009 .
Two Gazprom sources told Reuters the company had no immediate plans of returning to the previous gas price for Kiev , which is seeking around $ 35 billion in foreign assistance over the next two years .
â€œBut this is not Gazprom to decide , â€ � one of the sources said .

2014-02-25,"Moscow delivered a damning indictment of post - revolutionary Ukraine on Monday , denouncing alleged discrimination of the ethnic Russian minority , accusing the west of sponsoring a takeover of the country by "" terrorists "" and "" extremists "" , and clashing with Washington over plans for early elections in May.
"" Russia is extremely concerned about the situation in Ukraine , "" said a foreign ministry statement , which followed the highest - level reaction from Moscow so far to the collapse of Viktor Yanukovych 's presidency .
Dmitry Medvedev , the prime minister and former president , accused the post - Yanukovych authorities and parliament of lacking legitimacy .
"" If you consider Kalashnikov - toting people in black masks who are roaming Kiev to be the government , then it will be hard for us to work with that government , "" Medvedev said .
"" Some of our foreign , western partners think otherwise , considering them to be legitimate authorities .
I do not know which constitution , which laws they were reading , but it seems to me it is an aberration
â€ ¦ Something that is essentially the result of a mutiny is called legitimate . ""
The blistering language from Moscow , the first real response to the crisis from Ukraine 's neighbour and former overlord , collided with western attempts to keep the Russians onside for the looming challenge of establishing a stable , inclusive government and coming up with a multibillion - dollar rescue to try to stabilise an economy in freefall .
The new interim leaders of Ukraine said the country needed $ 35bn ( Â£21bn ) over the next two years and fast action on a bailout , as Moscow signalled its was freezing its $ 15bn in cheap loans â€ “ the package offered in November when Yanukovych triggered the uprising by turning to Russia and away from the European Union .
The Russian foreign ministry statement pressed all the buttons that will have the west and Kiev alarmed about ethnic and religious strife fracturing the country in two .
It complained that ethnic Russian rights were already being violated after the parliament rescinded the status of Russian as a second language . ""
Referring merely to revolutionary expediency , [ the parliament ] is imposing decisions and laws aimed at repressing the human rights of Russian and other national minorities .
There are even calls for a complete ban of the Russian language , "" it said .
Moscow opposed plans for early elections in May , calling first for constitutional changes and a referendum .
This contrasted with the stance of the US state department , which announced that William Burns , the senior diplomat credited with engineering a recent breakthrough in US relations with Iran , would travel to Kiev .
It said Burns would "" urge the new government to take all steps necessary for free and fair presidential elections in May.
He will urge the rapid formation of a national unity government . ""
The collapse of the Yanukovych administration late on Friday is a setback to Vladimir Putin in Moscow , while Europe and the west are seen as the international beneficiaries .
But with the Ukrainian economy on the brink of insolvency , the west is now under pressure to deliver tens of billions in aid .
It was clear that the west would insist on a programme under the International Monetary Fund , which would come with very tight strings attached .
But it appeared that the EU , US and other international actors would go beyond an IMF package with bilateral financial support .
Berlin spoke of organising an international donors ' conference to raise funds from Japan and China , while stressing that it wanted Russia as part of the funding team .
The Obama administration has indicated it regards Ukraine as being under new management .
Jay Carney , the main White House spokesman , said that although Yanukovych was elected his actions had cost him his legitimacy and he was "" not actively leading the country at present "" .
The US said Burns would "" be accompanied by representatives of the Department of the Treasury and the National Economic Council , who will work in concert with partners such as the EU and the IMF to discuss needed financial support while a new government implements the difficult steps necessary to reform the economy "" .
The US treasury secretary , Jacob Lew , told Arseniy Yatsenyuk , tipped as Ukraine 's next prime minister , that the US , "" together with Europe and others in the international community , are ready to supplement an IMF programme to cushion the impact of reforms , "" according to a treasury statement .
The British foreign secretary , William Hague , said he would visit Ukraine shortly , and said the country needed urgent international financial help .
Hague is due to travel to Washington later on Monday to discuss Ukraine with the US secretary of state , John Kerry , and the IMF .
He said the IMF was best placed to provide financial support and advice to Ukraine . ""
Ukraine 's financial situation is very serious and without outside assistance may not be sustainable , "" Hague told parliament .
The Russians bitterly criticised everything that had happened in Ukraine since Friday , arguing that the events were at odds with the settlement terms agreed by Yanukovych and opposition leaders in 24 hours of tough negotiations mediated by three EU foreign ministers last Thursday and Friday .
The full Russian support for this agreement appeared odd since Moscow was also involved in the negotiations in the person of Vladimir Lukin , a former Russian ambassador to Washington , who left the talks hours early , and Russia was the only party present that refused to sign the settlement .
Lukin abandoned the talks , describing the street protesters as "" nationalists "" , "" revolutionaries "" and "" terrorists "" .
The Russian statement on Monday said events in Ukraine since the weekend "" discredit the initiators and their guarantors [ EU ] , threaten civic peace , social stability and public safety .
We are bound to note that several of our western partners show no concern for the fate of Ukraine , but for one - sided geopolitical calculations .
There is no sign of real assessment of the criminal acts of extremists , including neo - Nazis and antisemites . """
2014-03-02,"Ukraine has put its armed forces on full alert and warned Russia that military intervention will lead to war shortly after Vladimir Putin gave the green light for an invasion as the upper house of the Russian parliament unanimously approved his request to send troops into the neighbouring state .
After a three - hour meeting with security and defence chiefs on Saturday , prime minister Arseny Yatseniuk said he had called for talks and urged Russia to return its soldiers to base in the Crimea region during a phone call with his counterpart Dmitry Medvedev . ""
Military intervention would be the beginning of war and the end of any relations between Ukraine and Russia , "" Yatseniuk said .
Ukraine 's acting president , Oleksandr Turchynov , said he had put the armed forces on full readiness because of the threat of "" potential aggression "" as 15,000 Russian troops were said to have joined those who have effectively seized Crimea .
Speaking live on TV , Turchynov said he had also ordered stepped - up security at nuclear power plants , airports and other strategic infrastructure .
Putin told the US president , Barack Obama , during a 90-minute call on Saturday night that Russia had the right to protect its interests and those of Russian speakers not only in Crimea but also in east Ukraine .
Obama called on Russian forces to pull troops back to base in Crimea and not interfere elsewhere .
He also warned Putin that Russia faced greater political and economic isolation .
The White House said in a statement : "" President Obama expressed his deep concern over Russia 's clear violation of Ukrainian sovereignty and territorial integrity , which is a breach of international law . ""
The US defence secretary , Chuck Hagel , told his Russian counterpart on Saturday that Moscow 's military intervention risked creating further instability and an escalation "" that would threaten European and international security , "" the Pentagon said .
Nato secretary general Anders Fogh Rasmussen said he would hold a meeting on Sunday to discuss the crisis after Ukraine asked it , the US and EU "" to look at all possible mechanisms for protecting its territorial integrity "" .
Tensions escalated into the night when two Russian anti - submarine warships appeared off Crimea 's coast , violating an agreement on Moscow 's lease of a naval base , a Ukrainian military source was quoted as saying .
The two vessels , part of Russia 's Baltic Fleet , had been sighted in a bay at Sevastopol , where Moscow 's Black Sea Fleet has a base .
Obama 's national security team met to discuss policy options , according to a senior administration official , while David Cameron said : "" There can be no excuse for outside military intervention in Ukraine â€ “ a point I made to President Putin when we spoke [ on Friday ] .
Everyone must think carefully about their actions and work to lower , not escalate , tensions .
The world is watching . ""
Foreign secretary William Hague said he was "" deeply concerned "" at the Russian parliament 's decision to use troops in Ukraine .
He said : "" This action is a potentially grave threat to the sovereignty , independence and territorial integrity of Ukraine . ""
After several days of Russian stealth , the move to deploy forces came suddenly and decisively .
The Kremlin said Putin wanted troops in Ukraine "" until the sociopolitical situation is normalised "" .
Less than an hour later , in a hastily convened extraordinary sitting of Russia 's Federation Council that was laced with cold war rhetoric , senators voted unanimously to support Putin 's proposal , and proposed withdrawing Russia 's ambassador to the US in protest at an "" insult to the Russian people "" from Obama .
Earlier in Kiev , Turchynov , who has been in power since president Viktor Yanukovych fled a week ago , convened a special session of the cabinet , and spoke by telephone with the US secretary of state , John Kerry .
Former world heavyweight boxing champion Vitali Klitschko , a leading candidate in presidential elections set for 25 May , had called for parliament to convene and order a full mobilisation of the army .
The United Nations security council was due to hold an emergency session to discuss Ukraine on Saturday night .
In London , William Hague said that Russia 's ambassador to Britain had been summoned to the Foreign Office .
The Russian decree does not limit the use of troops to Crimea , specifying only that the Russian military could be deployed "" on Ukrainian territory "" , and the big question is how far the Kremlin wants to go .
So far , Putin 's statement only talks about "" protecting the interests of Russian citizens and compatriots "" , but there are fears that Moscow is planning a full - scale annexation of Crimea , with its majority ethnic Russian population .
Putin 's press secretary , Dmitry Peskov , said that no decision to implement the decree had yet been taken .
Ominously , there were also clashes in the major eastern Ukrainian cities of Kharkiv and Donetsk on Saturday , with the deputy mayor of Kharkiv saying that 97 people had been injured in violence between supporters of the new government in Kiev and pro - Russian demonstrators .
Putin 's move comes after two days during which the Kremlin 's motives were unclear .
Armed men seized the Crimean parliament on Thursday and the peninsula 's airports on Friday , but claimed to be members of locally organised "" self - defence squads "" .
Ukraine had already accused Russia of a "" military invasion and occupation "" of Crimea .
Michael McFaul , until last week the US ambassador to Russia , castigated the Kremlin : "" Russian companies and banks with business in the west will suffer as a result of reckless Putin decision .
Will they speak up ?
"" he tweeted .
But the parliamentary session roundly dismissed western criticism in advance .
Senator Nikolai Ryzhkov said Russia should be prepared for the west to "" unleash their dogs on us "" .
"" They ruined Yugoslavia , Egypt , Libya , Iraq , all in the name of western democracy .
It 's not even double standards , it 's political cynicism . ""
Late on Friday night , Obama told Russia there would be "" costs "" for intervention in Ukraine .
A senator in the Federation Council said it "" crossed a red line "" and "" insulted the Russian people "" .
The parliamentary body said it would ask Putin for the Russian ambassador to the US to be withdrawn .
However , actual signs of violence have been limited .
The Russian foreign ministry claimed on Saturday that armed men "" from Kiev "" had tried to seize the government building in the Crimean capital , Simferopol , but had been repulsed by self - defence units , who took casualties .
On the ground , nobody could offer any evidence of such an attack .
Yanukovych , who gave a press conference in the southern Russian city of Rostov on Friday at which he claimed he was still the legitimate president , has called the new government Nazis .
His role is now unclear , but the Federation Council said he had approved the use of Russian troops .
He fled after signing a compromise agreement with opposition leaders , in the presence of three EU foreign ministers .
Russia has blasted the EU for failing to keep the opposition to its side of the bargain .
Yanukovych 's flight from Kiev was the culmination of three months of protest , ending with 82 people being killed in clashes with riot police .
Ukraine 's new government has disbanded the Berkut riot police involved in clashes with protesters , while Russia has announced it will give them Russian passports .
The first of them collected passports at a Russian consulate in Crimea on Saturday .
In Crimea on Saturday , there were more pro - Russia rallies , and the region already appeared under the control of Russian troops and pro - Russian militias , who were patrolling the airports , parliaments and roads in and out of the region ."
2014-03-31,"Russia flaunted its grip on Crimea on Monday , with the prime minister , Dmitry Medvedev , flying in to the newly annexed territory for a cabinet meeting , cementing the sense of resignation in Kiev and the west that the seizure of the territory is irreversible .
At the same time , Russian forces appeared to be pulling back from the border with eastern Ukraine .
Russia 's president , Vladimir Putin , said in a phone conversation with the German chancellor , Angela Merkel , that he had ordered a "" partial withdrawal "" from the border , according to Berlin .
The developments came after a four - hour meeting on Sunday between the Russian foreign minister , Sergei Lavrov , and the US secretary of state , John Kerry , in which both sides put their visions for resolving the Ukraine crisis on the table .
After the meeting in Pairs , Lavrov said Ukraine should introduce federalisation of power . ""
Both sides had very concrete positions , and it was perhaps the first time over the past few months that things were called by their real names , "" said a source in the Russian delegation , who did not elaborate further on whether this left the sides closer or further away from an agreement .
Kerry said after the meeting that any decisions on federalisation ought to be made by Ukrainian authorities , and the Ukrainian foreign ministry released a vicious riposte to the Kremlin , telling it to keep its nose out of Ukrainian affairs : "" Do not attempt to teach others .
Better bring order to your own country .
You have plenty of problems , "" read the statement .
Ukraine 's acting president , Oleksandr Turchynov , said on Monday that he saw no reason for the country to introduce a federal system .
On Monday , Kiev also sent a protest note to Moscow over the prime ministerial visit to Crimea , calling it a "" crude violation "" of international norms .
But Medvedev 's rhetoric during the televised meeting , when he promised to create a special economic zone in Crimea , raise pensions and wages and improve infrastructure , was calibrated to send a firm message that Russia has no plans to give the territory back to Ukraine .
The hawkish deputy prime minister Dmitry Rogozin , who has been targeted by US sanctions , was one of those to accompany Medvedev on the trip .
He posted a photograph of himself , with the sea in the background , on his Twitter account with the caption : "" Crimea is ours .
Basta . ""
"" The government will take steps to make Crimean holidays more affordable and more attractive , "" wrote Medvedev on his Facebook page .
"" I am certain that many people will again discover the clean sea , unique nature and hospitality of Crimeans . ""
The peninsula 's main source of revenue comes from tourism , and Russia has promised to make up for the absence of Ukrainian and other non - Russian tourists this summer by sending workers from state enterprises on package trips to Crimea .
With Crimea firmly in Moscow 's grip , attention has turned to the Russian - speaking eastern regions of Ukraine , which have become the subject of a tough negotiating game from Moscow .
In Russian - speaking cities such as Donetsk and Kharkov , there is less support for union with Russia than in Crimea , but repeated rallies have called for holding referendums either on joining Russia or on increased autonomy .
The government in Kiev has accused Moscow of deliberately stirring up tensions in the region , while the Russian foreign ministry has released a series of statements complaining that the rights of Russian speakers are under threat and making thinly veiled threats of military intervention .
Military analysts estimate that the Russians have amassed up to 40,000 troops close to Ukraine 's eastern border in recent days , though a number of reports on Monday suggested that many of the troops had begun a withdrawal .
The Russian defence ministry said on Monday that a motorised defence infantry battalion stationed near the Ukrainian border for "" training "" for a month had begun the journey back to its base .
Tensions remain high in the runup to presidential elections in Ukraine scheduled for 25 May.
Ukrainian intelligence claimed on Monday it had detained a Russian activist planning armed raids on government buildings in Kiev in an attempt to destabilise the situation in advance of elections .
Petro Poroshenko , a confectionary billionaire , is the favourite to win the vote , and was boosted over the weekend when former heavyweight boxer Vitali Klitschko withdrew from the race and gave his backing to Poroshenko .
His only serious challenger is now the former prime minister Yulia Tymoshenko .
Moscow has refused to recognise the interim government that took over in Kiev after President Viktor Yanukovych fled , and has previously called the May vote illegitimate .
But on Monday softened its tone , with deputy foreign minister , Grigory Karasin , saying the vote should be fair and transparent .
A number of Russian analysts have suggested that Moscow could agree to recognise the new Ukrainian government if its demands about federalisation were met and its annexation of Crimea recognised .
Germany 's finance minister , Wolfgang SchÃ¤uble , said on Monday that Russia 's moves against Ukraine were reminiscent of Nazi aggression in Czechoslovakia before the second world war .
"" We know all about that from history , "" he told a group of students , Der Spiegel reported on its website .
"" Those are the methods that Hitler used to take over the Sudetenland . ""
SchÃ¤uble said there were considerable fears about Russia in the Baltic nations as well as in Poland and Hungary .
"" They 're all crapping in their pants , "" he said ."
2014-03-31,"Russia 's prime minister , Dmitry Medvedev , has flown into Crimea to hold a cabinet meeting in the newly annexed territory .
The meeting comes a day after four - hour negotiations between the Russian and US foreign ministers in Paris , aimed at resolving the Ukraine crisis .
The majority of western politicians believe that Crimea is as good as lost , and attention has turned to the rest of Ukraine , where a huge Russian troop buildup has been reported on the border in recent days .
After the talks , Russia repeated its demand that the US and its European partners accept its proposal that Russian - speaking regions of eastern and southern Ukraine be given extensive autonomous powers independent of Kiev as a condition for agreeing a diplomatic solution to the crisis .
Sergei Lavrov , Russia 's foreign minister , told reporters Ukraine could not function as a "" unified state "" and should become a loose federation .
He made the remarks after an inconclusive meeting with John Kerry , the US secretary of state , at the Russian ambassador 's residence in Paris following a day in which tensions over Ukraine deepened appreciably .
Lavrov called the talks "" very , very constructive "" .
Kerry told reporters the US and Russia agreed on the need for a diplomatic solution but made clear there had been no breakthrough , saying the Russian troop buildup along the border was creating a climate of fear and intimidation in Ukraine and was not helpful . ""
Both sides had very concrete positions , and it was perhaps the first time over the past few months that things were called by their real names , "" said a source in the Russian delegation , who did not elaborate further on whether this left the sides closer or further away from an agreement .
Kerry called for Russia to pull back its forces and said talks on the country 's future must include Kiev 's leaders .
"" We will not accept a path forward where the legitimate government of Ukraine is not at the table .
This principle is clear .
No decisions about Ukraine without Ukraine , "" he said .
Despite the distance between the two sides , Kerry said Washington would "" consider the ideas and the suggestions that we developed tonight "" .
The meeting took place against an ominous backdrop of the gathering of an estimated 40,000 Russian troops on Ukraine 's eastern border , and warnings from Nato and the Pentagon that the Russian military activity , ostensibly relating to routine exercises , was abnormal and could be a prelude to an invasion .
General Philip Breedlove , Nato supreme allied commander Europe and the head of the US military 's European command , was ordered back to his post in Brussels during a visit to Washington after Chuck Hagel , the US defence secretary , pointed to "" a lack of transparency "" from Russia about the troop movements .
Unlike Moscow , Washington has said it will not resort to force to resolve the crisis .
However , on Monday morning , Ukrainian media quoting military sources said Russia had already started reducing the strength of its forces lining the border from 40,000 to about 10,000 The US has called on Russia to disarm irregular forces in Crimea , admit international observers and pull back its troops from the eastern border .
But speaking to Russian state television before the talks , Lavrov laid out Moscow 's quite different terms .
Primarily , he said , Russia was seeking a federal solution for Ukraine as part of "" deep constitutional reform "" . ""
Frankly speaking , we do n't see any other way for the steady development of the Ukrainian state apart from as a federation , "" he added .
Under the Russian plan , which Barack Obama and Vladimir Putin reportedly discussed in a phone call initiated by Moscow on Friday , each region would have control of its economy , taxes , culture , language , education and "" external economic and cultural connections with neighbouring countries or regions "" , Lavrov said .
"" Given the proportion of native Russians [ in Ukraine ] , we propose this and we are sure there is no other way . ""
The Russian proposal to radically alter the way Ukraine is governed and administered is certain to arouse strong opposition in Kiev , where it will be viewed by critics of Moscow 's intervention in Crimea as a roundabout way of breaking up or partitioning the country .
The Ukrainian foreign ministry released a furious statement on Sunday accusing Russia of laying down unacceptable conditions to a neighbouring country .
"" We would like to propose to the Russian side that before issuing ultimatums to a sovereign and independent state , it turn its attention to the disastrous conditions and complete powerlessness of its own national minorities , including the Ukrainian one , "" read the statement .
"" Do not attempt to teach others .
Better bring order to your own country .
You have plenty of problems . ""
In an apparent attempt to assuage concerns in Kiev and western capitals about Russian intentions , Lavrov said there were no plans to invade eastern Ukraine .
Latest US intelligence estimates based on satellite data indicate that Russia 's troops on the Ukrainian border include a wide range of special units , elite forces and equipment .
"" We have absolutely no intention of , or interest in , crossing Ukraine 's borders , "" Lavrov said .
"" We [ Russia and the west ] are getting closer in our positions . ""
He said Moscow 's terms for defusing the crisis , the worst between the west and Russia since the end of the cold war , also included a pledge by Kiev 's government that Ukraine would not seek to join Nato .
The eastward expansion of Nato since the collapse of the Soviet Union was one of the main grievances Putin expressed in a speech in Moscow this month when Crimea joined the Russian Federation .
Lavrov said Russia remained determined to protect the rights of Russian speakers in eastern and southern Ukraine and implied that it reserved the right to take appropriate action if its proposals for a federation and other settlement terms were not accepted .
Apparently seeking to exploit western unease about long - standing policy aims beyond Ukraine , Putin reportedly told Obama that Moscow also wanted guarantees about the future of the Russian - backed separatist territory of Transnistria in Moldova , on Ukraine 's south - west border .
Putin told Obama the fate of the breakaway region should be solved not by force but by talks in the 5 + 2 format of Moldova , Transnistria , the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe , Russia and Ukraine , with the EU and US as observers .
The Kremlin said Putin had suggested "" examining possible steps the global community can take to help stabilise the situation "" in the region .
It was unclear what response the US and its EU partners would make to the Russian demands .
The Obama administration has insisted Russia withdraw its forces from Crimea , reduce its military buildup on the eastern border , respect the territorial integrity of Ukraine and support national polls due in May to elect a new president and government .
The US and EU imposed limited sanctions on Russia following the annexation of Crimea .
Lavrov said the measures had had little impact .
Lavrov made no mention of the Ukraine elections or any possible withdrawal from Crimea .
Many analysts now predict that in any deal , the US and its western allies , and thus Kiev , will be forced to accept the annexation as a fait accompli ."
2014-08-07,"Russians will no longer be able to buy fruit , vegetables , meat , fish or dairy products from the EU and the US , as the full scope of Moscow 's food import ban became apparent on Thursday .
President Vladimir Putin told officials on Wednesday to come up with a list of western agricultural products and raw materials to be banned , in reaction to western sanctions over Russia 's policies in Ukraine .
Russia 's prime minister , Dmitry Medvedev , said the ban was effective immediately and would last for a year .
It covers most foodstuffs from the US , the 28 EU countries , Canada , Australia and Norway . ""
Until the last moment , we hoped that our foreign colleagues would realise that sanctions lead to a blind alley , and that no one benefits from them .
But they did n't realise this , and now we have been forced to respond , "" Medvedev said .
The EU and US have sanctioned a number of Russians , including billionaires believed to be close to Putin and those actively involved in the annexing Crimea and the unrest in eastern Ukraine .
After the downing of Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 , which pro - Russia rebels are believed to have shot down , a number of key Russian banks were also sanctioned , cutting them off from European capital markets .
The key question is whether the import ban would hurt European producers more than Russian consumers .
The Kremlin 's English - language channel , Russia Today , said the food ban could spark a "" crisis in Europe "" and would cost billions of pounds in lost revenues .
There was less musing on the cost to ordinary Russians , who have become used to readily available imported foods .
"" I am sure that our market will be filled with fresh quality Russian products , which anyway many Russians prefer to the imported ones , "" said Medvedev .
The agriculture minister , Nikolai Fyodorov , said more Brazilian meat and New Zealand cheese would be imported to offset the newly prohibited items .
He also said Moscow was in talks with Belarus and Kazakhstan to prevent the banned western foodstuffs being exported to Russia from the two countries .
Medvedev said Russia was prepared to introduce further measures in aviation , shipbuilding and automobile sectors , but said it would do so carefully .
Moscow has already floated the idea of banning European airlines from flying over Russian airspace , which could add several hours to some flights between Europe and Asia .
Russia is Europe 's second - largest market for food and drink .
Exports of food and raw materials to Russia were worth â‚¬12.2bn ( Â£9.7bn ) in 2013 , following several years of double - digit growth .
The UK is less likely to lose out .
In 2013 , its biggest food and drink export was Â£17 m of frozen fish , followed by Â£5.7 m of cheese and Â£5.3 m of coffee .
The president of the European Central bank , Mario Draghi , said on Thursday that the Ukraine crisis was contributing to heightened geopolitical risks that are threatening the eurozone 's faltering recovery .
"" Some of them , like the situation in Ukraine and Russia will have a greater impact on the euro area than they â€ ¦ have on other parts of the world , "" he said .
The world 's second - largest bottler of Coca - Cola drinks has become the latest company to be hit by the escalating standoff between Russia and the west , along with the sportswear maker Adidas .
Coca - Cola HBC , which bottles and distributes the US company 's drinks in 28 countries , said volumes would fall for the rest of the year , citing a sudden deterioration in Russia , its biggest market .
Financial markets were quick to react to Putin 's tit - for - tat move .
Moscow 's main two share indices extended Wednesday 's sharp declines , with retail and banking shares among the biggest fallers .
The RTS index lost 1.9 % , and the rouble - denominated Micex fell 1.5 % .
European indices were also weaker .
Food has already been caught up in political tensions between Russia and the west .
Moscow 's food safety authorities have recently banned the import of Polish fruit and vegetables , and a regional branch of the consumer protection agency Rospotrebnadzor is investigating McDonald 's cheeseburgers and milkshakes .
European pork was banned at the start of the year as the Ukraine crisis escalated , cutting off 25 % of all EU pig meat exports in a move that the European commission said exposed farmers to significant losses .
The EU and US stepped up punitive action against Russia last week in response to Moscow 's support for eastern separatists in Ukraine , which has been unwavering despite the downing of MH17 .
A Dutch rescue team had to abandon its work at the crash site on Thursday , judging that the frontline of fighting between Ukrainian forces and Russia - backed rebels was too close .
Ukrainian forces have made gains in the east in recent weeks , but at the expense of civilian casualties .
The rebels are now mainly holed up in the regional centres of Donetsk and Luhansk , leaving Kiev with a dilemma of how to win back the strongholds without enormous civilian loss of life .
Russia is carrying out military exercises near the border with Ukraine this week , and there are fears that the option of a ground invasion is still on the table .
Nato said earlier this week that Moscow had amassed around 20,000 troops near the border and could be planning an invasion under the guise of a humanitarian intervention .
In Kiev , there were clashes on Thursday morning as authorities attempted to clear Independence Square , known as the Maidan , of tents and protesters .
The square was the centre of the protests against President Viktor Yanukovych 's rule , and a small hardcore of protesters have refused to move on and have remained living in the square since Yanukovych was deposed in February .
The square was cleared by armed members of volunteer battalions which had returned from fighting the pro - Russia separatists in the east , themselves made up of former Maidan activists .
The violent clashes suggest tough times ahead for Ukraine , where President Petro Poroshenko will have to deal with the presence of many armed volunteer groups when the crisis in the east is over ."

2014-08-14,"The Russian prime minister Dmitry Medvedev 's well - known love for technology led to embarrassment on Thursday as hackers reportedly accessed his Twitter account and unleashed a barrage of hoax tweets .
"" I 'm resigning .
I 'm ashamed by the actions of the government .
Forgive me , "" read one message from Medvedev 's account that was retweeted thousands of times before it was removed .
The tweets also purported to reveal that the prime minister planned to become a freelance photographer ( Medvedev is a keen amateur ) , as well as what he really thinks of Vladimir Putin , for whom he kept the presidential seat warm from 2008 to 2012 : "" I 've wanted to say this for a long time .
Vova , you 're wrong ! ""
Another tweet read : "" # CrimeaIsNotOurs please retweet , "" playing on the Russian - language hashtag # CrimeaIsOurs that became popular after Moscow annexed the Ukrainian peninsula .
Medvedev and Putin are currently on an official visit to Crimea .
The government 's press service said on Thursday that Medvedev 's account had been hacked and that the account 's security had since been strengthened .
"" It 's obvious that this was a hooligan hacker prank , "" the presidential spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on the radio station Ekho Moskvy .
"" It shows once again the need to constantly observe the necessary level of security . ""
A group called Shaltay Boltay ( "" Humpty Dumpty "" in Russian ) appeared to claim credit , tweeting a screenshot of Medvedev 's resignation tweet with the caption : "" Ahha , well you understood ; ) "" .
Last month , Shaltay Boltay published leaked emails that it said came from the account of the deputy prime minister and former Medvedev aide Arkady Dvorkovich , after which Russia 's communications watchdog blocked its blog and Twitter account .
The group also claimed to have "" several emails including a Gmail and the contents of three iPhones of a certain prime minister "" , and tweeted photographs of a government meeting from the vantage point of where Medvedev would have chaired it .
In a subsequent blogpost , it published emails from several accounts that it said belonged to Medvedev , including receipts for technology purchases and a picture of him in a peasant shirt .
While Putin is a proud luddite , saying he does n't own a mobile phone and rarely goes on the internet , Medvedev is famous for embracing social media and gadgets .
He first joined Twitter on a visit to the company 's headquarters in Silicon Valley in 2010 .
In 2013 , Medvedev 's page on the Russian social network VKontakte was broken into and songs full of obscenities were posted to it .
In the wake of the Dvorkovich emails leak , the Russian parliament has been discussing legislation to make sending official information through non - governmental email services a crime .
Anton Nosik , a blogger and web entrepreneur , said it would not have been difficult for someone to steal the password to Medvedev 's account , since it was likely that several staffers had access to it and did not use additional security measures linked to one person 's phone number .
He said Shaltay Boltay could be claiming credit for publicity purposes .
While the group may have obtained data from Medvedev 's email accounts and iPhones , Nosik said some other phishing operation probably hacked the Twitter account , since the jokes seemed spontaneous and the damage was easy to reverse .
"" They illegally access info and share it .
What they never do is deface something , "" Nosik said , comparing the group to whistleblowers like Julian Assange .
"" They have access to many accounts .
If they were into impersonation , they could have impersonated the entire government .
They have usernames and passwords and access to the emails to which those accounts are registered .
"" Nosik was sceptical of attempts to improve security by forcing officials to use a government email system .
"" Once you are using servers that are not compatible with the rest of world and maintained by federal agencies , you are offering an unidentified number of our homegrown spies a chance to spy on you , "" he said .
"" I believe [ officials are ] more afraid of their rivals within than they 're afraid of the NSA and so forth . """
2014-10-15,"Russian prime minister Dmitry Medvedev has warned Tony Abbott that politicians need to â€œchoose their wordsâ€ � carefully following the Australian prime ministerâ€ ™ s promise to â€œshirtfrontâ€ � Vladimir Putin .
In a comment very similar to Russian embassy officials , Medvedev raised the Russian presidentâ€ ™ s sporting prowess , though not specifically his black belt qualification in judo .
â€œIf he likes to use sports terms , let him go aheadâ€ � , Medvedev told CNBC .
â€œMr
Putin is quite adept at sports and they could have forceful debates .
That said , serious politicians should choose their words.â€
�
The comments come as Abbottâ€ ™ s comments continued to run on news sites and social media .
On Monday , the prime minister threatened to â€œshirtfrontâ€ �
Putin over the downing of the MH17 plane when the two men attend the G20 summit in Brisbane next month .
Abbott has since recast his language , saying he intended to have â€œvery robustâ€ � conversation with Putin .
In Canberra , Russian embassy official , Alexander Odoevskiy welcomed Abbottâ€ ™ s change of tone to language more appropriate for diplomatic conversations .
He also said the embassy had received emails and phone calls apologising for Abbottâ€ ™ s remarks .
Odoevskiy questioned the view put by opposition leader Queensland premier Campbell Newman , opposition leader Bill Shorten and various media outlets that ordinary Australians did not want Putin to visit Australia .
â€œI doubt that it is the general Australian view that Putin is not welcome , â€ � Odoevskiy said .
â€œWe hear a lot from Campbell Newman and Bill Shorten and the leadership that Putin is unwelcome but from the messages and conversations with ordinary Australians , that view is not shared by the general public.â€ �"
2015-01-09,"Transgender people have been banned from driving in Russia , according to a new legal amendment published this week .
The regulations , which affect people deemed to have â€œsexual disordersâ€ � , also affect fetishists , voyeurs , exhibitionists and transvestites , and were immediately condemned by human rights activists as discriminatory .
The amendment to the law listing medical impediments to driving was signed by prime minister Dmitry Medvedev at the end of last year , but only published this week .
Russia has some of the worst figures for road accident fatalities in the world , and the new regulations are part of a government programme aimed at reducing the number of people who die on the countryâ€ ™ s roads .
Currently , official figures say 30,000 people die and 250,000 are injured on the roads every year .
The amendments give a long list of physical and mental disabilities which are legal impediments to driving , including conditions such as serious visual impairment or paralysis .
But the most controversial section is the list of sexual preferences and conditions given , including paedophilia , sado - masochism and exhibitionism , as well as â€œfetishismâ€ � , which is described as people who gain sexual arousal from inanimate objects .
Transsexuals and transvestites are also on the list , which is drawn from the World Health Organisationâ€ ™ s list of â€œgender identity disordersâ€ � and â€œdisorders of sexual preference.â€ �
Yelena Masyuk , a member of the Kremlinâ€ ™ s own human rights council , wrote online that the amendment should be scrutinised .
â€œI donâ€
™ t understand why , for example , fetishists , kleptomaniacs or transsexuals should be banned from driving a carâ€
¦
I think this is a violation of the rights of Russian citizens.â€
�
The move was also criticised by international rights activists , who said it could create a climate of fear .
â€œBanning people from driving based on their gender identity or expression is ridiculous and just another example of the Russian regimeâ€ ™ s methodical rollback of basic human rights for its citizens , â€ � said Shawn Gaylord of US - based organisation Human Rights First .
â€œBeyond the denial of basic freedoms , this provision may deter transgender people from seeking mental health services for fear of receiving a diagnosis that would strip them of their right to drive.â€ �
Russia drew a huge amount of international criticism for a recent law that bans the â€œpropaganda of homosexualityâ€ � to minors .
It was not immediately clear how the new ban would be enforced , whether there would be medical tests at the time of applying for a driving license , or whether there could be retrospective action taken against people who already drive but fall into the banned categories ."
2015-02-05,"As US - Russian relations continue their long slide , pushed into the deep freeze by the Ukraine conflict , a critical element in that relationship has remained intact .
Four years ago , in much more hopeful times , the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty ( New START ) entered into force , after having been signed in Prague by Barack Obama and the then Russian president Dmitry Medvedev .
The deal involved a cut in both sidesâ€ ™ arsenal of deployed strategic warheads by a third to a new ceiling of 1550 apiece .
Afterwards Obama described Medvedev as a â€œfriend and partnerâ€ � and Medvedev talked of a â€œpersonal chemistryâ€ � between the two .
It was the one solid achievement of the temporary â€˜resetâ€ ™ of relations between Washington and Moscow .
Medvedev has long since left the scene of course , and if there is a personal chemistry between Obama and Vladimir Putin , it is of an extremely toxic variety .
Yet the implementation of New START has not been affected .
According to the last declared count in September , the US had 1642 warheads , and the Russian Federation had 1643 .
That is comfortably on a downward glide path to reaching 1550 each as scheduled in three years time .
â€œIt has been a very successful four years , with a continual , smooth and straightforward implementation of the treaty , a significant bright spot in our bilateral relations , â€ � Rose Gottemoeller , the under secretary of state for arms control and international security said in a telephone interview while in London .
â€œIt has so far been immune to problems in the relationship.â€ �
However , at the time of its signature , New START was supposed to be the beginning of more ambitious cuts in the arsenals of both states , who own the overwhelming majority of the worldâ€ ™ s nuclear weapons between them .
But there were no follow - on talks , nor do any seem likely .
Obama proposed cutting the strategic deployed arsenals by another third in 2013 but Moscow has not shown interest .
â€œWe donâ€ ™ t have a willing dance partner at the moment , â€ � Gottemoeller said .
There is another problem that threatens to upset the stability of the arms control regime between the two countries .
Last year , the US accused the Russians of violating the Intermediate - Range Nuclear Forces ( INF ) Treaty by testing a nuclear - capable missile with the banned range of between 500 km and 5,500 km .
Gottemoeller said the new weapon was â€œa new ground - launched cruise
missileâ€ �
but denied it was of a type speculated about in some reports , the Iskander - K or R-500 .
When challenged , Moscow has not acknowledged the existence of the suspect missile and has launched counter - accusations about infringements by the US , which Washington has in turn rejected .
The US has threatened to take military counter - measures if the matter is not resolved , hinting that it could station medium - range weapons of its own in Europe once more .
But Gottemoeller insisted there was no deadline to trigger such measures and for now , Washington would rely on diplomacy ."
2015-06-22,"The Russian government has cut the budget for the 2018 World Cup by Â£340 m as part of belt - tightening measures , even though stadium construction projects have reportedly been over cost and behind schedule .
A decree by the prime minister , Dmitry Medvedev , published on Monday reduced the World Cup budget , including both government and private expenditures , by 29.2 billion roubles .
The total planned cost is now 631.5 billion roubles ( Â£7.4bn ) .
â€œOf
course
itâ€
™ s a question of optimising the preparations .
Weâ€

Mutko said Russia was cutting â€œredundantâ€ � construction projects and had agreed with Fifa to reduce the number of hotels and other facilities planned for the World Cup .
The number of training facilities at each stadium will now be three rather than four , he said .
â€œThis is a reflection of the difficult economic situation but it should not have a negative effect on the event itself , â€ �
Dmitry Yefimov , a Fifa representative in Russia , told R - Sport .
Even before the reduction there were doubts that Russia could meet its World Cup budget , since the cost for the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics grew exponentially during construction , eventually reaching an estimated $ 50bn .
The Russian government has implemented a 10 % across - the - board budget cut this year amid reduced revenues from low oil prices .
Despite suggestions Russia could be stripped of the World Cup if corruption is found during ongoing investigations , the president Vladimir Putin this weekend reiterated his commitment to holding the event , noting that stadium construction had already started .
The Guardian reported this month that at least 40 % of the World Cup construction programme was under way or has been completed .
But in an investigation published on Sunday , the respected newspaper Vedomosti reported that at least half of Russiaâ€ ™ s World Cup stadiums were behind schedule and almost all were over budget this spring , quoting an unnamed stadium designer .
In particular , the rouble crisis of last year , when the currency lost more than half its value against the dollar , caused prices for largely imported equipment to rocket .
According to Mikhail Khryapov , director of Stroitransgaz , which is building the stadiums in Volgograd and Nizhny Novgorod , equipment prices rose by 50 % and the overall cost of the project increased by 15 % .
In addition , World Cup construction has run into unforeseen costs and delays .
For instance , builders in Russiaâ€ ™ s Kaliningrad exclave had to spend 850 million roubles on sand to firm up the swampy ground where the World Cup stadium there is supposed to be constructed .
As a result of delays and price overruns , the sports ministry allowed contractors and builders to simplify the designs , Vedomosti reported .
A spokesperson for the first deputy prime minister , Igor Shuvalov , said stadium projects were cancelling extra features , using cheaper technologies , replacing imported products with local ones and re - examining contracts to try to cut out middlemen .
At the same time all of Fifaâ€ ™ s quality and safety requirements would still be met , he said .
Previously Fifa has allowed Russian organisers to reduce the planned capacity of World Cup stadium projects in Kaliningrad , Volgograd and Yekaterinburg to 35,000 rather than the standard 40,000 .
In a separate interview with the newspaper , Aras Agalarov , the president of Crocus Group , which is building the stadiums in Kaliningrad and Rostov - on - Don , said that after prices began to rise , he received permission from the government to â€œoptimiseâ€ � these projects to fit the previously planned budget .
For instance , the number of elevators planned at the Rostov - on - Don stadium was reduced from 45 to 25 , he said .
According to the Vedomosti report , government agencies and building companies have claimed they were able to save significantly by replacing imports and making projects more efficient .
Not all imports can be replaced , since some complicated electronics and other components are not made in Russia .
But Chinese companies often produce copies of European components , and buying from them instead can reduce costs by 15 % or more compared with European stadiums , according to Delovaya Rossiya , a civic organisation that promotes an open business climate ."
2015-09-02,"A mixed bag of sports - based news from Russia .
First , manscaped president Vladimir Putin has released a set of high - camp photos of him working out on holibobs with his toy prime minister Dmitry Medvedev .
We behold the pair pumping iron together , clinking fine china teacups together , and barbecuing deep inside each otherâ€ ™ s personal space , in a series which may as well have been captioned :
â€œAre they the only two people in the world who canâ€ ™ t see it?â€ �
But which , in Putinâ€ ™ s mind , is probably headlined : â€œOMG
I BET
THE PREZ CAN BENCH - PRESS A
MiG.â€ �
For others , however , the outlook is less sunny , with workers at St Petersburgâ€ ™ s Zenit Arena , a 2018 World Cup venue , reporting that their wages have not been paid for months .
On the one hand , this is barely remarkable .
It really isnâ€ ™ t a World Cup or an Olympics any longer unless an exploited and/or indentured work force is building it .
As far as Fifa has long been concerned , arguing for workersâ€ ™ rights would be as misplaced as arguing against gravity .
Companies â€œare responsible for their workers , â€ � explained Sepp Blatter , â€œnot Fifa.â€
�
On the other hand , things are beginning to take on a different complexion when we consider that Russia 2018 will be the first showpiece Fifa event under a new Fifa president , most likely Michel Platini .
Naturally , one hopes the Swiss investigation into the 2018 and 2022 World Cup votes is hovering menacingly above the new Fifa presidentâ€ ™ s in - tray â€ “ though given this is a Swiss probe , we ought not to surrender too much to wishful thinking .
Yet having already furiously denied reports that he was given a Picasso by Russia in exchange for his vote , Platini ought to feel particularly sensitive about how Russia 2018 is going to look .
We can already predict with reasonable confidence that it will be boycotted by a whole host of world leaders .
( Whether the event will land Russia Today fan Jeremy Corbyn is unclear , but I hope so , simply for the possibility that the expected Labour leader might be seated next to my beloved monster Steven Seagal â€ “ a Putin darling â€ “ for the opening ceremony .
Lip readers of the world are asked to keep the date free just in case . )
What looks like being more of a potential problem for Platiniâ€ ™ s new Fifa , which will absolutely not be anything like the old Fifa , is the sort of PR horror - show of a team boycott .
That possibility is far from ruled out as far as the Dutch are concerned , with last yearâ€ ™ s shooting - down over Ukraine of Malaysia Airlines MH17 â€ “ two thirds of whose passengers were Dutch â€ “ having been widely attributed to a Russian unit .
Last year , the Dutch football association ( KNVB ) offered a candid snapshot of its thinking on the issue , confirming a boycott was by no means off the table .
â€œDifferent people have asked the KNVB questions about [ participating in ] the 2018 World Cup in Russia , â€ � said the association .
â€œWe realise that a future World Cup in Russia will be very emotive for all football lovers and relatives of the dead in the Netherlands .
During these black days the KNVB is with the families , friends and football clubs of the victims .
Silence over this immense loss is the current priority .
The KNVB thinks that it is more appropriate for discussion about the future World Cup in Russia to be held at a later date , when the investigation of the disaster is completed.â€ �
That date now stands at next month .
Perhaps in anticipation , Putin recently aimed his unique brand of diplomacy at the expected conclusions of the Netherlands - led investigation into MH17 by incinerating vast amounts of imported Dutch flowers ( a literally incendiary sequel to Russiaâ€ ™ s recent European cheese - immolation ) .
For so long , the focus on the various horrors of Qatar has served as a lightning rod , diverting attention conveniently away from Putinâ€ ™ s more imminent World Cup .
That must now change â€ “ in fact , it should become a major Fifa election issue .
Where do these â€œnew Fifaâ€ � candidates stand on the gathering shitstorm that is Russia 2018 ?
Given that Putin used his last sporting mega - event as a curtain - raiser to invading a neighbour , enquiring minds should want to know .
Passionate voice needed The spectacle of Bundesliga fans showing solidarity with refugees was striking and moving .
In grounds across Germany last weekend , huge â€œREFUGEES WELCOMEâ€ � banners were held aloft , while Borussia Dortmund invited 220 asylum seekers to watch their Europa League tie .
Had things come to as desperate a head in the UK as they have in Germany , where racist violence has seen refugee shelters attacked , we would have to hope the Premier League would step up to the moment and assist in such a show of fellow feeling .
In many ways , this is an issue on which football should have a passionate voice .
As barely needs stating , so axiomatic has it become , the game has been vastly enriched across Europe by migrants and the children of migrants .
In surveys of refugees and asylum seekers , meanwhile , it places high on the list of what people love most about their new country .
And now , fans accustomed to picking out fellow members of their tribe via replica shirts can see their clubâ€ ™ s colours on the backs of migrants being pulled out of the Mediterranean .
When people talk about â€œthe football familyâ€ � , they are usually either Sepp Blatter , or using sarcastic air quotes .
But if such a thing can ever be said to exist , then this issue gripping Europe should be among the very closest to its heart ."
2015-09-11,"The Russian Orthodox Church has demanded further testing of remains thought to belong to the son and daughter of Russiaâ€ ™ s last emperor , Tsar Nicholas II , disrupting the governmentâ€ ™ s plans to rebury them in St Petersburg next month .
A working group created by the prime minister Dmitry Medvedev in July proposed on Friday to bury crown prince Alexei Romanov and his sister , grand duchess Maria , with the remains of their family in the iconic Peter and Paul Cathedral on 18 October .
But Medvedevâ€ ™ s spokeswoman later said the date for their burial would only be decided after additional consultation with the Russian Orthodox Church , reported news agency RIA Novosti .
Church spokesman Vsevolod Chaplin said the working group had agreed to further testing of the remains to prove their authenticity .
â€œPeople have questions .
We want further investigation so that any tests are done in the presence of church officials , â€ � said Chaplin , adding that the church also wanted to do further testing on those remains already buried in the cathedral .
The church has refused to recognise the results of DNA testing that found the remains do indeed belong to the royal family , delaying the process of burying Alexei and Maria , which have been held in a state repository since 2007 .
The current head of the Russian Imperial House , grand duchess Maria Vladimirovna , also considers the burial of these remains â€œpremature , â€ � a spokesman told news agency RSN .
â€œThese people have been canonised , and if their remains are found they will be considered holy relics that believers will pray to , for this reason itâ€ ™ s very important to make sure , â€ � said Chaplin .
Several descendants of the tsarâ€ ™ s family who now live abroad had already been planning to come to Russia for the October burial before the latest complications arose .
â€œWeâ€ ™ re very happy this story is coming to an end , but at the same time thereâ€ ™ s bitterness over the fact that the church hasnâ€ ™ t recognised the remains , â€ �
Ivan Artsishevsky , a spokesman for the relatives , told news agency Interfax on Friday .
Tsar Nicholas II abdicated the throne in 1917 , ending three centuries of rule by the Romanov dynasty , and sought asylum in Britain , but was refused by his cousin George V â€ “
Elizabeth IIâ€
™ s grandfather â€ “ over political concerns .
Held in captivity by the Bolsheviks , the family was executed by firing squad in the early hours of 17 July 1918 at a house in Yekaterinburg .
Their bodies were thrown into a mineshaft , burned and then buried .
The first remains were found in Yekaterinburg in 1979 , but remained buried until the end of the Soviet Union .
In 2008 , US and Russian experts confirmed that the remains unearthed in 1991 belonged to the tsar by matching DNA samples from the skeletons with those from living relatives and from objects such as a blood - stained shirt worn by Nicholas II .
The tsar , his wife Alexandra , daughters Anastasia , Olga and Tatiana and several servants were buried in St Petersburg in 1998 at a ceremony held by the president , Boris Yeltsin .
Remains thought to belong to Alexei and Maria , who were 13 and 19 when they were killed , were discovered 43 miles away from the others in 2007 .
Russian investigators have ruled the remains are authentic based on genetic testing .
In a controversial decision , the Russian Orthodox Church canonised the Romanov family , which is revered by many right - wing groups but considered autocrats by others , in 2000 .
The church has grown increasingly influential during the 15 years that president Vladimir Putin , who is often pictured with the patriarch , has been in office ."
2015-09-23,"Russiaâ€ ™ s investigative committee has reopened its case on the 1918 murder of the Romanov royal family after the Russian Orthodox church demanded further testing of what are believed to be their remains .
The churchâ€ ™ s hesitancy to allow the remains of two final members of the family to be buried has divided the Romanovsâ€ ™ descendants , with one branch of relatives supporting the call for more tests and another expressing impatience with the hold - up .
In a statement on Wednesday , spokesman Vladimir Markin said that , at the suggestion of a working group created this summer by the Russian prime minister , Dmitry Medvedev , the investigative committee had reopened the case to conduct additional identity testing on the remains using previously unavailable evidence .
Investigators will test remains thought to belong to Crown Prince Alexei Romanov and his sister , Grand Duchess Maria , against bloodstains on the uniform of their great - grandfather , Emperor Alexander II , who was killed in a bombing by radicals in St Petersburg in 1881 .
They will also compare the remains to those of their aunt , Grand Duchess Yelizaveta Fyodorovna , and study newly discovered materials from a 1918 - 1924 investigation into the murder by the White Guards who fought the Bolsheviks .
As part of the case , the bodies of Russiaâ€ ™ s last emperor , Nicholas II and his wife , Alexandra Fyodorovna , would need to be exhumed from their tomb in St Petersburgâ€ ™ s Peter and Paul Cathedral , Markin said .
Opened in 1993 after the first remains were found in Yekaterinburg , the murder case was closed in 1998 because those who committed the crime were dead .
Earlier this month , the working group suggested burying Alexei and Maria with the rest of their family on 18 October , but reportedly backed off from these plans after the powerful Russian Orthodox church questioned the authenticity of the remains .
Tsar Nicholas II abdicated the throne in 1917 and was held by the Bolsheviks after his cousin George V â€ “ Queen Elizabeth IIâ€
™ s grandfather â€ “ refused him asylum in Britain over political concerns .
He , his family and four attendants were executed by firing squad in the early hours of 17 July 1918 at a house in Yekaterinburg , and their bodies were thrown into a mineshaft .
But the Bolsheviks later removed the remains , burned them , corroded them with acid and reburied them in an unknown location .
For the next eight decades , rumours persisted that Princess Anastasia or other family members had survived .
The Romanovsâ€ ™ suspected remains were finally unearthed in 1991 , and in 2008 US and Russian experts confirmed through genetic testing that they belonged to the tsar , his wife and three of his daughters .
But the Russian Orthodox church never recognised the remains as those of the royal family , and when they were buried in St Petersburgâ€ ™ s Peter and Paul Cathedral in 1998 at a ceremony attended by the then president , Boris Yeltsin , the priest avoided speaking their names as he read the funeral rites .
In 2007 , more remains were discovered in a separate burial site near the first , and genetic testing reportedly confirmed that they belonged to Alexei and Maria , who were 13 and 19 when they were killed .
They have been kept in a state repository awaiting burial .
A geneticist from the Russian Academy of Sciences told the Komsomolskaya Pravda newspaper that testing on the remains had left â€œno doubt that all the members of the tsarâ€ ™ s family have been discoveredâ€ � .
But speaking to the Guardian earlier this month , a spokesman for the Russian Orthodox church , Vsevolod Chaplin , said it wanted further testing of both the remains buried in Peter and Paul Cathedral and those in the state depository , arguing that previous investigations of their authenticity were opaque .
For the church , a case of mistaken identity is not permissible .
â€œPeople have questions .
We want further investigation so that any tests are done in the presence of church officials , â€ � Chaplin said .
â€œThese people have been canonised , and if their remains are found they will be considered holy relics that believers will pray to .
For this reason itâ€ ™ s very important to make sure.â€ �
The churchâ€ ™ s request is backed by one set of Romanov descendants , headed by Nicholas IIâ€ ™ s great - great - granddaughter , Princess Maria Vladimirovna , who lives in Spain .
But it is criticised by another branch , led by Prince Dmitry Romanovich , which does not consider Maria Vladimirovna to be the rightful heir to the tsarist family and which has welcomed the move to bury Alexei and Maria .
A representative of this branch told reporters earlier this month that some family members had been planning to come to the burial in Russia and said there was still â€œbitterness over the fact that the church hasnâ€ ™ t recognised the remainsâ€ � .
Although the Romanovsâ€ ™ descendants live abroad , they occasionally travel to Russia , where they are still revered by some Orthodox faithful and far - right groups .
A regional lawmaker this summer sent a letter to both branches inviting them to resettle in Russia or in annexed Crimea ."
2015-11-26,"Russia has announced that it will impose import sanctions on Turkey and cancel major investment projects as the spat between the two countries over the downed Su-24 fighter jet continues .
The Russian prime minister , Dmitry Medvedev , said broad punitive steps could include halting joint economic projects , restricting financial and trade transactions and changing customs duties .
There were calls to ban imports of all Turkish produce , while in the city of Krasnodar , dozens of Turkish workers were rounded up and arrested for visa violations .
Already , the countryâ€ ™ s tourist board has suspended all tours to Turkey , a move that it estimated would cost the Turkish economy $ 10bn ( Â£6.6bn ) .
Russia also said it was suspending all military cooperation with Turkey , including closing down an emergency hotline to share information on Russian airstrikes in Syria .
Putin accused Turkey of deliberately trying to bring relations between Moscow and Ankara to a standstill , adding that Moscow was still awaiting an apology or an offer of reimbursement for damages .
He earlier called the act a â€œstab in the back by the accomplices of terroristsâ€ � and promised â€œserious consequencesâ€ � .
World leaders have urged both sides to avoid escalation .
In an apparent attempt to cool the dispute â€ “ and appeal to western countries â€ “ Turkish prime minister Ahmet Davutoglu
said in a letter to Britainâ€ ™ s Times newspaper that Ankara would work with its allies and Russia to â€œcalm tensionsâ€ � .
For two days , Russian officials have fumed over the incident and demanded an apology , while the Russian ambassador in Ankara was summoned in response to the Turkish embassy in Moscow being pelted with eggs and stones .
If Moscow expected to hear grovelling from Ankara , an apology was not forthcoming .
The Turkish president , Recep Tayyip ErdoÄŸan , told CNN that Russia , not Turkey , should be apologising , and in a speech to local officials in Ankara dismissed as â€œemotionalâ€ � and â€œunfittingâ€ � Russian suggestions that joint projects could be cancelled .
In response to Russian accusations that Turkey has been buying oil and gas from Islamic State in Syria , ErdoÄŸan said : â€œShame on you .
Itâ€ ™ s clear where Turkey buys its oil and gas ...
Those who claim we are buying oil from Daesh [ an Arabic acronym for Isis ] like this must prove their claims .
Nobody can slander this country.â€ �
Russia has insisted that its plane never strayed from Syrian airspace , while Turkey says it crossed into its airspace for 17 seconds .
The Russian foreign minister , Sergei Lavrov , said that even if this was the case , shooting the plane down was an extreme over - reaction and looked like a pre - planned provocation .
The planeâ€ ™ s pilot and a marine sent on a rescue mission died .
The surviving navigator claimed in an interview with Russian television that he received no audio or visual warning before the plane was shot down .
The Turks have released audio recordings of what they say are radio warnings issued to the plane .
The Russia - Turkey spat makes work harder for FranÃ§ois Hollande , who held talks with Putin as part of a diplomatic marathon aimed at building a wide - ranging coalition to launch airstrikes against Isis .
â€œIâ€ ™ m in Moscow with you to figure out how we can act together in order to coordinate our actions in order to hit this terrorist group and look for political solutions for Syria
, â€ � said Hollande in televised comments before the two presidents retired for talks .
Putin expressed his condolences over the Paris attacks earlier this month : â€œOur positions are the same .
Russia has been the target of terrorist attacks for a long time .
So we empathise with you , we know how you feel , how the people of France feel.â€ � Hollande and Putin met in the Kremlin late on Thursday .
The meeting was more cordial than recent surly encounters over Ukraine , with Hollande referring to his counterpart as â€œmon cher Vladimirâ€ � , but appeared to yield little in the way of real progress .
As it has done for years , the issue of Bashar al - Assadâ€ ™ s fate still divides Moscow and most western capitals .
Hollande said Assad â€œhas no placeâ€ � in a future Syria while Putin said the Syrian president had to be considered an ally .
â€œTo successfully fight terrorism in Syria is impossible without ground operations , and there is no force in Syria which could take part in ground operations except Assadâ€ ™ s army .
So I think Assad himself and his army is a necessary ally in the fight against terror , â€ �
he said .
Putin said he would prefer a broad coalition to fight Isis under a UN mandate , presumably with Assadâ€ ™ s backing , but conceded â€œour partners are not ready for thisâ€ � .
He said Russia would work with the US - led coalition where possible , but added that any further incidents such as the Turkish shoot - down of a Russian fighter jet on Tuesday were â€œabsolutely unacceptableâ€ � .
Hollande said that the two leaders had agreed on better intelligence coordination and exchange .
Moscow has been carrying out airstrikes in Syria for nearly two months , which western capitals say are aimed less at fighting Isis and more at propping up the Assad regime .
Putin has said the best way to defeat Isis is to support the â€œlegitimate governmentâ€ � of Assad and not to allow the institutions of state to crumble , as in Iraq and Libya . .
Hollande met Barack Obama in Washington on Tuesday and Matteo Renzi , the Italian prime minister , in Paris earlier on Thursday .
He met David Cameron on Monday and Angela Merkel on Wednesday .
In Britain , a vote of MPs is due next week on the extension of airstrikes from Iraq to Syria .
On Monday Cameron told Hollande that France could use a British airbase in Cyprus to fly missions against Isis .
Germanyâ€ ™ s defence spokesman said Tornado reconnaissance jets would be sent to support the fight against Isis in Syria .
Henning Otte said Germany would play a more active role , a day after Merkel told Hollande she would act swiftly to work out how her country could offer more support ."
2016-02-13,"The Russian prime minister has said the world is slipping into a â€œnew cold warâ€ � after European leaders condemned his countryâ€ ™
s airstrikes on Syria and called on Vladimir Putin to end them as a precursor for peace negotiations .
Dmitry Medvedev told a security conference in Munich that a lack of cooperation threatened to return the continent to â€œ40 years ago , when a wall was standing in Europeâ€ � .
He rejected the widely held belief that Russian planes had hit civilian targets in Syria .
â€œThere is no evidence of our bombing civilians , even though everyone is accusing us of this , â€ � he said on Saturday .
â€œRussia is not trying to achieve some secret goals in Syria .
We are simply trying to protect our national interests
â€ ¦ â€œCreating trust is hard â€ ¦ but we have to start .
Our positions differ , but they do not differ as much as 40 years ago when a wall was standing in Europe .
â€œYou could say even more sharply : we have fallen into a new cold war , â€ �
he said .
â€œNearly on a daily basis , we are being blamed for the most terrible threat to Nato as a whole , to Europe , to America , to other countries .
They make scary movies where Russia starts a nuclear war .
I sometimes wonder : are we in 2016 or 1962?â€ �
The Nato secretary general , Jens Stoltenberg , rejected Medvedevâ€ ™ s accusations : â€œRussiaâ€ ™ s rhetoric , posture and exercises of its nuclear forces are aimed at intimidating its neighbours , undermining trust and stability in Europe.â€ � The Russian prime ministerâ€ ™ s comments came as fighting escalated in northern Syria , with the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights saying that Turkey had shelled Syrian territories for the second time this month .
Medvedevâ€ ™ s
French counterpart , Manuel Valls , told the conference : â€œTo find the path to peace again , the Russian bombing of civilians [ in Syria ] has to stop.â€ �
The US secretary of state , John Kerry , said most of Russiaâ€ ™ s attacks had been against legitimate opposition groups in Syria .
â€œThis is the moment .
This is a hinge point , â€ � he said .
â€œDecisions made in the coming days and weeks , and a few months could end the war in Syria â€ “ or could define a very difficult set of choices for the future .
â€œThe war in Syria has now lasted for almost five years and shows no signs of burning itself out , which is why we are so focused on a political track .
If the international community and the Syrians themselves miss the opportunity now before us to achieve that political resolution to the conflict [ then ] the violence , the bloodshed , the torture , the bombing , and the anguish will continue â€ “ so will the siren call to jihad.â€ �
However , Russiaâ€ ™ s foreign minister said the chances of securing a ceasefire within a week were less than 50 % and his country remained deeply suspicious of US intentions .
Sergey Lavrov said military cooperation between the US and Russia was the â€œkey toolâ€ � to ensuring the humanitarian supplies were delivered and hostilities ended .
â€œIf we are moving closer to practical goals of [ a ] truce then , without cooperation between the military , nothing will work out , â€ �
he told the Munich conference .
The British foreign secretary , Philip Hammond , said the chance of a truce depended on Russiaâ€ ™ s actions : â€œUnless Russia over the next days is going to stop , or at least significantly scale back that bombing , the moderate armed opposition will not join in this [ peace ] process .
They can not be expected to join in this process.â€ �
Germanyâ€ ™ s foreign ministry said Russiaâ€ ™ s military action had â€œseriously compromisedâ€ � the peace process , while the Turkish foreign minister , MevlÃ¼t Ã‡avuÅŸoÄŸlu , said on Twitter : â€œWhat is important now is embracing this opportunity , stopping the airstrikes , ceasing targeting civilians and providing humanitarian access.â€
�
The Lithuanian president , Dalia GrybauskaitÄ— , told the conference the situation was more serious than the cold war .
â€œWe are probably facing a hot war , â€ � she said .
â€œRussia is demonstrating open military aggression in Ukraine , open military aggression in Syria .
There is nothing cold about this , it is very hot.â€
� Russian aircraft were seen in action over northern Syria again on Friday .
Its intervention in the conflict since late September has significantly strengthened the hand of President Bashar al - Assad , who on Friday vowed to regain control of the entire country .
His comments dealt a swift blow to international efforts to secure a ceasefire , deliver aid and promote a negotiated solution to the war that has killed more than a quarter of a million civilians .
The Syrian Observatory said that more than 1,000 civilians have been killed by Russian airstrikes in Syria .
Kerry said earlier that if the peace plan agreed on Friday failed , more foreign troops could enter the conflict .
â€œIf the Assad regime does not live up to its responsibilities , and if the Iranians and the Russians do not hold Assad to the promises that they have made ...
then the international community obviously is not going to sit there like fools and watch this , â€ � he said .
Ã‡avuÅŸoÄŸlu said Saudi Arabia had sent troops and fighter jets to Turkeyâ€ ™ s Incirlik military base ahead of a possible ground invasion of Syria , but did not reveal any numbers .
â€œWe have always emphasised the need for an extensive result - oriented strategy in the fight against [ Isis ] .
If we have such a strategy , then Turkey and Saudi Arabia may launch an operation from the land ,
â€ � he told a Turkish newspaper .
The Saudi foreign minister said his country would be â€œready to participateâ€ � in ground action and reiterated a desire to see the Syrian president deposed .
â€œThere will be no Bashar al - Assad in the future , â€ �
Adel al - Jubeir told Germanyâ€ ™ s Sueddeutsche Zeitung newspaper .
â€œIt might take three months , it might take six months or three years

2016-09-18,"Russia voted in parliamentary elections on Sunday and there was a notably low turnout in big cities .
The results are not expected to lead to any dramatic changes ; the established political parties are all broadly supportive of the countryâ€ ™ s president , Vladimir Putin , and the low turnout suggested more opposition - minded urban Russians simply stayed at home .
An exit poll by a state - run polling organisation , VTsIOM , showed that the United Russia party , led by the prime minister , Dmitry Medvedev , obtained 44.5 % of the vote .
The nationalist LDPR was in second place with 15.3 % of the vote , according to the exit poll , followed by the Communist party on 14.9 % and the Just Russia party on 8.1 % .
In Moscow just 28 % of voters had cast their ballots by 6 pm , compared with more than 50 % in the previous elections five years ago .
After the 2011 parliamentary vote , accusations of vote - rigging led tens of thousands of Russians to take to the streets in a series of protests that lasted until Putinâ€ ™ s inauguration for a new term in May 2012 .
To qualify for entry into the Duma , parties need to win 5 % of the vote nationwide .
There are currently four parties represented but the dominant force is United Russia , the party backed by Putin and to which most regional leaders belong .
Opposition politicians from Parnas , the party led by Boris Nemtsov until his assassination in Moscow last year , stood in a number of regions with candidates backed by the exiled oligarch Mikhail Khodorkovsky also on the ticket .
There have been allegations of foul play and opposition parties point out that the playing field is uneven , given the Kremlinâ€ ™ s tight control over much of the media .
The opposition has been riven by infighting and divisions over strategy , further fragmenting an already small slice of the vote .
Few are expecting major protests this time .
Those five years ago resulted in trials and prison sentences for some of those involved , which has left many feeling that political activism will not change anything .
Putin has become more popular since the annexation of Crimea , where people voted in their first parliamentary elections as part of Russia .
Ukraine strongly condemned the vote .
New presidential elections in Russia are due in early 2018 .
If , as expected , Putin stands and wins , he will have effectively ruled Russia for 24 years by the end of his next six - year term .
The prime minister , Dmitry Medvedev , called on voters to back United Russia on Friday , saying the country was â€œunder pressure from outside forcesâ€ � and needed to come together .
The party struggles to gain support among many Russians , who see it as an organisation of corrupt local bureaucrats , but it wins votes by virtue of Putinâ€ ™ s backing and through mobilising public service workers to cast their ballots ."
2016-09-19,"Russiaâ€ ™ s new parliament will be overwhelmingly loyal to the Kremlin , after elections marked by a record low turnout threw up few surprises .
With more than 93 % of the votes counted on Monday morning , the United Russia party , backed by Russiaâ€ ™ s president , Vladimir Putin , and led by its prime minister , Dmitry Medvedev , had won 54 % of the vote .
The other three parties to clear the 5 % barrier required to make it into the Duma are all broadly loyal to the Kremlin line .
United Russia will take more than three - quarters of the 450 seats in the Duma .
The communists , and the far - right nationalists of Vladimir Zhirinovskyâ€ ™ s
Liberal Democratic party took about 13 % of the vote , while the liberal Yabloko party and the opposition Parnas garnered miserly returns .
Parnas was the party led by Boris Nemtsov , a former deputy prime minister who was shot dead outside the Kremlin last year .
Before the elections , many had criticised the liberal opposition for failing to unite on a single ticket .
A new , mixed voting system was introduced for Sundayâ€ ™ s election , in which voters chose both a party and individual candidates , with half the MPs coming from party lists and half from the direct voting .
United Russia candidates also dominated the direct voting , meaning that in the end they will control 76 % of the seats in the new Duma , giving them the two - thirds majority required to change the constitution .
The projected 343 seats for United Russia is an increase of more than 100 from the previous parliament .
In recent years , the Duma has been a pliant body with little real voice , and the two MPs out of 450 who had pursued an independent line have not been re - elected .
One , Ilya Ponomarev , is living in exile while the other , Dmitry Gudkov , was beaten by a United Russia candidate in a Moscow district .
Turnout in the election was just 47 % , the lowest in the history of modern Russia .
In major cities , the turnout was even lower , with just 28 % of eligible voters making it to the polls in Moscow .
In Crimea , which was voting in the first parliamentary elections since annexation by Russia in 2014 , turnout was also low .
Only 40 % of Crimeans had cast their ballots with two hours of voting remaining , and the turnout was on course to be lower than the last time Crimeans voted in Ukrainian parliamentary elections .
After the widespread euphoria over rejoining Russia two years ago , life has not improved in the way many Crimeans had hoped , which has led to discontent and apathy similar to that in other parts of Russia .
The national average was boosted by some provincial regions , where officials are known to demand local residents , and especially public service workers , come out to vote .
â€œThe situation is tough and difficult but the people still voted for United Russia , â€ �
Putin said on Sunday evening .
United Russia was described as â€œthe party of crooks and thievesâ€ � by the opposition leader Alexei Navalny , but although many Russians have disdain for corrupt local leaders , United Russia remains electable due to its association with Putin and a lack of viable alternatives .
There were some violations reported on the day of the vote , including cases where what appeared to be blatant ballot stuffing was captured on camera .
However , most election observers noted that the elections were much cleaner than the parliamentary elections five years ago .
Then , multiple violations prompted tens of thousands of Muscovites to come out on to the streets for a season of protests that lasted several months and rattled the Kremlin .
While the day of the voting was cleaner and some opposition candidates were allowed on to the ballot , Kremlin critics say the vote is skewed from the outset given the partisan nature of state television and access to resources .
However , few expect a new season of protests , after a crackdown in 2012 dissuaded many opposition - minded Russians from dissent .
The next big election in Russia is the presidential vote , scheduled for early 2018 .
Putin is expected to stand and win another six - year term .
By the end of that term , he would have ruled Russia for 24 years ."
2017-03-27,"When Vladimir Putin was asked about his job , two years after becoming master of the Kremlin on New Yearâ€ ™ s Eve , 1999 , he said something about being a hired manager elected by the Russian people for a term of office .
When he is asked about his job now , he calls it â€œfateâ€ � .

Even so the Russian people , Putin is above all a symbol of stability after a decade and a half of turmoil that included the misguided and botched reform of the Soviet communist system ; its abrupt end and the sudden advent of freedom that often looked like a free - for - all ; the painful dissolution of the Soviet Union ; market reforms , often dubbed â€œshock without therapyâ€ � ; virtually instant crass inequality ; the end of ideology and the collapse of morals .
Putin was appointed by Boris Yeltsin , Russiaâ€ ™ s first president , to be his successor , but he earned his stripes by taming the oligarchs , bringing to an end the seemingly endless war in Chechnya , breaking the backbone of the once powerful Communist party and marginalising liberals .
He recreated the traditional Russian system of hierarchical government .
The state that had been privatised by the high and mighty could now strike back , reasserting its awesome power .
In much of what he was doing , Putin responded to the paternalistic demand of the bulk of the Russian people who had not particularly succeeded in the post - Communist era .
Not only did he genuinely win elections , which under his rule became a means of confirming people in power not replacing them .
He also cracked the code of staying in power in a country that had rejected both his predecessors , the once widely popular Mikhail Gorbachev and Boris Yeltsin .
When faced with the choice , early on , to go with the elites â€ “ including the intelligentsia â€ “ or with the ordinary people , he chose the latter .
Putin understood that to rule Russia he had to stay genuinely popular with â€œthe massesâ€ � and from time to time crack his whip at the elites : a â€œgood tsarâ€ � reining in the greedy â€œboyarsâ€ � .
Popularity ratings are important : to rule effectively , one needs at least 60 % support ; to rule comfortably , 70 % .
Approaching 50 % , however , which is totally fine in the west , is fraught with the dangers of civil strife in Russia .
Thus by his own personality , his public actions and attitudes , Putin managed to confer legitimacy on the Russian state in the eyes of the vast majority of the population .
Putin has restored Russiaâ€ ™ s status of a great power , lost with the Soviet Union .
He first tried to fit Russia into an enlarged west , as a senior ally of the US in Nato and a close partner of the EU within a â€œgreater Europeâ€ � .
When his efforts failed , he steered Russia away from the western orbit , rebuilt the countryâ€ ™ s military power and used it to protect Russian security interests in Ukraine â€ “ as he saw them â€ “ as well as to project force outside the former empire , to send the message to the world that Russia was back in play .
Publicly and resolutely , he stood up to US global dominance .
Seen as disruptive in the west , Putin has struck a conservative tone at home .
He allowed economic reforms in his first term , and later tolerated talk of modernisation , but his method of governance is essentially bureaucratic .
Putin is both a capitalist and a statist .
He understands the power of the market but is also wary of it , keeping the state always at the ready to step in and reassert control .
He has reduced former oligarchs to obedient servants ever so keen to oblige him .
He has seen his old friends rise to riches knowing that he can rely on their unquestioning loyalty
â€ “ the one quality Putin appears to value particularly highly .
The question about Putinâ€ ™ s own wealth misses the point â€ “ above a certain threshold , money turns into raw power , and in these terms the Russian president has few , if any peers .
An autocrat with the consent of the governed , Putin has preserved the essential personal freedoms that the Russian people first earned with the demise of the Communist system .
People can worship and travel freely ; Facebook and Twitter are essentially unrestricted ; there are even a few tolerated media outlets overtly in opposition to the Kremlin .
Political freedoms , however , are more tightly circumscribed , so as to leave no chance to potential â€œcolour revolutionariesâ€ � or politically ambitious exiled oligarchs .
For the bulk of the population , this matters little ; the relatively few activists have a choice of taking it â€ “ or leaving .
Putin once described himself as Russiaâ€ ™ s top nationalist .
He has also proclaimed patriotism to be Russiaâ€ ™ s national idea .
On his list of values , the Russian state features at the very top .
Since day one as president , he has been following Yeltsinâ€ ™ s parting request : â€œTake care of Russia.â€ � The Soviet Union was one of Russiaâ€ ™ s historical names , and so itâ€ ™ s little wonder that , to Putin , its downfall was a great catastrophe .
His basic frame of reference is Russiaâ€ ™ s rich history .
Once Putin quipped that there was no one in the world worth talking to after the death of Mahatma Gandhi .
Indeed , he talks with many , but he truly keeps company with Russiaâ€ ™ s past rulers : tsars , emperors and party leaders .
He is just the latest in a long line .
Having no peers in the land and very few abroad is a heavy psychological burden .
One needs to look to a much higher authority .
To Putin , however , religion is more than a personal matter .
Christian Orthodoxy , in his view , is a spiritual and moral guide , the essence of Russiaâ€ ™ s unique civilisation , and without it the countryâ€ ™ s history and its classical literature and the arts can not be fully understood .
To Putin , the â€œByzantine symphonyâ€ � , an alliance of the state and the established religious organisations , first among them the Russian Orthodox church , is the core of national unity .
Next year , Russia is due to hold its presidential elections .
Virtually everyone expects Putin to run , and no one has any doubt about his victory .
The only question is how many people will come to the polling stations , and how many of them will vote for Putin .
The Kremlin is now shooting for 70 % in both cases .
This fourth term in the Kremlin â€ “ fifth , if one counts Putinâ€ ™ s regency during Dmitry Medvedevâ€
™ s
stint â€ “ may be Putinâ€ ™ s last , not so much because he will turn 72 after the next six - year term expires , but rather because he was loth to change the constitution previously .
It is unlikely , however , that Putin will leave the stage even in 2024 , after nearly a quarter of a century in power : his job is in fact a mission that will not be done as long as he is active .
His challenge in the long term is to pass on leadership to a new generation of Russiaâ€ ™ s leaders , and make sure that this works .
Right now he is busy identifying people , most of them in their 40s and even 30s , who might form that group .
Some have already been appointed to senior positions as ministers , governors , or other high officials .
All will be tried and tested and given tasks to fulfil .
Putin himself , a father figure to his proteges , would then become a pater patriae , or , to use a Singaporean formula , a president mentor .
It is much too early to pass final judgment on Putin .
He has kept the country in one piece and restored its global status .
He continues to be a formidable figure , and is always ready to surprise .
He has made a deep impact on his country .
It is Putinâ€ ™ s Russia â€ “ largely because he is Russiaâ€ ™ s Putin ."

2017-03-30,"The street protests that swept Russian cities over the weekend were remarkable not just for their unusually large size , but also for their main target : Dmitry Medvedev .
After an investigation by the anti - corruption campaigner and opposition politician Alexei Navalny alleged a network of palaces and vineyards linked to Medvedev , the prime minister has become the focal point of the protests .
Angry Russians carried rubber ducks , a mocking reference to a shelter for ducks found on one of his alleged properties .
Medvedev , who spent four years as president between 2008 and 2012 , has long been considered by much of the opposition as a relatively decent member of Putinâ€ ™ s inner circle .
But his trajectory over the past decade reflects the evolution and eventual crushing of hopes that Vladimir Putinâ€ ™ s system might gradually reform from within , and evolve into something more liberal .
Medvedev , who has known the Russian president since 1991 , also grew up in Leningrad , now St Petersburg , but their backgrounds were very different .
While Putin was working for the KGB , Medvedev was a teenager dreaming of owning Pink Floydâ€ ™ s
The Wall and Wrangler jeans .
In interviews , he recalled work sweeping snow from the streets while he studied , and he later married his childhood sweetheart , Svetlana .
He used Twitter , surrounded himself with relative liberals , and said things like â€œfreedom is better than non - freedomâ€ � as he campaigned for the 2008 presidential election â€ “ in which he had long before secured the one vote that mattered : Putinâ€ ™ s .
In short , he seemed like a decent , progressive man who sympathised with the aspirations of Russiaâ€ ™ s growing middle class .
Although it was obvious that Putin , who moved aside to be prime minister , still held more power , there was real hope that with time Medvedev might grow into a genuine political force .
The Russian journalist Mikhail Zygar , in his recent book about Putinâ€ ™ s inner circle , described Medvedevâ€ ™ s uneasy manner as that of â€œa rookie teacher unsure of what reaction he will get on entering the classroom for the first timeâ€ � .
When Medvedev tried to dress or talk like Putin , donning bomber jackets or aspirating his consonants in the style of his mentor , the effects were more comic than threatening .
But it was partly for this reason that many liberals placed their hopes in Medvedev .
The very fact that he looked so awkward in his own skin , and seemed like a regular guy â€ “ rather than one of the humourless ex - KGB droids who made up so much of the Kremlin inner circle
â€ “ allowed people to hope he might be able to effect incremental change over time .
But in autumn 2011 , Putin announced he would move back to the Kremlin and Medvedev became prime minister again .
â€œTo be honest , I think even Putin was a bit disappointed in Medvedev .
He was hoping he might be able to eventually step aside , but he saw Medvedev wasnâ€ ™ t up to the task , â€ � one source close to the Kremlin claimed .
Medvedev accepted the demotion quietly , though rumours he had fallen into depression swirled around Moscow .
At a meeting with the leaders of parliamentary parties shortly after , he was saucer - eyed and looked like he might burst into tears at any moment .
â€œFor
a while it was very difficult for him to readapt to being prime minister , though after a while he seemed to be happy enough , â€ � said another source close to the Kremlin .
After the annexation of Crimea and the war in east Ukraine in 2014 , western sanctions and falling oil prices meant life got significantly harder for many Russians .
As Putin grabbed the credit for Russiaâ€ ™ s new assertiveness on the world stage , Medvedev took the hit for the miserable economic situation at home .
With time , Medvedevâ€ ™ s
gaffes seemed embarrassing rather than charming .
He was taunted mercilessly on social media , where he was attributed the hashtag â€œpatheticâ€ � .
His spokeswoman , Natalya Timakova , said Medvedev became upset after reading comments left for him on social media , and complained that people thought it acceptable to call him Dimon , a flippant diminutive of Dmitry .
â€œHeâ€ ™ s not Dimon to you ,
heâ€ ™ s the prime minister , â€ �
she said , angrily .
At the height of Ukraineâ€ ™ s Maidan protests in 2014 , he called on Ukraineâ€ ™ s then president Viktor Yanukovych not to be â€œa rag on which people are wiping their feetâ€ � .
If Putin had said it , it would have sounded vicious and pithy ; when Medvedev said it , it sounded more like projection .
His previous , almost charming awkwardness now seemed more like political tone - deafness .
He was repeatedly filmed snoozing through major events , including the spectacular opening ceremony of the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi , Russia .
Asked by an emotional teacher why salaries were so low , Medvedev jovially suggested that if teachers wanted to earn good money , they should go into business instead .
When he was accosted by angry pensioners in annexed Crimea demanding to know why the government had not indexed pensions , he retorted : â€œThere isnâ€ ™ t any money !
But hang in there .
All the best to you , â€ � before walking off .
Such remarks appear newly distasteful in light of the allegations in Navalnyâ€ ™ s film .
If even some of them are true , they suggest Medvedev has amassed a huge empire of property and assets , albeit held by friends and through proxy trusts .
â€œHeâ€ ™ s not Dimon at all ...
heâ€
™ s one of the most corrupt people in the country , â€ � said Navalny in his video .
Medvedev has made no official comment on the allegations .
On Sunday , the day of the protest , he wrote on his Instagram account that his day had been â€œnot badâ€
� as he had gone skiing .
Paradoxically , his position is likely to have been made safe by the wave of protest .
Rumours that his days as prime minister are numbered have been doing the rounds for years , and six months ago there was renewed chatter that Putin could remove him .
But the Kremlin will not want to appear to be succumbing to Navalnyâ€ ™ s agenda .
â€œPutin trusts Medvedev fully , heâ€
™ s a 100 % tested product .
And now , even more so heâ€ ™ s unlikely to fire him
, his position is more solid than ever , â€ � said one of the sources close to the Kremlin ."
2017-04-01,"â€œNobody is scared of going to jail , but we have work to do , â€ � said Kira Yarmysh , spokeswoman for Alexei Navalny , as she waited for the Russian opposition politician to be delivered to court for an appeal hearing on Thursday .
Navalny , who was marched to his hearing handcuffed to a stout police officer , saw his appeal rejected , and will spend the next week behind bars , serving out a 15-day sentence after he was arrested at last weekendâ€ ™ s protest in Moscow , one of more than 1,000 people detained by police in the capital alone .
There were protests in dozens of Russian cities last Sunday , called by Navalny over allegations of corruption against prime minister Dmitry Medvedev .
They were the biggest since a wave of protests in 2011 and 2012 , and for the first time since that wave was crushed there is an air of uncertainty on the Russian political scene .
Navalny , a nationalist turned liberal who has published several investigations into the huge wealth of Valdimir Putinâ€ ™ s inner circle , has declared he wants to run in the election due next March .
Putin is widely expected to stand again , and win another six - year term , which would take him to 2024 and almost a quarter - century of rule over Russia .
But after last weekâ€ ™ s events both the authorities and the opposition have much on their minds .
The Kremlin has to decide whether to launch a crackdown or try to weather the storm , while Navalny and his movement must work out how far they can push the Kremlin .
In the weeks prior to the protest , Navalny toured a number of Russian cities to set up volunteer headquarters to help run his campaign .
â€œWeâ€ ™ re doing everything youâ€ ™ re supposed to do in an electoral campaign , â€ �
he said in an interview before last weekendâ€ ™ s rally .
â€œWe want to force them to allow me on to the ballot.â€
�
Even Navalnyâ€ ™ s own team were surprised at how many people came to the protest , and they now fear that if they organise new demonstrations , which usually fail to receive official permission to go ahead from the authorities , the arrests will continue .
Several organisations are attempting to keep the current wave going .
Some groups unaffiliated with Navalny have called for a protest on Red Square today , while others have called for a repeat of last weekâ€ ™ s â€œstrollâ€ � along Tverskaya , Moscowâ€ ™ s main street .
Mikhail Khodorkovsky , an oligarch living in exile in London , has called for protests on 29 April .
But Yarmysh said Navalnyâ€ ™ s team were most likely to wait until early in the summer before calling another demonstration .
â€œThe problem is that we know that the minute we organise anything , thatâ€ ™ s going to be another 15 days in jail for Alexei , and we want to focus on the pre - electoral campaign , â€ � she said .
On Thursday , the offices of Navalnyâ€ ™ s anti - corruption foundation were still sealed off , after police and plainclothes officers raided them the evening after the protest and were filmed removing computers and other hardware from the building .
Yarmysh said all information about ongoing corruption investigations was stored securely but that the officeâ€ ™ s closure had affected the foundationâ€ ™ s work .
In a nearby office , lawyers and volunteers were helping relatives of those who had been arrested with paperwork and legal advice .
On Thursday , Putin compared the protests in Russia to the Maidan revolution in Ukraine and the Arab spring , both of which the Kremlin has previously characterised as being directed from the west .
The Russian president said he was in favour of fighting corruption but did not address the specific allegations against Medvedev , and made a show of spending the day with his prime minister in the Arctic , making it clear that that job is safe for now .
Medvedev has made no official response to the corruption allegations .
One lawyer defending some of those arrested , who did not want to be named , said police were searching for people involved in the more violent episodes last weekend and could launch a whole range of cases with potentially long prison terms at the end of them .
â€œThereâ€ ™ s a chance that this will end up very serious , and make the Bolotnaya cases look like childâ€ ™ s play.â€ �
After a protest in May 2012 on central Moscowâ€ ™ s Bolotnaya Square , a number of protesters we given lengthy jail terms .
The defining characteristic of the protests last week was the presence of many very young Russians .
â€œThere were children there who were 16 , or even 14,â€ � said the lawyer .
â€œThese kids donâ€
™ t remember Bolotnaya .
I think it was a bit irresponsible to call them out without telling them there was a real chance of being detained or beaten by
police.â€ �
Navalnyâ€ ™ s video about Medvedev has now been watched more than 16 million times on YouTube , and the politician has been successful at winning over a younger audience .
â€œThose under 25 grew up with the internet .
Itâ€ ™ s not that they donâ€ ™ t watch TV , but they watch it differently , â€ � wrote analyst Ekaterina Schulmann in a recent column .
â€œThey find programmes on YouTube , and get their news from social media .
That means the TV propaganda bypasses them by , and even if they listen they donâ€ ™ t understand what theyâ€ ™ re being told , because our propaganda is all aimed at Soviet [ era ] people.â€ � The authorities are fighting back in the classrooms .
Over the past week , a new genre of video has begun to appear online , as students across Russia make clandestine films of their school or university teachers lecturing them on politics .
In Tomsk , one university professor told his students : â€œIf there is no corruption in a state , it means the state is pointless.â€ �
In Samara , students were pulled from lessons to a large hall , where they were shown an educational film about the â€œbloody battleâ€ � that could be about to take place in Russia .
â€œExperts say that all extremists have common characteristics : they have no morals and do not accept social norms , â€ � said the filmâ€ ™ s narrator as footage of Navalny was shown on the screen .
Many of the videos show confident students arguing back against teachers , in a sign that the Kremlin may have its work cut out to silence the new generation of angry Russians .
Discussions have taken place during recent months over whether or not to allow Navalny to take part in the election next year , but while there were some who thought the opposition leader could create a sense of competition without seriously challenging Putin , most in the Kremlin believe him too dangerous to be allowed to run .
In 2012 oligarch Mikhail Prokhorov stood against Putin on a campaign that emphasised liberal values and pro - business policies but offered no direct criticism of Putin .
It is possible that the Kremlin will put up a similar â€œsemi - oppositionâ€ � candidate next year .
â€œThe problem when thereâ€ ™ s no competition is that itâ€ ™ s hard to get people to come out to vote , â€ � said one source close to the Kremlin .
â€œSo they will need to find someone to stand against Putin , but they want someone who plays within particular rules , and knows the limits .
Navalny does not play by any rules.â€ �"
2017-05-24,"The Russian billionaire and Arsenal shareholder Alisher Usmanov has launched an embittered online attack on the anti - corruption campaigner and Vladimir Putin critic Alexei Navalny .
Usmanov , who is currently trying to take full control of Arsenal , last week released an angry , personal video tirade , ending with the words : â€œI spit on you , Alexei Navalny.â€ �
On Wednesday he released a second video entitled â€œI spit on you againâ€ � .
Navalny , who has announced his intention to stand against Putin in presidential elections next year , made a video earlier this year accusing the prime minister , Dmitry Medvedev , of in effect receiving bribes from a number of businessmen , including Usmanov .
Usmanov has promised to take Navalny to court over the bribery allegations , which he denies , and has also begun an online offensive against the opposition politician .
In Usmanovâ€ ™ s first video , which was 12 minutes long , the billionaire spoke in a quiet , calm voice but with undisguised contempt and fury .
He addressed Navalny using the informal Russian â€œyouâ€ � , a mark of disrespect if not used among friends .
â€œOut of the two of us , youâ€ ™ re the criminal , â€ � said Usmanov , referring to Navalnyâ€ ™ s conviction in a court case most observers believed to be politically motivated .
Usmanov owns 30 % of Arsenal , and recently had a $ 1.3bn ( Â£1bn ) bid for control of the club turned down .
The businessman , born in Soviet Uzbekistan , spent six years in jail during the late Soviet period after a conviction he claims was politically motivated and which was later overturned .
In his latest video , Usmanov casts doubt on Navalnyâ€ ™ s claims that the current Russian government is repressive .
â€œYou call out from every street corner that you are being persecuted , that the government is ruthless .
Ruthless ?
You spent a whole day in jail .
One night , as far as I know .
You spent one night in jail , and I spent six years in jail , for nothing.â€ �
In fact , Navalny spent 15 days in jail last month , one of several stints behind bars , after he was detained at a protest rally in late March that drew tens of thousands of Russians to the streets .
Shortly after he was released , he was doused with green fluid by assailants in Moscow and left temporarily blind in one eye .
On Wednesday , a Moscow court jailed two of those detained at the protest for â€œassaultingâ€ � police officers .
One of the protesters was sentenced to eight months in prison , the other 18 months .
The Kremlin is wary of Navalnyâ€ ™ s ability to harness street anger and is unlikely to allow him on to the ballot next year .
When travelling around the country to launch his presidential campaign , he has been insulted and assaulted by people he believes are sent by the authorities .
Usmanov , however , claimed Navalnyâ€ ™ s anti - corruption investigations were born of jealousy .
â€œI feel the terrible envy of a loser and failed businessman , â€ � said Usmanov .
He said he had paid huge amounts of taxes into the Russian budget , and also given a billion dollars to charity .
â€œI bought everything I own , including a lovely boat and a plane , because I live happily , unlike you.â€ �
Usmanov also compared Navalny to Sharikov , a dog that takes on human form in Mikhail Bulgakovâ€ ™ s novel Heart of a Dog .
Navalny immediately posted both of Usmanovâ€ ™ s videos to his own YouTube channel , together with his own commentary on â€œthe richest man in Russia and Britain , oligarch , and beginner video - blogger Alisher Usmanovâ€ � .
Navalny called on Usmanov to debate him , and said the businessman was just one of many people his Anti - Corruption Foundation was targeting .
â€œOur main targets are those who take bribes , but we also want to punish those who give them , like you.â€ �
A Moscow court is due to hear Usmanovâ€ ™ s libel case against Navalny next week ."
2017-06-06,"A Moscow court has dropped charges against the Guardian reporter Alec Luhn who faced a fine or community service after he was detained by police during a reporting assignment .
The charge of â€œviolating the order of participating in a public eventâ€ � came after Luhn was detained by police while covering a protest march in central Moscow on 26 March , organised by the opposition politician Alexei Navalny .
The rally , called in protest over allegations of corruption directed at the prime minister , Dmitry Medvedev , was unsanctioned , meaning police did not give permission for it to go ahead .
Nonetheless , thousands of people marched along Moscowâ€ ™ s main thoroughfare , Tverskaya .
Luhn was detained in a side street shortly after Navalny had been put into a police bus and driven away , amid skirmishes between protesters and riot police .
He was among several people grabbed by police , who began detaining people at random some time after the clashes had subsided .
Police falsely claimed Luhn had been participating in the rally by shouting slogans , and refused to release him even when he said he was a journalist and showed his official foreign ministry accreditation .
After spending several hours in detention , Luhn was released and informed the charges against him would be dropped , but was later summoned to a court hearing .
â€œThis is the first not guilty verdict among all the people brought to court over the 26 March protest , â€ � said Ilya Novikov , the lawyer who represented Luhn in court .
â€œAs of today , we have observed about 800 cases in Tverskoi court , and more than 200 cases in the appeals court , and there hasnâ€ ™ t been one not guilty verdict until now , â€ � said Sergei Sharov - Delaunay of Russia Behind Bars , an NGO that helps prisoners and their families .
While it is standard practice for police to pluck random protesters off the street at unsanctioned rallies , previously journalists have been released without charge .
An estimated 60,000 people attended demonstrations in dozens of cities across Russia on 26 March , an unexpectedly large turnout that alarmed authorities with less than a year remaining until the presidential election next March .
Navalny has declared his intention to stand against Vladimir Putin but is unlikely to be let on to the ballot .
Police detained more than 1,000 people in Moscow alone , most of whom were released without charge or with minor infringements .
Navalny was sentenced to 15 days in jail .
Some have been charged with more serious offences and one man has already been jailed for 18 months .
Luhnâ€ ™ s journalistic accreditation was not enough to stop the charge being brought , but it is possible that diplomatic pressure helped bring about the not guilty verdict .
The British embassy in Moscow has raised the issue privately with Russian authorities and representatives of both the British and American embassies attended the hearing on Tuesday .
Luhn is a US citizen .
Navalny has called another protest for 12 June ."
