2000-04-15,"Hopes that President Robert Mugabe 's Zimbabwe government was seeking a compromise proved premature yesterday when it appealed against a court order to evict thousands of black squatters on white - owned farms .
Mr Mugabe 's party , Zanu - PF , dispelled any lingering optimism by accusing the main opposition party , the Movement for Democratic Change , of treason .
Its leader , Morgan Tsvangirai , who was in London yesterday , rejected the allegation but warned the British government to tone down its attacks on Mr Mugabe or risk turning him into a martyr .
The mood yesterday contrasted with Thursday when the Zimbabwe government indicated that it was ready to try to encourage the squatters to leave the farms and Mr Mugabe named a delegation for land talks in London .
But the attorney general , Patrick Chinamasa , has now said he will appeal to the supreme court against the high court ruling that the police should move the squatters .
"" The police lack the resources to enforce the order , "" he said .
The contradictory signals renewed the uncertainty .
Although there were reports that squatters had left farms yesterday , the Commercial Farmers ' Union , which represents white farmers , insisted that none had gone .
More than 1,000 farms are affected by the invasions and 615 are currently being occupied , according to the union .
The situation yesterday was described as generally quiet , although one white farmer 's son was attacked with bricks .
Mr Mugabe , attending a conference of developing countries in Havana yesterday , kept up his anti - British rhetoric and insisted that the "" acquisition "" of land would continue .
In a worrying development , his government accused the MDC of forming an alliance with the United States , Britain and two South African politicians to sabotage the country and undermine Mr Mugabe , a charge dismissed as "" fantasy "" by the Foreign Office .
The accusation was aired by the Zimbabwe Broadcasting Corporation on Thursday night and printed in full in the state - owned Herald newspaper yes terday .
The minister of information , Chen Chimutengwende , said : "" MDC is both waging a war and preparing for an escalation of that war against the government of Zimbabwe and Zanu - PF . ""
We no longer believe that the MDC is genuinely inter ested in parliamentary elections , because they are concentrating on violence and the preparation of a full - scale military war instead of concentrating on explaining their policies in order to win the minds of the people . ""
This is a war they can not win , nor can they win the forthcoming general elections . ""
Parliamentary elections are due in Zimbabwe and must be held before August , but Mr Mugabe has not yet set a date .
The MDC secretary general , Welshman Ncube , blamed Mr Mugabe 's covert security agency for the treason charge .
We have no doubt it was prepared by the Central Intelligence Organisation , "" he said .
He warned that it might be used by Mr Mugabe to claim that the security of the country was threatened , declare a state of emergency , and arrest the MDC leadership .
Mr Tsvangirai , who is visiting South Africa , Britain and the US in order to build up the credibility of his party , declared : "" There is no MDC - Anglo - American agreement . ""
He also described the illegal take - over of land as "" racism in reverse "" and said that if Mr Mugabe had left government in 1995 he would have gone with his reputation intact , but "" the past five years have been a disaster "" .
Mr Tsvangirai was reluctant to get into a slanging match , however .
"" We must be very careful that we do n't push Mr Mugabe to the extent of being a martyr at this stage , "" he said , "" because that 's exactly what he is looking for . ""
He is history anyway , so why push him to the extent where you are likely to resuscitate his image ? ""
He advised the British government to proceed with caution .
"" They should stop talking about sanctions and give him an honourable avenue out . ""
Mr Tsvangirai met the Foreign Secretary , Robin Cook , and the Foreign Office minister Peter Hain , and urged them "" to tone down condem nations "" .
He said Mr Hain , one of the most outspoken critics of Mr Mugabe , had "" admitted he had been a little bit harsh "" .
Mr Cook concurred with the need for a measured approach to dealing with Mr Mugabe and sought to clarify Britain 's position with regard to funding a land reform programme .
The British government 's offer to hold talks on the issue in London have been presented by the Foreign Office as a move towards achieving a peaceful resolution .
But Mr Mugabe 's government has claimed it as a diplomatic coup .
After meeting Mr Tsvangirai , Mr Cook said : "" I set out our position , that Britain would support a genuine land reform programme which would benefit the rural poor and provide fair compensation to those farmers willing to sell land . ""
But Mr Ncube said : "" We in the MDC are surprised at that particular move by the British government . ""
In our judgment it is unwise to reward the Mugabe government for its actions .
It would be telling the Mugabe government that if you apply terror tactics and use intimidation you get rewarded .
That is what Zanu - PF has been doing on the land issue . ""
The British government is sending signals that it is seeking accommodation , but that will be used by the Mugabe government as a victory for its tactics . """
2000-04-18,"Morgan Tsvangirai , the leader of the main opposition movement in Zimbabwe , says that Robert Mugabe should be offered an honourable way out .
But how ?
Stubborn , oblivious of the damage he is inflicting on his country and the suffering of the individuals caught up in the dramas he has manufactured , Mugabe has paid attention so far neither to threats nor inducements .
He is unfazed by international criticism , by the suspension of aid , or by talk of sanctions .
He treats offers of compromise , like Britain 's expression of readiness to discuss compensation for commercial white farmers after a fair and efficient distribution of land , as concessions which he is under no obligation to match .
Mugabe could have softened his policies on his return from abroad two days ago , as some elements in his government seemed to want him to do , but he chose not to do so .
He has written the script for the next chapter of his political life , and it casts him as a patriotic leader resisting an internal plot led by whites and black traitors and backed by outside forces , notably Britain , determined to destroy Zimbabwe 's independence .
Mugabe 's script is mendacious , in the sense that the coalition between white businessmen , including farmers , and black opposition groups came into being only after his mismanagement of the country and the economy reached an intolerable point .
It is a reaction , not a plot .
But he is right that it represents a threat to him .
It may be that his script still includes a bargain with his opponents , or for compromise with Britain and other international critics .
But only on his terms .
Mugabe still expects to win .
The main reason his "" veterans "" are on the farms is so that they can coerce the farm workers , a fifth of the voters , into casting their ballots for Zanu - PF in the elections that are supposed to be held sometime in the coming months .
One question is whether there are substantial elements in the ruling party who feel Mugabe is taking Zimbabwe in the wrong direction .
After all , most of the opposition originally came from the Zanu - PF fold .
It might be a long wait for such defections , however .
But there is one power that has the means and the prestige to change the situation decisively , which is why the news that President Thabo Mbeki is to make an official visit to Zimbabwe soon could be very important .
South Africa has obvious moral leverage , and , at least in theory , physical leverage , too , in that it supplies most of Zimbabwe 's electricity and fuel .
President Mbeki is the chairman of Commonwealth , which gives him a mandate to start a process of mediation .
Finally , the South African leader has a very strong interest in seeing the land issue in Zimbabwe settled in a moderate way .
If there were to be a wholesale distribution of white - owned farms in Zimbabwe , the impact on the delicate politics of land in South Africa would be enormous .
A quiet South African intervention is the one thing that might persuade Mugabe to accept a package including a withdrawal of all or most of the squatters , British readiness to reconsider the compensation question , a firm date for elections , Commonwealth help in preparing for fair elections , and Commonwealth monitoring of the vote itself .
Given the right impetus by South Africa and others , the Commonwealth Ministerial Action Group , which is due to meet in London at the beginning of May , should be able to set this in train .
Better still , given the dangers , it would be a good idea if a Commonwealth mission including the new secretary general , Don McKinnon , and the Nigerian president , Olusegun Obasanjo , were to go to Harare earlier ."
2000-04-27,"Morgan Tsvangirai may be an unknown quantity in Britain , but he has been a household name in Zimbabwe for years .
Since the early 1990s he has been the leader of the Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions ( ZCTU ) , the organisation that represents the country 's main labour unions .
Once a compliant organisation that took its cues from the Mugabe government , the ZCTU was transformed by Mr Tsvangirai into the leading opposition .
In 1997 and 1998 it held a series of successful national anti - government strikes which brought the country to a halt .
The strikes also brought the wrath of the Mugabe government and in December 1998
Mr Tsvangirai was beaten unconscious by a gang who attempted to throw him out of the window of his 10th floor office .
The perpetrators were identified as supporters of Mr Mugabe 's Zanu - PF party .
Such is Mr Tsvangirai 's popularity that many workers downed tools until they found out whether he would live .
Mr Tsvangirai , 49 , grew up in a large family in the southern area of Buhera .
He went to secondary school but when his father died he went to work in the mines to support his family .
When questioned about his lack of a degree , Mr Tsvangirai shoots back with the retort : "" This government has lots of people with degrees and doctorates , but they are not doing such a good job of running the country . ""
He became involved in union administration and rose through the ranks .
He is credited with being instrumental in forming the National Constitutional Assembly , a coalition of church groups , unions , human rights groups and other civic organisations that pressed Mr Mugabe to draw up a new constitution .
When Mr Mugabe created his own draft constitution to entrench his powers , Mr Tsvangirai led the assembly in a successful campaign to reject it .
He founded the new Movement for Democratic Change , launched in January , which draws on a wide range of Zimbabweans , black and white ."
2000-05-11,"Zimbabwe 's main opposition party , the Movement for Democratic Change ( MDC ) , is considering a national strike , a call for international sanctions and a boycott of the coming election to protest at the unrelenting state - sponsored violence against its members .
Reeling from the killing of 19 members since April 1 , the MDC will hold an emergency national council meeting on Saturday . ""
Faced with this situation of lawlessness and murders against our members , the MDC must consider new strategies , including a possible boycott of the parliamentary elections , mass action and an appeal to the international community for more drastic action , "" said the MDC 's president , Morgan Tsvangirai .
President Robert Mugabe 's ruling Zanu - PF party is facing a strong challenge from the MDC in the parliamentary elections , due by August .
The MDC previously said it would not boycott the elections because the party is committed to change by democratic means .
"" But with this level of government violence against our members , we have now reached a stage where we must review participation in the elections , "" said Mr Tsvangirai .
"" To talk of free and fair elections with this state of affairs , this amount of violence and intimidation , we are just fooling ourselves .
"" A national strike is a very real option for the MDC , with the party drawing support from Zimbabwe 's trade unions .
Mr Tsvangirai , as the leader of the Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions ( ZCTU ) , called three successful general strikes in 1998 and 1999 that brought the country to a halt .
"" What can Mugabe and Zanu - PF do if we just stay at home ? "" said Mr Tsvangirai when asked if a strike would provoke Mr Mugabe to further violence .
"" Obviously our workers are pressing for mass action .
There is no sense in pretending that things are normal . ""
Turning to the possibility of international sanctions , Mr Tsvangirai said : "" So far the international community has acted diplomatically with calls for Mugabe to allow free and fair elections .
We will consider whether we should urge the international community to use more drastic action beyond diplomatic appeals .
Sanctions is one of those options . ""
Mr Tsvangirai said the whole country was suffering from the ongoing state violence .
"" This government has no respect for the constitution , for democratic processes or for the rule of law .
Every Zimbabwean , regardless of race , tribe or belief who does not support Zanu - PF has become an enemy of the state and is threatened with elimination . ""
The state has promoted lawlessness , anarchy and violence to a point where it is now commonplace . ""
He said there was only one way his party could fight back . ""
The answer is that we must compete with the only weapons we have .
These are truth and the people 's determination for democratic change . """
2000-05-12,"The threat by the main Zimbabwean opposition alliance , the Movement for Democratic Change , to boycott the country 's general election is understandable but ill - advised .
Since the ruling Zanu - PF party lost last February 's constitutional referendum , supporters of the MDC have been subjected to an escalating campaign of government and army - orchestrated violence and intimidation which is exceptional even by Zimbabwe 's shoddy democratic standards .
At least 19 people have been murdered , often in gruesome circumstances , and hundreds of others have been beaten or arrested , including the MDC 's leader , Morgan Tsvangirai .
The police have taken special powers to curb rallies and racial tension has been cynically exploited .
Mr Tsvangirai , who has until now adhered firmly to a democratic , non - violent approach and who has urged restraint on Britain , now says that a boycott , plus a campaign of mass civil disobedience and international sanctions may be the MDC 's best course . ""
Faced with this situation of lawlessness and murders against our members , the MDC must consider new strategies , "" he warns .
"" To talk of free and fair elections with this state of affairs ... we are just fooling our selves . ""
With the government still to announce a date for the elections ( due to have been held last month ) , Mr Tsvangirai is clearly running out of patience .
Which , of course , is exactly what President Robert Mugabe wants .
An MDC boycott would hand him an election victory on a plate .
Mass abstentions would not prevent Zanu - PF from claiming a famous victory ( after , no doubt , inflating the returns ) .
A boycott would let Mr Mugabe off the hook from which he has been dangling ever since his government 's egregious economic mismanagement , costly foreign adventures , and blatant corruption finally turned a once loyal electorate against him .
A boycott would render meaningless the plan to send Commonwealth election monitors , who remain the best hope of a free and fair poll .
A call by the MDC for international sanctions would meanwhile enable Mr Mugabe to claim that his opponents are , as he has said all along , the stooges of Britain and the enemies of Zimbabwe .
And strikes and civil disobedience would quite probably bring yet greater , violent repression .
Appalling though the provocation is , Mr Tsvangirai and the MDC must not join Mr Mugabe in abandoning the democratic path ."
2000-06-23,"Robert Mugabe will be out of power within a month and Zimbabwe will have Morgan Tsvangirai , the leader of the Movement for Democratic Change , as its new president , according to Eddie Cross , the prospective finance minister in the new government .
With voters going to the polls tomorrow and Sunday in the most hotly contested parliamentary election since independence , senior MDC leaders have started making the most optimistic predictions .
"" We expect to get over 76 seats which will be a majority in the 150-seat parliament .
We will demand Mugabe 's resignation and are confident the army will support us , "" Mr Cross , a leading industrialist , told the Guardian yesterday .
The economy was in "" meltdown "" , he claimed , and in desperation the government had printed Z$30bn ( £ 500 m ) worth of banknotes since January .
Once Mr Mugabe stepped aside , there would need be no more than a week for nominations followed by a three - week election campaign and a new president would be in power before August .
One of the new government 's first acts to revive the economy would be to devalue the Zimbabwe dollar by about 40 % , in line with demands from commercial farmers .
He predicted that South Africa would play a pivotal role in removing Mr Mugabe .
Zimbabwe relies heavily on South African electricity and has racked up an unpaid energy bill of millions of pounds .
Mr Cross acknowledged that Mr Mugabe , whose term runs until 2002 , had the right under the constitution to appoint a minority government and rule by decree if he lost control of parliament . ""
But it would be tantamount to a coup
and I do n't think South Africa will accept it .
They can cut his electricity and oil at any time . ""
Mr Mugabe has the right to appoint 30 members to the parliament , and only 120 constituencies are being contested this weekend .
If the MDC were to win more than 60 seats but less than 76 , "" Mugabe might try to hang on to power , but we would block his budget , "" Mr Cross warned .
Mr Tsvangirai was less ebullient about the imminence of Mr Mugabe 's departure , but he was confident the MDC ought to win more than half the contested seats . ""
Any result that does not give the MDC a majority will have been seriously rigged , "" Mr Tsvangirai said .
The candidates ' agents as well as independent monitors from local civic groups will be able to stay with the ballot boxes at night on the two polling days to ensure there is no tampering , the government - appointed chairman of the election directorate , Dr Mariyawanda Nzuwa , said yesterday .
However , the MDC has expressed concern about the security of the boxes when they are later taken to the counting centre .
The Legal Resources Foundation yesterday made an urgent application to the supreme court to overturn a ruling that election monitors can not accompany the boxes ."
2000-06-28,"It was the rural vote which saved Robert Mugabe 's face in Zimbabwe 's hotly contested elections , and even Morgan Tsvangirai , the opposition leader , accepted that yesterday .
"" The result was a true reflection of rural people 's views .
We did n't have access to them , and the work we did there before the reign of terror was insufficient .
We did n't have enough time to change attitudes . ""
So , although the opposition Movement for Democratic Change ( MDC ) still insists that intimidation by the ruling Zanu - PF party played a large role , it acknowledges that the party was working in a context which was favourable to it .
Rural people , particularly the middle - aged and elderly who remembered the seven years of war before liberation were ready to accept Zanu - PF 's argument that war could resume if the opposition won .
The line of thinking may not have been logical but the conservative sentiment was there .
Others were swayed by the feeling that Zanu - PF brought liberation from white minority rule in 1980 and to desert it would be a betrayal , not only of the liberation forces but of earlier generations .
Whatever the motives which prompted individuals in the polling booth , Zanu - PF 's sweep through Mashonaland - the heartland of its supporters during the liberation war - was remarkable .
It won all 10 constituencies in Mashonaland Central , 10 out of 12 in Mashonaland West , and 11 out of 12 in Mashonaland East .
Mr Tsvangirai had hoped to break into this territory , which is why he chose to fight in a rural constituency , albeit in Buhera North in Manicaland , another largely Shona area .
"" My national executive advised me to take a safe seat in Harare , but it was my strategy to go out into the rural areas and show that discontent there was the same as in the towns , "" he said .
His decision to take the risk of a rural constituency followed from his analysis of the results of the February referendum , which was defeated entirely on the basis of the urban vote .
Indeed , MDC supporters repeatedly pointed out before last weekend 's vote that their referendum victory by no means guaranteed success in a general election .
They reminded reporters that although the overall total of No votes was enough to reject the draft constitution which had been put to referendum , it was carried in 63 constituencies and defeated in 57 .
The figures bear an uncanny similarity to Zanu - PF 's tally of 62 seats yesterday against the MDC 's 57 .
Government ministers say the referendum 's defeat was a wake - up call for Zanu - PF .
"" We realised we had to start mobilising , and we did , "" one senior party figure said yesterday .
They chose to fall back on their traditional issue , the question of land .
The occupations of farms by war veterans served a double purpose .
It raised the profile of the land issue nationally as unfinished business left over from the liberation struggle , which had brought political independence but not econonomic independence .
The strategy was obviously successful in reminding peasants in the so - called communal areas where no white farmers live ( known in colonial days as the tribal trust lands ) that unfair land distribution was still a key issue .
It must also have had some effect among black farmworkers and other Africans in the so - called commercial farming areas .
In Chinhoyi , for example , where Mr Mugabe held an emotional rally on the last day of the campaign , the Zanu - PF candidate won the seat , though by a relatively narrow margin of 8,176 to the MDC 's 7,602 .
Though this was probably not intended , the land issue had the effect of arousing strong reactions from the British government , especially Peter Hain and Robin Cook .
This allowed Mr Mugabe to claim there was a real danger of a reversion to white rule .
Privately , Zanu - PF ministers were equally angry with the United States , which they rightly believe controls the IMF and the World Bank .
It is these two institutions that have been imposing the main conditions for new loans to Zimbabwe .
They are also furious with the US Senate for passing a Zimbabwe Democracy Act , which supports programmes for aiding opposition - minded civic groups and the non - governmental media in Zimbabwe .
"" We 're being turned into another Iraq or Cuba , "" says Chen Chinutengwende , the information minister .
Finally , the land issue had the benefit for Robert Mugabe of deflecting attention from other issues , such as joblessness , inflation and corruption .
This was what worried urban voters most .
Here Zanu - PF failed miserably .
Every seat in Harare and Bulawayo , the two main cities , went to the opposition MDC .
Zanu - PF also did very badly in Matabeleland , picking up only two out of 15 constituencies , and losing several cabinet ministers ' seats .
To try to win urban voters back in the two years until the presidential elections , Mr Mugabe has promised to bring in price controls on a few basic commodities , bread , mealie meal , milk , and meat .
During the campaign these promises did not win enough people over , perhaps because they did not believe they were practical .
Zanu - PF will have to deliver on its promises now it has won the election ."
2000-06-29,"Zimbabwe 's defeated opposition party , the Movement for Democratic Change , is to take 10 dossiers listing alleged election rigging to the high court .
At its first meeting since failing to win control of parliament in last weekend 's elections , the MDC executive said : "" Disturbing facts have come to light . ""
The dossiers are believed to cover events in Buhera North , where the MDC leader , Morgan Tsvangirai , was defeated by Zanu - PF .
The MDC won 57 seats to Zanu - PF 's 62 in the new parliament .
Even if the court challenges succeed , the change in the number of seats in favour of the opposition will not be enough to undermine Zanu - PF 's grip on power , since President Mugabe has the constitutional right to nominate 30 seats in addition to the 120 contested .
Mr Tsvangirai has ruled out any chance of working formally with Zanu - PF . ""
He [ Mugabe ] must clear up his own mess , "" he said .
With presidential elections just two years away the MDC wants to build on its success in emerging from nowhere in less than a year to challenge Zanu - PF .
It is aware that compromising with Zanu - PF might alienate its supporters and tarnish its image of freshness and honesty .
"" We 've got to guard against being seen to be retreating , "" Mr Tsvangirai said .
He acknowledged this week that Mr Mugabe might try to win some of the new MPs over to his side , with job offers or other inducements .
"" It would be naive to think no individuals will be ready to be co - opted , "" he said .
At its strategy meeting yesterday the MDC also discussed its priorities .
Although it has no hope of promoting legislation , it wants to propose motions in parliament that will keep it in the public eye .
The first is to call for the withdrawal of the 11,000 troops Zimbabwe has in Congo , a deployment which is highly unpopular .
The government has said it will bring the soldiers home only when the United Nations gets its peacekeepers in place .
The MDC also intends to oppose President Mugabe 's plans to introduce price controls on basic foodstuffs to protect the poor .
Mr Mugabe too was meeting his senior colleagues yesterday .
Their agenda was topped by a postmortem on how the party lost so many seats - particularly in the urban areas as well as in Matabeleland .
The election results have reduced Zanu - PF from a national movement to an almost entirely Shona peasant party .
Apart from small segments of the new middle class which have benefited from government patronage by getting civil service jobs or help with their businesses , this is a reversion to the pattern of support found during the liberation war , and it means that Zanu - PF has lost the other constituencies it had tried to cultivate .
The government also gave notice yesterday that it will press ahead with its seizure of 804 white - owned farms .
"" The land issue is on , "" said the minister of information , Chen Chimutengwende , yesterday .
"" The process of acquisition and redistribution could start within weeks . ""
The government had no second thoughts about taking the farms , Mr Chimutengwende said .
Mr Mugabe confirmed last month that the designated farms would be confiscated and resettled by poor black farmers .
He said that since the British government did not pay for the farms , taken from Africans by Rhodesian colonialists , then his government would not pay for the land .
In April Mr Mugabe pushed through a constitutional amendment stating that the government is not obliged to pay for the land and last month it published an enabling law , which gave the farm owners 30 days to appeal against the seizure of their properties , expiring on July 3 . ""
So far I understand no one has appealed , "" said Mr Chimutengwende , indicating that the seizures would proceed smoothly .
But Tim Henwood , chairman of the Commercial Farmers Union , said hundreds of farm owners were preparing their appeals and intended to file them on Friday .
About 500 farmers are expected to seek to keep their farms , while 300 are either not contesting the confiscation or are attempting to negotiate to give up another property in place of the one designated by the government .
The appeals may well be futile , since the government has already stated that there are no valid grounds for appeal ."
2000-10-06,"Zimbabwe 's opposition leader , Morgan Tsvangirai , has warned of a popular uprising against the man he calls the Milosevic of Africa - President Robert Mugabe - if the government carries out its threat to arrest him for treason on his return home this weekend .
Mr Tsvangirai was accused of treason when he called for the violent overthrow of Mr Mugabe if he did not swiftly resign as president .
But , speaking in Johannesburg , the leader of the Movement for Democratic Change ( MDC ) said his detention would provoke a revolution .
"" The mood of the people is so tense that I will not be responsible for the reactions of the people .
We have given Mugabe a warning .
It is clear .
Listen to the people .
The current mood in the country is uncompromising .
A similar situation [ to Yugoslavia ] can not be avoided , "" he said .
"" We must stop Africa 's Milosevic .
There 's no difference between the situation in Yugoslavia and the situation in Zimbabwe .
There are parallels .
[ Mugabe ] has committed genocide against a minority , rigged elections , ignored the rule of law and created a state which is internationally isolated . ""
Mr Tsvangirai made the threat that earned him the prospect of arrest at a rally a week ago to mark the first anniversary of the MDC , which came within a whisker of defeating Zanu - PF in June 's parliamentary elections .
"" What we want to tell Mugabe today is to please go peacefully .
If you do n't want to go , we will remove you violently , "" he said .
Mr Mugabe later told a meeting of his party 's central committee that the British government was working with the MDC to create unrest in the cities , "" in the hope that a Zanu - PF government will capitulate or fall in violent circumstances "" .
The day after his speech , Mr Tsvangirai left on a scheduled trip to Europe and South Africa .
He was due to fly back to Harare on Tuesday but delayed his return after various government ministers called for his arrest .
The speaker of parliament demanded his detention and prosecution for treason .
The police described the "" threat of violence "" as unlawful and said they were prepared to act .
Mr Tsvangirai said he had not intended to use the word "" violently "" and meant "" unceremoniously "" , and that there was no legitimate reason to arrest him for his comments .
"" It was undiplomatic , I must say , but it certainly was n't treason , "" he said .
"" The law can not be applied selectively ; one law for the MDC and another for Zanu - PF .
There have been instances of people threatening to use weapons of war and they have not been arrested .
"" More than 30 people have died in politically related violence in recent months , either during the occupation of white - owned farms or in attacks on MDC supporters .
But there have been no arrests .
Ominously , one of Mr Mugabe 's old - guard supporters , Nathan Shamuyarira , warned that the ruling party would be more than a match for any uprising . ""
The area of violence is an area where Zanu - PF has a very strong , long and successful history , "" he said .
Mr Tsvangirai said Zimbabwe could not afford another two years of Mr Mugabe until the next presidential election .
"" I understand he still thinks he has more to contribute to Zimbabwe .
That state of mind is delusionary .
What he is involved in is the tactics of survival , not a strategy for the survival of the country . ""
But he said that if Zimbabweans wanted change , they should learn from the example of Belgrade and not expect others to do it for them .
"" You can not watch a situation where things collapse in your hands and you expect a miracle to come from somewhere , "" he said .
The government remains defiant .
On Thursday the police shut down Zimbabwe 's first independent radio station , less than a week after it went on air , in defiance of a supreme court ruling .
The high court has ordered the chief of police and his deputy to appear in court on Monday to explain why they should not be jailed for contempt .
The government accused Britain of "" making threats "" to try to stop the move against the radio station .
Mr Tsvangirai said this was further evidence of Mr Mugabe 's desperation .
"" It is an illustration of a government that 's intolerant of opposing views , "" he said .
"" It does not want the space for any mouthpiece other than that which supports Zanu - PF views . """
2000-10-10,"After returning from South Africa and evading police who planned to arrest him on treason charges at the airport , Zimbabwe 's opposition leader , Morgan Tsvangirai , yesterday called on President Robert Mugabe to hold early elections or resign . ""
Mugabe 's term as president lasts until 2002 , but he no longer has the mandate of the people or their support , "" said Mr Tsvangirai , leader of the Movement for Democratic Change shortly after his arrival .
"" He is no longer legitimate .
He should go back to the people and seek an early election , or he should resign .
Otherwise he risks a popular uprising against him . ""
While Mr Tsvangirai kept the pressure on Mr Mugabe , the government increased its pressure on the MDC .
Earlier yesterday , police arrested three MDC members of parliament on charges of inciting violence .
There were angry protests after the arrests and police used teargas to disperse two gatherings of MDC supporters in central Harare .
About 10 arrests were made .
Police had expected Mr Tsvangirai to return to Zimbabwe on a scheduled flight from Johannesburg and waited for him at Harare airport .
But he entered the country by some other means , presumably a charter flight to a smaller airport .
Upon arrival at his home , Mr Tsvangirai spoke with MDC officials and journalists .
Within minutes , he telephoned the police to tell them he was at home and could be arrested there .
By early evening the police had still not come to pick him up .
He was in high spirits after successfully slipping through the security net that police and intelligence services threw up around the airport .
Mr Mugabe 's government has said that it intends to arrest him on treason charges because of remarks he made at a September 30 rally to mark the first anniversary of the MDC 's founding .
"" We say to Mugabe , ' Please go peacefully .
If you do n't we will overthrow you violently ' , "" Mr Tsvangirai said to a deafening roar of approval from more than 20,000 supporters .
He quickly clarified his remarks , saying that he did not mean that the MDC would use violence , but that the people of Zimbabwe would rise up against continued abuses by Mr Mugabe and his Zanu - PF party .
"" I said something unpalatable to Mugabe and to Zanu-
PF , but I do n't think it was illegal
, "" Mr Tsvangirai said yesterday .
"" If the authorities think I have committed a crime , then I must face the due legal procedures .
The people must maintain their cool .
Zanu - PF is trying to provoke the people , so it will have an excuse to unleash more violence and repression . ""
Mr Tsvangirai said the MDC was committed to the rule of law and change by peaceful , constitutional and democratic means .
He said Mr Mugabe "" should be happy that he has a credible opposition that can contain the anger of the people against his misrule "" .
While in South Africa , Mr Tsvangirai said he met former president Nelson Mandela . ""
He still has immense influence .
I asked him to try and encourage Mugabe to retire . ""
Mr Tsvangirai repeated his remarks that Mr Mugabe was "" the Milosevic of Africa . ""
He charged that he had ruined the economy , involved Zimbabwe in a disastrous war in the Congo and had thwarted democracy by rigging the parliamentary elections in June . ""
The only difference between Yugoslavia and Zimbawe is that they are white and we are black .
Our situations are the same , "" Mr Tsvangirai added ."
2000-11-08,"Zimbabwe 's main opposition leader , Morgan Tsvangirai , predicted yesterday that a series of planned demonstrations and strikes would topple President Robert Mugabe within the next few months .
Mr Tsvangirai , who heads the Movement for Democratic Change ( MDC ) , left London last night to return to Zimbabwe .
In an interview with the Guardian , he said the timing for unleashing the demonstrations was still under discussion but that it could be before Christmas . ""
The way the pressure is mounting in the country , people have been urging us to take immediate action .
We are working out our plans .
I do not think we have even three to four months
or we will be overtaken by spontaneous events .
It could be sparked by the lack of payment for civil servants .
Inflation is at a galloping rate .
It may be caused by shortages .
Although Mr Mugabe still has two years of his six - year presidential term to run , his grip on power has been weakened by Zimbabwe 's economic crisis , which many citizens attribute to the government 's involvement in the war in the Democratic Republic of Congo , where some ministers and officers have financial interests .
The result has been steep rises in the price of sugar , bread , transport and other basics and severe fuel shortages .
There were riots last month .
Calling on Mr Mugabe to resign to avoid bloodshed , Mr Tsvangirai said : "" The end for Mugabe is irreversible .
It depends on how it is managed .
He can always opt to complete his term , but that would undermine the economy .
That is impossible .
Or he could accelerate the transition without anarchy .
The response of Mugabe is unpredictable . ""
Mr Tsvangirai was confident that Mr Mugabe , 76 , would go .
He admitted that the strategy was risky and that Mr Mugabe could use force to try to suppress demonstrations but he claimed that Mr Mugabe was running out of options .
The MDC leader has been on a two - week tour of Europe cultivating support .
He saw the foreign secretary , Robin Cook , in London on Monday .
Mr Tsvangirai said : "" The mood [ in Zimbabwe ] is very tense .
We are caught between a restless population and an arrogant government . ""
President Mugabe , he said , "" has been resilient so far but for the first time he is facing the real possibility of losing power "" .
Mr Tsvangirai , who is committed to pulling Zimbabwe out of the Congo war , is making the calculation that the army will not intervene to save Mr Mugabe .
He admitted that lots of officers had become rich from that war , but many others had not and they would not support Mr Mugabe in suppressing demonstrations .
Mr Tsvangirai added that Zimbabwean forces were in a perilous position in Congo , because Zimbabwe 's air force was unable to provide any cover , having run out of fuel .
There has been discussion in Harare about putting Mr Mugabe on trial for human rights abuses .
Mr Tsvangirai said : "" It is unpredictable what would happen after change .
A lot of people would demand retribution but strategically we would be looking at the future rather than the past . ""
Mr Mugabe has threatened to arrest Mr Tsvangirai , but the MDC leader professed not to be worried .
"" I have been personally harassed .
I have been put in jail .
One more arrest will not matter . ""
The former Rhodesian leader Ian Smith returned to Zimbabwe from Britain earlier yesterday , dismissing threats that he would be arrested and echoing Mr Tsvangirai 's call for Mugabe to resign . ""
He must heed calls from his own people because he has destroyed this country .
We can not afford him any more , "" Mr Smith , 86 , told reporters at Harare international airport ."
2001-02-19,"The Zimbabwean government has intensified its assault on opposition and dissent with moves to bar the leading challenger to Robert Mugabe from the next presidential election , new threats to kill white farmers and the expulsion of two foreign journalists , including the BBC 's correspondent .
The ruling Zanu - PF party is trying to block the popular opposition leader , Morgan Tsvangirai , from running for president next year by bringing criminal charges designed to bar him from office .
It is also packing the courts with compliant judges , unlikely to overturn any sentencing on appeal .
While Mr Tsvangirai 's disqualification would be a blow to his party , the Movement for Democratic Change ( MDC ) , it could also prove highly destabilising , given the government 's deep unpopularity and Zimbabwe 's burgeoning economic crisis ; economists warn that it will face a shortage of staple foods within six months .
Harare is also trying to limit the damage to its image overseas .
The information minister , Jonathon Moyo , said the government felt no obligation to abide by a Harare high court decision yesterday blocking the authorities from expelling Joseph Winter of the BBC , and Mercedes Sayagues , who works for the Guardian 's sister paper in Johannesburg , the Mail and Guardian .
On another front , Zanu - PF is trying to force the leaders of the overwhelmingly white Commercial Farmers Union to resign , warning that more farmers will die if they do not side with the government .
The ruling party 's main target , however , is Mr Tsvangirai .
Last week he was belatedly charged with incitement to violence - five months after a speech in which he warned Mr Mugabe that if he did not go peaceably he could be removed by force .
The government claims that the MDC leader was advocating revolution .
Mr Tsvangirai says he was just warning of the likely consequences of an increasingly unpopular president trying to cling on to power at all costs .
The MDC believes that the government waited to charge its leader because it was manipulating the courts to ensure that a conviction would be upheld on appeal .
Earlier this month , Zimbabwe 's justice minister told the country 's independent supreme court judges that their safety could not be guaranteed unless they resigned immediately .
The chief justice bowed to the pressure and quit , but four other judges have refused to step down .
The MDC 's legal affairs chief , David Coultard , sees a pattern in the recent events .
"" It 's quite clearly part of a coordinated plan to make sure [ Tsvangirai ] is convicted and can not run for president , "" he said .
"" If that happens Mugabe will go for an early election . ""
Intimidation has not been restricted to those in the courts and opposition figures , however .
A group of men arrived on the doorstep of Mr Winter , the BBC reporter , at 2 am yesterday , demanding to be allowed into his flat .
Other journalists arrived and scared them away and Mr Winter , his wife and child were given shelter by the British high commission , but their house was later ransacked ."
2001-02-20,"The expulsion orders issued against two foreign correspondents working in Zimbabwe and expected moves to force all others to leave the country are just the latest in a long string of depredations wrought by Robert Mugabe .
After terrorising the farming community , intimidating the opposition and fiddling last summer 's general election , Mr Mugabe is now focusing on his own presidential re - election bid .
His "" campaign "" to date has included attempts to trump up criminal charges against Morgan Tsvangirai , the Movement for Democratic Change 's leader and his main rival , thereby disbarring his candidacy ; the forced resignation of senior judges who challenged his diktats ; renewed rampages by thugs given free rein by Zanu - PF ; and efforts to muzzle the domestic media .
Somebody blew up the printing presses of the Harare Daily News last month .
Perhaps Mr Mugabe might care to say what progress has been made in identifying the person who ordered this attack ?
Perhaps not .
Mr Mugabe believes himself to be above the law .
He is no more interested in impartial justice than he is in bringing peace to Congo or reversing the calamitous fall in living standards that has made paupers of his people .
He appears concerned only with personal power and to that end will do all he can , including calling a snap election to perpetuate his Lear - like misrule .
What is to be done ?
Comradely persuasion , the preferred approach of South Africa 's Thabo Mbeki , has failed .
Some people believe Mr Mugabe is mad and thus beyond the reach of reasoned argument ; others that obsessed with his founding father status , he has forgotten that leadership is a responsibility , not a right .
The freezing of IMF - World Bank support and other such sanctions has not modified his behaviour ; tougher measures , like cutting South Africa 's electricity supply subsidies , would hurt ordinary Zimbabweans most .
There is no safe prospect of a "" people 's power "" revolt while the army and police remain firmly in Mr Mugabe 's pocket .
Outside military intervention is not an option .
In London , the government expresses "" extreme concern "" ; the UN woefully wrings its hands .
Last May , Commonwealth ministers demanded Mr Mugabe uphold democratic rights .
He ignored them then and he will again now .
Big bad Bob , aged 77 this week and still going strong , scorns such impotence and through his unchecked excesses makes all the world his victim ."
2001-02-20,"The United States says it is looking for new ways to punish Robert Mugabe following government threats to the lives of Zimbabwe 's leading judges and the expulsion of two foreign journalists , including a BBC correspondent .
Washington said it was consulting key allies , including Britain , to coordinate measures to get the government to halt its increasingly violent campaign against opponents and what appear to be the first steps toward barring the opposition leader , Morgan Tsvangirai , from running for president on trumped up charges of inciting revolution .
The US has already cut a large proportion of its aid since Mr Mugabe encouraged supporters to occupy white - owned farms and ignored his supreme court 's ruling that the land invasions were illegal .
Britain joined in the international condemnation of the expulsion orders issued against a BBC reporter , Joseph Winter , and Mercedes Sayagues , a reporter for the Guardian 's sister paper in South Africa , the Mail and Guardian .
Zimbabwe 's high commissioner , Simbarashe Mumbengegwi , was called to the Foreign Office to hear a minister , Brian Wilson , protest at the expulsions , the harassment of judges , and the recent bombing that wrecked the presses of Harare 's Daily News . ""
A free press and independent judiciary are essential parts of any democratic society , "" Mr Wilson said .
"" Expelling journalists can not prevent the world from seeing what is happening in Zimbabwe or anywhere else . ""
President Mugabe 's reaction to such protests came in an address to foreign diplomats assembled at State House in Harare : "" We are still the subject of malicious propaganda by external forces opposed to the land reform programme , "" he told them .
"" This is affecting our image abroad . ""
Mr Winter flew to Johannesburg yesterday after a raid on his home late Sunday night by men presumed to be government supporters forced him and his family to seek shelter at the British high commission .
He and Ms Sayagues had won a high court order letting them stay until the end of the week to settle their affairs , but the BBC correspondent said he had decided to leave quickly , fearing for his wife and two - year - old daughter : "" There is just too much pressure and harassment , and it 's not fair for them to go through it . ""
The information minister , Jonathan Moyo , who ordered the reporters out , refused to accept the extension and said he did not recognise the court 's authority .
He has hinted that all foreign journalists will have to leave before long .
But confusingly , a senior BBC TV reporter and camera team from Johannesburg were allowed into Zimbabwe yesterday and given accreditation "" until new regulations come into force "" .
The information minister faces problems of his own : the Ford Foundation filed a lawsuit in Nairobi yesterday accusing him of embezzling $ 80,000 ( then worth £ 51,600 ) when he worked for the charity for four years up to 1997 .
Mr Moyo , who described the charges as "" scurrilous accusations "" , says he in turn is suing the Ford Foundation , accusing it of "" misrepresenting a research project "" in which he participated .
In a further move to intimidate or drive out white Zimbabweans , the government says it will tighten laws barring dual citizenship .
About 20,000 people in Zimbabwe are believed to hold British passports .
Many also hold Zimbabwean citizenship without revealing their British status to the Harare administration .
The current law technically bars dual citizenship , but the supreme court has ruled this impractical because no provision was made for renunciation of citizenship .
The new laws are also going to strip anyone who remains out of the country for five years of their Zimbabwean nationality .
"" There are concerns that those with dual citizenship are behind efforts to discredit the government , "" an official said ."
2001-04-27,"The Zimbabwean opposition won a crucial legal victory yesterday when the high court overturned last summer 's general election results in two constituencies on the grounds that the candidates for the government party , Zanu - PF , secured their victory by violence and intimidation .
If the ruling is upheld on appeal , there will be byelections in Buhera north , where the Movement of Democratic Change ( MDC ) president Morgan Tsvangirai was defeated , and another rural constituency .
During the violence - racked election campaign two of Mr Tsvangirai 's aides died in a firebomb attack by men identified as state agents .
Jubilant MDC supporters mobbed him outside the court after Judge James DeVittie gave his ruling .
"" We are delighted with this ruling .
It vindicates our position to contest the elections in the courts , "" Mr Tsvangirai said .
"" It puts in focus what we have said all along , that the elections were not free and fair .
It also shows the judiciary has not succumbed to intimidation from the government .
We are expecting more victories in other key constituencies . ""
The MDC has challenged 37 other Zanu - PF victories .
"" The people in my constituency are itching for a re - run , "" Mr Tsvangirai said .
Kenneth Manyonda , a senior Zanu - PF official and former provincial governor , and Reuben Marumahoko , whose victories were overturned , remain in parliament until their appeals are heard .
If the verdict is upheld , they will be barred from holding public office or seeking election for five years .
Despite widespread violence , the MDC won 57 of the 120 elected seats in the parliamentary elections last June .
Mr Mugabe 's Zanu - PF has a comfortable majority because the president appoints another 30 members .
Nevertheless , the MDC could gain an absolute majority if it wins 19 of its legal challenges and goes on to win the byelections .
Shortly after the court ruling , the police raided Mr Tsvangirai 's offices and arrested four of his security staff and an office worker . ""
These arrests are sour grapes after our win in the courts , "" Mr Tsvangirai said .
"" It is part of the continuing intimidation that all of Zimbabwe is experiencing . ""
Harare remains in the grip of a wave of violent intimidation of factories and businesses by Mr Mugabe 's "" war veteran "" supporters .
Scores of factories and companies have been invaded and their managers , both black and white , have been beaten up .
The veterans have demanded large payments , on the pretext that they were settling old labour disputes .
Their leader , Chenjerai Hunzvi , said yesterday that his followers would soon invade embassies and international aid organisations to prevent them providing assistance to the MDC ."
2001-05-07,"The accused : Morgan Tsvangirai Tsvangirai , 49 , came to national prominence as a trade union leader .
He transformed the Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions during the 10 years he was its secretary general from a sleepy organisation that allowed the government to define labour issues into the most potent domestic critic of Mugabe .
Drawing on support from the labour movement as well as church groups and human rights groups , Tsvangirai founded the Movement for Democratic Change in September 1999 .
Despite violence which killed 32 MDC supporters , the new party won 57 of the 120 elected parliamentary seats .
Tsvangirai lost his constituency but a court has ruled that election invalid due to the state - sponsored violence during the campaign including the firebombing death of two of Tsvangirai 's top campaigners by men driving a truck marked "" Zanu - PF Manicaland Province "" .
The justice minister : Patrick Chinamasa
In the 10 months he has served as the minister of justice , legal and parliamentary affairs , Chinamasa , 52 , has bullied the chief justice , Anthony Gubbay , into resigning and issued threats to two other supreme court judges , telling them that the government could not guarantee their safety .
In his efforts to rid the judiciary of any independent or critical judges , Chinamasa has become one of Mugabe 's key ministers .
Chinamasa has refused to prosecute a number of crimes committed by government supporters , including the farm invasions and the murders of more than 30 MDC supporters .
The judge : Moses Chinhengo Chinhengo , who is in his mid-30s , has achieved his position as a justice of the high court through diligence and carefully reasoned judgments .
One of a new breed of black judges coming up through the Zimbabwean judiciary , he has a reputation for fairness and even - handed rulings .
In recent months he has delivered two judgments that were unfavourable to the government .
His ruling that Mugabe 's war veterans should be moved off farms they are occupying illegally was cited by the supreme court and by the International Bar Association for its thoroughness and balanced arguments .
He also ruled that the Zimbabwe Independent newspaper was entitled to report on the accusations of fraud being pressed against the information minister , Jonathan Moyo , by the Ford Foundation .
That judgment upheld the freedom of the press ."
2001-05-07,"The Zimbabwean opposition leader , Morgan Tsvangirai , goes on trial today on politically motivated charges of treason designed to prevent him from running for president against Robert Mugabe .
The legal assault on the increasingly cowed opposition comes as the government unleashes a fresh wave of intimidation against its detractors , this time aimed at breaking Mr Tsvangirai 's support in the cities after Mr Mugabe 's "" war veterans "" successfully terrorised the rural areas .
Armed thugs are targeting businesses in an attempt to curb financial backing for the opposition and intimidate workers into supporting Mr Mugabe .
But the prosecution of Mr Tsvangirai is a key component of the government 's strategy to ensure that Mr Mugabe faces no real challenge in an election that should be held within a year .
If the Movement for Democratic Change ( MDC ) leader is sentenced to more than six months in prison , he will be constitutionally barred from running for president . ""
The charges against me are politically motivated to get me out of the way before the presidential elections next year , "" Mr Tsvangirai told the Guardian . ""
The charges go hand in hand with the campaign of terror being perpetrated by Mugabe 's war veterans .
For two weeks factories have been invaded by war veterans but the police have done nothing .
Innocent people have been beaten and killed .
Judges have been threatened . ""
At the time of Mr Tsvangirai 's arrest , the information minister , Jonathan Moyo , accused the opposition of terrorism .
"" It has now become clear that the MDC is the Movement for Violent Change that is interested in bomb and grenade issues , "" he said .
"" It is our duty as government to prosecute any crime that is committed .
It is our responsibility to uphold the rule of law .
No one is exempt from the law . ""
The fact that Mr Mugabe 's more violent supporters are exempt from the law - and are literally allowed to get away with murder in some cases - is a clear indication of the political menace behind the charges .
But whatever the motive for the prosecution , Mr Tsvangirai probably has a case to answer , albeit under oppressive colonial - era security laws that Ian Smith 's white regime used to hold Mr Mugabe for 10 years without trial .
The MDC leader is being tried for terrorism for a remark he made at an opposition rally in September when the party was still buoyant after it came tantalisingly close to winning parliamentary elections three months earlier .
Mr Tsvangirai warned the government that its days were numbered .
"" We say to Robert Mugabe , if you do n't want to go peacefully , we will remove you violently , "" he said .
A few hours later he called a press conference to "" clarify "" that he was not threat ening a rebellion against the president but merely warning that people would rise up if he clung to power .
The prosecution is certain to focus on who Mr Tsvangirai meant by "" we "" .
Immediately before his remark he had been talking about the MDC .
It may be a sign of the government 's confidence that it has allowed a widely respected and independent judge to hear the case .
Moses Chinhengo ruled twice against the government last year over the issues of farm invasions and press freedom .
If he is convicted , Mr Tsvangirai will have to hope for a sentence of less than six months to avoid the constitutional bar on running for president .
The charges carry a maximum of life in prison .
There is another scenario that is almost as bad for the opposition ; that Mr Tsvangirai will receive a lesser sentence but Mr Mugabe will call a snap election while he is still in prison .
The MDC leader 's lawyers say their opening ploy today will be to try to get the case moved from the high court to the supreme court on the grounds that the Law and Order ( Maintenance ) Act is unconstitutional .
Mr Tsvangirai is charged under section 51 , which covers "" terrorism and sabotage "" .
The supreme court remains independent despite Mr Mugabe 's efforts to purge "" disloyal "" judges , white and black .
Zimbabwe 's chief justice , Anthony Gubbay , was forced to take early retirement in March after war veterans threatened to kill him .
But he won an assurance from the government that it would not embark on an immediate purge of other judges .
That has left the four other members of the supreme court in place , all of whom have demonstrated their independence .
Zimbabwe 's highest court may prove Mr Tsvangirai 's best hope .
"" The judiciary is not succumbing to intimidation , "" he said .
"" Judges have been threatened but they are standing up to Mugabe .
I am convinced the court will deliver a fair verdict . ""
The same act is being used to charge the MDC 's vice - president , Gibson Sibanda , and two other party officials for allegedly inflammatory speeches , and to detain four of Mr Tsvangirai 's bodyguards who have been accused of undergoing military training in Uganda .
Whatever the outcome of the trial , the violence against the MDC is likely to escalate as the election draws nearer .
In recent weeks , the war veterans have rampaged through scores of businesses in Harare , beating factory managers and taking them to the offices of the ruling Zanu - PF party to extort large amounts of money in "" compensation "" for dismissed workers .
The British manager of the Avenues clinic , the country 's largest private hospital , went into hiding on Friday after war veterans threatened him .
Armed men also descended on the Spring Steel factory until its 130 workers drove them out .
"" Anybody in industry who does not pay money to the war veterans is in for trouble .
Police give no protection , "" said its owner , Marco Garizio .
The government has also written to foreign embassies threatening the safety of diplomats it said were supporting the opposition .
The degree to which the MDC has been outmanoeuvred , intimidated and cowed could be seen at the opposition leader 's latest rally .
The turnout was poor and almost everyone present left after war veterans marched into the stadium .
Zimbabweans can perhaps draw some comfort from the isolated protest of the industry and trade minister , Nkosana Moyo , an independent , who resigned at the weekend over the attacks on businesses .
But such is Mr Mugabe 's reputation for vindictiveness that Mr Moyo sent his family to South Africa before quitting and then quickly joined them .
For now , with the opposition leader on trial and the war veterans on the streets , many Zimbabweans are more despondent than ever at the prospect of unseating Mr Mugabe and Zanu - PF ."
2001-05-08,"The Zimbabwean opposition leader , Morgan Tsvangirai , won an important first round victory against the government at his terrorism trial yesterday when the high court questioned the constitutionality of oppressive British colonial - era laws used to charge him .
The high court postponed the trial while the supreme court considers whether President Robert Mugabe can even use the notorious Law and Order ( Maintenance ) Act which has been wielded by every Zimbabwean government for four decades to oppress opponents .
If the supreme court strikes down either the entire act or the section dealing with terrorism , it will not only end Mr Tsvangirai 's prosecution but possibly remove an important weapon from Mr Mugabe 's arsenal in his battle with all manner of opponents .
The act has been used to prevent anti - government demonstrations , to try to curb critical journalism and to justify violence against dissenters .
Judge Moses Chinhengo delivered his blow to the government 's case on the first day of the trial : "" It is common knowledge that the Law and Order ( Maintenance ) Act is a piece of colonial legislation that was introduced in 1960 , before this country got a justiciable Bill of Rights in 1980 , "" he said .
"" That historical fact suggests that in the new order , the act will be sorely tested each time it is relied upon by the state to prosecute an individual . ""
No date was set for the supreme court hearing but if it upholds the law , the case will be referred back to the high court .
Mr Tsvangirai is on trial for terrorism , for a remark he made at a rally of his Movement for Democratic Change ( MDC ) party last September warning Mr Mugabe to resign after the opposition came close to winning parliamentary elections .
"" We say to Robert Mugabe , if you do n't want to go peacefully , we will remove you violently , "" he said .
The prosecutor , Nathaniel Sibanda , told the court yesterday that Mr Tsvangirai 's words were an incitement to revolution . ""
The charges are directed at mischief of the highest order , which is calling for the violent removal of a lawfully elected president in a democratic state , "" he said .
But many Zimbabweans see the trial as an attempt to prevent Mr Tsvangirai running for president against Mr Mugabe .
If the opposition leader is convicted and given more than six months in prison he would be barred from high office .
Yesterday , Mr Tsvangirai praised the independence of the judiciary despite attempts by the government to purge the courts of "" disloyal "" judges .
The supreme court is still considered independent with four of its five judges resisting pressure to resign .
The fifth judge - Zimbabwe 's new chief justice - was appointed in March after his white predecessor was threatened until he took early retirement .
Judge Chinhengo said the supreme court should decide whether the two sections of the Law and Order act under which Mr Tsvangirai is charged infringe the right to free speech and the right to be considered innocent until proved guilty .
But the court could scrutinise the entire act if it chose .
It was introduced in 1960 by the British colonial authorities to curb the activities of African nationalists pressing for the then Southern Rhodesia to become independent .
The law was made even tougher by Ian Smith 's white minority regime after its unilateral declaration of independence as Rhodesia .
The white government used the act to jail Mr Mugabe for 10 years without a trial .
Mr Tsvangirai 's lawyer , Chris Andersen , was a minister of justice in the Smith government - although not the one who sent Mr Mugabe to prison .
Yesterday he was challenging the constitutionality of a law he used repeatedly before independence .
Two sections of the act - forbidding public gatherings without a police order and barring journalists from publishing news that might cause "" fear and despondency "" - have already been struck down by the supreme court .
Mr Mugabe 's information minister , Jonathan Moyo , said the government would respect the high court ruling .
"" We respect the institution of an independent judiciary and we look forward to the outcome of the supreme court case , "" he said .
"" It is interesting that so many international journalists came here for this case .
We do not want to see an international media kangaroo court saying there is no rule of law in Zimbabwe .
We hope they do not try to politicise this case .
It is not a politically motivated case , it is a criminal case . ""
But there are few in Zimbabwe who believe that ."
2001-05-30,"Zimbabwe 's opposition has warned that a coup will exacerbate , not resolve , the country 's growing political and economic crisis following the Guardian 's revelation that senior military officers have warned South Africa they may overthrow Robert Mugabe .
Morgan Tsvangirai , the leader of the Movement for Democratic Change , said the history of coups in Africa was disastrous and rarely laid the ground for legitimate governments .
"" Coups are not the answers to our problems , "" he said .
"" Once a country sets itself on a course of coups , it is difficult to re- establish a healthy democracy .
If this report that the army is planning a coup is serious , then the army must be discouraged from doing that .
Political change must come in a constitutional manner , through free and transparent elections . ""
Mr Tsvangirai 's warning came after high level sources in Pretoria told the Guardian that senior army officers in Zimbabwe had secretly warned the South African government that a looming food crisis could prompt the military to seize power if it was asked to put down popular protests .
Pretoria says it has strongly advised against any move to overthrow the Zimbabwean president by force .
The South African sources named the hardline head of the air force , Air Marshal Perence Shiri , as the most likely to lead a coup , giving good grounds for Mr Tsvangirai to fear a military takeover .
Air Marshal Shiri , who commanded the army brigade responsible for the Matabeleland massacres 15 years ago , has been a firm Mugabe loyalist and would only be likely to remove the president because he feared he was jeopardising the ruling Zanu - PF 's grip on power .
The Zimbabwe government yesterday dismissed any possibility that military officers might be plotting against Mr Mugabe . ""
Do n't ask me about stupid things , "" said the information minister , Jonathan Moyo .
"" You guys write stories and then turn around and ask me to comment about these stupid things ...
I will not dignify such trash . ""
The speaker of parliament , Emmerson Mnangagwa , who is very close to the military and widely touted as Mr Mugabe 's successor , laughed when asked about a potential coup .
"" I am hearing this for the first time , "" he said and hung up .
President Thabo Mbeki 's office in Pretoria did not immediately respond .
Western diplomats described the reports of a potential coup as "" pretty credible "" and a "" fair assessment "" , and said that South Africa 's role in the Zimbabwe crisis was fundamental , particularly as far as the economic situation is concerned .
Mr Mugabe , 77 , appears more isolated and vulnerable than at any time of his 21 years in office .
Two key cabinet ministers - defence minister Moven Mahachi and employment minister Border Gezi - have died in car accidents in the past four weeks , and a third , trade minister , Nkosana Moyo , has resigned in protest at the violent invasions of factories by Mr Mugabe 's war veterans .
On a visit to South Africa last week , the US secretary of state , Colin Powell , described the Zimbabwean regime as totalitarian .
Virtually all major western donors have stopped new aid to Harare ."
2001-07-05,"The Zimbabwean opposition leader , Morgan Tsvangirai , said yesterday he had secured pledges from Britain , Europe and the US to provide independent observers for next year 's presidential election , when he will stand against Robert Mugabe .
With seven parliamentary byelections pending , Mr Tsvangirai is anxious for foreign monitors to be present in the coming months to prevent the intimidation of voters .
There were widespread complaints of fraud and violence during last year 's parliamentary elections .
The diplomatic offensive by the leader of the Movement for Democratic Change ( MDC ) has coincided with a two - day general strike by an estimated 3 m Zimbabweans in protest at the government 's recent 70 % increase in fuel prices .
Speaking in London yesterday , Mr Tsvangirai repeatedly distanced the MDC from direct involvement in the strike , but commented : "" Increasing petrol prices [ so much ] has been suicidal .
"" It 's completely insensitive .
If they are going to adjust the prices they should do it in a way people can still afford fuel . ""
In the past week Mr Tsvangirai has been received at the state department in Washington , by the new British foreign secretary , Jack Straw , and by three EU commissioners : Chris Patten , Neil Kinnock and Poul Nielsen . ""
Whereas before people were prepared to listen to the MDC but regard it as a protest movement , now there 's acceptance of the MDC as a political party , "" said Mr Tsvangirai .
Late last month the EU set a two - month deadline for Mr Mugabe to end Zimbabwe 's political violence and interference with the independence of the judiciary , and guarantee freedom of speech .
Industry and commerce remained largely closed on the second day of the national strike , which was called by the Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions as a protest against economic mismanagement .
Although the anti - government strike was peaceful , local residents reported that army units had beaten people in Chitungwiza , Budiriro and Dzivarasekwa .
The government stepped up its campaign yesterday to portray the strike as a failure .
The state - owned Zimbabwe Broadcasting Corporation described the strike as unsuccessful and the work of foreign agents .
The government - controlled Herald newspaper said that thousands of workers tried to go to their jobs but were locked out by white factory owners trying to sabotage the government ."
2001-10-13,"Zimbabwe 's opposition leader , Morgan Tsvangirai , has been attacked by President Robert Mugabe 's followers who smashed all the windows of his car , in an escalation of the country 's state - sponsored political violence .
The attack on Tsvangirai 's motorcade , the latest in a series of incidents of violence and torture in recent weeks , adds urgency to the international campaign to impose travel sanctions and freeze the overseas holdings of Mugabe and his cabinet .
Tsvangirai , head of the Movement for Democratic Change ( MDC ) , said the assault on his motorcade was an assassination attempt . '
It was clear .
What would you say when a group of between 50 and 70 people attack you and almost destroy your vehicle ?
' asked a bruised and shaken Tsvangirai , hours after the assault on Friday .
The attack occurred 12 miles outside the central city of Kadoma where Tsvangirai was travelling to encourage people to register to vote for the upcoming presidential elections , due by the end of March .
Mugabe , 77 and in power for 21 years , is seeking re - election for another six - year term .
Tsvangirai , a popular former labour leader , is posing the biggest challenge to Mugabe 's rule since Zimbabwe became independent in 1980 .
Last year Mugabe 's party won a narrow majority of 62 of the 120 elected seats in parliamentary elections marked by widespread state - sponsored violence . '
We will use any and all means to make sure that Mr Mugabe is re - elected , ' said a top Zanu - PF official of the impending presidential polls . '
If it takes violence , then we will use violence . '
This was the second attack on Tsvangirai 's convoy this year .
On 23 July , Tsvangirai 's motorcade was attacked by Zanu - PF youths in the run - up to a parliamentary by - election .
Tsvangirai said the new attack was a clear violation of the Commonwealth 's Abuja agreement in which the government promised to restore the rule of law .
He alleged that police knew of the attack but took no action to stop it . '
The international community should note that the Abuja agreement was a smokescreen to hoodwink them into believing that law and order would be restored in the country , ' he said .
He urged the Commonwealth to take steps to hold Mugabe to the promises he made in the agreement .
In another violent incident , six MDC members were tortured for two days last week by Zanu - PF supporters who beat the soles of their feet with iron bars and held them over a fire causing burns to their bodies .
The victims said they were told their torture was the launch of the presidential election campaign .
Since the Abuja accord , more than 30 new farms have been invaded by Mugabe 's followers , according to the Commercial Farmers ' Union .
The invasions have been accompanied by numerous acts of violence .
The attack on Tsvangirai is expected to boost the campaign to press Mugabe to stop violence and allow free and fair democratic elections .
A new report , by the International Crisis Group , urges that travel sanctions and a freeze on overseas assets should be imposed against Mugabe , his cabinet and their families .
The report , ' Zimbabwe : Time for International Action ' , warned that the postponement of the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting following the 11 September terrorist attacks in the US should not allow President Mugabe to believe that because the world 's attention is distracted he is free to continue violent repression in his country .
The first forum to consider such action against Zimbabwe 's leadership will be a meeting of European Union Foreign Ministers on 29 October .
The European Parliament passed a resolution on 6 September that calls for ' visible and tangible action ' on President Mugabe and his close associates ."

2001-12-14,"Zimbabwe 's main opposition leader was arrested by police in a dawn raid on his Harare home this morning and questioned over the use of a two - way radio by one of his bodyguards .
A spokesman for Morgan Tsvangirai 's party , the Movement for Democratic Change ( MDC ) , said the arrest was the "" the latest in a series of instances of harassment and intimidation of the opposition "" ordered by the ruling Zanu - PF party .
Mr Tsvangirai will face the Zimbabwean president and Zanu - PF leader , Robert Mugabe , in presidential elections in March .
He poses the single largest challenge to Mr Mugabe , 77 , who has ruled since independence in 1980 .
"" All these incidents are part of Zanu - PF 's campaign strategy .
They are carefully designed to dampen the spirits of the MDC president in the run up to the historic poll and throw his programme off course , "" the spokesman said .
Mr Tsvangirai 's wife , Susan , said eight police , including uniformed officers with automatic weapons , raided the house .
Her husband was held for four hours and questioned by police demanding a licence for a walkie - talkie before being released without charge .
Some personal radios need to be approved and licensed by the state telecommunications company but the spokesman said that the bodyguard 's model was exempt .
Infringements are considered a minor offence carrying a small fine .
Three MDC security guards were also detained , evidently also in connection with a personal radio .
The incident comes a day after Mr Mugabe threatened to crack down on the opposition and its backers , among whom he counts six foreign journalists , including the Guardian 's correspondent in the country .
He accuses them waging a campaign of political violence and terrorism .
"" Violence is not just happening , it in fact has been deliberately hatched at the centre of the MDC and by its patrons and principals overseas , "" he said .
"" This is a real physical fight and we have to prepare for it . ""
According to the independent Zimbabwe Human Rights Forum , 31 out of the 41 people have died this year in political violence were opposition supporters .
The present crisis began when ruling party militants began illegally occupying white - owned farms .
The pro - Mugabe "" war veterans "" have set up bases across Zimbabwe which they are using as intimidation centres , the Forum said this week in a report ."
2001-12-15,"Zimbabwe 's opposition leader , Morgan Tsvangirai , was detained by police for more than four hours yesterday after a dawn raid on his home , as political tension mounted with the start of the presidential election campaign .
President Robert Mugabe , who branded the opposition leader and his party "" a terrorist force "" yesterday , is lagging behind Mr Tsvangirai in opinion polls ahead of the March election .
Police arrested Mr Tsvangirai at his Harare home at 4:30 am and held him until 9 .
They said it was in connection with a walkie talkie radio seized there the day before .
The radio was "" like a child 's toy that can be bought at a supermarket "" , said an official of Mr Tsvangirai 's party , the Movement for Democratic Change ( MDC ) .
Police said the intercom set should have been registered .
"" I hold President Mugabe responsible for this , "" said Mr Tsvangirai .
"" This incident shows that the government has a complete disregard for political tolerance .
This was a clear case of political harassment of the worst order . ""
This latest incident should show the local and international community that there is no rule of law in the country . ""
Mr Tsvangirai , who has survived three violent attacks by Mr Mugabe 's supporters , said his was a law - abiding party , adding : "" We will not be provoked into violence by anyone . ""
But Mr Mugabe insisted yesterday that Mr Tsvangirai and the MDC were bent on spreading terror throughout Zimbabwe .
Speaking at the opening of the annual congress of his ruling Zanu - PF party in Victoria Falls , Mr Mugabe said : "" We must be prepared for a physical fight .
We have seen the enemy 's capacity for evil and murder .
Our youths should rally behind us in defence of our independence . ""
Mr Mugabe attacked Britain for trying to thwart his programme of land seizures and he accused it of plotting international sanctions against Zimbabwe . ""
The British were brought up as a violent people , liars , scoundrels and crooks , "" said Mr Mugabe .
"" I am told that Blair was a troublesome little boy at school .
So we can not have reasonable dialogue with such people . """
2001-12-16,"President Robert Mugabe urged his supporters yesterday to go to war against Zimbabwe 's opposition Movement for Democratic Change .
At the same time his police again detained the MDC leader , Morgan Tsvangirai , over charges of having an unregistered walkie - talkie radio . '
This is total war , ' said Mugabe at the close of his Zanu - PF party congress in Victoria Falls . '
We will have a central command centre .
This is war , it is not a game .
You are all soldiers of Zanu - PF for the people .
When we come to your province we must see you are ready .
When the time comes to fire the bullet , the ballot , the trajectory of the gun must be true . '
Even as Mugabe was speaking , police arrested Tsvangirai and charged him with the relatively petty offence of having an unregistered two - way radio .
It was the third police raid on Tsvangirai in as many days . '
They say that I broke the Telecommunications Act , which says that I must have a licence , ' Tsvangirai told Reuters by telephone from Harare 's central police station , where he was giving a statement to police . '
I do n't understand why I am being charged as an individual because it [ the radio ] does not belong to me , it belongs to the party , ' he said .
He was later released on bail .
Mugabe 's fresh threats of violence against the MDC and the harassment of Tsvangirai have deepened the repressive atmosphere that already permeates the country .
Lagging behind Tsvangirai in opinion polls , Mugabe is determined to use all means to stay in power .
Taken with a raft of new oppressive Bills to be pressed through Parliament this week , Mugabe 's bitter invective has made Zimbabwe decidedly anxious , rather than festive .
Returning to Zimbabwe after being branded a terrorist by the state media , I was somewhat apprehensive , not only about what would happen to me but also about the state of the country that I have made my home .
I was struck by the fact that my concern was matched and often outstripped by the anxiety of ordinary Zimbabweans who are worried about the escalating climate of antagonism .
Ordinarily the weeks before Christmas are a particularly fun time , with seasonal rains giving everyone hope for a good agricultural crop in the coming year and the markets brimming with ripe tropical fruits and vegetables .
But this year people 's spirits have not been buoyed by good rains or the abundance of fresh maize and mangoes . '
No one has a holiday mood , ' said Mabel Mushava ( not her real name ) . '
How can we ?
Our Christmas bonuses have been eaten up by inflation .
We ca n't travel freely to our kumushas [ rural homes ] because the militias and war veterans are out there beating and intimidating people .
We ca n't pick up a paper or turn on the radio without getting hateful messages .
We ca n't think of the New Year without worrying about violence in the election campaign .
This is a miserable time . '
Zimbabwe 's Parliament is due to consider new legislation that paints a grim picture of the shape of things to come .
The Public Order and Security Bill was published in the government gazette on Friday and is expected to be pushed through Parliament this week .
It is widely considered to be as repressive as the old Rhodesian legislation that it is replacing .
Several amendments to the Electoral Act are set to be voted on , including measures to bar any non - governmental organisation from carrying out voter education , to ban any independent election monitors and to restrict international observers .
Yet another amendment will prevent the estimated one million Zimbabweans living out of the country from voting , except for those in the military and diplomatic corps .
The Mugabe government has also issued a new Bill to govern the press , which media experts consider one of the most repressive in the world .
All journalists operating in the country must get a government licence for which only Zimbabwean citizens are eligible .
The Bill threatens jail and heavy fines and is clearly designed to muzzle the critical independent press , both domestic and foreign .
With such heavy - handed legislation , the Mugabe government is giving the country a few lumps of coal in its stocking .
All these Bills could be passed next week .
Recently the government has shoved Bills through by having all three readings in one day . '
I 'm not making any New Year 's resolutions .
What 's the point ?
' asked a Zimbabwean businessman . '
Until the elections are held in March , we do n't know what future this country has .
After that we will know whether things are going to get better or if they are going to just continue on this frightening freefall .
Then I 'll make my resolutions about what to do . '"
2001-12-23,"Zimbabwean opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai yesterday welcomed the imposition by the United States of limited sanctions against President Robert Mugabe . '
We do n't want sanctions against the country .
We want sanctions against the perpetrators of violence , of which Mugabe is the captain , ' said Tsvangirai to cheers from thousands of delegates at the first annual congress of his party , the Movement for Democratic Change .
He said the MDC would remain firm in its opposition to Mugabe 's government , even though the party is suffering considerable state - sponsored violence .
The congress endorsed Tsvangirai to run against Mugabe in the presidential elections in March .
President George Bush signed into law on Friday the Zimbabwe Democracy Act which restricts Mugabe , his cabinet and their families from travelling to the US and freezes any financial assets they hold there Mugabe criticised these measures and blamed the ' mad British Government ' for the Commonwealth 's decision to put the possible suspension of Zimbabwe 's membership on the agenda of its forthcoming conference .
The Commonwealth Ministers repeated their concerns about Zimbabwe 's continued violence , occupations and intimidation of the media , which they said violated the body 's fundamental values .
An Amnesty International report published last week harshly criticised the Mugabe government . '
The situation in Zimbabwe is getting worse day by day as the presidential elections draw nearer , ' it said ."
2002-01-05,"Zimbabwe civil war claim Morgan Tsvangirai , head of the Zimbabwean Movement for Democratic Change , said the country was heading towards "" a low - intensity civil war "" because of violence by President Robert Mugabe 's party youth militia , which he said had killed four members of the MDC in the past 10 days .

2002-01-31,"A locomotive pulling numerous carriages is speeding down the track .
A helpless heroine - symbolising in this case , the Zimbabwean electorate - has been roped to the railway line .
A shootout is under way between the "" bad "" guys - President Robert Mugabe , Zanu - PF hardliners and hand - picked army generals , and the so - called war veterans - and the good guys - the Movement for Democratic Change led by Morgan Tsvangirai , the trade unions , and what remains of the independent judiciary and media .
The train comes racing round the bend and bears down on the struggling victim .
Its whistle blows .
The engineer slams on the brakes but it is far too late to stop .
Will her gallant would - be rescuers be able to cut the distressed damsel free in time ?
Or will her cruel abductors succeed in getting their wicked way ?
For those who can bear the suspense , all will be revealed in the polls due on March 9 - 10 .
But many in Britain , the former colonial power in what was once Rhodesia , in the chancelleries of western Europe and in the US state department and Congress already think they know the ending .
Barring some big , unforeseen upset , Mugabe will fiddle and intimidate and bully his way to another presidential term - in just the same way as he secured victory in the last parliamentary elections two years ago despite a big swing to the opposition .
If grasping that victory means a further increase in violence and torture , Mugabe is apparently quite prepared to take that step .
If it means yet more seed and grain seizures on white - owned farms , at a time when famine already threatens large swathes of the country , he will do that , too .
If the price of victory is shutting down the free press , barring foreign journalists , excluding international election monitors , and defying critics within his own party who say he has gone too far , Mugabe is ready to pay it .
And there is , it seems , precious little that a watching world can do to stop him .
Perhaps the train wreck can somehow be averted .
Some kind of last minute reprieve is certainly to be hoped for .
But it is just a hope - for Zimbabwe has become , in one sense , a salutary and sobering reminder that the powers of the "" international community "" can be vastly overestimated .
Among those likely to be left with egg on their faces are the following : Britain Former foreign secretary Robin Cook and his junior minister , Peter Hain , tried berating Mugabe , cutting off arms sales , and curtailing government - to - government aid .
Mugabe said they had a colonial era complex and ignored them .
Cook 's successor , Jack Straw , tried negotiation in Abuja , Nigeria last year but was subsequently fobbed off .
This week he vowed to put Mugabe "" on the spot "" .
But his efforts to date have done little or nothing to head off the impending theft of the election .
The Commonwealth
Despite its commitment to uphold democracy embodied in the 1991 Harare Declaration and despite several meetings of the Commonwealth ministerial action group and its organisation of the Abuja talks , the Commonwealth has been exposed as largely powerless to act .
At a meeting in London this week , CMAG snubbed Straw by ignoring his appeal to suspend Zimbabwe from Commonwealth councils , preferring instead to deliver yet another verbal slap on the wrist .
The European Union Much is made these days of the EU 's common foreign and security policy - but Zimbabwe has demonstrated that such a joint policy exists in theory more than in practice .
Last year , Mugabe was received at the European commission in Brussels and by President Jacques Chirac of France , much to Britain 's disgust .
Earlier this week , EU foreign ministers finally agreed to impose collective sanctions if Mugabe did not allow elections monitors to enter the country .
But the sanctions relate only to foreign travel and assets held abroad by Zimbabwe 's ruling elite - and they have had plenty of time to forestall and minimise their impact .
Even if enacted , the sanctions will make no difference to the conduct of the polls .
South Africa President Thabo Mbeki has in theory the most to lose if Zimbabwe implodes into civil war , with resulting mass movements southwards of hungry refugees .
Yet despite Zimbabwe 's huge debts to South Africa and his country 's control of Zimbabwe 's power supplies , Mbeki has consistently failed to exert decisive pressure on Mugabe .
Although the two leaders are said not to like each other , Mbeki appears loath to put the squeeze on a man who was once an icon of the African liberation movements .
In similar vein , neighbouring countries of the Southern Africa Development Community have proved to be both toothless and divided when it comes to bringing Mugabe into line .
The United States Over the years the US has spent millions of dollars in aid to encourage developing country democracies , including Zimbabwe .
But as a recent Carnegie Endowment study points out , progress has been painfully slow .
In Zimbabwe , the process has clearly gone into reverse .
But other than some sharp remarks by secretary of state Colin Powell during a recent visit to South Africa , and apart from threatening sanctions similar to those envisaged by the EU , the US has also been forced to look on impotently .
The United Nations No effective pressure has been brought to bear on Mugabe via the UN , even though it is the UN 's World Food Programme that may have to pick up the pieces if , as expected , food shortages following the farm seizures become endemic .
The UN secretary general , Kofi Annan , who hails from West Africa and has championed good governance in the continent , has good reason for despondency .
Looked at all round , it is a sorry record of failure .
And even if , somehow , the damsel on the railway line springs free from her shackles at the last moment and the "" good guys "" win the day , Zimbabwe over the past two years has become a memorable object lesson .
The lesson is that when it comes to taking on a canny , stubborn and ruthless old autocrat like Bob Mugabe , the "" international community "" is still more of a diplomatic concept than an active force for change ."
2002-02-02,"Zimbabwe 's President Robert Mugabe kicked off his re - election campaign yesterday by attacking his main opponent , Morgan Tsvangirai , as "" a puppet of Britain "" .
Swooping into the rural crossroads of Mutawatawa in his white presidential helicopter , escorted by two army helicopters , he greeted a crowd of 8,000 supporters at Murewa , in the north - east , the heartland of support for the ruling Zanu - PF party .
Mr Mugabe drew a supportive but muted response from the crowd in his 30 minute speech , which concentrated on attacking Britain even more than Mr Tsvangirai , the leader of the Movement for Democratic Change . ""
Tsvangirai is masquerading as a white man , "" Mr Mugabe said .
"" He is a puppet from Britain , a front for Britain . ""
Later he said : "" We are in a state of war against the British government .
Britain wants to topple this government .
They want to give the land back to the whites . ""
Mr Mugabe said his government would never abandon its seizure of white - owned farms .
"" The people will benefit , "" he said .
At one point , when community elders made a presentation to Mr Mugabe , they complained that the roads in their area were bad .
He blamed that , too , on his "" conflict with Britain "" , before flying off to a similar rally in another rural centre , Mudzi .
Mr Tsvangirai can not campaign in rural areas , due to widespread violence against his party .
Nor can he criticise Mr Mugabe , as a new security law makes it a criminal offence to make derogatory remarks about the president , the police or the army .
Mr Tsvangirai is set to hold his first rally on Sunday in the eastern town of Mutare , near the border with Mozambique .
He has already denounced the campaign conditions as "" unfree and unfair "" .
The MDC has been barred from campaigning in large areas of central Mashonaland province and the Gokwe , Zaka and Bikita districts because pro - Mugabe militants have set up roadblocks , Mr Tsvangirai said .
"" The mention of ' MDC ' carries with it a death sentence , and that is what the people in these areas have to endure , "" he said .
The MDC alleges that 100 of its supporters have been killed in politically motivated attacks , while hundreds of thousands more have been beaten .
The US secretary of state , Colin Powell , and the British foreign secretary , Jack Straw , strongly condemned the government 's tough new media bill yesterday after a meeting in Washington , where they discussed possible punitive measures against Zimbabwe .
"" I find it almost impossible to comprehend how free and fair elections can be held in Zimbabwe when such laws have been passed , "" Mr Straw said , adding that the law would influence the EU 's decision on the imposition of sanctions .
On Monday , EU foreign ministers gave Zimbabwe until February 3 to accept observers for the polls or face sanctions , including a suspension of aid , travel bans and the freezing of the assets of Mr Mugabe and 20 others in his inner circle .
Mr Powell echoed Mr Straw 's remarks and pointed to his own past criticism of Mr Mugabe , adding that Washington was "" in close coordination with our British colleagues and with others as to what action might be appropriate as we move forward "" .
Despite mounting criticism from western countries and human rights groups , Mr Mugabe 's neighbours have taken a softer tone and sometimes voiced support for him .
A taskforce from the 14-nation Southern African Development Community reiterated its opposition to sanctions on Mr Mugabe after a two - day meeting in Harare .
Malawi 's foreign minister , Lilian Patel , who heads the taskforce , said:""The way some media reports about Zimbabwe is very bad , because they create an impression which makes one think that the country was full of thugs and unsafe . """
2002-02-04,"The Zimbabwean opposition leader , Morgan Tsvangirai , has faced down senior military officers who have threatened a coup if he wins next month 's presidential election , by saying that he will sack them .
Last month , the army high command said it would not recognise any government that did not adhere to the aims of the "" revolution "" , and that any president was confined to a "" straitjacket "" , taken to mean that he could not pursue policies the military does not like .
The opposition Movement for Democratic Change has until now avoided direct confrontation with the military , but at the launch yesterday of his campaign for the March 9 and 10 election , Mr Tsvangirai told supporters that he would sack army officers who did not have "" the professional integrity to respect your vote "" .
The MDC candidate has further angered the military leadership by pledging to pull 10,000 Zimbabwean troops out of the Democratic Republic of Congo .
It would be a popular move with the rank and file who do the fighting , but senior officers and ruling party officials have grown rich from mining and other contracts since the military intervention in Congo .
"" When we come to power , we will plan an orderly withdrawal from the Congo war where our men are dying and our dollars are being wasted , "" Mr Tsvangirai said .
At an election rally at the weekend , President Robert Mugabe focused on two favoured targets : Britain and gays .
He accused Tony Blair of trying to overthrow him because of the president 's opposition to homosexuality , and said that the British cabinet was "" full of gays "" .
"" I have people who are married in my cabinet .
He has homosexuals and they make John marry Joseph and let Mary get married to Rosemary , "" Mr Mugabe said on Saturday .
"" We are saying they do not know biology because even dogs and pigs know biology .
We can form clubs , but we will never have homosexual clubs .
We will punish them . ""
Mr Mugabe has repeatedly attempted to portray the MDC as a British - funded front for white interests .
Mr Tsvangirai responded by accusing the president of reducing the country to anarchy in a desperate bid to hang on to power .
"" There is anarchy in our country .
Is there a person here who has not been affected by violence and beatings ?
I promise there will be law and order , "" he said .
Mr Tsvangirai urged his supporters not to seek revenge for the widespread political violence by the ruling Zanu - PF party .
Residents in Mutare had reported that they were threatened with beatings and even death if they attended the opposition rally .
The threats reportedly came from Zanu - PF officials , who went from door to door , escorted by police officers .
Mr Mugabe is due to sign into law a repressive press bill which was finally passed by parliament last Thursday and which critics say will stifle criticism of the regime during the election campaign .
The bill provoked a public split in Zanu - PF .
The European Union is due to announce today what measures it will take to encourage free and fair elections ."
2002-02-06,"Zimbabwean police released the journalist Basildon Peta yesterday after the attorney general 's office refused to prosecute him for planning a protest against the government 's harsh new press law .
The incident comes just five weeks before the presidential election in which President Robert Mugabe faces the stiffest challenge in his 22 years in power from Morgan Tsvangirai , leader of the Movement for Democratic Change ( MDC ) .
Mr Peta , a reporter for the Independent in London and secretary general of the Zimbabwe Union of Journalists , was held overnight and his home ransacked twice by police , who have sweeping powers under the new Public Order and Security Act .
Police blamed Mr Peta for organising the demonstration last week in which 60 journalists stood with gags and anti - government placards in front of parliament .
The draconian security law states that police must be given four days ' notice before a public gathering is held .
Mr Peta 's lawyer secured his release by showing authorities a clause that exempts professional organisations , such as groups of journalists or lawyers , from having to give police notice of a gathering .
Police were well aware of the clause because it was used last week to win the release of three journalists arrested at the demonstration .
"" They knew very well they would have to release me and drop the charges , "" said Mr Peta .
"" It was clear they knew of the clause about professional bodies . ""
They just wanted to harass me and demoralise me by keeping me in their filthy conditions .
They can not intimidate me .
Journalists in Zimbabwe are standing together and they can not stop us .
""
The arrest and release of Mr Peta is the latest in a pattern in which several journalists and editors have been jailed and released without charges .
In the worst case , two years ago , two Zimbabwean journalists were abducted and tortured by government agents before being turned over to the police .
Despite identification of the perpetrators , no one has been arrested .
Although the Mugabe government has promised the European Union it will allow free press coverage of the election campaign , Mr Peta 's ordeal indicates the press in Zimbabwe will continue to be restricted .
Britain 's foreign minister , Jack Straw , warned yesterday that Mr Mugabe 's government risks losing international recognition if next month 's elections are not judged to be free and fair .
Speaking to MPs , Mr Straw said : "" If we believe , not withstanding the admission of observers and their report , that the elections have not been conducted in a free and fair way then yes , withdrawal of recognition of that government is a possibility . ""
EU diplomats meeting in Brussels to discuss the crisis yesterday said the Zimbabwean authorities were not preventing the deployment of election observers and said a six - member advance team would be ready by February 9 .
The EU team , led by a senior Swedish official , is expected to grow to 30 over the next couple of weeks and to the full strength of 150 by polling day on March 9 .
EU foreign ministersagreed a week ago to impose "" smart sanctions "" on Mr Mugabe and 19 associates if Harare prevented deployment of the observers .
Sanctions could also be imposed at any time if the observers ' work is hindered , violence continues or free media access is prevented .
Political violence has continued to spread in Zimbabwe , with followers of Mr Mugabe 's Zanu - PF party accused of beating to death three MDC officials .
Another MDC member remains critically ill in a Harare hospital and four others are missing after being reportedly abducted over the weekend .
Two MDC officials were reportedly shot at and stopped by agents of the Central Intelligence Organisation ( CIO ) .
They both escaped unhurt but their car was torched , said the MDC secretary general , Welshman Ncube ."
2002-02-13,"An Australian television documentary will today allege that Zimbabwe 's opposition leader , Morgan Tsvangirai , was involved in a plot to assassinate his rival , President Robert Mugabe , before next month 's election .
The SBS Dateline documentary will broadcast surveillance video footage purporting to show Mr Tsvangirai , the leader of the Movement for Democratic Change , agreeing to the "" elimination "" of Mr Mugabe before the ageing president goes to the polls in Zimbabwe on March 9 and 10 .
Mr Tsvangirai dismissed the charges yesterday .
"" It is a crude smear campaign against me .
They are ridiculous charges and there is no truth to them , "" he said .
The grainy video allegedly records a December meeting between Mr Tsvangirai , two unidentified men and a Canadian firm of political consultants in Montreal .
Referring to Mr Tsvangirai 's presence , one of the Canadian company 's employees says in extracts released yesterday : "" The MDC , represented by the top man who 's sitting here right now , commits to - let 's call it ... the coup d'etat or the elimination of the President . ""
"" Do coffins win elections ? "" asks one of the Canadians . ""
OK , Mr Mugabe is eliminated .
Now what ? ""
another participant in the meeting later asks .
"" Are you in a position basically to ensure a smooth transition of power ? ""
The man the documentary identified as Mr Tsvangirai replies : "" Yes .
I 've no doubt about it . ""
He adds later : "" We can now definitely say that Mr Mugabe is going to be eliminated . ""
The documentary will also reveal alleged evidence that a British company attended two meetings with Mr Tsvangirai and the Canadian firm .
Interviewed on the programme , Mr Tsvangirai denied that the MDC was plotting to assassinate Mr Mugabe . ""
Why should we ? "" he said .
"" He is a 78-year - old man .
We have no reason whatsoever to make any harm to him . ""
Mr Tsvangirai said he was surprised that a reputable journalist would fall for "" such obvious propaganda "" ."
2002-02-14,"The man behind claims that the Zimbabwe opposition leader , Morgan Tsvangirai , was involved in a plot to kill President Robert Mugabe has a reputation as a notorious fantasist , it emerged last night .
Ari Ben - Menashe , who was once employed as a junior officer in Israeli intelligence , claimed that his Montreal - based firm , Dickens and Madson , was approached last year by someone acting on behalf of Mr Tsvangirai to help the Zimbabwe opposition party , the Movement for Democratic Change .
Mr Ben - Menashe described the firm as a "" political consultancy "" and "" lobbyist "" and said he had known Mr Mugabe for some time .
In a statement last night , the company said its senior staff had "" extensive contacts "" with "" intelligence agencies around the world "" .
An Australian television network , SBS , broadcast a grainy video last night purported to be of a meeting between Mr Tsvangirai , Mr Ben - Menashe and other company officials in Montreal last December .
It suggested that those present discussed how to remove Mr Mugabe from power .
Last night , Mr Tsvangirai called the tape "" contrived "" .
"" There is no substance to the allegations , "" he said .
"" It is a smear job .
I had discussions about different scenarios that might happen in Zimbabwe .
I have discussed how the transition to democracy will go if I am elected .
The quotes could easily have been manipulated to be taken out of context . ""
Mr Ben - Menashe , said he met Mr Tsvangirai twice in London last November .
He said the opposition leader did not know the Montreal meeting was being videotaped .
Asked how SBS got hold of the video , he replied : "" That is neither here nor there . ""
Mr Ben - Menashe met diplomats in Harare more than two years ago , indicating that he had business with the Mugabe government long before the video was shot .
The film - maker , Mark Davis , arrived in Zimbabwe in January on a tourist visa , without journalist accreditation , but then managed to get an interview with Mr Mugabe - something a journalist without accreditiation could not do .
Time magazine has called Mr Ben - Menashe a "" veteran spinner of stunning - if - true - but yarns "" .
He has been ruthlessly attacked in Newsweek , the Wall Street Journal and New Republic .
He was also the main source of allegations made in 1991 by an award - winning journalist , Seymour Hersh , about the late Robert Maxwell , Mirror Group journalists , the abduction of the Israeli nuclear whistle - blower Mordechai Vanunu , and assorted arms deals .
Mr Ben - Menashe first came to light when he was acquitted by a New York federal jury in 1990 of charges that he had illegally sold Israeli - owned C-130 Hercules aircraft to Iran .
The sale , he said , was part of a US - sanctioned deal to win the release of American hostages .
He made unproven claims about Irangate and about October Surprise - a claim that Ronald Reagan 's campaign team had arranged a deal with Iran and Israeli officials to delay the release of US hostages held in Tehran until after the presidential election in November 1980 .
Mr Tsvangirai 's spokesman , Learnmore Jongwe , said in a statement yesterday that the Montreal company had been hired by the MDC , but that it now worked for the Mugabe regime .
He said the "" false "" claim that Mr Tsvangirai had discussed assassination in the meeting "" seems to arise from Dickens and Madson "" . ""
Mr Tsvangirai did take part in a meeting with Dickens and Madson in Montreal in December .
He came to suspect that he was being secretly videotaped .
There was no plot to assassinate Mugabe , "" Mr Jongwe said .
The statement included other alleged examples of smear tactics against the MDC , including claims that it was planning a civil war and that it was responsible for South Africa 's biggest bank robbery ."
2002-02-19,"The EU has "" finally acted on its threats and slapped President [ Robert ] Mugabe and his ruling elite with targeted sanctions "" Zimbabwe 's independent Daily News reports .
It says that Mr Mugabe 's stance against international election observers , which led to the sanctions , shows he is worried by the challenge posed by the opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai in the March presidential election .
Mr Mugabe is quoted at a press conference in Mozambique attacking Piere Schori , the head of the EU observers , for entering the country without a government invitation .
The paper says that Mr Mugabe is well known for "" holding grudges against those who criticise him "" and explains that Mr Schori was present at the June 2000 parliamentary election , which nearly pushed the ruling Zanu PF party out of power .
He ruled the election was not free and fair and in his report of an election marred by political violence that left over 90 opposition supporters dead attacked Mr Mugabe 's government for sanctioning violence and using the state media as its mouthpiece .
The press is under tight control in Zimbabwe .
As a footnote to its story , the Daily News reports that South African journalists yesterday telephoned its office saying the government had denied them permission to cover the election .
The Daily Mail and Guardian , one of the affected South African titles , adds a quote from Mr Mugabe : "" The independent media are most of them liars , downright liars .
They fabricate news , exaggerate news , they manufacture news .
""
The South African Independent reports that the president 's men are running riot in "" battlefield Harare "" , storming the opposition headquarters and leaving its fleeing members to be arrested by riot police .
An editorial in the Irish Independent says the EU must work closely with South Africa to build a dialogue with Zimbabwe , even though Pretoria is opposed to sanctions and such action may seem futile . ""
The 77-year - old president is unlikely to win a fair election .
He might , however , ' win ' a rigged election , "" it says .
"" That way lies civil war , with yet more suffering for the people of Zimbabwe .
In the face of this horrible prospect , the options for intervention by any outside power are sadly limited .
"" One course open to the EU is to work closely with Pretoria despite their disagreement on the sanctions question . ""
Back in Zimbabwe , the weekly Independent will not deal with the sanctions until Friday , but its current issue reports on the elections .
It says that Mr Mugabe 's Zanu PF party may insist on tactics in opposition - dominated Harare and Chitungwiza to confuse and frustrate voters .
A similar strategy was used last year by Zambia 's ruling party to starve opposition strongholds of ballot papers and unnecessarily drag the vote out .
It quotes Reginald Matchaba - Hove , chairman of the Zimbabwe Election Support Network , explaining that a voter will have to present ID , confirm their name and address , then submit to further checks and questioning before making a choice between candidates for the president , mayor and council .
There will be long queues and a strong chance that impatient voters will leave halfway through , he says .
"" This appears to be nothing but a shenanigan designed to create unfair advantage for one contestant by confusing and frustrating the urban electorate who may be perceived to be hostile to that candidate , "" Mr Matchaba - Hove tells the paper .
Another weekly , the Financial Gazette , reports that a crack unit of the government 's Central Intelligence Organisation ( CIO ) was established to trail the EU and Commonwealth election observers .
According to the paper 's sources , CIO officers were instructed to report on their meetings with the opposition Movement for Democratic Change and civic organisations perceived to be working against Mr Mugabe 's re - election bid .
It is left to the government - run Herald to report on a women 's march on the British High Commission in Harare in support of the president 's stand against UK intervention ."
2002-02-23,"Zimbabwean police yesterday fired at the convoy of the opposition leader , Morgan Tsvangirai , but did not injure anyone , according to the Movement for Democratic Change .
Elsewhere in the country , South African observers monitoring the presidential elections set for March 9 - 10 were threatened and their vehicle damaged when they witnessed an assault on MDC workers .
Mr Tsvangirai was driving through a rural area of Masvingo province for a campaign rally and stopped at the Sese village , where he met about 20 people .
Word spread and more supporters gathered .
But 10 police in a Land Rover arrived and declared the gathering illegal and immediately fired tear gas into the crowd , according to the MDC .
Mr Tsvangirai 's convoy left and drove towards Masvingo city .
When they stopped by the road for a break , the police caught up and fired two shots at Mr Tsvangirai 's vehicle , as well as tear gas , the MDC said .
No one was injured .
Mr Tsvangirai vowed to continue his speaking tour of the country .
A former trade union leader , he poses the most serious challenge to President Robert Mugabe 's 22-year rule .
Mr Tsvangirai , 49 , leads Mr Mugabe , 78 , in opinion polls , with the support of nearly 70 % of the voters .
Mr Mugabe 's supporters have responded by inflicting violence throughout the country , with assistance from the police and the army .
It is feared that Mr Mugabe will carry out widespread vote rigging , using new legislation which gives the government sweeping control of the entire voting and counting process .
In the second outbreak of political violence yesterday , two members of the South African observer mission , Eliza Maahlo and Dr Bethel Sithai , saw four MDC supporters being attacked by 200 youth militia of Mr Mugabe 's ruling Zanu - PF party , according to the MDC 's spokesman , Learnmore Jongwe .
The South Africans were interviewing the MDC supporters about the presidential campaign at the opposition party 's offices in the central city of Kwekwe , about 120 miles west of Harare .
The offices were then besieged by Mugabe supporters armed with stones and iron bars , who attacked all those in the building .
Those hurt were rushed to the Kwekwe hospital , but details of the injuries were not immediately available .
A vehicle belonging to the South African observers was also damaged .
The incident may force the South African observer team to take a harder line towards the Mugabe government .
Previously the South Africans had stated that they thought a free and fair election was possible in Zimbabwe , and they suggested that the violence came equally from both sides .
But already the South Africans have publicly complained that international journalists have not been given free access to the country .
· The Foreign Office admitted yesterday that it did not expect to persuade the Commonwealth to suspend Zimbabwe at a summit next month .
But officials said they hoped the 54-state organisation would put Mr Mugabe on notice that it would act if Zimbabwe 's elections were rigged ."
2002-02-25,"African leaders are negotiating with Zimbabwean opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai to arrange a safe passage out of the country for President Robert Mugabe if he loses the hotly contested presidential poll on March 9 and 10 , according to diplomatic sources .
Mr Tsvangirai is leading Mr Mugabe in opinion polls with support from nearly 70 % of voters .
Several political analysts say it would be difficult for Mr Mugabe to reverse such a wide margin of support for the opposition leader , either through pre - poll violence or extensive vote - rigging .
But a defiant Mr Mugabe , who turned 78 last week , refuses to countenance defeat and has indicated he might use a military coup to stay in power if he loses .
Fellow African leaders are so opposed to a coup that they are trying to get Mr Mugabe to agree to accept electoral defeat in return for a comfortable exile and exemption from any trials for numerous allegations of human rights abuses .
Nigerian president Olusegun Obasanjo is thought to have raised the issue of Mr Mugabe 's exile at a meeting with Mr Tsvangirai in Harare last month .
Mr Obasanjo first met Mr Mugabe at a late - night meeting in State House , the official presidential residence .
The Nigerian leader then insisted on meeting Mr Tsvangirai and after initially opposing the idea , Mr Mugabe agreed .
Mr Tsvangirai , who has survived several assassination attempts , was wary about going through Mr Mugabe 's tight security , but he was given assurances by Mr Obasanjo and a Nigerian embassy car ferried him to the meeting at 2 am .
The Nigerian leader asked Mr Tsvangirai if he would allow Mr Mugabe to leave the country "" with dignity "" to a place of exile , according to local reports .
Mr Tsvangirai has refused to confirm that report .
However , it is far from certain that Mr Mugabe will accept such a deal , even if Mr Tsvangirai agrees to it .
Hundreds of Mr Mugabe 's followers ambushed opposition supporters yesterday after a gathering in Chinhoyi , where opposition leader Mr Tsvangirai vowed to end a "" reign of terror "" if he took power .
Several cars carrying foreign election observers were hit by youths who apparently mistook them for opposition supporters , witnesses said .
The EU pulled out its election monitors last week , saying they were not being allowed to work freely ."
2002-02-25,"The head of Zimbabwe 's opposition party was today charged with high treason , an offence punishable by death , over allegations he plotted to assassinate President Robert Mugabe .
"" I have been charged with high treason , "" said Morgan Tsvangirai , the leader of the opposition Movement for Democratic Change .
Mr Tsvangirai told reporters that he had been questioned by police over an alleged plot to assassinate the veteran head of state , but said he still expected to contest next month 's presidential elections . ""
The charge was that I had committed treason and that they would like to find out from me what I had to say .
Of course I denied that completely "" , he said .
Mr Tsvangirai , 49 , said he believed police would not proceed with any prosecution before the elections .
He was questioned for two hours today at a police station in Harare before being told the charges would be pressed , said his lawyer , Innocent Chajonda .
He was then released and told he would be summoned at a later date .
It was not immediately clear how the charges will affect Mr Tsvangirai 's ability to campaign in the presidential elections of March 9 - 10 .
President Mugabe is fighting for his political survival after nearly 22 years of autocratic rule in the southern African country .
Mr Tsvangirai , a former trade union leader , poses the most serious challenge to President Mugabe 's rule .
He leads Mr Mugabe , 78 , in opinion polls , with the support of nearly 70 % of the voters .
Mr Mugabe 's supporters have been inflicting violence throughout the country , with assistance from the police and the army .
It is expected that Mr Mugabe will carry out widespread vote rigging , using new legislation which gives the government sweeping control of the entire voting and counting process .
Mr Mugabe said last week that he would not have his rival arrested before the elections , despite allegations of an assassination plot .
The government claims Mr Tsvangirai met members a Canada - based political consulting firm last year to arrange for the "" elimination "" of the president .
Ten days ago , the firm released a secretly recorded video tape of a December 4 meeting in Montreal , which they said incriminated Mr Tsvangirai .
Zimbabwe 's state media has given wide coverage to the allegations by Ari Ben - Menashe , who heads the Canadian consulting firm Dickens and Madson .
Mr Ben - Menashe left Harare on Sunday after meeting with police and members of the Central Intelligence Organisation .
On Friday , the government - mouthpiece Herald newspaper reported that Mr Tsvangirai claimed he would receive the support of the United States and other governments to head a transitional government following an assassination of President Mugabe .
The president has told supporters at campaign rallies he knew of the alleged plot last year , but did nothing to have Mr Tsvangirai arrested "" for fear of plunging the country into chaos "" ahead of the vote .
Denying the assassination claims , Mr Tsvangirai said he met the Canadian consulting firm four times about possible publicity it could offer his party abroad .
He said his recorded remarks were taken out of context .
A video timing clock was not erased from a grainy copy of the recording aired by Zimbabwe state television , and showed that the original secret tape had been heavily edited and even "" rearranged , "" said the Mass Media Project of Zimbabwe , an independent media monitoring group .
The Mass Media Project also said that state television devoted 35 minutes of its nightly news over the first four nights to the alleged conspiracy .
The opposition 's official denial received 15 seconds of air time on the same news program in the same period .
Despite some reports of controversial dealings by Mr Ben - Menashe and his partner , who is wanted in the United States on allegations of fraud , the state media on Sunday described him as "" a man of indisputable credibility "" .
Mr Tsvangirai 's motorcade has been attacked at least three times in the last two years since political violence began in the country in the run - up to the June 2000 parliamentary elections .
In the latest round of violence , police fired tear gas and shots at opposition vehicles in southern Zimbabwe on Friday .
Mr Tsvangirai , who travels in an armour - protected vehicle , was not hurt .
A van carrying election observers was stoned yesterday by activists loyal to the president , who apparently mistook them for opposition supporters , observer officials said .
Among the three injured observers was a retired police chief from Botswana .
He was in a van carrying members of a team representing the Southern African Development Community .
According to witnesses , the activists throwing stones at the van wore T - shirts emblazoned with Mugabe 's picture .
Yesterday 's incident marked the second time international observers had been attacked by ruling party activists ."
2002-02-26,"The treason charges filed yesterday against Morgan Tsvangirai boil down to this unusual scenario : the leader of Zimbabwe 's opposition decided to assassinate President Robert Mugabe and launch a military coup - and hired a Canadian lobbying firm to organise it .
Sceptical Zimbabweans quipped that there was no shortage of people at home willing to bump off the president , and that the opposition hardly needed a foreign company to arrange talks with disgruntled army officers .
The scenario , set out in a doctored videotaped recording of Mr Tsvangirai , looked even more strange when it was revealed that the key player in the alleged plot was a former Israeli intelligence officer whose wife said she did not believe a word he said .
But that has not stopped Mr Mugabe 's government from constructing an international conspiracy on which to string up Mr Tsvangirai ahead of Zimbabwe 's presidential election , which takes place at the end of next week .
The "" conspiracy "" was revealed a fortnight ago in an Australian television documentary made by a journalist honoured for his work in East Timor and other difficult spots , Mark Davis .
The core of the Dateline programme was grainy video footage that Davis claimed had been given to him by a secret source .
The transcript said that the video showed Mr Tsvangirai attempting to recruit a Canadian political consultancy , Dickens and Madson , to murder Mr Mugabe .
Mr Davis also said that he had audio evidence of two meetings at the RAC club in London with Mr Tsvangirai and Dickens and Madson .
According to the Dateline documentary , the firm was promised lucrative government contracts if Mr Tsvangirai took power .
The MDC leader did not deny meeting the firm but says that it was at the consultants ' invitation because they had offered advice on how to deal with the press and political issues in north America .
In other words , he had been set up .
The highly propagandist state - owned press in Harare went wild .
The day after the Australian documentary , the ever more fantastic Herald newspaper proclaimed that there was a "" Plot to Kill President - Covert Plot Hatched in UK and Canada "" .
Night after night for a fortnight , state television news reshowed the same six minutes of video that it claimed proved Mr Tsvangirai was asking the Canadians to help kill Mr Mugabe .
But then came the questions .
It was quickly spotted that the timing on the video record ing was jumping all over the place , and it was readily evident that it had been doctored .
What Mr Tsvangirai said at one point was immediately followed by a sentence he said 20 minutes earlier to make it sound as if it were all one statement .
Then there were the subtitles added by Zimbabwe television , supposedly showing what Mr Tsvangirai said , which bore no relation to the words coming out of his mouth .
Crucially , the subtitles had Mr Tsvangirai saying the word "" eliminate "" in reference to Mr Mugabe .
In fact he never uttered the word , but the sound was so poor hardly anyone could tell .
State television cut out sections of the video where Mr Tsvangirai made it clear that he did not want army intervention and that in the event of President Mugabe 's death his vice - president should take power .
The Media Monitoring Project , an influential independent watchdog in Zimbabwe , poured scorn on the use of the video . ""
Careful scrutiny of the contents of the clips shown on ZTV , however , raise doubts about the integrity of the Dickens and Madson officials and anybody who wanted to use them to incriminate the MDC leader , "" it said .
In the acres of space it has given to the issue , the Herald more than once claimed that Mr Tsvangirai "" repeated his demands for the elimination of President Mugabe "" .
But the only person who uses the word eliminate at the meeting is Ari Ben - Menashe , the head of Dickens and Madson , who gave the tape to Mr Mugabe 's government .
He has since admitted that he has been a "" friend "" of Mr Mugabe for 15 years , and has done a lot of business with him .
Iraqi - born Mr Ben - Menashe worked for Israel 's military intelligence and was once a deputy chief of Mossad .
He was accused of lying under oath to the US Congress about the Iran - contra affair during Ronald Reagan 's presidency .
He also sold false stories to gullible reporters about Israel 's atomic bomb .
Ten years ago , the Jerusalem Post called him a "" notorious and chronic liar "" .
Dickens and Madson has been heavily involved in Africa 's bloody diamond trade , an enterprise from which Zimbabwe 's military has made vast profits since its military intervention in the Democratic Republic of Congo .
Other questions have also arisen - and have gone unanswered .
Mr Ben - Menashe admitted he handed the tape to Zimbabwean officials six months ago , but it was only made public weeks before the presidential election .
And how was it that Davis was allowed into Zimbabwe when other foreign journalists were banned , let alone given an interview with a president who goes to great lengths to avoid the press ?
Davis has not been making himself available for interviews .
Above all , why should the opposition leader turn to a foreign consultancy firm to murder the president ?
Mr Ben - Menashe has an answer to that one .
"" That 's a question you have to put to him .
Maybe because he heard I worked for Israeli intelligence in the past or he read my book , "" he said .
"" He [ Tsvangirai ] wanted a company to assassinate the president and to arrange a coup in Zimbabwe .
We do consultancy work , we do political advice , we do lobbying .
We do n't do military stuff . ""
The charge of treason against Mr Tsvangirai came as no great surprise .
But his immediate release was unusual given the gravity of the charge .
The MDC leader can be re - arrested and held at any point , but perhaps at this stage the government considers it enough to leave the impression that Mr Tsvangirai is no longer a credible candidate , even though he can not be forced out of the race .
Much of the barrage of propaganda to which Zimbabweans are subjected daily is aimed at sowing doubt , and at creating confusion as much as terror ."
2002-02-26,"The Zimbabwe opposition leader , Morgan Tsvangirai , was yesterday charged with treason - a crime punishable by death - as President Robert Mugabe fought tooth - and - nail to stay in power .
As opinions polls showed Mr Mugabe trailing well behind Mr Tsvangirai in the run - up to the presidential election on March 9 - 10 , police in Harare accused the opposition leader of plotting to assassinate the president .
Mr Tsvangirai denied the charges and claimed he was the victim of a set - up by the government .
He was charged after being questioned by police for two hours . ""
The reason for charging me is obvious , "" he said .
"" We are going into a presidential election and this was only a strategy to keep me out of the race ...
If any crime was committed in December , why wait until just weeks before the election ? ""
The charges give Mr Mugabe several options in the battle with his arch - rival .
He could have him arrested at any point in the next two weeks or use the charges as an excuse for failing to recognise the result of the election if the opposition leader were to win .
The latest twist increases pressure on the Commonwealth heads of government , meeting in Brisbane at the weekend , to take punitive action against Mr Mugabe .
But many of the leaders , mainly from Africa , are reluctant to agree to Zimbabwe 's suspension from the Commonwealth .
The foreign secretary , Jack Straw , described the charges against Mr Tsvangirai as "" a disturbing development "" and "" yet another attempt by the Mugabe regime to obstruct the conduct of the election "" .
A US state department spokesman said the charges were "" another tragic example of President Mugabe 's increasingly authoritarian rule "" .
The police alleged that Mr Tsvangirai attempted to contract a Canadian firm to kill Mr Mugabe .
The accusations were made on an Australian television programme , Date line , two weeks ago .
Mr Tsvangirai , who was released without bail and without any restriction on his movements , said he would continue campaigning .
He insisted : "" If anything , this will enhance my image . ""
He also faced treason charges last year after he said that if Mr Mugabe did not go peacefully , he would be overthrown .
The charges were dismissed by the supreme court .
The Australian programme showed a video purporting to be of Mr Tsvangirai discussing the assassination of Mr Mugabe with five men in Montreal , Canada , last December .
Mr Tsvangirai admitted meeting with what he thought were political consultants , but claimed he was set up .
When the others began talking about killing Mr Mugabe , he said he jumped up and left the room ."
2002-02-27,"The Commonwealth is preparing to fudge the issue of Zimbabwe 's suspension this weekend , in spite of Robert Mugabe 's government yesterday filing fresh treason charges against the country 's opposition party .
The new charges were filed against two deputies of the leader of the Movement for Democratic Change , Morgan Tsvangirai , who was charged on Monday for allegedly plotting to assassinate Mr Mugabe .
Welshman Ncube , secretary general of the MDC , and the shadow agriculture minister , Renson Gasela , were charged with being part of the plot .
Britain and other countries have dismissed the treason charges as a last - ditch attempt by Mr Mugabe to stay in power .
But although Zimbabwe is top of the agenda for the Commonwealth heads of government biennial meeting in Brisbane , diplomatic sources said yesterday they were shying away from punitive action .
Commonwealth rules at present allow for suspension only of countries where there has been a coup , such as Pakistan .
The sources said the Commonwealth , which has 54 members , will agree to a change of rules that will widen the criteria for suspension to include attempts to interfere in elections , including intimidation of voters .
But the organisation is expected to fudge the issue of Zimbabwe by delaying a decision on implementing suspension until after the election , due to take place on March 9 - 10 .
A source said : "" If Commonwealth election observers report after the election there had been intimidation , that could trigger Zimbabwe being thrown out . ""
The election takes place only days after the Commonwealth conference ends .
There has been speculation that Mr Mugabe chose the date in the hope that the Commonwealth would not act against him so close to the election .
The compromise formula is likely to lead to accusations of the Commonwealth being too soft in dealing with Mr Mugabe .
It puts a lot of store by working by consensus and many African leaders are uneasy about suspending Zimbabwe .
Britain , which will be represented at the Brisbane talks by the prime minister , Tony Blair , and the foreign secretary , Jack Straw , will push for suspension .
A Foreign Office spokeswoman said : "" There is no place in the Commonwealth for a country that is prepared to inflict such suffering on its own people . ""
A team of 10 Commonwealth ministers set up two years ago to investigate reforms to the rules is to present a report to the heads of government recommending widening the scope for suspension .
The review was proposed by Mr Blair at the last heads of government meeting in Durban , South Africa .
The Commonwealth could in theory enforce the new rules within 24 hours of adopting them .
But the diplomatic sources said there is an unwillingness to suspend Zimbabwe , especially while Commonwealth election observers are in the country .
Although Mr Mugabe barred British election observers and European Union observers have pulled out , there are 45 Commonwealth observers in Zimbabwe .
They will take up their posts across the country today .
Mr Mugabe has not yet ruled out attending the Commonwealth meeting , though it seems unlikely that he would leave Zimbabwe so close to the election .
If he does not attend , Zimbabwe is likely to be represented by its foreign minister , Stan Mudenge .
The treason charges against Mr Tsvangirai and his deputies provide Mr Mugabe with a chance to cling to power if he were to lose the election .
Polls show that Mr Tsvangirai has up to 70 % support in the presidential contest .
Mr Tsvangirai yesterday claimed to be relaxed about the charges : "" I have neither been affected by the treason charges nor have the people of Zimbabwe been confused by these charges .
The people are more concerned about the hunger in the country , the collapsing economy and the lack of jobs than they are about these fanciful tales .
"" I am being persecuted by a desperate man who has run out of ideas to manage the country 's economy . ""
The treason charges follow a meeting Mr Tsvangirai had with Canadian political consultants in December .
The allegation is that he tried to hire them to assassinate Mr Mugabe .
Yesterday he rebuffed the charges : "" These are contrived charges to try to implicate me in the eyes of the Zimbabwean public .
We were set up by people we hired to be our lobby group .
If these treason charges are serious , why am I scot free and able to travel around ? ""
Mr Tsvangirai said he is determined to carry on with his campaign .
"" The people of Zimbabwe will not be cowed and neither will I , "" he said ."
2002-02-28,"It has been a bad week for Morgan Tsvangirai .
Even supporters of the Movement for Democratic Change candidate in next week 's presidential election are questioning the opposition leader 's judgment .
"" People say I was naive , "" said Mr Tsvangirai in an interview with the Guardian .
"" But I 've got another 30,000 votes in my cap as a result of this harassment . ""
Mr Tsvangirai is trying to explain why he sat in a room for four hours with a man who used words like murder , assassinate and eliminate in talking about President Robert Mugabe , without once objecting .
The grainy video , which is repeated interminably on Zimbabwe 's state television , shows Mr Tsvangirai meeting a Canadian lobbying firm headed by a former Israeli spy , Ari Ben - Manashe .
The MDC leader says he was there to discuss how to influence American politicians .
Mr Ben - Manashe claims Mr Tsvangirai was seeking help to kill Mr Mugabe .
Throughout the tape , Mr Ben - Manashe makes leading statements .
At one point he says : "" Morgan and the MDC agree that they will assassinate Mugabe and form a government with the army . ""
Later he refers to the "" murder "" of the president .
The word "" eliminate "" is repeatedly used .
The damage to Mr Tsvangirai has come from his failure to protest at such plans even though he at no point endorses them .
The MDC candidate now says he was disturbed by the conversation .
"" That 's why I walked out of the meeting , because Ben - Manashe was behaving in a very odd way , "" he said .
The video shows Mr Tsvangirai leaving the meeting after about 45 minutes but returning a short while later , looking relaxed .
The conversation continues with talk of the role of the army in forming a government if Mr Mugabe is gone .
Mr Tsvangirai insists that the whole meeting was a charade designed to entrap him .
Certainly Mr Ben - Manashe 's reputation fits such a plot .
Yet the central question is why Mr Tsvangirai 's suspicions were not raised by the nature of the conversation .
He is at a loss to explain .
"" How could I have even suspected that here was the lobby group we had hired to represent our interests and they were videotaping their own client ? "" he asked .
And what was he doing dealing at all with a man he now says framed him ?
Mr Tsvangirai blames other members of his party for not checking out the lobbying firm and discovering that Mr Ben - Manashe had a long - standing friendship with Mr Mugabe .
It is not the MDC 's leaders first lapse of political judgment .
Mr Tsvangirai was accused of treason once before for advocating the violent overthrow of Mr Mugabe if he did not go peacefully .
Yet the latest controversy raises the most serious questions to date about Mr Tsvangirai 's judgment on the eve of the election on March 9 and 10 that would probably see him end Mr Mugabe 's 22-year rule since Zimbabwe became independent , if the ballot is not rigged .
Wrecking
In their desperation to be rid of Mr Mugabe , few voters appear to take notice of Mr Tsvangirai 's policies .
Yet he will be called upon to reverse years of economic decline and the wholesale wrecking of some of the country 's key institutions .
Mr Tsvangirai says he envisages a country where the rule of law , basic economic common sense and a racial tolerance far better than in neighbouring South Africa , are restored after 20 years of growing abuses that have culminated in the present misrule .
He calls it national healing .
But even national healing can not resolve many of the problems facing Zimbabwe 's 12.5 m people .
One in four adults is HIV - positive and Aids has slashed life expectancy to 37 years .
Inflation has surged above 100 % , and nearly two - thirds of the workforce can not find a job .
The most pressing issue facing Mr Tsvangirai if he becomes president will be the one closest to Mr Mugabe 's heart - land .
Much of Zimbabwe is going hungry because the country can no longer feed itself thanks to the violence on the white - owned commercial farms , yet the food shortages are fuelling the demand for land .
"" There is a need for land resettlement in this country but we also have to deal with a very serious food deficit , "" said Mr Tsvangirai .
"" We believe we can find a lasting solution , a more equitable solution , by creating space for the landless and at the same time also recognising that commercial agriculture is important for the long - term economic stability of the country . ""
Mr Mugabe is right about one thing , at least in the short term .
Mr Tsvangirai does plan to give white - owned farms back to their recent owners to get food production back on track .
Poor blacks who have settled on the farms would be moved to large tracts of largely unused state - owned land .
Eventually , the MDC would create a land commission to oversee the resettlement of landless people on one - quarter of the country 's arable soil , including about one - third of the white - owned farms .
But Mr Tsvangirai says he would do a lot more for new settlers than the government , which has dumped them on the farms and left them to fend for themselves .
For a start , he would give title deeds to resettled families , enabling them to borrow money using the soil as collateral to purchase tools and seeds .
The present government retains ownership of the redistributed land , enabling it to throw off anyone who fails to express the necessary support for the ruling party .
In the end though , Mr Tsvangirai may find it hard to persuade someone who has staked out a precious plot on a white - owned farm to give it up . ""
All I can promise that person is that you will be given land .
Not necessarily where you have allocated yourself but we will not let you go back to your area where you are landless .
That is a promise I can give , "" he said .
Morgan Tsvangirai has radically altered his views on the path to power , abandoning his dedication to socialism as he rose to the top of the Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions and found himself overseeing popular protest against the abuses of Mr Mugabe 's rule .
Responsive ""
I 've moved significantly from my youthful socialist ideals , "" he said .
"" Our first 10 years of independence was caught up with an emphasis on redistribution policies rather than creating and enlarging the cake .
The result is we ran out of the cake .
So I have moved to a situation where you must create conditions for increased production but also for the state to be re sponsive to social conditions .
"" The result is an economic strategy heavily in favour of privatisation and foreign investment that has earned him friends in the west and the support of Zimbabwe 's tiny white population .
The government has made much of the whites in the upper echelons of the MDC .
They have a higher profile than they perhaps deserve given that just three of the 16 members of the shadow cabinet are not black .
"" Eighty - five per cent of Zimbabweans do not attribute our problems to the whites , "" said Mr Tsvangirai .
"" They attribute them to poor governance . ""
But before he can tackle all of this , Morgan Tsvangirai has to get Robert Mugabe out of office .
What will Mr Tsvangirai do if the election is stolen from him ? ""
What I know is that if a government is illegitimate , what arises out of this is that people wo n't accept it .
The government may get some way , but down the line they can not survive .
Under those circumstances , anything can happen . """
2002-02-28,"The Australian journalist who broke the news of an alleged plot by Zimbabwe 's opposition leader , Morgan Tsvangirai , to kill his rival , President Robert Mugabe , last night defended his story - and the videotape on which it rests .
Mark Davis , a television journalist who has won Australia 's top media award , confirmed that he received the six - hour surveillance tape of a meeting between Mr Tsvangirai and a Canadian political consultancy , from the firm 's head , Ari Ben - Menashe .
"" We have not manipulated a single word or a single sentence , "" he said .
According to Mr Davis , the Zimbabwean authorities also have copies of the tape .
Heavily edited footage from the video has met with widespread scepticism .
Mr Davis described the allegation as "" an ugly story "" but said he stood by it .
He criticised governments and journalists in Britain and Australia for dismissing it without attempting to see the video in full .
In an Australian television interview last night with Sekai Holland , the Movement for Democratic Change 's secretary for international affairs , Mr Davis invited her to view the entire tape .
"" I do n't have the time because I simply do n't believe your story from the footage that you 've offered , "" she said .
She called it a "" scam "" and "" a huge diversion "" that the MDC believed had come from Mr Mugabe .
Mr Davis showed the unedited tape to the Guardian .
It shows Mr Tsvangirai and two associates meeting Mr Ben - Menashe and two colleagues from the political consultancy , Dickens and Madson , in Montreal on December 4 last year .
There is no obvious sign that the sound or sequences have been tampered with , although Mr Ben - Menashe admitted he deliberately set up the video and is now working for Mr Mugabe .
Mr Ben - Menashe is a former senior official of Israel 's intelligence service , Mossad .
He has been accused of lying under oath to the US Congress , and of selling concocted stories to newspapers about Israel 's nuclear weapons programme .
Most of the first one - and - a - half hour meeting is a discussion of what are called "" transitional arrangements "" by Mr Tsvangirai .
Mr Ben - Menashe is filmed making frequent references to "" murdering "" , "" assassinating "" and "" eliminating "" Mr Mugabe .
Mr Tsvangirai gives no sign of objecting to such terms in the footage , and says : "" We can now definitely say that Mugabe is going to be eliminated "" .
Defending himself , Mr Tsvangirai has said he quit the meeting in disgust .
At one stage he is seen briefly leaving the room to confer with an associate .
He is also the first to get up to depart when the meeting concludes .
At one stage Mr Ben - Menashe says : "" OK , Mr Mugabe is eliminated .
Now what ? ""
Mr Tsvangirai then explains at length that he is supported by key members of the Zimbabwean military and claims that the MDC now controlled the leadership of the country 's war veterans . ""
In my view , it will not raise any suspicion .
It will be a normal transition , where the army guarantees stability for a certain duration , "" Mr Tsvangirai said .
"" That transitory phase should be used to play down the basis for a clean election in three months , four months , five months , we are prepared to wait . ""
Mr Tsvangirai is then pictured in a relaxed mood in another meeting with a Dickens and Madson partner .
He later shares Mr Ben - Menashe 's birthday cake and leaves after another meeting over lunch ."
2002-03-01,"The prime minister , Tony Blair , arriving in Australia today for the five - day Commonwealth conference , yesterday expressed revulsion at the behaviour of the Zimbabwe president , Robert Mugabe , and dismissed treason charges against his rival , Morgan Tsvangirai , as "" deeply suspect "" .
This is the harshest criticism of Mr Mugabe yet by the prime minister , who has been incensed by the events of the last week in the Zimbabwe election campaign .
Mr Tsvangirai launched legal action yesterday against the Australian TV station that broadcast allegations he was involved in a plot to kill President Mugabe .
He will sue SBS Television for defamation in the supreme court of New South Wales .
The lawsuit will not be heard in Sydney until April 19 - more than a month after the presidential elections in Zimbabwe .
Yesterday , Mr Blair , said , in an interview for the Australian Broadcasting Corporation that he had not seen an Australian video purporting to provide evidence of Mr Tsvangirai 's plot to assassinate Mr Mugabe .
But he added : "" I think most people realise that these types of charges that are being put up there in the course of an election campaign are deeply , deeply suspect and the truth is that Mugabe is prepared to do virtually anything in order to cling on to power . ""
"" What there should be in Zimbabwe is a free and fair election with people allowed to exercise their proper democratic rights , but I suspect the reason Mugabe is not very keen on that happening is that he fears the consequences .
"" There was confusion in Harare yesterday over the status of the treason charge against Mr Tsvangirai .
The opposition leader , his lawyer and a police spokesman all said earlier this week that Mr Tsvangirai had been formally charged with treason .
But justice minister Patrick Chinamasa said yesterday that Mr Tsvangirai and two other senior officials of his party had been questioned by police and signed warned and cautioned statements as the first step in having treason charges pressed against them .
The length
Mr Blair 's trip - he will not be back in the UK until next Wednesday - will renew criticism about him spending too much time out of the country instead of concentrating on domestic issues , especially as the conference is unlikely to achieve much ..
Asked about the chances of Mr Tsvangirai winning , Mr Blair said he would if the election are fair ."
2002-03-03,"Opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai has signalled a deal with Zimbabwe 's President Robert Mugabe : if he takes defeat at the polls quietly he will not be prosecuted for crimes against his people .
But he was gloomy about the conduct of the election thus far : ' The conditions are hostile to the opposition .
We have widespread violence against the people .
We have no access to the electronic media . '
Our campaign rallies are being disrupted and there are no international observers .
There are no international media here .
You ca n't have a free and fair election under these conditions . '
The former trade union boss who is widely expected to topple Robert Mugabe from power at the polls next weekend - as long as the election is free and fair - leads an interesting life .
He has survived two assassination attempts and in the past few days he has been shot at and charged with treason .
But even he was a little surprised when a man in a crumpled suit popped out of a car boot .
It was the only way for me to interview him without being detected by Mugabe 's secret police , the Central Intelligence Organisation .
The BBC is banned in Zimbabwe .
Tsvangirai said : ' I am sure they are afraid of losing power because of the consequences of losing power .
Are we going to take them to The Hague ?
Are we going to prosecute them for crimes committed against the people - all these things are adding up to the inherent fear , so what we have to decide is that if fear is a stumbling block to future progress , then let 's talk about it because we do n't want to focus on retribution . '
Was not talking - a deal of some sort - being charitable to criminals , killers ? '
I 'm not being charitable , I 'm being realistic .
What 's the use of burning down the building ?
If you push certain people ' - Mugabe and his Zanu ( PF ) party - ' to burn down the building , what would you inherit ? '
I raised the ' Gukurahundi ' , the killings by Mugabe 's Fifth Brigade in Matabeleland in 1984 in which as many as 20,000 may have died .
Tsvangirai said : ' Yes , we know these crimes , but let me tell you one thing .
He 's a 78-year - old man .
Why pursue him ? '
In 2000 , Tsvangirai looked set to win a seat in Parliament , but then his election agent , Tichoana Chiminya , and another MDC activist , Talent Mabika , were burnt to death by a CIO officer called Joseph Mwale .
Tsvangirai said : ' Yes , I have no doubt in my mind that the MDC won that parliamentary election
but it was stolen . '
And what if Mugabe steals the presidential election ? '
I am afraid , yes .
The government is committed to a predetermined outcome and will do everything to subvert the will of the people .
But that 's not going to deter us .
If he rigs the election , people will certainly rise .
If they rise , Mugabe will try to suppress them by army and other forces . '
If that happens , there will be more repression but that 's a dead end .
You can only have more repression and more repression .
There is nothing more to it .
If he tries to fight the people , he will not succeed . '
He 's been shot at , threatened , charged with inciting violence and , since the interview took place , treason .
Did he feel afraid ? '
Afraid ?
No .
Yes , threatened , the risk is there .
You can do something to minimise it but you ca n't eliminate it . '
I suggested the odd thing about Zimbabwe was that it 's not quite a tyranny , not like Saddam Hussein 's Iraq .
He replied : ' Tyranny is tyranny .
The degree may differ but it 's still tyranny . '
And this is a tyranny ? '
I 'm sure it 's authoritarian to the extent that if people are being brutalised with state - sponsored thugs and these thugs are able to commit these acts of criminality with impunity , what do you call that ? '
Who was going to win ? '
I have no doubt we could have as high as 65 per cent . '
What did Tsvangirai think of Mugabe 's playing the race card against the white community ? '
You know , during the struggle the amount of emotions between black and white , the polarisation was so deep , so he 's trying to revive that .
And if he says "" Blame it on the whites "" , then it becomes convenient to exploit those emotions . '
Is that working ? '
No .
I mean 90 per cent of the blacks in this country do n't believe the problems we are facing have anything to do with whites .
After all , they 're an endangered species here . '
Tsvangirai lives in a rather posh villa in a sleek , ' whites mainly ' suburb of Harare .
What 's going to stop him , if he gets elected and has five , 10 years in power from being just another Mugabe ? '
It 's the people , the people would not allow me to go on beyond two terms . '
He cocked a snook at Jonathan Moyo , the Information Minister who piloted the draconian Access to Information Bill through Parliament . '
Why he 's so crazed about licensing journalists all of a sudden ?
It 's quite obvious he wants to muzzle the press and limit external media to come and cover the presidential election . '
How do you think Mugabe will be remembered ? '
From hero to zero . '

2002-03-05,"Zimbabwean police cut short a meeting yesterday between foreign diplomats and the opposition leader , Morgan Tsvangirai , who was briefing them on his plans if he wins the election against President Robert Mugabe this weekend .
About 30 foreign envoys went to a Harare hotel to hear Mr Tsvangirai describe his plans for a transition to a government by his Movement for Democratic Change ( MDC ) , if he wins the March 9 and 10 presidential election .
But soon after the briefing began , Mr Tsvangirai was called out by police and he returned to inform the diplomats that the meeting had been declared an illegal gath ering under Mr Mugabe 's new Public Order and Security Act .
The diplomats dispersed , but many were outraged .
"" We have the right and the duty under the Vienna convention to talk to political forces when we think it 's appropriate , "" said the Spanish ambassador , Javier Sandomingo .
Other diplomats said the police action was a blatant dis play of the Mugabe government 's efforts to suppress Mr Tsvangirai at every turn .
Opinion polls show that Mr Tsvangirai has support from nearly 70 % of voters and has a real chance of unseating Mr Mugabe , who has held power for 22 years .
International observers saw evidence yesterday of state - sponsored violence near the second city of Bulawayo , a centre of support for Mr Tsvangirai .
Residents of St Paul 's village showed observers the results of an attack on Sunday they said was carried out by pro - government militants , saying five people were wounded and six homesteads destroyed .
Bulawayo police inspector Manzini Moyo told observers from the Commonwealth , South Africa and Norway that he was aware of the attack but he declined to give further details .
Witnesses said about 600 youths wearing T - shirts of the ruling Zanu - PF party rampaged through the settlement , wielding sticks , clubs and axes .
The MDC says at least 107 of its members and supporters have died in political violence over the past two years ."
2002-03-05,"The prime minister , Tony Blair , expressed disappointment yesterday after the Commonwealth summit fudged the issue of whether to suspend Zimbabwe for abuses of the democratic process .
A compromise statement , unanimously adopted by the summit , means that a decision on suspension is to be delayed until after Zimbabwe holds its presidential election this weekend .
The president , Robert Mugabe , is fighting for his political survival against Morgan Tsvangirai , the leader of the Movement for Democratic Change .
Mr Mugabe 's supporters have been involved in acts of violence and intimidation during the election campaign .
Mr Blair , backed by Australia , Canada and New Zealand , pushed for immediate suspension at the summit in Australia but was opposed by a bloc of African countries .
The prime minister , who flies home today , said : "" We should have provided a far stronger statement and backed it up with action .
We have postponed the day of judgment of Zimbabwe .
I think that is the wrong thing to do . ""
He added : "" The statement is not the statement I would have drafted .
There is no point in using diplomatic language about this .
The statement that appears is , in effect , the lowest common denominator . ""
The statement said a three - man team would be established to decide on suspension , consisting of the Australian prime minister , John Howard , who sided with Britain in pushing for immediate suspension ; the Nigerian president , Olusegun Obasanjo , who opposed immediate suspension ; and the South African president , Thabo Mbeki , who was also opposed .
The statement said they were to base their decision on a report by the 60-odd Commonwealth observers monitoring the election .
The team will "" determine appropriate Commonwealth action on Zimbabwe in the event the report is adverse "" : the action "" ranges from collective disapproval to suspension "" .
Mr Blair said he hoped that when the trio came to make their decision , they would opt for suspension .
He warned : "" I think the Commonwealth will do the right thing here but if it does not , well , its credibility is at issue . ""
The MDC also criticised the delay , warning that it could lead to a bloodbath in the days after the poll closes .
Sekai Holland , an MDC spokeswoman , told reporters at the summit the statement was an insult .
"" We are not happy because it is more talk and no action . ""
African leaders justified their refusal to support immediate suspension on the grounds that it would be unfair to Mr Mugabe to prejudge the conduct of the election .
Ms Holland expressed concern about the inclusion of Mr Mbeki and Mr Obasanjo on the team , given their reluctance to move against Mr Mugabe in the past .
Mr Obasanjo was adamant he would take the necessary steps : "" Whatever has to be done will be done .
There is no question of that . ""
The Nigerian leader played a positive role last September in getting Britain and Zimbabwe to sit down together , even though the deal they thrashed out subsequently foundered .
The team was chosen on the basis that Australia holds the chair of the Commonwealth at present , South Africa was the last holder and Nigeria will be the next .
The observers ' report will be handed to the three leaders about four days after the polls close .
The Commonwealth 's unwillingness over the last year to act against Zimbabwe has resulted in its reputation dropping to levels last seen almost a decade ago when it dithered over suspending Nigeria after a series of human rights abuses .
It suspended Nigeria in 1995 only when the writer Ken Saro - Wiwa was executed .
The Commonwealth secretary - general , Don McKinnon , defending the summit 's decision , argued that if Zimbabwe had been suspended two years ago , there would be no Commonwealth observers now ."
2002-03-06,"Robert Mugabe goes into the election in three days ' time with nearly twice as many Zimbabweans saying they will vote for his main rival , Morgan Tsvangirai , as there are pledging to support the president who has ruled for 22 years .
But the most revealing statistic of a new opinion poll is that 60 % of voters are apparently too afraid to say who they support .
The poll , conducted by the University of Zimbabwe 's mass public opinion institute , is the most scientific and comprehensive to date .
Just 11.3 % of voters said they back Mr Mugabe , compared with 19.8 % for his opponent .
"" The task is the interpretation of the nearly 60 % who opted to keep their choice a secret , "" said Professor Masipula Sithole , the institute 's director .
"" The high number is a manifestation of fear and an environment of intimidation .
It 's obvious most of the intimidation is coming from the ruling party , and those intimidated by it are likely to be opponents of the ruling party , not supporters .
"" The bad news for Mr Mugabe is made worse by the fact that 87 % of those questioned claim they intend to vote , meaning that intimidation may discourage people from publicly supporting the opposition but it will not keep them away from the polls .
Some analysts believe the president 's support has declined even further because the research was conducted before the food shortages began to bite .
A slightly different question - who would make the better president ? - produced twice as much support for Mr Tsvangirai ( 31 % ) as for Mr Mugabe ( 15 % ) .
But there are signs that Mr Mugabe 's war of attrition on the vote may be having some impact .
By far the lowest registration is among the young , with not much more than half of 18 to 20-year - olds signing up to vote .
Just 4 % of young voters say they will vote for Mr Mugabe .
New electoral laws make it difficult for them to register by requiring proof of residence , which many do not have .
Crucially , 90 % of those polled believe their ballot is secret .
The ruling party has implicitly acknowledged this in its campaign to intimidate vot ers with threats of collective punishment of villages that vote against Mr Mugabe .
The surprise in the survey was that whoever wins the election , more than 60 % of those polled said they would like to see a coalition government of both parties .
Prof Sithole said : "" People are tired of this polarisation .
They want the leadership on both sides to work together , and they are frightened of more violence whichever side wins . """
2002-03-08,"Zimbabwe 's ruling party has again raised the spectre of a military coup if President Robert Mugabe loses this weekend 's election .
Zanu - PF 's chief of external affairs , Didymus Mutasa , told South African television that the party would welcome military intervention if the opposition candidate , Morgan Tsvangirai , were to win the poll . ""
Many , many of us did not go to fight the settler regime in order to install a British puppet like Tsvangirai , "" he said .
"" Under these circumstances , if there were to be a coup , we would support it very definitely . ""
Despite months of violence , intimidation and a massive propaganda campaign to portray Mr Tsvangirai 's Movement for Democratic Change as a front for white interests funded by Britain , Mr Mugabe is far from certain of winning even with the aid of significant vote - rigging .
If he attempts to hang on to power in the face of overwhelming public opposition , his success will probably depend on the army .
Despite warnings from the military top brass that it may not accept a Tsvangirai victory , the army 's reaction is difficult to predict .
"" Whoever wins the election , what the army does will determine who will take power , "" said John Makumbe , chairman of the Zimbabwe crisis committee , made up of some 250 civil society organisations from unions to human rights groups .
Mr Tsvangirai said yesterday he thought a coup was unlikely .
"" There have been , in the heat of the moment , statements from President Mugabe ... and others , threatening to overturn the will of the people .
These statements are unfortunate and should not be taken seriously , "" he said .
The fear of punishment for past deeds may dictate how the army leadership reacts to a victory by Mr Tsvangirai .
It is likely that he will have sought to reassure senior officers - such as the air force chief , Perence Shiri - who are vulnerable to prosecution for crimes against humanity for the Matabeleland massacres 20 years ago and other abuses ..
The Zimbabwean army , rated as one of the best - trained and equipped in Africa , has an estimated 27,000 troops in the country .
From Monday , when the jittery nation will await results from the weekend poll , all army units will be "" in full combat gear "" , according to the independent Financial Gaz - ette yesterday .
All soldiers will be armed with rifles , ammunition , water and rations as if they were going into battle , said the newspaper .
Dozens of army trucks are parked in ranks near Harare city centre , some with turrets for water cannon and machine guns , and portholes for guns .
Mr Mugabe has vowed he will never give up power to Mr Tsvangirai , and he was backed a few weeks ago by the army 's commander , General Vitalis Zvinavashe , who stated that he will not "" take orders from or salute "" a president who did not fight in the war against Rhodesian minority rule .
Senior army officers have been put in charge of administering the election , prompting many observers to question the fairness of the poll .
The army and police rank and file have been forced to vote early , in the presence of their commanding officers to ensure their ballots are cast for Mr Mugabe ."
2002-03-12,"Zimbabwe 's opposition leader , Morgan Tsvangirai , said yesterday that he feared for his life after the detention of his party 's secretary general and hundreds of other activists as voting in the presidential election was called to a halt .
The detentions came as the state press all but declared Robert Mugabe the winner , and his government defied a high court order to permit a full third day of polling after hundreds of thousands of people were prevented from voting at the weekend .
The polling stations either did not reopen at all yesterday or only did so after lunchtime .
Police fired tear gas and beat people waiting to vote in three Harare townships after the government ordered balloting stations to close at 7 pm , despite an earlier assurance that anyone still in line would be allowed to vote .
Last night , the high court refused a request by the opposition Movement for Democratic Change to extend the election to an unprecedented fourth day .
Earlier , the police arrested the MDC 's secretary general Welshman Ncube .
The party 's shadow foreign minister , Tendai Biti , was briefly abducted by government supporters .
The government said Mr Ncube was detained while travelling near the Botswana border for "" attempting to flee the country "" .
He is facing treason charges for allegedly plotting with Mr Tsvangirai to murder the president .
Both men have dismissed the charges as "" absurd "" .
The police also held two American diplomats for five hours after stopping them at a roadblock in Chinhoyi .
The US embassy in Harare described the action as "" a violation of basic diplomatic conventions "" .
Hundreds of other opposition activists were arrested and held on minor charges as the state media began to paint a picture of a widespread conspiracy by the MDC , white Zimbabweans and foreigners to undermine the credibility of the presidential election .
In a call to party supporters , Mr Tsvangirai warned that he might also soon be detained by "" the forces of darkness "" .
"" They may want to arrest me , and at worst kill me , but they will never destroy the spirit of the people to reclaim their power , "" he said .
"" The tide of change is irreversible , but we must be prepared to pay a high price for our freedom .
President Mugabe and his colleagues are afraid of the people and may do anything to kill the messenger . ""
Mr Tsvangirai no longer sleeps at his house and is protected by South African bodyguards .
The opposition unsuccessfully applied to the high court last night for the election to be extended to a fourth day after the justice minister , Patrick Chinamasa , disobeyed an order to hold a full third day of voting across the country yesterday .
He only permitted continued balloting in Harare and the township of Chitungwiza , where large numbers of people had been unable to vote because the ruling party engineered long delays .
That would have been enough to satisfy the opposition , but at dawn yesterday , as tens of thousands of people again queued to vote , the registrar general , Tobaiwa Mudede , ordered the polling stations to remain shut to "" test equipment "" .
Finally , some opened shortly before midday .
But by then many of the people had given up and left the queues to go to work .
The MDC 's call for a fourth day of voting was rejected by Paddington Garwe , the high court 's senior judge . ""
He ruled that he had no jurisdiction - that this was a matter within the province of the registrar - general and that was the end of the matter , "" said Eric Matinenga , an MDC lawyer .
Foreign observers began to question the government 's election statistics last night .
One Commonwealth official said the numbers were evidence of a "" coordinated strategy by Mugabe to steal the election . ""
Local independent observers agreed .
"" We are worried by this apparent massaging of figures , "" said Reginald Matchaba - Hove of the independent Zimbabwe Election Support Network .
"" By Sunday morning the government was claiming that there were more rural voters than urban voters .
The truth is that it is the other way around .
It was a big alarm bell .
They say there is a massive turnout in some rural areas , but many observers did not see it .
And then there are the overwhelming queues in Harare and Chitungwiza .
We are worried .
"" The government is claiming a 69 % turnout in Mr Mugabe 's old stronghold of Mashonaland Central , and that more than half of registered voters cast their ballots in other provinces where he needed to do well , such as Manica and Masvingo .
In contrast , the authorities said far fewer people voted where Mr Mugabe 's government has long been unpopular .
In the two provinces of Matabeleland , for instance , the turnout was officially 47 % .
But it was the numbers from Harare and Chitungwiza that gave greatest cause for concern .
During the first day and a half of voting , the election authorities claimed a very low turnout in the capital and neighbouring township .
But its figures record a significant leap in the numbers who voted on Sunday afternoon , even though there is no evidence that the polling stations were working any faster .
It has raised concerns in some quarters of ballot box stuffing .
Last night , the MDC said a number of its officially accredited monitors were unable to follow the ballot boxes from the polling stations to counting centres after being detained at police roadblocks ."
2002-03-12,"Early results in Tuesday 's presidential election in Zimbabwe put President Robert Mugabe in front .
The results , from the central Midlands and southern Matabeleland South provinces showed Mugabe in the lead with 27,065 votes with 15,621 votes being recorded for the opposition leader , Morgan Tsvangirai .
But as results trickled in , observers slammed the poll .
Norwegian and local independent monitors condemned the government 's conduct of the poll .
The Norwegians said the poll did not meet international standards and had been marred by violence , most of it from government supporters .
The ZESN ( Zimbabwean Election Support Network ) , an umbrella organisation of 38 church and civic groups , said tens of thousands of people had been prevented from voting .
"" There is no way these elections could be described as free and fair , "" said a spokesman for the group .
As counting began in 120 voting centres , Welshman Ncube , secretary - general of Tsvangirai 's Movement for Democratic Change ( MDC ) , was charged with treason .
Ncube , who was released on bail , dismissed the charges as government propaganda .
The government has also accused Ncube , Tsvangirai and another MDC figure of plotting to assassinate Mugabe .
Tsvangirai and Western critics say Mugabe is systematically cheating to cling to power in the once - rich nation , which faces an economic and political collapse that could spill into neighbouring countries including South Africa .
Mugabe 's government dismissed the criticism and Information Minister Jonathan Moyo described the vote as "" exemplary "" .
Justice Minister Patrick Chinamasa said Zimbabweans had voted "" freely and fairly and in a peaceful manner . ""
Kare Vollan , the head of the 25-strong Norwegian mission , told a news conference the elections had been conducted in "" an environment of strong polarisation , political violence and an election administration with severe shortcomings "" .
He said the poll failed "" key , broadly accepted criteria "" .
The Norwegians were the largest European observer group after the European Union withdrew its team when Mugabe excluded some EU member states .
The ZESN local monitors said "" tens of thousands of Zimbabweans were deliberately and systematically disenfranchised of their fundamental right to participate in the governance of their country "" .
It said there had been a drastic reduction in polling stations in the MDC 's Harare strongholds , leading to huge queues of voters , and a "" phenomenal increase "" in the number of voting places in Mugabe 's rural bastions ."
2002-03-13,"Robert Mugabe has won the most bitter presidential election in Zimbabwe 's history , in a vote that opposition and observers said was deeply marred by irregularities and violence .
The results , announced on state - owned radio , showed a victory for Mr Mugabe , whose race against former labour leader Morgan Tsvangirai presented the first real electoral challenge for the president since he led Zimbabwe to independence 22 years ago .
Zimbabwe 's justice minister , Patrick Chinamasa , described the vote as a "" runaway victory "" .
But the opposition Movement for Democratic Change rejected the results .
Mr Tsvangirai said : "" It is the biggest electoral fraud I have ever witnessed in my life . ""
He said the "" people of Zimbabwe in their entirety "" were stopped from voting and that the result was the culmination of two years of violence "" sometimes with the connivance of the police "" .
The election "" does not reflect the true will of the people of Zimbabwe and is consequently illegitimate in the eyes of the people , "" he added .
According to preliminary results , Mr Mugabe had about 54 % of the vote , while Mr Tsvangirai had 40 % , Tobaiwa Mudede , the registrar - general of the state electoral directorate said .
There were 1,685,212 votes for Mr Mugabe and 1,258,401 for Mr Tsvangirai .
The results still have to be certified , but election officials said 3,130,913 people voted out of 5,647,812 registered .
"" We hereby declare Robert Gabrielle Mugabe has received the majority of votes cast , "" Mr Mudede said .
The victory gives Mr Mugabe a fifth six - year term .
"" It was won on the issue of the land , "" he added , citing Mr Mugabe 's policy of seizing white - owned land and turning it over to landless blacks .
As the results were announced early this morning , Zimbabwean security forces were on "" full alert "" to stamp out any unrest , state television reported .
The foreign secretary , Jack Straw , said the came as no surprise following a systematic campaign of "" violence and intimidation "" to preserve "" power at all costs "" .
He said the British government was still receiving reports from the country and would consult with the EU , the US and the Commonwealth before deciding what action to take .
If President Mugabe had been "" fully confident of popular support "" he would not have obstructed polling stations from opening , had the leader of the opposition arrested or instructed police to break up violence , Mr Straw said .
He will make a full statement on the election to parliament tomorrow .
Independent observers questioned the validity of the vote , saying it was tainted by violence , intimidation , confusion and the disenfranchisement of thousands of voters in the opposition stronghold of Harare . ""
The presidential elections failed to meet key , broadly accepted criteria for elections , "" said Kare Vollan , head of the 25-member Norwegian observer mission .
He said the mission , the largest European delegation , found flaws with every step of the electoral process , from voter registration and campaigning to the actual vote .
The independent Zimbabwe Election Support Network and a coalition of church and civic groups known as the Crisis in Zimbabwe Committee also said the election was fundamentally flawed .
David Coltart , an opposition member of parliament , said , "" there are some really odd figures "" from rural areas , where Mr Mugabe traditionally does well .
However , government officials have repeatedly denied there were any irregularities in the election , and was today given support by South Africa , which has consistently sought to deflect criticism of the Mugabe government and helped block Commonwealth sanctions .
The South African observer mission said the election "" should be considered legitimate , "" said Sam Motsuenyane , the head of the 50-member team .
He acknowledged there was violence during the campaign , that some voters were turned away and that new election laws "" threaten the integrity of the electoral process . ""
But he called most of the problems "" administrative oversights .
"" Military police set up roadblocks on main roads leading into Harare this morning and there were reports of soldiers at the airport in Bulawayo , Zimbabwe 's second largest city and an opposition stronghold .
Amnesty International said 1,400 opposition polling agents and independent election observers had been detained and others had been arrested for allegedly trying to vote a second time .
"" We are deeply concerned for the safety of those arrested in the light of the well - established pattern of ' disappearances , ' cruel , inhuman and degrading treatment by Zimbabwean security forces , "" Amnesty said in a statement demanding their release .
Tony Reeler , an official from the Zimbabwean human rights group , Amani Trust , said late last night that at least 2,000 people had been detained , the majority of which had not been released .
Police said on Monday that 277 people had been arrested in Harare for voting irregularities .
A police spokesman , Wayne Bvudzijena , said yesterday that he had no updated information .
Foreign election observers complained to police that 75 people were being held in a chicken wire cage in the Harare township of Glen View , and about 40 others spent the night in police cells and a cage in the north - western suburb of Mabelreign .
Mr Mugabe faced little dissent until recent years , when the nation 's economy collapsed and political violence - blamed mostly on the ruling party - became rampant ."
2002-03-20,"As a general strike took hold across Zimbabwe today , the leader of the country 's main opposition party , Morgan Tsvangirai , was formally charged with treason over an alleged plot to assassinate the president , Robert Mugabe .
Mr Tsvangarai appeared in a Harare courtroom today where he was charged with treason - which carries a possible death sentence - and was released on bail of Z$1.5 m ( £ 21,500 ) .
He was ordered to surrender his passport and the deeds to property worth Z$3 m .
The charges arise from a videotaped meeting between Mr Tsvangirai and a Canadian lobby firm that had been hired on behalf of his party , the Movement for Democratic Change ( MDC ) .
During the four - hour meeting , the head of the lobby firm - a former Israeli spy named Ari Ben - Manashe - used the words "" murder "" , "" assassinate "" and "" eliminate "" in reference to Mr Mugabe .
On the tape , Mr Tsvangarai never agreed to the assassination plot mentioned by Mr Ben - Manashe , but crucially he never denounced it either .
The meeting had been taped without Mr Tsvangarai 's knowledge , and he claims the meeting was set up to entrap him , and that Mr Ben - Manashe was paid by Mr Mugabe to produce evidence of a coup plot .
Welshman Ncube , Mr Tsvangirai 's deputy , was formally charged with treason and granted bail just before this month 's disputed presidential election .
Mr Tsvangarai 's arrest comes one day after the Commonwealth suspended Zimbabwe 's membership in protest at a violent election that international observers said denied voters a free and fair choice of candidates .
The election resulted in Mr Mugabe extending his 22 year rule by another six years .
Today the foreign secretary , Jack Straw , welcomed the Commonwealth decision and expressed hope that Mr Mugabe 's Zanu - PF party would move towards reconciliation with the MDC . ""
The news this morning of the renewed detention of Morgan Tsvangirai suggests this message has yet to get across , "" he said .
Throughout the country today , a general strike called to protest about the election began to take hold .
Several banks and businesses closed , and some factories and shops in Harare were forced to close after workers did not turn up .
However most government offices , post offices and schools remained open .
Union officials expected the three - day strike to take greater hold tomorrow .
Police manned roadblocks on the main highways into Zimbabwe 's cities today , after declaring the strike illegal under sweeping new security laws passed ahead of the elections .
State radio described the strike - organised by the Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions - as a failure and said police were deployed across the country "" to make sure some unruly elements do not prevent people going to work "" .
In Harare , commuter traffic was lighter than usual and activity in its normally bustling townships was down ."
2002-03-21,"Morgan Tsvangirai , the leader of the Zimbabwean opposition , was charged with high treason by President Robert Mugabe 's government yesterday : a defiant response to Zimbabwe 's suspension from the Commonwealth .
Earlier this week the South African president , Thabo Mbeki , and other neighbouring African leaders urged Mr Mugabe not to press the charge , to create a more conciliatory political climate after last week 's bitterly contested presidential election .
By going ahead with it Mr Mugabe seems to be showing that he is not interested in negotiations with Mr Tsvangirai .
Since Mr Mugabe was declared the winner on March 13 he has signed into law a repressive press bill and his supporters have begun a campaign of violent retribution against the opposition .
Four supporters of Mr Tsvangirai 's Movement for Democratic Change have been killed , and a white farmer .
In a courtroom packed with his supporters , Mr Tsvangirai pleaded not guilty to the charge that he sought to hire Canadian political consultants to assassinate Mr Mugabe .
His lawyer , Eric Matinenga , said told the court that the charge was "" a kneejerk reaction "" to Zimbabwe 's one - year suspension from Commonwealth membership . ""
Mr Tsvangirai 's stake in this country is too high to think he would run away from allegations that are very weak indeed , "" Mr Matinenga said .
The MDC 's secretary general , Welshman Ncube , who is also charged with treason , said the charges were "" an attempt to continue the harassment of the leadership of the MDC and to make it impossible for us to continue to resist an illegitimate government "" .
He said the suggestion that the MDC should enter into a government of national unity with Mr Mugabe 's Zanu - PF party "" was always out of the question "" , adding : "" You can not negotiate a government of national unity with a government you believe to be illegitimate . ""
Mr Tsvangirai was remanded until April 30 and released on bail of Z$1.5 m ( £ 20,000 ) in cash and Z$3 m in property surety .
He had to surrender his passport and must appear at his local police station every Monday .
Renson Gasela , an MDC MP and the shadow agriculture minister , was also charged with treason and released on bail of Z$500,000 .
The state said it would produce six witnesses , a videotape and other evidence against Mr Tsvangirai .
Legal experts dismiss the evidence as "" unconvincing and circumstantial , at best "" .
But Zimbabwe 's judicial system has lost a great deal of its independence and lawyers say that Mr Tsvangirai may not get a fair trial .
As he went to court , most Zimbabweans went to work , ignoring the three - day strike called by the Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions .
Virtually all shops and banks were open , but about half the country 's factories were closed .
Factory workers said the ZCTU had not explained the reasons for the strike . ""
No one told us what this strike is about , "" said a machinist who did not want his name used .
"" I missed work last Monday to vote .
If I missed three days this week I would not have enough pay to feed my family .
But if the unions had called a protest against the elections and said that clearly , we would have all supported it . "" International pressure on Mr Mugabe is continuing to grow .
His party 's violent retribution against the MDC was criticised yesterday by the Norwegian election observers .
"" Following the election it quickly emerged that Zanu - PF supporters had embarked on systematic reprisals against opposition members and supporters , "" said Kare Vollan , the leader of the group , which reported that Mr Mugabe 's followers were carrying out arson , beating , torture and killing with "" impunity "" ."
2002-04-12,"Zimbabwe 's opposition will argue in court today that Robert Mugabe won the presidential election last month by massive fraud and violence .
Morgan Tsvangirai , leader of the Movement for Democratic Change , said : "" Our lawyers have uncovered mountains of hardcore and powerful evidence of electoral fraud , which if presented to an independent and impartial court would undoubtedly result in Robert Mugabe 's electoral victory being set aside . ""
He gave no details of the evidence , but he said the case might not get a fair hearing because the independence of the judicial system had been compromised by Mr Mugabe 's packing the courts with compliant judges .
The challenge is being brought under the Electoral Act , which requires such cases to be begun within 30 days of the ballot results .
Mr Tsvangirai and his party are proceeding with the case despite talks between the MDC and the ruling Zanu - PF party to try to resolve the political crisis .
International observers , including the Commonwealth , condemned the March 9 - 11 election , citing widespread state - sponsored political violence and fraud .
The Commonwealth suspended Zimbabwe for a year and the US and EU have refused to accept Mr Mugabe as the legitimate president .
For its part , the government has formally charged Mr Tsvangirai with plotting to assassinate Mr Mugabe .
The opposition leader denies the charges and is out on bail .
The MDC case will centre on evidence that Zanu - PF inflated the voter turnout in rural areas , stuffed ballot boxes and locked out voters in the opposition 's urban strongholds .
Last month the opposition said it had found widespread disparities in the official voting figures , which showed that Mr Mugabe won the election by 56 % to Mr Tsvangdirai 's 42 % .
The state election supervisory commission 's voting tables differed widely from the results announced by the registrar general , Tobaiwa Mudede , opposition officials said in a report that included purported copies of the voting tables .
The tallies showed unusually high voter turnouts in ruling party strongholds and a decline in urban opposition strongholds since the parliamentary elections in 2000 .
Mr Tsvangirai denied yesterday that the court challenge was "" sour grapes "" on his part . ""
I do n't confer legitimacy on the government .
It is for the people of Zimbabwe , and they are the ones that have been short - changed , "" he said .
The MDC alleges that ruling party militants used violence to chase away opposition polling agents and either stuffed the ballot boxes during their absence or understated the MDC votes during the counting .
Mr Tsvangirai said the court action would be withdrawn if Zanu - PF acted in good faith in talks due to resume on May 13 .
The talks , mediated by Nigeria and South Africa , opened this week with the MDC calling for an immediate end to the continued state violence , in which more than a dozen opposition supporters have died since the election . ""
While we appreciate that there are talks taking place , we only had 30 days to file this election petition , "" Mr Tsvangirai said .
"" We could not forfeit the remedy given to the MDC by law . """
2002-05-20,"The Zimbabwean opposition leader , Morgan Tsvangirai , said yesterday that his party would lead thousands of people in protest against President Robert Mugabe 's government within weeks , following the collapse of its talks with the governing party , Zanu - PF . ""
Mass action is inevitable and unavoidable , "" he told the Guardian .
"" We have come to a stage where non - violent action has to be taken .
The assessment we have from consulting with the people is that they are prepared to protest against this illegitimate government . ""
The call to the streets is a new step for Mr Tsvangirai , and is expected to increase the tension in Zimbabwe .
He said the protests would take place "" soon "" .
"" Even three weeks or a month is too long . ""
In recent weeks Mr Tsvangirai has addressed several rallies .
"" I have been going around the country and I tell you the mood is combative and defiant , "" he said .
"" I am glad there is consensus between the rural and urban divide about the illegitimacy of the government . ""
As a responsible leadership we are going to channel their emotions in a positive way that will resolve the crisis this country is in . ""
Mr Tsvangirai and his Movement for Democratic Change have refused to accept Mr Mugabe 's victory in the March presidential election .
Mr Mugabe said in the state - controlled Sunday Mail yesterday that his government was prepared "" to talk peace if the MDC wants to talk peace , but if they choose violence , then we will deal with them effectively "" ."
2002-07-27,"The Zimbabwean police say they plan to charge Morgan Tsvangirai , the opposition leader widely believed to have been robbed of victory in April 's rigged presidential election , with threatening President Robert Mugabe .
They contend that Mr Tsvangirai committed an offence under the new security laws when he told a rally of his Movement for Democratic Change in May that Mr Mugabe would have to leave office .
He can be jailed for up to 20 years if he is convicted of "" undermining the office of the president "" .
Mr Tsvangirai is already facing treason charges for calling for the violent overthrow of Mr Mugabe before the election and , separately , for allegedly plotting to assassinate the president .
The primary evidenced for the second charge is a highly suspect video that emerged just before the presidential ballot .
The police questioned him for several hours on Thursday but his lawyer , Innocent Chagonda , said the MDC leader refused to concede that he had said anything that could be construed as criminal .
His client had not been formally notified of charges .
An MDC MP is also under arrest for allegedly threatening government supporters during campaigning for municipal elections in Kadoma , about 75 miles west of Harare .
The political crisis has further deepened Zimbabwe 's economic woes .
The government has announced a 500 % increase on import duty on "" luxury goods "" after admitting that the economy is expected to shrink by about 11 % this year ."
2002-08-03,"Date set for Tsvangirai trial
A court in Zimbabwe has ruled that the opposition leader , Morgan Tsvangirai , will stand trial in November on charges that he plotted to assassinate the president , Robert Mugabe .
The treason charges against the leader of the Movement for Democratic Change were filed in March after a Canadian - based company released a secretly recorded video of a meeting , which they said incriminated Mr Tsvangirai .
The treason charges carry the death penalty .

2002-10-12,"Zimbabwe 's opposition leader , Morgan Tsvangirai , yesterday urged the United Nations to investigate the growing number of incidents of state torture in the country .
"" We are witnessing an alarming rise of cases of torture , electric shocks and beatings perpetrated by the police , "" Mr Tsvangirai told the Guardian .
"" We are calling on the UN human rights commission to urgently investigate this .
It would help to stop the carnage , the violence and human rights abuses that are taking place in the country .
"" It is clear that Zimbabwe 's political crisis is deepening and state torture is being used to suppress any opposition to the Mugabe regime .
We are appealing to the UN to look into this as soon as possible , "" added Mr Tsvangirai , the leader of the Movement for Democratic Change ( MDC ) .
"" We are appealing to the international community to help us stop the torture and to hold the perpetrators accountable .
The police , the army , the CIO [ central intelligence organisation ] , the militia are all being used to inflict violence and brutality against the people .
They are on a campaign to crush our opposition party . ""
More than 1,050 cases of torture in Zimbabwe have been documented this year , according to a report issued this week by the Human Rights Forum .
Linos Mushonga , a Harare city councillor and MDC member , said he repeatedly lost consciousness from police giving him electric shocks .
"" They attached electrodes to my toes , my fingers and my penis .
They said they were going to punish me for supporting the opposition , "" Mr Mushonga said .
"" They switched the current on again and again .
The pain shot through my body and I saw white , like lightning .
I went into convulsions .
"" The torture took place at Chinamora police station at the end of August , he said .
"" I had been blindfolded but I knew we were at the Chinamora station because I could hear the police radio communications . ""
Mr Mushonga was not released until September 17 ; he was then in hospital for eight days .
Doctors ' reports confirm injuries consistent with electric shocks and beatings .
"" If the police can do this to me , a city councillor , then who is safe in Zimbabwe ? ""
Mr Mushonga asked .
"" This has happened to many other people .
The international community is letting us down .
How can Augustine Chihuri [ Zimbabwe 's police commissioner ] be a vice - president of Interpol ?
How can he be the chairman of the southern African regional police organisation ? ""
Other recent reports of torture include Tom Tawanda Spicer , 18 , a leader of the MDC 's youth wing , who was also shocked into convulsions and beaten , according to medical reports .
He claims his torture took place at Harare 's central police station . ""
This is happening at police stations across the country , "" admitted a member of the police force , who would not give his name for fear of retribution .
"" Many of us are ashamed of it
but if we protest we are reprimanded .
"" Zimbabwean human rights groups are compiling reports of torture and offering medical treatment and counselling to the victims .
Those groups are also facing the wrath of the Mugabe government .
Recently police raided the offices of the Amani Trust and arrested Dr Frances Lovemore , who treats victims of violence .
He was jailed for more than 24 hours before being released without charge . ·
A leading US food aid official warned yesterday that Zimbabwe would face a "" major famine "" if the government did not allow massive amounts of food to be imported by the end of the year .

2003-01-13,"Mediators acting for top government officials have floated the idea that President Robert Mugabe would retire in return for immunity from prosecution , Zimbabwe 's opposition leader , Morgan Tsvangirai , disclosed last night .
Mr Tsvangirai said he had talked with independent mediators on behalf of the house speaker , Emmerson Mnangagwa , and armed forces chief of staff , General Vitalis Zvinavashe . ""
They wanted my assurance that if Mugabe retired , [ the Movement for Democratic Change , Zimbabwe 's opposition party ] would take part in a transition towards new democratic elections . ""
Gen Zvinavashe and Mr Mnangagwa , seen as Mr Mugabe 's heir apparent , are two of the most powerful ruling Zanu - PF politicians .
Mr Tsvangirai said the ap proach was made because they said they realise Mr Mugabe "" is the main stumbling block "" .
"" They said Mugabe must step down before we can find solutions to our economic decline and the hunger , among many other problems . ""
Mr Tsvangirai named retired Zimbabwean army Colonel Lionel Dyke , a close associate of both men , as a mediator .
The mediators said the two Zanu - PF leaders would secure Mr Mugabe 's retirement to regain some international legitimacy for the country and renew aid and investment .
Mr Tsvangirai thought that Mr Mnangagwa and Gen Zvinavashe had tried to set up talks because there is no clear Mugabe successor . ""
Clearly , the succession issue has not been concluded and they were trying to position themselves . ""
Despite the apparent promise that Mr Mugabe would step down , the opposi tion leader turned down the mediators ' suggestions .
"" I rejected that exploratory approach because we in Zimbabwe need open , transparent discussions to lead us back to democracy .
We can not accept preconditions set up in secret deals , "" he said .
"" There will be other approaches because negotiation is the only way to bring an end to our crisis . ""
Mr Tsvangirai 's MDC held direct talks with Zanu - PF last year .
The talks quickly broke down but Mr Tsvangirai said he thought there was a good chance for their renewal .
Mr Tsvangirai said talks could determine how Mr Mugabe would step down and the establishment of a transitional coalition government leading to free and fair elections .
Issues to be considered include whether or not Mr Mugabe would be granted immunity from prosecution for alleged human rights abuses and whether he would be exiled .
Mr Tsvangirai has stated many times that any power - sharing government would only be temporary .
Zanu - PF party officials were unavailable for comment .
There has been no response from Mr Mugabe himself , who was scheduled to return to office today after a holiday .
Mr Mugabe , 78 , who led the nation to independence in 1980 , won a new six - year term in elections last March that independent observers said were deeply flawed .
Mr Tsvangirai indicated that his party is willing to soften its calls for Mr Mugabe to be put on trial for alleged crimes in order to get the president to retire . ""
Circumstances dictate behaviour , "" said Mr Tsvangirai .
"" The country is on its knees . ""
Britain 's shadow foreign secretary , Michael Ancram , said : "" Anything that shows any movement in relation to ending Mugabe 's evil regime must be greeted with cautious welcome . ""
Mr Ancram said he wanted to know more about the suggested deal , particularly those concerning an end to the persecution of the Matabele , the displaced black farm workers , and the illegal land grabs .
"" I obviously will wish to consult with opposition members in Zimbabwe before deciding whether this offer is genuine or cosmetic . ""
Prof Paul Wilkinson , an international relations expert from St Andrews University , said such a deal would be "" extraordinary "" if it happened .
But to be successful , he said , the move would need wider support , preferably from Mr Mugabe himself , or at least senior ministers and the ruling Zanu - PF party machine ."

2003-01-13,"Cricket 's Zimbabwe crisis has rumbled on for a month or more before England have voiced their deepest fear : that any unilateral withdrawal from their World Cup tie in Harare risks another damaging split in the world game .
With Zimbabwe 's opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai due to face trial on February 3 on charges of plotting to assassinate Robert Mugabe and protests over food and fuel shortages spreading to the cities , World Cup organisers may yet have to accept that rescheduling of the Zimbabwe matches is inevitable .
But far from "" faffing around "" ( Nasser Hussain ) or entirely lacking moral conscience ( just about everybody else ) , cricket 's authorities are responding responsibly to the challenge of holding together the fabric of world cricket .
Perhaps a second safety and security delegation will visit Zimbabwe this month and conclude that the matches must be played elsewhere .
But it will not be an argument won by British political bluster .
Cricket might have had its roots in the British Empire but
it now prospers in the Commonwealth , which is a more complex thing altogether .
England 's unilateral refusal to play a World Cup match in Harare would further diminish their influence and leave international cricket even more in the control of an Asian - African power bloc .
The old colonial powers of England , Australia and New Zealand would be routinely outvoted by a six - nation majority led by India and South Africa .
The cheap jibes aimed at Hussain 's players for their lack of political nous stick in the craw .
It is entirely possible that what this England side knows about Zimbabwe could be written on the back of a Qantas boarding card .
But it is also likely that most people who answer "" yes "" or "" no "" to the question "" Should England boycott their World Cup tie in Harare ? ""
have not studied the issue in depth either .
English cricket has every right to feel bitter .
One commentator has even called for the MCC to cancel the match forthwith - as if , mysteriously , the Marylebone Cricket Club had resumed the control over the English game that it relinquished years ago .
Similarly , cricket 's governing body , the International Cricket Council , has been pilloried in a fashion which assumes that just because its headquarters are at Lord 's and its chairman and chief executive are Australian , it is still in the control of white middle - class colonials with a dismissive attitude to matters of conscience that might disturb their complacency .
Let us understand this once and for all : England is no longer the most powerful voice in world cricket .
We can not force the ICC to abandon the Zimbabwe leg of World Cup with a couple of broadsheet editorials and a statement in the House .
Perhaps all this talk of invading Iraq has given us delusions of Empire again .
When Jack Straw brokered the one - year suspension of Zimbabwe from the Commonwealth in protest at last year 's corrupt elections he recognised the vital part played by President Thabo Mbeki of South Africa .
Had the government wished to make political gestures during the cricket World Cup , it needed to broker a similarly intelligent deal .
But instead of working alongside English cricket for the past six months to find a solution , the government has become embroiled in a petty bout of points - scoring with English cricket officials .
The fact is that in Britain , for every cricket lover there is a splenetic cricket - hater .
It has been unclear recently whether some people are really out to get Mugabe , an evil dictator , or a game that for some reason they subconsciously despise .
It is perfectly legitimate to possess a moral conscience and also to conclude that to play cricket against Zimbabwe in Harare is not to legitimise the tyrannical regime of Mugabe , but is an expression of support towards an oppressed family member .
Zimbabwean cricket is not a product of an evil regime - as was South African cricket in the apartheid years - but has worked hard to develop decent multi - racial credentials which are worthy of preservation for the day when Mugabe 's appalling regime is finally ended .
It is an argument that , in England at least , has been lost .
But it is an argument that is more complex than many have allowed ."
2003-01-14,"Zimbabwe 's ruling Zanu - PF party yesterday scrambled to deny reports that two leading officials approached the opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai with a plan for President Robert Mugabe to step down .
"" This is a wicked , malicious and mischievous attempt to bring the British - sponsored MDC [ the Movement for Democratic Change , Zimbabwe 's opposition party ] to power by unconstitutional means , "" said Zanu - PF 's secretary for information , Nathan Shamuyarira , on state radio .
But Mr Tsvangirai insisted last night that the "" exit plan "" for Mr Mugabe to leave office before his term expires in 2008 was proposed to him by a mediator acting for two top party officials - the parliamentary Speaker , Emmerson Mnangagwa , and General Vitalis Zvinavashe , chief of staff of the armed forces .
"" They asked for the cooperation of the MDC in a transitional period after Mugabe leaves power , "" said Mr Tsvangirai .
"" That initial effort has collapsed , but I am sure there will be more such initiatives .
Everyone is desperate to find a solution to Zimbabwe 's crisis . ""
He said that the solution will come when the two parties , Zanu - PF and the MDC , sit down at a table and negotiate over a return to democracy .
Mr Tsvangirai is due to stand trial on February 3 for allegedly plotting to have Mr Mugabe assassinated by a Canadian consultancy firm .
The state radio also carried a denial by Gen Zvinavashe , who dismissed the report of his involvement as "" the work of enemies bent on destroying the country "" .
The radio news also stated that Mr Mnangagwa , the other alleged co - conspirator , had "" no knowledge "" of the plan .
The denials may have backfired , as they served to increase speculation about how much longer the 78-year - old president can stay in power . ""
Even the ZBC [ state radio ] is talking about Mugabe stepping down from power , "" said a motorist waiting in a half - mile queue for petrol .
"" Of course he must step down .
This country has no fuel , no mealie meal and no rule of law . ""
South Africa also denied involvement in any attempt to replace him with a coalition government , pending new elections .
"" South Africa is neither aware of nor party to the reported deal , "" said a foreign affairs spokesman , Ronnie Mamoepa .
The government in Pretoria was involved in an effort to get Zanu - PF and the MDC to negotiate last year after Mr Mugabe 's disputed re - election in March .
But the effort quickly broke down .
The new attempt at negotiation is seen as significant because it came from two of the highest ranking members of Mr Mugabe 's party .
It seems likely that Mr Mugabe did not know of their efforts to open talks with Mr Tsvangirai . ""
This was clearly an attempt to test the waters for a negotiated end to Mugabe 's rule , "" said Brian Raftopoulos , chairman of the Zimbabwe Crisis Committee .
"" It may not have succeeded , but the pressure is increasing for such negotiations , both internally and internationally .
This negotiating could carry on . ""
Mr Mugabe has not issued any comment on the reports .
He is currently on an extended holiday in Thailand that has raised criticism from average Zimbabweans , who say he should not be out spending money when the country is grappling with economic problems .
The minister of information , Jonathan Moyo , was also busy denying South African press reports that he had gone on a shopping spree while on holiday in Johannesburg .
The reports also stated that police were called to his hotel because he was allegedly beating his wife .
Mr Moyo blamed "" British intelligence "" .
· Zimbabwe 's high court yesterday ordered the release of Harare 's opposition mayor , Elias Mudzuri , for holding a meeting without police approval , as required by tough new laws that the opposition says are aimed at gagging it .
The court said the police had failed to produce enough evidence to hold him ."
2003-01-28,"The European Union 's policy on Zimbabwe was in disarray last night as foreign ministers failed to agree on a new package of sanctions because of a row over France 's controversial invitation to Robert Mugabe to attend a summit in Paris .
In Zimbabwe , the opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai said more than 1,000 of his supporters had been tortured in the past year by the Mugabe regime , and called for an investigation by the UN , Commonwealth and Interpol .
His Movement for Democratic Change said it was "" frustrated and disappointed "" , by the EU 's failure to agree further sanctions .
The EU 's visa ban , assets freeze and other punitive measures imposed on Zimbabwe 's president and his top aides last year are due to expire next month , but have become embroiled in angry disagreements and recriminations .
George Papandreou , foreign minister of Greece , the current holder of the EU 's presidency , said after what diplomats called a "" difficult "" meeting in Brussels that another attempt would have to be made to forge consensus .
EU ambassadors are expected to meet on the issue later this week .
He warned that an EU - Africa summit , scheduled for Lisbon in April , might not go ahead .
Britain and five other member states warned that they will not send their heads of government to Lisbon if Mr Mugabe is invited .
Several African countries have said they will not attend if the Zimbabwean leader is absent .
The crisis over the EU 's so - called "" smart "" sanctions has come to a head over France 's decision to invite Mr Mugabe to a Franco - African summit in Paris on February 19 , a day after the measures are due to expire .
France came under fire for breaking ranks with its partners , but if any of its critics had objected , Paris would have blocked the renewal of the sanctions , which must be agreed unanimously .
"" The important thing is to ensure that we have the sanctions and continue to make clear our disapproval about the way the Mugabe regime works , "" one diplomat said .
Officials said a possible compromise was for future sanctions to be governed by majority voting if a country sought an exemption .
France says it wants to discuss democracy and human rights with the Zimbabwean leader .
Dominique de Villepin , the French foreign minister , said the measures should be interpreted "" flexibly "" .
The sanctions were imposed last year in protest against elections that the EU and the US branded unfair and illegitimate .
They were also in response to the confiscation of white - owned farms and the crackdown on the independent press , the judiciary and the opposition .
Anna Lindh , Sweden 's foreign minister , said : "" It gives a very strange signal if the EU is having sanctions against Zimbabwe and at the same time is inviting Mugabe , even if it is one country inviting him to a special conference . ""
Glenys Kinnock , the British Labour MEP , said : "" The future of EU sanctions has now been thrown into a melting pot which threatens the very survival of those sanctions . ""
The whole episode has shown the EU at its most ineffective , conducting laborious negotiations to agree a common policy only to have individual member states seek exceptions .
The United States has already called the French invitation regrettable and urged the EU to enforce the travel ban against Mugabe and his close associates .
In Zimbabwe , Mr Tsvangirai said the spate of regime - led violence had resulted in some 30 political murders in the country between January and November 2002 .
"" Our leaders are arrested , often on trumped - up charges , in order to torture them , "" he told a news conference .
"" A number of MDC party functionaries have been tortured and subsequently died as a result . ""
Amnesty Interational and Zimbabwe 's Human Rights Forum have also reported an alarming rise in cases of torture in Zimbabwe .
They said police stepped up torture of opposition members , including four members of parliament , in an effort to crush dissent ahead of the cricket World Cup matches to be played in Zimbabwe , and forthcoming diplomatic efforts to resolve Zimbabwe 's political and economic crisis .
The calls follow the torture allegations by an opposition MP , Job Sikhala , and his lawyer , Gabriel Shumba ."

Mr President , you are our true leader , ' said a beaming vendor .
Others chanted : ' We are hungry , we are hungry . '

This week will be especially tough for Tsvangirai , who goes on trial tomorrow for his alleged involvement in an assasination attempt on Zimbawe 's tyrannical leader , Robert Mugabe .
In an exclusive interview with The Observer , Tsvangirai declared this weekend that his country was now facing a ' torture emergency ' . '
The UN should send its special rapporteur ; the Commonwealth should investigate .
This is a universal appeal to all international bodies , government and human rights organisations to investigate what is going on here .
In the name of human rights , it must stop . '
Tsvangirai bitterly attacked France and Portugal for inviting Mugabe to summits in their capitals in defiance of European Union sanctions , charging that they will be ' toasting with goblets of the blood of innocent women and children ' .
In the marketplace on Friday , the support for Tsvangirai was tangible , even from a young man who came up in a T - shirt emblazoned with the emblem of Zanu - PF , Mugabe 's ruling party . '
What 's this ? ' said Tsvangirai in a jocular tone . '
It 's just a T - shirt , ' said the man , shaking hands and smiling .
' I have to have something to wear . '
Some told Tsvangirai how brave he was to stand up to Mugabe .
Others said : ' Where have you been ?
We need you ! '
Within a few minutes Tsvangirai got back in his truck and was off to visit other markets as well as the endless queues - fuel queues , bus queues and food queues - that define Zimbabwe today .
They were lightning visits , designed to avoid Zimbabwe 's police , who have used draconian security laws to disperse meetings that Tsvangirai was scheduled to address .
After keeping a relatively low profile since the March presidential elections , which he narrowly lost to Mugabe amid widespread charges of state violence and voting fraud , Tsvangirai is reinvigorated and taking the offensive against the government .
Tsvangirai is enthusiastically received wherever he goes and the whistle - stop walkabouts are marked by cheers , joking and a lack of the menace and thuggish threats that are the hallmarks of Mugabe 's Zanu - PF .
It has been many years since Mugabe has ventured out to meet the public .
Tsvangirai , 51 , appeared relaxed and cheerful , but he has many challenges to face , not least tomorrow .
He has dismissed the charges as ' trumped - up allegations , part of a campaign of spurious charges against our party 's leaders to try to derail us .
We are confident these charges will not hold up in court ' .
In the past few weeks , 10 supporters of Tsvangirai 's Movement for Democratic Change ( MDC ) have been arrested , including three MPs and a lawyer .
They allege that they were tortured by police , including beatings , clubbing and electric shocks to the genitals .
Their charges are supported by independent medical examinations .
In January , Zimbabwe was rocked by the news that two of Mugabe 's top deputies allegedly approached Tsvangirai to see if he would join in a transitional government if they could convince Mugabe to take early retirement .
The news established Tsvangirai as a key player in any negotiations to resolve Zimbabwe 's ongoing crisis . '
Anyone who wants to find a solution must come to the MDC because we have the allegiance of the people , ' Tsvangirai said . '
Mugabe may have the power and the position , but he is totally lacking in democratic legitimacy .
People are looking to the MDC because it stands up for democracy and speaks up for the issues that affect everyone .
Zanu - PF knows the time for testing the waters is fast running out .
Negotiations to resolve the economic crisis must take place now , or very soon . '
The economic realities are very evident .
The government is insolvent and the situation is totally unsustainable .
When people are going hungry , we are clearly at the wall .
The peoples ' suffering must stop .
That is the key . '
Mugabe 's government estimates that eight million of the country 's 12 million people are threatened with starvation . '
The government alone can not deal with the magnitude of the food shortages , yet it wants to control food for political reasons , ' Tsvangirai said . '
There is evidence that food is being steered away from the areas of MDC support .
Buhera [ Tsvangirai 's home area ] and Binga have been starved of any food from the state Grain Marketing Board . '
It is only because of the intervention of international non - governmental organisations that there has not been serious loss of life .
And the fuel shortage makes things worse .
There is no diesel to transport food . '
South Africa and Nigeria both sent Cabinet Ministers to Zimbabwe in January who publicly supported Mugabe and did not meet Tsvangirai or any other MDC member .
Tsvangirai denounced South Africa and Nigeria for supporting Mugabe rather than mediating between all sides . '
We in the MDC recognise the role of South Africa in help ing to point the way forward for us .
South Africa has the historical precedent of always being part of the solution for this country .
Our concern is over the strategy the Mbeki government has employed .
We question whether it can serve as an honest broker . '
We believe they have compromised themselves by openly supporting Zanu - PF .
This support started with the March elections , but it is now more robust .
The Labour Minister visited here and loudly supported Zanu - PF , the Foreign Minister , too .
And at the ACP meeting , South Africa supported Mugabe .
So it is natural for us to distrust them . '
Tsvangirai spelled out what he believes is necessary to return the troubled country to democracy . '
The first thing is that Mugabe has got to go .
Mugabe 's arrogance and defiance is becoming a national liability , ' he said . '
Let 's recognise that Zanu - PF , although it is part of the problem , is also part of the solution .
It must be involved in the transitional authority that we are proposing .
The elections must be conducted according to the standards of the Southern African Development Community [ SADC - the group of 15 southern African nations ] . '
African countries have developed their own standards for democratic elections and these must be adhered to , Tsvangirai said . '
To allow democracy to function freely is the only way out . '
We recognise that Mbeki needs a solution to Zimbabwe 's crisis , too .
If there is anything we can do to bridge the gap of misunderstanding with South Africa , then we will try it .
But they must deal with us honestly and fairly . '
South Africa has gone through a commendable process of changing governments using national healing and reconciliation , fully democratic elections , the creation of a legitimate constitution that gives power to the people .
We can learn from all those steps . '
The next few months are crucial , he said .
' There are many events that are coming up : the Commonwealth decision in March whether to expel Zimbabwe or maintain its suspension ; Nigerian president Obasanjo will visit here in February ; EU heads of state will meet with their ACP partners soon ; the UN is to consider Zimbabwe .
What the international community should say is "" We want to help "" . '
The international community should not think this is just between two political parties ; they must help the whole nation .
To do that they must consult with all the civic organisations in the space between the parties .
All stakeholders should be consulted ; only then can we move forward together . '"
2003-02-03,"The treason trial of the Zimbabwean opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai is to open today , but it is President Robert Mugabe 's government and the country 's legal system that is expected to come under international scrutiny .
Mr Tsvangirai and two senior officials of his Movement for Democratic Change are charged with plotting to have Mr Mugabe assassinated .
Mr Tsvangirai has dismissed the allegations as "" trumped - up charges , fabrications designed to discredit the MDC "" .
Mr Tsvangirai said he is working to end Mr Mugabe 's rule , but strictly through democratic means .
With inflation at 200 % , two - thirds of the country 's 12 million people threatened with starvation , crippling shortages of fuel and other essential items , most Zimbabweans may be inclined to believe Mr Tsvangirai .
The three accused will be defended by a team headed by the renowned South African anti - apartheid lawyer George Bizos .
The government accuses Mr Tsvangirai of hiring a Canadian political consultancy firm to assassinate Mr Mugabe .
That company , Dickens and Madson , is on record as being employed by Mr Mugabe 's government , so the defence will argue that any evidence it provides is highly suspect .
The state 's chief witness will be the company 's director Ari Ben - Menashe , a former Israeli Mossad agent described by Time magazine as a "" veteran spinner of stunning - if - true - but yarns "" .
Accusing his opposition of treason is not a new tactic for Mr Mugabe .
In 1982 he charged the rival nationalist leader Joshua Nkomo and officials of his Zapu party with plotting to topple him .
They were acquitted , but were imprisoned for seven years without charges .
In 1996 another opposition leader , the Reverend Ndabaningi Sithole , also alleged a frame - up after being being convicted of plotting to kill Mr Mugabe ."
2003-02-04,"The trial for treason of the Zimbabwean opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai opened yesterday amid scenes of violence and chaos with baton - wielding police preventing diplomats , MPs , lawyers and journalists from entering court .
Two journalists were arrested and police raised truncheons at several European Union diplomats who were brusquely shoved away from the court entrance .
"" Is this the rule of law in Zimbabwe ? "" said Priscilla Misihairabwi , an opposition MP , as police threatened to arrest her .
"" This is a public place .
It is a public court .
What have you got to hide ? ""
Mr Tsvangirai , the leader of the Movement for Democratic Change ( MDC ) and two senior party officials are charged with plotting to have President Robert Mugabe assassinated .
If convicted they could face the death penalty .
Mr Tsvangirai has dismissed the allegations as "" trumped - up charges "" designed to smear him and his party .
The charges were made in February last year , only a month before Mr Tsvangirai ran in presidential elections which Mr Mugabe narrowly won amid widespread state violence and evidence of massive voting fraud .
The Commonwealth and western governments dismissed Mr Mugabe 's election as illegitimate .
Mr Tsvangirai , 51 , arrived to cheers from a crowd of 200 supporters , which apparently enraged the police who began angrily pushing people away with their batons .
His co - defendants , the MDC secretary - general , Welshman Ncube , and the MP Renson Gasela , were refused entry until it was pointed out that the trial could not take place without them .
The US ambassador , Joseph Sullivan , was pushed away but eventually was allowed to enter the court .
"" It has important implications for the rule of law and democratic pluralism in Zimbabwe , "" Mr Sullivan said .
That meant little to the riot police who pushed the German deputy ambassador , Jan Hendrik van Thiel , when he presented his diplomatic card .
"" Get away from here , "" shouted a policeman .
"" You are no longer a diplomat .
We will get you . ""
"" Do n't allow anyone to enter , "" ordered a plainclothes policeman .
"" We do n't allow anyone to enter .
This is not parliament , "" he said to opposition MPs .
The heavy - handed police tactics are seen as a taste of what is to come at the World Cup cricket matches to be held in Zimbabwe , starting in Harare on February 10 .
"" This is not logical , "" said an angry European envoy .
"" The government has made so much about this treason trial that they should want the world to see that it is proceeding in an orderly fashion .
But this kind of behaviour makes one question the entire process .
It is crazy . ""
Eventually the president of the high court judges , Paddington Garwe , issued an order that diplomats , journalists and interested members of the public should be allowed to enter .
This allowed the British high commissioner and the German and Spanish ambassadors to attend the afternoon session .
But police continued to refuse entrance to several journalists working for the foreign press , saying the courtroom was filled to capacity .
Lawyers inside , however , said the public galleries were nearly empty .
Bharat Patel , the deputy attorney general , opened the state 's case , saying : "" Their opposition and desire for political power is not criminal as such but it is their desire to overthrow a government and to occupy positions through undemocratic means which is criminal .
It is their unlawful desire of seeking to attain political power that the state seeks to punish . ""
The case centres on a secretly recorded videotape of a meeting between Mr Tsvangirai and the Canadian consultant Ari Ben Menashe in which the opposition leader purportedly sought to hire assassins to eliminate Mr Mugabe .
Mr Menashe claims to be a former Israeli intelligence officer and arms dealer and now heads the Canadian consulting firm Dickens and Madson .
The firm is on record as being hired by the Mugabe government to improve its image , therefore its evidence against Mr Tsvangirai will be questioned as unreliable .
Mr Tsvangirai said the firm offered to help the MDC buff up its image in the west .
But Mr Ben Menashe , who is the main state witness , said that Mr Tsvangirai wanted him to have Mr Mugabe killed .
The renowned South African anti - apartheid lawyer George Bizos , who is leading Mr Tsvangirai 's defence , said the government 's evidence has been "" heavily doctored "" to implicate the three defendants .
"" We agree that this is a trial with heavy political overtones and undertones , "" said Mr Bizos , giving an outline of the defence case .
"" This was a trap .
The accused are innocent as they have said .
"" The case comes as Zimbabwe faces a deepening economic crisis with two - thirds of its 12 million population threatened with starvation , a crippling fuel shortage and inflation at 200 % .
Tensions are high and it is feared by many that the trial of the popular Mr Tsvangirai could set off an angry reaction ."
2003-02-05,"A self - avowed former Israeli spy claimed in a Harare courtroom yesterday that the Zimbabwean opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai plotted a coup to depose Robert Mugabe - backed by £ 6 m from the British government .
Ari Ben Menashe , a political consultant based in Canada who claims to be a former Israeli intelligence agent , testified that the leader of the opposition Movement for Democratic Change ( MDC ) had asked him to assassinate Mr Mugabe and carry out a coup .
At their first meeting , at the Hilton Hotel at Heathrow airport , Mr Ben Menashe alleged that Mr Tsvangirai told him : "" Mugabe will not leave office unless he is carried out in coffin ...
he has to be killed , it has to look like an accident and nothing to do with the MDC . ""
He claimed that Mr Tsvangirai and his associates took out a $ 500,000 ( £ 300,000 ) contract for the assassination .
Mr Ben Menashe , the state 's star witness , alleged that Mr Tsvangirai said that when he became president he would give Mr Ben Menashe 's firm contracts worth around £ 20 m .
The consultant said he set up an operation to secretly record video evidence against Mr Tsvangirai and two other senior MDC officials , secretary - general Welshman Ncube and Renson Gasela , an MP .
He claims that it was only later that he was hired by the Zimbabwean government to improve its image .
He also claims the Mugabe government owes him $ 1 m ( £ 600,000 ) .
He alleges that Mr Tsvangirai said the British government would provide £ 6 m to pay the Zimbabwe air force commander , Air Marshal Perence Shiri , to lead a coup against Mr Mugabe .
Mr Ben Menashe said he never saw the money .
The MDC leaders deny the charge .
They could face the death penalty if convicted .
The charges stem from a videotape secretly recorded by Mr Ben Menashe in his Montreal office during a meeting with Mr Tsvangirai in 2001 .
Both the defence and the independent Zimbabwe Mass Media Monitoring Project has said the videotapes have been heavily edited .
The tape shown in court yesterday was badly muffled and at no time did
Mr Tsvangirai say he wanted Mr Mugabe murdered .
The key statement from Mr Tsvangirai on the tape was : "" The discussion was not about elimination of Mugabe .
The discussion was about the elections and the post - election outcome . """
2003-04-01,"Zimbabwe 's main opposition party celebrated crucial byelection victories in the capital yesterday , billing them as a springboard for mass action to topple President Robert Mugabe .
"" This is only the beginning of the struggle to recapture the stolen presidential poll , so that the sovereignty of the people of Zimbabwe is consolidated , "" the Movement for Democratic Change 's president , Morgan Tsvangirai , said after his party 's two victories .
"" In the days ahead we shall be working frantically to put in place strategies that will rid the country of the crises that stem largely from the illegitimacy of the Mugabe regime . ""
Political tensions rose across the country , as the MDC 's vice - president , Gibson Sibanda , was arrested in Bulawayo and Harare was surrounded by armed roadblocks .
Extra army units guarded Mr Mugabe 's official residence .
Despite unprecedented state violence , widespread intimidation and evidence of massive vote - rigging , the opposition retained its parliamentary seats in two townships of Harare , where the ruling party holds none of the 19 seats .
"" We won !
They used every trick in the book but they still could not defeat us , "" an exultant MDC supporter , Derek Madharani , said .
"" We are celebrating in the streets .
People are so happy .
We know the army will come and beat us tonight , but we do n't care . ""
Mr Mugabe 's party , with 95 seats , enjoys a comfortable majority in the 150-strong parliament and victory in the two byelections would have taken it a step closer towards the two - thirds majority it needs to enact constitutional changes .
Mr Tsvangirai yesterday warned that his party intended to launch mass action against the government .
The MDC had issued an ultimatum to the government to restore democracy and human rights by yesterday or face a popular uprising .
"" The people of Zimbabwe must now be on permanent alert , "" he said .
"" They must be ready to heed the call for the final demand on the Mugabe regime to be accountable to the people and to restore their sovereign right to be governed by a government of their own choice .
This will be the final push that will restore our sovereignty , liberty and freedom . ""
Gibson Sibanda , a trade unionist , was arrested in Bulawayo early yesterday .
He was expected to be charged under the draconian security laws for organising a successful , largely peaceful , two - day national strike last month .
His arrest could be a prelude to jailing Mr Tsvangirai .
Calls by government leaders for Mr Tsvangirai to be put behind bars were prominently reported throughout the weekend on state television , radio and in the newspapers .
The home affairs minister , Kembo Mohadi , who is in charge of the police , said the courts should revoke the bail of the MDC leader , who is on trial for treason .
The two parliamentary victories were in Harare 's low - income residential areas of Highfield and Kuwadzana .
The MDC candidate in Highfield defeated the war veteran Joseph Chinotimba , notorious for inciting violence on farms and in the capital , by a vote of 8,759 to 4,844 .
In Kuwadzana , a popular MDC youth leader routed the ruling party 's candidate by 12,548 votes to 5,002 .
The relatively low turnout of just over 30 % of registered voters was blamed on the high levels of intimidation .
Gangs of youths from the ruling Zanu - PF party patrolled the voting queues in violation of election regulations , sometimes chasing away people coming to vote , according to independent poll observers ."
2003-05-06,"In a move hailed as the first step towards solving Zimbabwe 's deepening crisis , President Robert Mugabe came under concerted pressure from three African leaders to begin negotiations with the opposition party , the Movement for Democratic Change ( MDC ) .
Presidents Thabo Mbeki of South Africa , Olusegun Obasanjo of Nigeria and Bakili
Muluzi of Malawi met Mr Mugabe for two hours yesterday to encourage his ruling Zanu - PF party to hold talks with the MDC .
After meeting Mr Mugabe , the leaders met the MDC leader , Morgan Tsvangirai , for 90 minutes .
"" The three presidents agreed with me that Zimbabwe is in a dire state , "" said Mr Tsvangirai .
"" We agreed that we have to work out a solution .
The fundamental issue is that the MDC and Zanu - PF must get down and talk . ""
The inter - party negotiations would aim to establish a transitional period in which Mr Mugabe would retire and an interim government including both parties would be installed to pave the way for new , free and fair elections according to international standards , say African diplomats close to the talks .
However , Mr Mugabe has not welcomed the pressure from his fellow African leaders .
The state - owned Sunday Mail newspaper questioned whether the presidents were coming "" as African brothers or as agents of the British government "" .
Speaking after the talks , Mr Obasanjo said : "" It appears as if this country is sitting on a keg of gunpowder .
That might be an exaggeration , but things are definitely bad . ""
Mr Mugabe stuck to his demand that before any talks the MDC had to drop its legal challenge to his 2002 re - election , which the Commonwealth dismissed as rigged .
"" The MDC said they do n't recognise me alongside the British , the Americans and the Europeans .
Does the MDC now say they recognise me ?
That is the issue , "" he told reporters .
"" If they do , well , that means that the action now in court has to be withdrawn and we start talking . ""
Mr Tsvangirai has stated that the MDC is not willing to abandon its case .
The court case , alleging widespread state - sponsored violence and vote - rigging , is the opposition party 's only legal recourse .
Mr Tsvangirai has put forward his own conditions to the inter - party talks .
He said that all state - sponsored violence and torture against MDC supporters must stop and that the repressive Public Order and Security Act and the anti - press laws must be repealed .
"" It may be a halting step but this is none the less the first step in the movement towards a democratic government , "" said Iden Wetherell , the editor of the Zimbabwe Independent .
"" It may be a protracted and messy process , but it has now begun .
The visit of the three leaders represents a significant chink in the hitherto solid armour of African solidarity protecting Mugabe . ""
John Makumbe , the chairman of the Zimbabwe in Crisis Coalition , was cautious .
"" I believe Mugabe has a few more tricks left up his sleeve , "" he said .
"" The process has begun but I fear there will be ... more blood spilled before Mugabe actually steps down . ""
The visiting leaders were welcomed by about 300 female MDC supporters who gathered in the centre of the capital , Harare .
Jubilantly singing and dancing , they waved placards saying : "" Please advise Mugabe to step down "" , "" Tell Mugabe to go now "" and "" Women are being tortured "" .
Armed police charged the crowd and dragged away about 10 women , including some with babies .
But the action did not dampen the protesters ' spirits .
"" They can arrest us , but they can not stop us , "" said one woman after fleeing police ."

Now that presidents Olusegun Obasanjo of Nigeria , Thabo Mbeki of South Africa and Bakili Muluzi of Malawi are in the country , can we prepare a smile , marking good days to come ?

2003-05-12,"Harare treason trial resumes The treason trial of Zimbabwe 's opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai resumes today with state prosecutors ready to push ahead with charges that he plotted to assassinate President Robert Mugabe .
Mr Tsvangirai , who heads the Movement for Democratic Change , and two senior colleagues could face the death penalty if convicted .
The case hinges on a videotape of Mr Tsvangirai that the defence says was doctored .
Reuters , Harare Lithuanians say yes to EU Lithuanians voted strongly in favour of joining the European Union next year , officials said yesterday .
With 21 % of the ballots counted in the two - day referendum , 89 % had voted in favour . ""
The first returns that come in usually set the tone , "" the head of the election committee , Zenonas Vaigauskas , said .
Reuters , Vilnius"
2003-05-29,"The Zimbabwean opposition leader , Morgan Tsvangirai , is increasing the pressure on President Robert Mugabe by calling for a five - day national strike and urging the people to take to the streets .
"" Rise up in your millions and take part in nationwide peaceful protest marches for democracy and good governance to encourage Zanu - PF [ the government party ] to take dialogue seriously , "" he says in an advertisement published in the Daily News today .
Mass public protest is a new strategy for his party , the Movement for Democratic Change ( MDC ) , and it is not certain that the marches will succeed .
The regime has shown it is not afraid to use the police and army to break up public demonstrations critical of the government .
The security forces have not hesitated to use rifles and teargas against even small demonstrations , and they also have armoured personnel carriers fitted with water cannon and machine guns , bought from Israel last year .
Public anger at the shortage of food , fuel , electricity and even bank notes has risen to a new peak this week , convincing the MDC to bring forward the strike , originally planned for mid - June .
The stoppage is expected to be a significant vote of no confidence in the Mugabe regime .
The MDC has already closed the country down twice , with national strikes lasting two days and three days in March and April respectively .
"" The strike will be a success , there is no question about that , "" a Zimbabwean journalist said .
"" It is crunch time for the government .
Everybody is angry .
No one can get fuel .
No one can get cash , because the country has run out of currency .
No one can afford even basic food .
People are hungry .
We have electricity blackouts at any time .
And everyone knows who is wrong .
They blame the government .
"" Inflation is running at 260 % a year , according to official statistics , and many economists say it is even higher .
Workers have not been fully paid for the past two weeks because the banks are short of notes .
The government does not have the foreign currency to import ink and paper to print more of the increasingly worthless Zimbabwe dollar .
But even the rapidly growing public fury does not guarantee that the MDC will succeed in mobilising a huge protest .
It is difficult to concentrate a large number of people in the centre of Harare because most of the capital 's population live in townships up to 20 miles away . ""
It is difficult to say if the call for mass action will succeed , "" said a lawyer .
"" The anger of the people is palpable , you can feel it .
But so far no one has held a mass public protest , and people are afraid of being mowed down by the police and army . ""
But there is an increasing sense of desperation amongst many people that they have nothing to lose , and that will make it dangerous for the Mugabe regime .
"" Even if the protest does not succeed , it could pave the way for future action which could topple the regime , in the way that the former Yugoslav president Slobodan Milosevic was forced out of office in Belgrade by a popular uprising .
Brian Raftopoulos , chairman of the Zimbabwe in Crisis Coalition , said : "" The stay - away and mass action are not designed to topple the Mugabe regime ... they are geared towards adding pressure on Mugabe to enter negotiations . """
2003-06-02,"Zimbabwe 's opposition leader , Morgan Tsvangirai , was today arrested ahead of a week of anti - government strikes and demonstrations expected to be the biggest challenge yet to President Robert Mugabe 's rule .
Mr Tsvangirai , who leads the Movement for Democratic Change ( MDC ) , was picked up at his house and taken to Harare Central police station , opposition party sources told the Reuters news agency .
He was later released .
The former trade union leader , who is also currently on trial for treason , has become increasingly defiant in his calls for the people of Zimbabwe to rise up against Mr Mugabe and his policies .
The opposition blames the president for sinking the country into economic and political disarray .
The MDC has vowed to go ahead with plans for five days of protests this week despite a government pledge to hit hard on what it calls an illegal attempt to spur a coup d'etat .
In weekend advertisements headed "" Countdown to the final push "" , the opposition said : "" Any thought of the dictator giving up power quietly is sheer delusion .
The Zimbabweans story begins to unfold - sadly , in our streets .
We are now ready to go .
The end is now in sight . ""
In Harare it appeared the strike was taking hold , with most shops , banks , and factories closed .
Traffic was light , and only few commuter busses were running .
Opposition officials said they were planning for street demonstrations later in the day .
Over the weekend , the high court declared the protests illegal but the opposition plans to file an appeal against the ruling at the supreme court .
State television , in its nightly news yesterday evening , said anti - government demonstrations and strikes would be "" met with the full wrath of the law "" , the Associated Press reported .
Television showed troops and riot police being deployed in Harare , the capital , and file footage of tear gas being fired on demonstrators in previous protests .
The defence minister , Sidney Sekeramayi , told the Zimbabwe Broadcasting Corporation : "" Our soil is very sacrosanct .
We shall not allow it to be re - colonised . ""
Mr Mugabe 's government has frequently accused Mr Tsvangirai and the MDC of being British puppets in a plot by the former colonial power to oust the president .
Government - printed political leaflets distributed in Harare late last night said : "" No to mass action .
No to British puppets .
Let the workers go to work , let the children go to school and let the banks and businesses remain open .
Remain strong . ""
As part of their crackdown against demonstrations , police - manned roadblocks were set up along all the main roads leading into the capital and military helicopters swooped over the western city of Bulawayo .
Both cities are considered opposition strongholds .
Zimbabwe is facing its worst economic crisis since independence with record inflation of 269 % and acute shortages of hard currency , local money , petrol , medicines and food .
Only international food aid has averted mass starvation ."
2003-06-02,"Tanks moved into Harare 's townships yesterday and the security forces were put on alert in preparation for the start , today , of a week - long national strike and protests against President Robert Mugabe .
Panic buying highlighted the anxiety gripping the country after the opposition leader , Morgan Tsvangirai , urged Zimbabweans to "" rise up in their millions "" to demonstrate against Mr Mugabe .
Idah Mandaza , a worker in Harare , said : "" Everybody is getting ready .
This is the final push to tell Mugabe that he must go . ""
MDC leaders said the protests were designed to force Mr Mugabe to negotiate .
The government won a high court ruling over the weekend declaring the protests illegal .
The MDC lodged an appeal yesterday saying the protests would be peaceful .
Officials said they would not call off the protests .
Welshman Ncube , the secretary - general of the MDC , said : "" Engaging in peaceful protests is our right .
A new government can only be installed by the people through a free and fair election . ""
Nathan Shamuyarira , a spokesman for the ruling Zanu - PF party , said : "" The time has come for a showdown with the MDC .
They must be confronted and taught a lesson . ""
Zimbabwe is in a severe economic crisis with shortages of food , fuel and currency ."
2003-06-03,"Police fired live bullets and teargas to disperse small - scale anti - government protests , and arrested the opposition leader , Morgan Tsvangirai , as Zimbabwe 's week - long national strike and demonstrations got under way yesterday .
Confronted with the determination of Mr Tsvangirai 's Movement for Democratic Change ( MDC ) to take its supporters to the streets in public protests , President Robert Mugabe 's government responded with a huge show of force by the police and army .
Armoured vehicles fitted with guns and water cannon patrolled the capital and police circled the city with fortified roadblocks , according to residents of Harare .
Military helicopters hovered overhead , on the lookout for any large protest gathering .
In a pre - emptive strike to prevent Mr Tsvangirai from leading a public protest , police arrested him early yesterday and charged him with attempting to overthrow the government , according to his lawyer , Innocent Chagonda .
Mr Tsvangirai was taken to court under guard to attend his long - running treason trial .
He was later released .
At least six MDC members of parliament were also arrested , including Job Sikhala , who earlier this year was tortured in police custody according to medical evidence and testimony admitted in court .
Police also arrested the MDC mayors of Harare and Bulawayo , according to lawyers .
All were still in custody yesterday afternoon .
"" Deploying the armed forces on the streets of Zimbabwe in an attempt to prevent the people from exercising their basic democratic right to engage in peaceful protest is a clear demonstration that the regime has lost the support of the people , "" said MDC spokesman Paul Themba Nyathi .
""
No amount of violence can crush people 's desire for peaceful democratic change .
"" The public reacted angrily to Mr Tsvangirai 's arrest .
"" People are really mad about that , "" said Wilson Mushonga , who gave a false name to avoid retribution .
"" But the government is afraid to put him in jail .
They know if they put him in cells , people will erupt . ""
The five - day national strike started by completely shutting down all commercial and industrial activity in Harare , Bulawayo and other major cities .
Workers and business owners are furious with the Mugabe government for the hyperinflation , currently 269 % and shortages of food , fuel and even banknotes .
The government 's show of force and tough warnings by cabinet ministers did not stop several thousand people amassing for protests .
An estimated 5,000 people marched from the western Highfields township towards the city centre , but they were dispersed by police firing shots in the air and teargas .
Several of the protesters were arrested and at least three people were injured by gunfire , according to medical workers .
About 6,000 students at the University of Zimbabwe began to march towards central Harare but they were blocked by police firing teargas , driving them back on to their campus said witnesses .
About 200 protesters gathered in the downtown office districts and were chased by police who fired teargas .
A Reuters photographer witnessed police in Harare forcing about 50 people , some of them women , to lie on the street while they beat them with batons and homemade whips .
Other skirmishes with government forces broke out in the eastern township of Mabvuku and Tafara . ""
The army is going around beating up people .
Any group of more than three people will be attacked because the soldiers say they could be planning a demonstration , "" said Idah Mandaza .
"" They are really afraid of these protests . ""
Government ministers and top officials of the ruling Zanu - PF party warned of harsh action against any demonstrators .
The fact that any protesters came out at all was hailed by civic leaders as a sign that the Mugabe regime 's facade of invincibility was cracking . ""
No matter what force the government uses to put down these demonstrations , the protesters will have succeeded in denting the armour of the Mugabe regime , "" said human rights lawyer Brian Kagoro .
"" Mugabe will emerge weaker politically . ""
Early yesterday , the government showered central Harare with leaflets urging Zimbabweans to ignore the strike call .
One of the leaflets read : "" No to mass action , no to violence , no to British puppets , no Rhodesian sellouts , no to the MDC , enough is enough .
""
Many Harare residents reacted to the pamphlets with scorn .
"" They are wasting their time on propaganda like this , "" said Wilson Mushonga .
"" The money spent to do that would be better spent providing food for hungry people . ""
The state - run Zimbabwe Broadcasting Corporation , which reflects the views of Zanu - PF , called the protests a a flop , saying army and police patrols had maintained peace around the country .
The British foreign secretary , Jack Straw , expressed concern over events in Zimbabwe .
"" I am extremely worried by early reports that in some areas the Zimbabwean police and military have been forcibly dispersing peaceful demonstrators , "" said Mr Straw in a statement that urged the Mugabe government to respect citizens ' rights ."
2003-06-09,"Morgan Tsvangirai , Zimbabwe 's opposition leader , today appeared in court on the first of the two counts of treason he is charged with .
Mr Tsvangirai , the leader of the Movement for Democratic Change ( MDC ) , was arrested on Friday at the end of a week of anti - government protests and accused of inciting his supporters to overthrow President Robert Mugabe .
But his court appearance today was part of an ongoing trial on charges he plotted to kill Mr Mugabe in late 2001 to spark a coup .
The case has revolved around grainy videotaped footage purporting to show the MDC leader discussing the possibility of "" eliminating "" Mr Mugabe at a meeting in Montreal , Canada .
He may face a death sentence if convicted .
Mr Tsvangirai is , however , expected to appear later today in Harare 's magistrates court on the second , incitement - related treason charge .
No time for the hearing had been set but his lawyers and supporters yesterday said they would demand his immediate release .
The MDC leader was held over the weekend at a Harare police station that a high court judge , Benjamin Paradza , who was briefly detained there in February , had complained was lice - ridden .
His supporters have threatened renewed protests against Mr Mugabe 's 23-year rule if Mr Tsvangirai is not set free .
"" If our president is not released immediately , the dying regime must brace itself for a long winter of intense but peaceful mass action , "" the MDC vice - president , Gibson Sibanda , told reporters .
The MDC says Mr Mugabe 's government is illegitimate and blames it for ruining an economy struggling with high inflation and unemployment and crippling shortages of food and fuel .
Mr Mugabe , who insists he won last year 's general election fairly , said in an interview last night that he would not retire soon .
"" As long as there is that fight , I am for a fight ...
I can still punch , "" he told South African television ."
2003-06-10,"The Zimbabwean government stepped up its crackdown on the political opposition yesterday by denying bail to the opposition leader , Morgan Tsvangirai , and arresting his deputy .
Mr Tsvangirai , the leader of the Movement for Democratic Change ( MDC ) , is facing a second charge of treason and remained in jail yesterday after his lawyers failed to win his release .
The MDC claimed that 800 of its supporters had been arrested in the five - day national strike last week .
Mr Tsvangirai already faces charges of treason that he plot ted to have President Robert Mugabe assassinated .
The fresh charge is that he plotted a violent overthrow of the Mugabe government by calling for mass anti - government demonstrations .
Mr Tsvangirai denies both charges , saying he has always advocated a peaceful change of government in Zimbabwe .
The opposition party 's secretary general , Welshman Ncube , a co - accused in the first treason trial , was arrested yesterday and may also face new treason charges .
He was questioned yesterday by police , who were expected to detain him after his appearance in the high court .
Mr Mugabe warned that he would continue his campaign against the opposition in a rare interview broadcast by the South African Broadcasting Corporation : "" As long as there is that fight , I am for a fight ...
And I can still punch . ""
The 79-year - old president dismissed suggestions that he is ready to retire after 23 years in power .
South Africa has encouraged him to stand down and hand over to a government of national unity as part of a deal .
But Mr Mugabe rejected the suggestion .
"" I do n't want to retire in a situation where people are disunited and where certain of our objectives have not been achieved , "" he said .
"" It would be nonsensical for me , a year after my election , to resign . ""
Human Rights Watch , a New York - based organisation , warned that the Mugabe government had increased its abuses of civil rights in recent months . ""
Not only have the army and police personnel failed to protect people from human rights abuses , but they are now carrying out abuses themselves , "" said Peter Takirambudde , executive director of the organisation 's Africa division .
"" Recent legislation has drastically curtailed citizens ' rights to freedom of expression , assembly and association . ""
The report says political violence , prevalent in rural areas since 2000 , has become common in urban centres , and non - political organisations are being targeted .
Police raided the offices and home of filmmaker Edwina Spicer in the last few days .
"" They swooped on our house Friday and again on Monday , "" said Ms Spicer , who is currently in London .
"" They accused me of beaming bad reports about Zimbabwe from our premises .
When staff members said we had not been here for a week , they were beaten and required hospitalisation . ""
Ms Spicer said that equipment worth an estimated £ 20,000 was seized .
Human Rights Watch joined numerous Zimbawean civic organisations in calling for the Mugabe government to re - establish the rule of law , disband youth militia , withdraw military personnel from residential areas , and revise legislation contrary to international human rights law .
The government is confronted with growing opposition .
The five - day strike shut virtually all industrial and commercial activity and prompted a massive show of intimidatory strength by security forces .
Residents of Harare 's townships reported beatings by Mugabe 's youth militia in retribution .
Some claimed that the cabinet minister Elliot Manyika directed the beatings , according to Zimbabwe 's Standard newspaper .
Mr Manyika carried a list of hundreds of names of people who were marked for retaliatory violence , according to the report .
The new treason charges against Mr Tsvangirai centre on two political rallies last month where the state claims he urged supporters to take to the streets to oust Mr Mugabe and the Zimbabwean government .
Mr Ncube is accused of calling on supporters , in statements the government says were made last week , to take part in demonstrations and march to State House , Mr Mugabe 's official residence .
Under draconian new security laws the protests were declared illegal .
Mr Tsvangirai 's lawyer , George Bizos , said the latest allegations were "" spurious "" and intended to keep his client in custody in the wake of last week 's protests . ""
The charges are to prevent him from exercising his rights as a politician and leader of the opposition , "" he said ."
2003-06-11,"Zimbabwe 's courts yesterday ordered that the opposition leader , Morgan Tsvangirai , be jailed for a month while waiting to stand trial on the second treason charge pressed against him .
Mr Tsvangirai , 51 , the head of the Movement for Democratic Change , appeared in a heavily guarded court to face charges that he had incited protests aimed at illegally toppling President Robert Mugabe .
His lawyers said they would ask for bail - but were forced to wait until today to formally request his release .
The arrest was seen as part of a crackdown on the opposition after the five - day national strike last week .
Lawyers said prosecutors had freed the detained MDC secretary general , Welshman Ncube , and appeared to have dropped treason charges against him .
Police armed with AK-47s , shotguns and batons surrounded Harare magistrates court as Mr Tsvangirai heard the formal reading of charges and was remanded into police custody until July 10 .
He arrived in a convoy of armoured vehicles .
The MDC has threatened new protests if Mr Tsvangirai , a former trade union leader who has mounted the strongest challenge Mr Mugabe has seen in his 23 years in power , is not released soon ."
2003-06-20,"A court in Zimbabwe today ordered opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai to be released on bail after two weeks of detention on treason charges .
The court also said that it was restricting the political statements Mr Tsvangirai could make .
He is expected to be released later today .
Opposition officials said that Mr Tsvangirai was held in what they described as a filthy , overcrowded cell , and vowed to continue their struggle . ""
His incarceration has only served to strengthen the people 's resolve to intensify peaceful efforts to tackle the crisis of legitimacy in Zimbabwe , "" opposition spokesman Paul Themba Nyathi said .
Judge Susan Mavangira said that Mr Tsvangirai would be violating conditions of his release if he advocated the removal of Zimbabwe 's president , Robert Mugabe , and his government by what she termed "" violent or other unlawful means .
"" The new round of treason allegations stem from a week of anti - government strikes and protests which was called by Mr Tsvangirai earlier this month .
The protests shut down much of Zimbabwe 's already fragile economy , but the government used a massive show of force to crush planned street marches before they could begin .
State prosecutors said that Mr Tsvangirai called on supporters to oust Mr Mugabe during the protests , and incited them to violence .
Mr Tsvangirai denies the allegations , saying that he called for peaceful protests to get Mr Mugabe , 79 , to the negotiating table to discuss the nation 's worsening political and economic crisis and his possible retirement after 23 years in power .
Mr Tsvangirai and two senior opposition officials are already on trial on treason charges for allegedly plotting to assassinate Mr Mugabe two years ago .
The three deny the charges , and say they were framed by the government to weaken their party .
Treason carries a possible death penalty .
The trial has been ongoing and Mr Tsvangirai was in court today .
Ms Mavangira ordered Mr Tsvangirai to pay $ 10 m ( £ 7,400 ) in a cash bail bond and hand over property deeds or rights to other assets worth $ 100 m .
She said state prosecutors failed to argue that Mr Tsvangirai might fail to appear for trial on the new round of treason charges .
On the first treason charges , Mr Tsvangirai paid $ 3 m in a cash bond , and surrendered his passport to the high court .
Ms Mavangira said that the new bail was higher because of Zimbabwe 's record inflation .
Inflation levels have soared since Mr Tsvangirai was charged on the assassination allegations .
Mr Tsvangirai ran against Mr Mugabe in presidential elections last year .
Independent election observers say that the elections , narrowly won by Mr Mugabe , were swayed by state - orchestrated political violence , intimidation and vote - rigging .
Mr Tsvangirai was arrested on June 6 , the final day of the recent anti - government strikes and protests ."
2003-06-21,"The Zimbabwean opposition leader , Morgan Tsvangirai , was freed on bail yesterday after being held for a fortnight on treason charges .
In a show of independence , the court overturned all government objections that Mr Tsvangirai would incite a revolt against the president , Robert Mugage , if he was released .
With the deterioration of the economy accelerating , both the Zimbabwean opposition and the British Foreign Office share an optimism that Mr Mugabe 's hold on power is slipping .
They believe the president is at his most vulnerable since taking power 23 years ago .
The court set bail at Z$10 m ( roughly £ 9,000 ) plus a further Z$100 m in assets as a guarantee .
Mr Tsvangirai was able to leave the prison , accompanied by his wife and a group of supporters , after four boxes stuffed with the money were delivered to the court .
Opposition officials said Mr Tsvangirai had been held in what they described as a filthy , overcrowded cell .
He is due back in court on July 10 .
Mr Tsvangirai , who was not in court to hear the judgment , was arrested on June 6 after a series of strikes and street protests against Mr Mugabe , who is 79 .
The government claimed the demonstrations amounted to an attempted coup .
Mr Tsvangirai denies the charge .
Opposing bail , government lawyers claimed that once released , he would make "" a final push "" to unseat Mr Mugabe ."
2003-08-09,"Zimbabwe 's high court ruled yesterday that opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai must continue to be tried on treason charges , but dropped similar charges against two other senior officials of the opposition party , the Movement for Democratic Change .
Judge Paddington Garwe dismissed the charges against the MDC 's secretary - general , Welshman Ncube , and the party 's shadow agriculture minister , Renson Gasela , saying the state had failed to present evidence that the two had plotted to have President Robert Mugabe assassinated .
But the judge said the state had presented sufficient evidence to continue the trial against Mr Tsvangirai .
The treason case is viewed by legal experts , civic leaders and the public at large as harassment of Mr Tsvangirai and the MDC , and part of a government campaign to use the courts to silence its critics .
Mr Tsvangirai also faces a new treason charge , brought in June , for allegedly backing a violent overthrow of the government when he called for a five - day national strike ."

2003-12-28,"Directions to the rendezvous will be given at the last minute , says the voice at the other end of the line , lest the secret police are listening .
In these days of fuel shortages it is just a 15-minute drive from central Harare to the suburb where five polite young men , acting as sentinels , open the gates leading to a pink house .
Standing at the door of his study , a one - room cottage in the garden , is Morgan Tsvangirai , would - be President of Zimbabwe and nemesis of Robert Mugabe .
He looks like his newspaper photographs : a bit crumpled , smiling and frowning at the same time .
A pumping handshake and he drops into an armchair , keen to discuss the fate of his country .
What happens next - continued stalemate , a bloody uprising , a negotiated handover of power , fresh elections - hinges largely on him and the opposition group he leads , the Movement for Democratic Change ( MDC ) .
The coming year , most analysts agree , is make - or - break .
If Tsvangirai gets it right , Zimbabwe will have a ' soft landing ' from 23 years of Mugabe rule .
If he gets it wrong , the country may go the way of Congo and pay in chaos and bloodshed , or choke in the tightened grip of the ruling Zanu - PF party .
Tsvangirai knows it is his big test .
The 51-year - old knows many doubt he is up to the job , that maybe his personality and leadership skills are no match for the daunting task ahead , that he makes too many mistakes .
Rubbish , his supporters say .
It is Tsvangirai who forged the MDC from a trade union base into a national movement and has withstood huge pressure to pose the most serious challenge Mugabe has known .
The MDC holds nearly half of the 120 elected seats in parliament , controls the councils of nearly all the country 's urban areas , and , according to most independent observers , would have won the 2002 presidential election had it been fair .
Despite the vote - rigging , violence and muzzling of independent media , the party is intact and respected . '
Morgan still commands a great degree of popular support and affection , ' says one Western diplomat .
But a growing number of critics say that this is not enough .
People grow hungry , poor and destitute while the President 's cronies loot farms and state assets with no sign of a backlash .
Tsvangirai and his aides are accused of staying at home while sending supporters onto the streets to be beaten up .
Some MDC activists complain of lost momentum , fatigue and disillusionment .
Sitting in the armchair , dressed in navy slacks and an African print shirt , Tsvangirai listens and shakes his head . '
Totally unjustified .
You ca n't have the leaders on the streets when nobody is there behind them , ' he says .
Six months ago the nation heeded his call for a week - long general strike but declined to throng streets patrolled by the police , soldiers and Zanu - PF thugs . '
It 's easier for people to take the soft option and stay at home - and that 's disappointing . '
If they saw Tsvangirai and other leaders on the streets , might they not join them ?
They might , he concedes , but the leaders might also be arrested , decapitating the movement with barely an independent press left to report it .
Some observers think the risk justified .
In his guerrilla days , Mugabe was incarcerated and his movement continued , so why not the MDC ? '
The tragedy of the MDC is they want to behave like gentlemen when they 're in a war situation .
They should make it impossible for Zanu , make noise , sing , ' said Sam Nkomo , head of Associated Newspapers of Zimbabwe , the group which published the Daily News , a feisty critic that the regime closed earlier this year .
Nobody calls Tsvangirai a coward .
He has been thrown into prison , been beaten unconscious and almost hurled from a 10-storey window .
Now he is on trial for treason and could be executed .
But critics say the movement 's morale and cohesion will falter unless it is bolder .
Asked about being a martyr if necessary , Tsvangirai , a father of six , dodges the question .
Pressed , he says : ' Yes , I think I 'd be prepared to lay down my own life . '
What he does not add , though some aides do , is that the streets are not filling with critics . '
Maybe we 're still not desperate enough , ' sighed one disillusioned MDC activist .
That thesis may soon be tested .
Tsvangirai promised to create a ' broad alliance ' with other pro - democracy organisations to ' intensify the pressure ' on the regime in 2004 .
He declines to elaborate on tactics , but says the 79-year - old despot is on his way out , comparing him to Jim Jones , the cult leader who led a mass poisoning in the South American jungle in 1978 . '
If a man wants to commit suicide , you ca n't stop him . '
Tsvangirai left school early to work in a textile mill , then a mine , before working his way up the trade union movement .
He never went to university - one of the reasons Mugabe , who reportedly has at least six degrees , is so disdainful .
Sometimes depicted as a firebrand who shoots from the hip , at one point in the interview he grows so animated he leaps to his feet , almost shouting .
But Tsvangirai stays on - message , carefully wording , for example , his criticism of South Africa 's President Thabo Mbeki .
Many in the MDC despair that Mbeki , the one power broker with leverage over his wayward neighbour , cossets Mugabe .
But Tsvangirai merely says the South African has been ' misled ' and ' must be very disappointed ' at Mugabe 's broken promises to ease repression .
Another fraught issue is whether the MDC is secretly negotiating with Zanu - PF .
Opposition supporters in particular have been confused by contradictory signals from both sides . '
There are no talks .
People must not misunderstand proximity contacts as talks .
There have been no substantive talks , ' says Tsvangirai .
Since the crackdown Zimbabweans seldom hear his voice or read his words , but if they did they may be surprised at how upbeat the opposition leader seems ."

2004-01-30,"Zimbabwean police yesterday banned Morgan Tsvangirai 's opposition party from launching its long - awaited and detailed proposals to rebuild the country 's crumbling economy .
Using security laws , officers prevented the Movement for Democratic Change ( MDC ) from meeting international diplomats and journalists to announce their new economic programme , called Restart .
Under Zimbabwe 's public order and security act , all public meetings of more than three people must have police approval , and police insisted the MDC 's application had been delivered to the wrong room and had not been processed .
Police added they did not have enough officers on hand to ensure security for yesterday 's meeting .
Last week officers raided the MDC 's offices and seized many documents , including versions of the Restart programme .
Police said they were taking "" subversive material "" .
"" These are lies and excuses from a regime that seeks to prevent Zimbabweans access to a comprehensive policy programme and a path to recovery , "" said an MDC spokesman , Paul Themba Nyathi .
"" The government fears that the MDC Restart programme will expose its own shortcomings , as it has no coherent programme to tackle the economic crisis .
The MDC was making an urgent appeal to the high court to allow the meeting to go ahead .
The action against the opposition party came a day after President Robert Mugabe 's ruling Zanu - PF party pushed through parliament a law to speed up land seizures that the legislative body 's own legal committee has deemed unconstitutional .
The amendment to the land acquisition bill allows the government to seize land without serving papers on the current owners .
The government argued that the amendments would "" consolidate the gains of land reform and remove bottlenecks in land acquisition "" .
Zanu - PF ignored the parliamentary legal committee 's finding that the bill is unconstitutional .
The government has seized more than 90 % of white - owned commercial farms and appears intent on taking the remaining 400 .
The seizures are blamed for the drastic reduction in Zimbabwe 's agricultural output .
Until recently Zimbabwe was called the "" breadbasket of southern Africa "" for its ample production of food , but now more than half of the country 's 12 million people are dependent upon international aid .
By preventing the opposition party from publicising its economic plan and forcing through the controversial bill , MDC officials said the Mugabe government was destroying the possibility of negotiations with the opposition party to resolve Zimbabwe 's deepening crisis .
The South African president , Thabo Mbeki , said Mr Mugabe had promised that his party would meet with the MDC to resolve Zimbabwe 's problems .
But MDC leaders say Mr Mugabe is not serious about holding talks . ""
These actions show Mugabe and his Zanu - PF are not interested in negotiations , "" said Tendai Biti , the MDC 's secretary for economic affairs who helped to develop the Restart programme .
"" They are not interested in talks .
They are not interested in the courts or in the rule of law .
They are only interested in holding on to power at all costs .
All they need is the police and the army and their unconstitutional laws . ""

2004-07-03,"Thugs suspected of being loyal to the Zimbabwean president , Robert Mugabe , yesterday attacked an opposition party rally with clubs , axes and stones , in an attempt to assassinate the party 's leader .
Morgan Tsvangirai was addressing supporters of the Movement for Democratic Change at Mvurwi , a town north of the capital , Harare , when some 200 men waded into the crowd , striking men , women and children , said a party spokesman .
Hospitals and police could not be reached immediately for confirmation that several people were injured , including a driver who was reportedly smashed in the face with a rock , and a woman hit on the head with a brick , who fell over with a child strapped to her back .
Neither Mr Tsvangirai nor any senior MDC members were injured , but the party president considered the incident an attempt on his life , said the spokesman , William Bango .
The incident broke a period of relative calm and seemed designed to intimidate the opposition in the run - up to a general election due next year , said analysts .
They doubted whether the intent was to kill Mr Tsvangirai .
The former trade union leader is locked in a bitter struggle to oust Mr Mugabe , whom he accuses of rigging elections since 2000 .
Since the economy started crumbling four years ago , the ruling Zanu - PF party has used violence and intimidation , including rape and murder , to cow the opposition .
Yesterday 's rally was a rare MDC foray into the ruling party 's heartland of Mashonaland Central , in effect a no - go area , and a test of how far the opposition could exploit the recent absence of violence to galvanise its demoralised supporters .
Mr Bango said the answer came shortly after 2 pm when a convoy of vehicles disgorged men wielding axes , clubs and stones .
After damaging parked MDC vehicles and injuring drivers , the men moved into an open - air garage where 500 supporters were gathered .
There was no immediate response from Zanu - PF , which often accuses the opposition of instigating violence .
With the ruling party 's near total dominance of the public and private media , most Zimbabweans are unlikely to hear about the incident .
In February , suspected Mugabe loyalists attacked Mr Tsvangirai and his wife at a rural town south of Harare , but the couple escaped unhurt .
Several years ago some men beat him up badly , and allegedly tried to throw him out of an office window , but fled after being disturbed ."
2004-10-15,"A court in Zimbabwe today found the country 's opposition leader , Morgan Tsvangirai , not guilty of treason charges that his party maintained were a government attempt to frame him .
Members of the opposition cheered and clapped after Judge Paddington Garwe acquitted Mr Tsvangirai in a long - awaited judgement at Harare 's high court .
The state had accused Mr Tsvangirai , who is the leader of the Movement for Democratic Change ( MDC ) , of plotting to kill the president , Robert Mugabe .
The charges were based on a grainy four and a half hour video , recorded by hidden cameras , of a meeting between Mr Tsvangirai and the Canadian - based political consultant Ari Ben Menashe in Montreal on December 4 2001 .
During a year - long trial that ended on February 26 , Mr Tsvangirai 's defence lawyers said the tape had been doctored to implicate him in a plot to murder Mr Mugabe and stage a military coup to seize power .
Mr Tsvangirai denied involvement in any such plot , and said he had mentioned the "" elimination "" of Mr Mugabe during the discussions in reference only to the president 's possible defeat in the 2002 presidential election .
"" This was a political trial so it had all the dimensions of political influence , so it was a bit unpredictable , "" Mr Tsvangirai told the BBC after hearing the verdict .
"" I was always hoping for the best but always prepared for the worst , so it is a surprise .
"" The lengthy trial hampered Mr Tsvangirai 's ability to lead an effective political opposition , and he still faces another treason charge for allegedly advocating the violent ousting of Mr Mugabe .
Amnesty International said today it believed Mr Mugabe 's government had trumped up the charges as a form of harassment of the political opposition in Zimbabwe . ""
The acquittal is a huge blow to the forces of tyranny , "" said Gibson Sibanda , the vice - president of the MDC .
"" The ruling sends out a message of hope to all those struggling for freedom and democracy both inside and outside Zimbabwe . ""
He said the treason charge and unrelenting campaign of violence and intimidation demonstrated the level of panic within the ruling party , which tolerates no threat to its power .
The home affairs minister , Kembo Mohadi , said police reinforcements were deployed outside the courthouse to prevent any unrest .
Mr Mohadi added that security and court officials had also restricted access to the court , with large crowds anticipated .
Testimony in the nation 's longest trial covered a broad sweep , ranging from the secretly recorded meeting to an alleged plan by the former US president Bill Clinton - to be bankrolled by the Jewish community in the US - to persuade Mr Mugabe to leave office .
Mr Menashe claimed he had been asked by the Clinton administration to negotiate a deal for Mr Mugabe 's retirement .
State prosecutors withdrew allegations made earlier in the trial that Mr Tsvangirai had spoken with Mr Menashe about the "" murder "" and "" assassination "" of Mr Mugabe after the words could not be found on the secretly recorded tape .
Defence attorney George Bizos , a South African human rights lawyer , had submitted evidence that Mr Menashe was already working for the Zimbabwean government 's security agency on an operation to discredit the burgeoning opposition when Mr Tsvangirai visited him in Montreal .
He said Mr Tsvangirai had only sought the consultant 's help to raise funds and canvass for support for the opposition in the US and Canada .
The video of their meeting was out of focus and barely audible .
Mr Tsvangirai , who was freed on bail , had to surrender his passport after being charged two weeks before he ran against Mr Mugabe in the March 2002 election .
He narrowly lost the vote , which independent observers said had been rigged , and his political activities were sharply curtailed by his lengthy appearances in the dock .
Mr Menashe , 52 , who claims to have been a former Israeli intelligence agent and a security adviser to the Israeli prime minister , was in 1990 acquitted by a US federal jury of charges that he illegally arranged a deal to sell US - made military cargo planes to Iran in exchange for the release of four US hostages in the Middle East .
Israel denied he was connected to intelligence work , but said he had served for a brief period as a junior clerk in its civil service .
Mr Tsvangirai 's defence team said Mr Menashe had frequently lied under oath while giving his evidence in order to cover up his efforts , for the Zimbabwe Central Intelligence Organisation , to entrap the opposition leader .
Evidence given in the trial showed he had received $ 650,000 ( £ 361,000 ) from the Zimbabwe intelligence service .
The chief state prosecutor , Bharat Patel , asking for a conviction at the conclusion of the trial in February , said there was still enough evidence to prove that Mr Tsvangirai had planned Mr Mugabe 's assassination ."
2004-10-16,"Zimbabwe 's opposition leader , Morgan Tsvangirai , surged back as a political force yesterday after a court acquitted him of plotting to assassinate President Robert Mugabe , ending a two - and - a - half year case that could have seen him executed .
Mr Tsvangirai expressed surprise and relief at the ruling which boosted his party in the run - up to parliamentary elections early next year . ""
Great .
Thank God , "" he said .
Supporters of the Movement for Democratic Change danced and ululated outside the high court in Harare after the verdict was announced , but they were swiftly dispersed by police backed up with a military jet which buzzed the capital .
Mr Tsvangirai , 52 , was charged with treason and plotting a coup in a year - long trial which became a test for a judicial system battered by government intimidation .
Despite flimsy prosecution evidence many observers expected Mr Tsvangirai to be jailed or hanged .
But Judge Paddington Garwe told a packed courtroom that the prosecution had not proven guilt beyond reasonable doubt .
"" The court therefore returns a verdict of ' not guilty ' , "" he said .
The state may appeal and Mr Tsvangirai has yet to face a separate treason trial , but nothing could dampen the opposition 's glee . ""
His acquittal is a victory for the people of Zimbabwe and a huge blow to the forces of tyranny , "" said the MDC in a statement .
Mr Tsvangirai 's lawyer George Bizos , who defended Nelson Mandela in a 1960s treason trial , wept with relief at what he said was a victory for justice .
Amnesty International said confidence in the judiciary had been restored .
However , Mr Tsvangirai said the case was political .
"" It had all the dimensions of political influence , so it was a bit unpredictable , "" he told the BBC .
"" I was always hoping for the best but always prepared for the worst , so it is a surprise . ""
Since the trial ended in February Mr Mugabe has been discreetly lobbied by other African leaders to spare his opponent to bolster the legitimacy of elections in March , according to western diplomats .
The MDC came close to winning parliamentary elections in 2000 and the presidency in 2002 but international observers said intimidation , violence and vote rigging saved Mr Mugabe and his Zanu - PF party , rulers since independence from Britain in 1980 .
The case against Mr Tsvangirai hinged on a grainy , barely audible video secretly taped in Canada in 2001 when he met an Israeli political consultant , Ari Ben - Menashe , and allegedly discussed the "" elimination "" of the president .
Defence lawyers said Mr Tsvangirai wanted only to raise funds and support but that he was set up by Mr Menashe who was in the pay of Zimbabwe 's security services .
The judge found no evidence of a request to assassinate Mr Mugabe .
Determined to crush celebrations , the government gave another masterclass in intimidation .
The Herald newspaper warned on its front page that police would deal with any "" MDC hooligans "" who disturbed the peace .
Several hundred supporters responded to the MDC 's call to rally at the court but they were ringed by police wielding batons and guns and watched by plain - clothes men in sunglasses .
As police sealed off streets to the court a military jet flew low overhead .
Mounted police trotted through the city centre , followed by two trucks with water - cannons .
"" This is not the time or place to smile , "" said one man .
After the verdict aides rushed Mr Tsvangirai away , not daring to savour the moment for cameras waiting outside the court .
His convoy sped off so fast a bodyguard fell off the back of a pick - up truck ."
2004-10-18,"Sunday Mirror Editorial , Zimbabwe , October 17 "" The judgment [ in ] the treason trial of Morgan Tsvangirai , the leader of the opposition Movement for Democratic Change ( MDC ) will go a long way in remoulding the way in which both the local and international communities regard matters of governance in Zimbabwe .
Against many 's expectations , and despite much vitriolic media hype , Mr Tsvangirai was acquitted on Friday .
How the case was handled symbolises that there is the rule of law in Zimbabwe .
"" There are checks and balances and therefore there was no need for fear that the executive , or the ruling Zanu - PF for that matter , would interfere with the justice delivery system . ""
Standard Editorial , Zimbabwe , October 17 ""
It was abundantly clear that international fraudster and fortune - hunter Ari Ben Menashe had framed the rather naive Mr Tsvangirai and the charges were trumped - up and politically motivated .
Mr Tsvangirai 's victory this first round is as charged with sorrow and doubt as it is with joy and gratitude .
A second treason charge is hanging over his head and democratic forces everywhere can not sleep easily .
The battle is not over yet .
Zimbabweans are in for a long haul . ""
Daily News Editorial , Zimbabwe , October 16 ""
Most analysts called this a political trial , part of Zanu - PF 's sinister plot to enfeeble the most formidable opposition political party since independence .
The judgment suggests strongly that justice is still alive and well in Zimbabwe , that in spite of attempts by Zanu - PF there are still men and women of conscience who will act in accordance with the law , and not out of warped party loyalty . ""
Sunday Mail Editorial , Zimbabwe , October 17 ""
The fact that people can sit down and discuss the elimination of a sitting president smacks of conspiracy and to argue that Mr Tsvangirai should not have been on trial is being mischievous .
Mr Tsvangirai had himself said it was not him who was on trial but democracy .
So if democracy was under trial has it now been acquitted ? ""
Nathaniel Manheru Herald , Zimbabwe , October 16 ""
Mr Tsvangirai is a man the courts have saved from the gallows , only to be delivered to the guillotine of popular vote , come March 2005 . ""
"" Skilfully , Zanu - PF has already dubbed the March 2005 election the anti - Blair election , in the process keeping MDC 's troubled linkage with the west under a spotlight .
The vast western media availed to Mr Tsvangirai soon after his acquittal ; the loud sigh of relief that rang loud in the hallways of No 10 , the White House and other corridors of the west , only serves to reinforce Zanu - PF 's campaign , while firmly nailing the MDC mast high on the pole of empire where it flutters to an ill political wind . ""
Daily Telegraph Editorial , October 16 ""
The prospects for the opposition are of continued brutal harassment by an old tyrant , who appears to have concluded that it would be self - defeating to imprison or execute Mr Tsvangirai .
Robert Mugabe would thereby make a martyr of a man who no longer poses any immediate threat to his rule . ""
In the meantime , the economy continues to unravel .
Zimbabweans go hungry while their president makes absurdly optimistic claims about the size of the grain harvest .
This is a country going steadily downhill .
The acquittal of Mr Tsvangirai , though cheering in itself , will not halt that melancholy slide . """
2004-12-01,"The David Blunkett saga has taken another twist this morning , with the home secretary issuing a defiant statement to the press .

2004-12-01,"The leader of Zimbabwe 's opposition today urged the UK and Europe to put pressure on the country 's president , Robert Mugabe , to make next March 's elections "" free and fair "" .
Speaking in London at the end of a campaign tour of Africa and Europe , Morgan Tsvangirai , the leader of the Movement for Democratic Change , warned the country risked deteriorating into "" another Darfur "" if that did not happen .
He said Britain was in a "" position to influence "" the EU and other countries to press for basic electoral reforms in Zimbabwe .
However , while calling for support , Mr Tsvangirai said he accepted that the UK was an "" invidious "" position because Mr Mugabe was "" paranoid "" about the prime minister , Tony Blair , and also because of its colonial history .
He said this meant the UK had to be "" cautious "" in its approach to Zimbabwe , or it risked "" playing into the hands "" of Mr Mugabe .
In an illustration of the sensitive nature of UK involvement , Mr Tsvangirai revealed he had met Mr Blair for unpublicised private talks last week .
Mr Tsvangirai said the Zimbabwean electoral process had been ravaged by violence . ""
In the absence of a genuine , democratic election , Zimbabwe risks deteriorating into another Darfur or Sierra Leone ... [ which would ] pose a serious threat to the stability of the southern African region , "" he warned in a statement .
The opposition leader also repeated his condemnation of the current England cricket tour of Zimbabwe , which he said risked lending legitimacy to Mr Mugabe 's regime .
He said the Zimbabwean president was looking to improve his "" pariah status "" .
He added that the cricketers had been left in an impossible position and , although "" the British government could not have stopped it [ the tour ] "" , he put the blame on the International Cricket Council .
Earlier , the shadow foreign secretary , Michael Ancram , had added his voice to calls for the England cricket team to pull out of the tour .
The MDC has said it may not take part in the 2005 elections if reforms fail to happen , and Mr Tsvangirai today said the matter would be decided in the next few weeks following debate within the party .
Some analysts are sceptical over whether the MDC would actually pull out of the elections , but party officials said the threat was genuine and was a strategic move to put pressure on Mr Mugabe .
The 2002 presidential elections were won by Mr Mugabe , but the result was disputed and was condemned by international human rights groups .
Mr Tsvangirai wants electoral reforms to take place within guidelines set by the Southern African Development Community ( SADC ) .
Mr Mugabe ratified a protocol on elections with other SADC leaders in August , but Mr Tsvangirai said reforms that had been made were "" cosmetic "" , and that the president had backtracked on his promises .
The SADC chairman , the Mauritian prime minister , Paul Berenger , also said the reforms did not go far enough .
He called for opposition parties to be able to campaign freely , with an end being brought to state violence and repression of the media .
The SADC electoral charter also called for a transparent voter registration process and scrutiny of the voters ' roll .
Mr Tsvangirai , a former union leader , said there was a historic opportunity for a free election next year , but warned it would be lost "" if SADC leaders do not exert sufficient diplomatic pressure "" .
He said the MDC wanted to campaign on the pressing issues - "" food and jobs "" - and added that , if electoral reforms took place , his party would be victorious .
Talking about his discussions with Mr Blair , Mr Tsvangirai said : "" We talked about what should be done and what can be done .
We talked about trying to resolve the crisis through the EU and other platforms , and the British government should be in a position to influence these platforms . ""
The EU has long criticised the Mugabe regime , and has imposed sanctions on Harare , including a travel ban on Mr Mugabe and key government figures .
However , Mr Tsvangiri this week said the sanctions had not been applied forcefully enough .
This was the 52-year - old 's second visit to Europe since the Zimbabwean high court last month cleared him of plotting to kill Mr Mugabe .
He had his passport taken away during his year - long trial for treason , but it was returned when he was acquitted .
Mr Tsvangirai today said there was still another charge of treason against him , but he was not worried about it because there was no case .
Meanwhile in Zimbabwe , Mr Mugabe 's Zanu - PF party congress began today , and there were reports that several officials had been expelled from the party .
Mr Tsvangirai said the expulsions were likely to be because Mr Mugabe , who is 80 , was trying to control his succession ."
2004-12-05,"The leader of Zimbabwe 's opposition , Morgan Tsvangirai , was detained yesterday at Harare 's international airport after returning from Europe , according to his party .
Police and customs agents intercepted the president of the Movement for Democratic Change when he stepped off the plane .
They then photocopied his passport .
For the past several weeks Tsvangirai has toured several African and European capitals to drum up support in advance of next year 's elections in Zimbabwe .
His warm reception in South Africa , Britain and Belgium annoyed President Robert Mugabe 's government and it was determined to prevent another tour , said MDC spokesman Paul Themba Nyathi . '
It was a reaction to the success of his trip .
Photocopying the passport was a marker .
We expect them to confiscate it to stop him leaving the country . '
The authorities would be able to cite the treason charges Tsvangirai is expected to face next year as an excuse , Nyathi added .
A court in Harare acquitted Tsvangirai of treason charges in a separate case in October , prompting the return of his passport and the first chance to leave his country since 2002 .
He took full advantage , meeting South Africa 's President Thabo Mbeki , Tony Blair , and senior EU officials in a whirlwind tour that raised the MDC 's profile .
There was speculation that Mugabe 's security services had made a blunder in returning Tsvangirai 's passport and that the government had intended to keep him in the country ."
2005-01-26,"The Zimbabwean opposition leader , Morgan Tsvangirai , challenged South Africa and neighbouring countries yesterday to press President Robert Mugabe to meet the minimum standards for free and fair elections .
Mr Tsvangirai said his party , the Movement for Democratic Change ( MDC ) , had not yet decided whether to participate in parliamentary elections in March .
"" The question is : are credible elections possible under the current conditions ?
The answer is no , "" Mr Tsvangirai told the Guardian .
Speaking in Johannesburg , he urged the Southern African Development Community to influence Mr Mugabe to meet election standards set by the 14-nation body .
"" We can not hold public meetings of more than three people without police permission .
There are 50,000 youth militia trained to inflict violence on the opposition .
Voter registration ... is a shambles and prevents millions of people from voting , "" Mr Tsvangirai said .
He said the MDC was confident of widespread support and wanted to participate in the elections but added : "" If we take part under current conditions we give legitimacy to a discredited system .
If we do n't run then we become irrelevant . """
2005-03-30,"President Robert Mugabe called the Zimbabwean opposition "" traitors "" yesterday and accused the Movement for Democratic Change leader Morgan Tsvangirai of running to the British "" like a puppy wagging its tail "" .
As the tension increased before tomorrow 's general election , Mr Mugabe told 20,000 supporters that his party , Zanu - PF , would win a "" free and fair "" contest with the MDC , whose leader he mocked as a "" big - headed man with no brain "" . ""
He runs to the British like a puppy wagging its tail , campaigning for sanctions , and asking to be installed as leader , "" he said at one of his biggest rallies since electioneering began a month ago .
Later he declared that victory by the opposition party "" will not be tolerated "" .
Reginald Matchaba - Hove , director of the Zimbabwe Electoral Support Network , said he was concerned about Mr Mugabe 's remarks and had asked foreign observers to stay in the country for at least a week after polling for fear of renewed violence .
The opposition said yesterday that one of its supporters had been killed by Zanu - PF members : its first accusation of murder in the campaign .
The police denied that the crime was politically motivated .
The EU dismissed the elec tions as "" phoney "" , yesterday , and said that it would take unspecified steps against Harare . ""
As soon as these phoney elections have been held , I can commit myself to the fact that the issue of Zimbabwe will be on the [ EU council of ministers ' ] agenda when we next meet , "" the deputy foreign minister of Luxembourg , Nicholas Schmit , said .
On Sunday the Roman Catholic Archbishop of Bulawayo , Pius Ncube , called for a "" nonviolent mass popular up rising "" if Zanu - PF won the general election by fraud .
Yesterday he said Mr Mugabe 's comments revived ominous memories of moves against suspected opposition voters after previous elections .
"" It may be quiet now , but we are not sure what will happen after these elections , "" he said .
"" You are dealing with people who bullied everyone into silence in the past . ""
Voters will choose 120 members of Zimbabwe 's 150-seat parliament .
The president ap points the remaining 30 seats , so the MDC needs to win 76 seats for a majority .
Mr Mugabe 's former information minister Jonathan Moyo told Reuters that the president 's remarks showed that he was unable to accept a democratic opposition . ""
[ He ] has an unfortunate habit of always accusing opponents of plotting a coup .
That might demonstrate his attitude to the democratic process , "" he said .
Mr Moyo , who is standing as an independent in his home area , Tsholotsho , said Mr Mugabe 's rhetoric showed that he was nervous about the outcome of the elections , which he described as too close to predict .
He hoped that voters would deny Zanu - PF the two - thirds parliamentary majority it is seeking , which would enable it to amend the constitution and strengthen its grip on power .
Campaigning yesterday
Mr Tsvangirai focused on the economy , as has been his party 's strategy throughout .
Zimbabwe 's farms , industry , education and international relations had all been destroyed , he said , speaking in his home region , Buhera .
"" How are we going to rebuild Zimbabwe ?
You and me have to work together , "" he said .
Yesterday was expected to be the last day of campaigning , but electoral officials said additional rallies would be permitted today ."
2005-04-01,"Zimbabwe 's opposition leader , Morgan Tsvangirai , accused Robert Mugabe of stealing parliamentary elections yesterday as the president 's party was declared the winner .
With results declared for 98 of the 120 constituencies being contested , the ruling Zanu - PF had taken 62 seats - enough for a majority in the 150-member parliament , where 30 MPs are appointed by Mr Mugabe .
Mr Tsvangirai 's Movement for Democratic Change ( MDC ) had won 35 seats .
Mr Mugabe gained stronger support in the countryside for his seizures of white - owned farms , but observers fear that voters in isolated and sparsely populated rural constituencies are also more easily intimidated than those in the towns .
"" We do not accept that this represents the national sentiment , "" said Mr Tsvangirai .
"" The government has fraudulently , once again , betrayed the people .
We believe that the people of Zimbabwe must defend their vote and their right to free and fair elections . ""
The MDC went into the election holding 51 seats , but admitted that it could end up with only 40 .
Some observers expected Zanu - PF to gain a two - thirds majority in parliament , which would allow Mr Mugabe to rewrite the constitution unopposed .
Mr Tsvangirai said his party would do more than simply appeal against the result in the courts , which the government has packed with sympathetic judges .
But he would not say what action it would take .
Previous attempts at protest have been violently crushed by security forces and members of the ruling party 's youth militia .
The MDC has avoided confrontation in recent years .
The US said the voting process had been tainted .
"" The election process all along has been tilted in favour of the government , "" said Richard Boucher , a spokesman for the state department .
Controversy surrounded the election of Mr Mugabe 's nephew , Patrick Zhawao , a Zanu - PF candidate , in Manyame constituency , south - west of Harare .
Election officials announced on Thursday night that about 15,000 people had voted .
They then said yesterday morning that the total turnout was 24,000 , and that Mr Zhawao had received more than 15,000 votes .
"" I won .
I was leading .
Suddenly I hear about 24,000 votes , and I do n't know where the extra 10,000 came from , "" said the losing MDC candidate , Hilda Mafudze .
"" It is the first example of what we are going to start seeing from here on . ""
As Zanu - PF supporters carried a mock coffin representing the MDC through the constituency , election officials refused to comment on the discrepancy in their figures .
The officials said they doubted there was any rigging .
Before the voting , Mr Mugabe changed electoral law to allow army officers , largely loyal to the ruling party , to serve as election officials .
Opponents of Mr Mugabe drew comfort from the fact that his party had failed to recapture Zimbabwe 's cities .
Iden Wetherell , a senior journalist with two of the last remaining independent newspapers , said : "" The youth , the educated , the skilled are in the cities .
They are the future of Zimbabwe and they have rejected Mugabe again , against all odds .
They are completely alienated from him . ""
An MDC source said the party had not decided what to do next : "" This is crunch time .
What can 40 seats in parliament do ?
We know that taking the legal route , challenging the elections in the courts , will lead nowhere .
Do we call people to mass action ?
That is difficult to do . ""
Following international pressure to hold a legitimate election , Mr Mugabe allowed the MDC to campaign and hold rallies in the run - up to the vote .
Opposition supporters suffered less violence than in previous election campaigns , but in some rural areas MDC voters were denied access to state - controlled grain supplies .
Tactics used to fix the poll included inflating the voters ' roll with "" ghost voters "" and denying the MDC access to state - controlled media .
An independent monitoring group , the Zimbabwe Election Support Network , said up to 25 % of those who tried to vote had been turned away because their names did not appear on the electoral roll or they failed to present proper identification .
State electoral officials said about 10 % of voters had been turned away from polling stations .
Turnout was about 42 % , compared with 48 % in the 2000 general election ."
2005-04-01,"President Robert Mugabe 's ruling Zanu - PF party today emerged victorious in the official results of a Zimbabwean parliamentary election criticised by the opposition and western powers as fraudulent .
With 84 of the contested 120 parliamentary seats declared , Zanu - PF took 51 .
Morgan Tsvangirai 's opposition Movement for Democratic Change ( MDC ) won 33 , according to results on the official counting screen at the Harare election centre .
The ruling party entered the race needing only 46 seats to obtain a simple majority in the 150-seat parliament , where 30 members are Mugabe appointees .
Earlier , Mr Tsvangirai accused the government of trying to steal the elections , with MDC supporters reporting a catalogue of irregularities .
Mr Tsvangirai hinted that Zimbabweans should take to the streets to defend their vote .
"" We do not accept that this represents the national sentiment ... the government has fraudulently , once again , betrayed the people , "" he told reporters .
"" We believe the people of Zimbabwe must defend their vote and their right to free and fair elections . ""
Mr Tsvangirai said his party would do more than merely appeal the result in Zimbabwe 's courts , which are packed with judges sympathetic to the government .
However , he would not specify what action the party would take .
Opposition officials accused the government of delaying the counting process and orchestrating the announcement of results .
They said it had done so to create an impression of an early MDC lead to bolster claims the election was free and fair .
The MDC won 31 of the first 54 seats declared , but they were in the urban areas in which the party is traditionally strong .
Zanu - PF 's strength lies in the rural vote .
The foreign secretary , Jack Straw , today launched a scathing attack on Mr Mugabe 's government , blaming it for the "" desperate crisis "" afflicting Zimbabwe . ""
Credible observers have noted that , although there was less violence than during the 2000 and 2002 elections , harassment and intimidation by the ruling party and the government continued , "" Mr Straw said in a statement .
"" There was some improvement in the mechanics of voting , but the voters ' roll was severely compromised and thousands were turned away .
Zimbabwe 's 2005 parliamentary elections were fundamentally flawed and further weaken Mugabe 's legitimacy . ""
Voter turnout , estimated from official figures , was around 42 % , compared to 48 % at the last parliamentary election in 2000 .
Electoral officials said around 10 % of voters had been turned away from polling stations in six of Zimbabwe 's 10 provinces , either for lacking proper identity documents or being at the wrong voting centre .
An independent poll monitoring group put the number of voters turned away at as high as 25 % .
Correspondents writing on sokwanele.com , an underground site committed to peaceful protest , reported that presiding officers were failing to post results outside polling stations as required by electoral law .
Instead , they were imposing news blackouts , leaving results to be announced by the Mugabe - leaning registrar general in Harare .
They also reported instances of MDC officials being held in polling stations and opposition supporters being chased away by Zanu - PF militia .
Over recent days , charges that intimidation was rife , that the electoral roll had been tampered with and that large numbers had been unable to cast votes set the stage for a fierce debate over the results .
The MDC complained that a number of its observers had been refused entry to the polls .
In at least one township , ruling party supporters blocked the road to a polling station with stones .
Nervous residents said the supporters were turning voters away .
Foreign observers - handpicked by Mr Mugabe from mostly sympathetic African countries - said any irregularities were minor .
However , independent analysts said the damage had already been done .
"" Fear has been ingrained , "" Brian Kogoro , the chairman of Crisis in Zimbabwe - a coalition of non - governmental groups - said .
"" You could say it hangs over the heads of people like an invisible sword . ""
Residents in some drought - stricken rural areas were told they could forfeit desperately needed food aid if they voted for the opposition , human rights groups said .
Under international pressure to produce a credible result , Mr Mugabe 's government and party appear to have ordered less of the violence that plagued previous elections .
For the first time in years , MDC supporters were able to campaign openly , even in the government 's rural strongholds .
Mr Mugabe was yesterday confident that the gamble would pay off , saying he was "" entirely , completely , totally optimistic "" of victory .
The MDC won 57 of the parliament 's elected seats in the last general election in 2000 , despite what western observers described as widespread violence , intimidation and vote rigging .
However , it lost six seats in subsequent byelections .
In 2002 , Mr Tsvangirai was declared to have lost a flawed presidential poll by a narrow margin .
Around 5.8 million people , out of Zimbabwe 's population of almost 12 million , are registered to vote .
However , up to 3.4 million Zimbabweans who live overseas - many of whom are believed to be opposition supporters - are barred from casting votes .
Zimbabwe 's economy is in crisis after years of misrule and corruption , with the country 's decline having been accelerated by the chaotic seizure of white - owned commercial farms , which began in 2000 ."

Could the situation in Zimbabwe get worse than it is now , with a 75 % unemployment rate , an economy running at only half its capacity and with a ruling elite that can not stop looting the state 's coffers ? ""
Sebastian Mallaby Washington Post , April 4 "" [ The ] election ... was stolen with the complicity of ...
Thabo Mbeki , South Africa 's president ...
In the run - up to Zimbabwe 's election ...
Mr Mbeki actually undercut the international pressure for a fair contest .
He expressed a serene confidence that the election would be free and fair ...
He quarrelled with the Bush administration 's description of Zimbabwe as an outpost of repression .
He did everything , in other words , to signal that mass fraud would be acceptable .
And so Zimbabwe 's thugs obliged him ... ""
Some brave Zimbabweans called for an African version of Ukraine 's orange revolution .
But as one opposition politician said wistfully , regional conditions provided no encouragement .
Ukraine benefited from proximity to pro - democratic Europe .
But Zimbabwe 's democratic neighbour sent the opposite signal . """
2005-08-03,"The Zimbabwean government dropped all treason charges against the opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai yesterday , a surprise move that may open the way for negotiations between the two sides .
"" The state is withdrawing charges before plea , "" the public prosecutor , Florence Ziyambi , said at a hearing in Harare magistrates court .
Ms Ziyambi did not give any reason for the decision to drop the case , which accused Mr Tsvangirai of seeking to topple the Mugabe government through the organisation of street protests in June 2003 .
Conviction on a treason charge could have brought the death penalty .
Mr Tsvangirai , the leader of the Movement for Democratic Change ( MDC ) , was acquitted last October of charges that he plotted to assassinate Mr Mugabe before the 2002 presidential elections .
Asked why he believed the government had dropped the second treason charges , Mr Tsvangirai 's lawyer , Eric Matinenga , told journalists : "" Because he never committed a crime , and obviously someone has seen sense . ""
Lawyers in Harare said the government had made a political decision to drop the treason charges against Mr Tsvangirai . ""
Virtually everything in the courts runs on a political basis , "" said one , who spoke on condition of anonymity .
"" The case was always very weak and it should have never come to court in the first place .
But now a political calculation has been made to drop the charges .
""
Many observers say the Mugabe government is opening the door to talks between the ruling party , Zanu - PF , and the opposition MDC . ""
This sets the stage for future talks between the two parties that will be brokered by [ South African president ] Thabo Mbeki , "" said John Makumbe , professor of political science at the University of Zimbabwe . ""
After coming back from China with next to nothing in terms of cold hard cash , Mugabe is desperate , "" Prof Makumbe added .
"" He must go back to South Africa for urgent financial help and he knows that Mbeki is pushing the card of negotiations between the two parties . ""
Mr Mugabe needs $ 1bn ( £ 564 m ) to import adequate supplies of food , fuel and power and to avoid imminent suspension from the IMF by paying off arrears of $ 300 m .
When top Zimbabwean officials went to South Africa two weeks ago they were told financial assistance would depend upon Mr Mugabe making substantial political and economic reforms , according to South African government sources .
"" Mugabe will have to agree to Mbeki 's demands for talks between the two parties , "" said Mr Makumbe .
"" Mbeki has not been tough with Mugabe before , but now the G8 leaders are pressing him to find a solution to Zimbabwe 's crisis .
International pressure does work . ""
Mr Mbeki said over the weekend that Zimbabwe needed help in dealing with its crippling foreign debt .
He said Mr Mugabe 's economic problems were a result of him spending too much on providing health , education and clean water to the people .
"" It is wrong to say that the debt problem in Zimbabwe is a problem of corruption , that money was disappearing to corrupt politicians , "" Mr Mbeki said to applause at a conference on land distribution .
But some Zimbabweans say Mr Mbeki 's analysis is not as critical of Mr Mugabe as it should be .
Iden Wetherell , an editor at the Zimbabwe Independent and Standard newspapers , said : "" If this is Mbeki 's diagnosis of the problem it does n't hold out much hope that he is going to be able to help Zimbabweans find the right solution . ""
Zimbabwe 's economic collapse stems directly from distortions in public expenditure that favoured a bloated government and parasitic state corporations at the expense of social investment .
"" When land reform did proceed it was certainly not the poor or landless who benefited but members of the governing elite , the same people who helped themselves to a variety of funds designed to assist the disadvantaged . ""
Mbeki 's account of events would appear to be the product of wishful thinking . """
2006-03-20,"Pressure will be stepped up on the government of President Robert Mugabe , Zimbabwe 's opposition leader , Morgan Tsvangirai , said yesterday .
At his party 's convention in Harare , he championed the Movement for Democratic Change as "" the mainstream "" faction and brushed off as a "" temporary diversion "" the split in the movement which arose from differences over whether to contest last November 's elections for a new upper house .
The MDC in all 12 of Zimbabwe 's provinces , plus the party 's youth and women 's wings , endorsed a new term for him at the end of the two - day congress ."
2006-07-04,"A founder member of the Movement for Democratic Change and four other politicians were attacked by a mob wielding iron bars and machetes whom they identified as supporters of a rival faction loyal to the party 's leader , Morgan Tsvangirai .

The incident in Harare 's Mabvuku township , a key area in the turf war between rival opposition factions , highlights the bitter split within the MDC .
The split took place late last year over the issue of whether or not to contest elections for the newly created senate .
Mr Tsvangirai leads the group that boycotted the senate polls and enjoys widespread support in Harare .
The group that took part in the senate elections is smaller but has many prominent MPs who allege that gangs of violent youths who support Mr Tsvangirai are intimidating township residents .

The attacking mob sang songs praising Mr Tsvangirai and the injured identified several as belonging to the party leader 's youth group .
Mr Tsvangirai has denied that his followers carried out the attack , and claimed that the mob were agents of Mr Mugabe 's regime .
Vincent Kahiya , editor of the Zimbabwe Independent , said : "" This is disturbing because it is not the first incident of Tsvangirai 's side being accused of violence .
The wheels have come off the opposition .
A divided MDC is weaker and [ President Robert ] Mugabe 's Zanu - PF is stronger .
The country is looking for leadership and direction .
People do not expect that from Zanu - PF
but they are not getting it from the MDC .
"" The MDC 's disarray further strengthens the hand of Mr Mugabe , who has succeeded in outmanoeuvring the efforts of the UN secretary general , Kofi Annan , to negotiate a solution to Zimbabwe 's deepening political and economic crisis .
Mr Annan announced this week , at the close of the African Union summit in the Gambia , that he is giving up as a mediator after Mr Mugabe rescinded an invitation for him to visit Zimbabwe .
Mr Mugabe 's most serious challenge is Zimbabwe 's accelerating economic collapse , with inflation at 1,200 % and 70 % of the 12 million population living on less than $ 1 ( 54p ) a day ."
2007-02-19,"Police in Zimbabwe fired teargas and used water cannon to break up an opposition rally yesterday as it was confirmed that three people had died in a cholera outbreak caused by water contamination in the country 's increasingly chaotic towns and cities .
More than 10 trucks of heavily armed riot police prevented the meeting of supporters of the opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai in Highfield township , despite Zimbabwe 's courts declaring the rally legal .
Police stopped a football match and sealed off the Highfield sports ground to prevent any gathering of people in the rising political tension .
Before the armed patrols moved in , angry youths had pelted police foot patrols with rocks .
The cholera deaths are the first fatalities to be officially reported since the disease took hold last month .
Nineteen people in the eastern Mabvuku township have been taken to hospital and residents report that scores more are ill but can not afford to go to a doctor .
The health minister , David Parirenyatwa , said the cholera threat was under control , but health experts disagree . ""
The spread of cholera is an indictment of the government 's neglect of basic services , "" said a Harare doctor , who did not want to be named .
"" The systemic decline in standards is a threat to public health .
Child mortality is rising , life expectancy is dropping .
And people are getting angry . ""
Labour unrest is growing .
Government hospitals are crippled by a strike of doctors and nurses , now entering its eighth week .
More than 180,000 civil servants are poised to strike tomorrow after rejecting the government 's offer of a 250 % pay raise , which falls far short of the country 's inflation rate of 1,600 % .
State - owned newspapers claimed that the civil servants were planning the strike merely to spoil President Robert Mugabe 's 83rd birthday on Wednesday .
Officials are working to raise more than £ 600,000 for a lavish party for Mr Mugabe to be held in the central city of Gweru at the weekend .
The cholera deaths highlight Zimbabwe 's rapidly declining health standards .
Until recently the country enjoyed some of the best public health standards in Africa .
Since 2000 , however , the situation has worsened .
Zimbabwe now has the world 's lowest life expectancy of 34 years for women and 37 years for men , according to the World Health Organisation .
Zimbabwean officials confirm a widespread breakdown in the water distribution system .
Many Harare areas go without water for weeks .
People dig shallow wells and sell water that has been contaminated by the widespread use of pit latrines .
Raw sewage flows through township streets because broken pipes are not repaired for months , said a township dweller .
Officials admit raw sewage is being pumped into Harare 's main reservoir , Lake Chivero ."
2007-02-22,"Zimbabwe 's police yesterday imposed a three - month ban on political rallies and protests in several of Harare 's increasingly restive townships .
The opposition Movement for Democratic Change ( MDC ) denounced the measures as "" a state of emergency "" that highlighted the growing insecurity of president Robert Mugabe 's regime .
On Sunday , police fired teargas and water cannon in Highfield township to disperse people gathering to hear the leader of the MDC , Morgan Tsvangirai , launch his campaign for the 2008 presidential elections .
The courts had declared the rally legal but police prevented it , fearing anti - government protests .
Youths threw stones at police until 10 trucks of heavily armed officers moved in to arrest 40 protesters and patrol the township .
The police said the ban was needed to prevent "" pandemonium , looting and destruction of property "" .
It covers Harare 's southern townships , including Highfield , which is now a hotbed of opposition . ""
The regime is panicking .
They are trying to impose a state of emergency .
This is tantamount to banning the MDC and all political activity , "" said an MDC spokesman , Nelson Chamisa .
He said the opposition party would continue to "" organise our rallies and meetings where necessary "" .
Tensions are rising in Zimbabwe as a result of 1,600 % inflation and shortages of fuel and staple foods .
Mr Mugabe showed little awareness of the crisis in an interview marking his 83rd birthday yesterday .
He said he would not step down in the near future despite admitting he was being pressured by cabinet ministers to do so .
He warned them not to "" push Mugabe out just now .
There are no vacancies because I am still there "" .
In the rambling , heavily edited interview , Mr Mugabe denied the economy was sinking but conceded that economic problems were causing people to suffer ."
2007-03-12,"Zimbabwe opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai was said to be seriously injured by police and one of his supporters was shot dead in an anti - government demonstration yesterday in Harare .
He was injured when arrested along with more than 110 activists , according to officials in his party , the Movement for Democratic Change ( MDC ) .
Heavily armed riot police were preventing a "" Save Zimbabwe "" prayer meeting in Harare 's Highfield township when they assaulted Mr Tsvangirai and arrested other opposition leaders , said witnesses and MDC officials .
He has a "" head injury that has caused heavy bleeding and bouts of dizziness .
Others in the cells with him are very worried about his condition , "" said Roy Bennett , the MDC 's representative in South Africa .
Zimbabwe Lawyers for Human Rights were last night pressing an urgent court application to have access to Mr Tsvangirai and to get him medical attention .
Opposition supporters threw rocks at police and set up burning barricades in Highfield in street skirmishes against police .
One protester , Gift Tandare , was shot dead .
Water cannons and tear gas were used to disperse the crowds .
It is the second demonstration in a month against Robert Mugabe , despite a police ban on all political gatherings .
Ignoring opposition to his rule , Mr Mugabe yesterday announced he would run for re - election as president ; he has held power since independence in 1980 .
Speaking to the Guardian on a visit to South Africa on Saturday , Mr Tsvangirai said : "" The regime is under siege because so many people are hungry .
Desire for change has never been so strong .
It is against this background that our party demands a new constitution that will ensure free and fair conditions in the presidential elections in 2008 . ""
Mr Mugabe was quoted in the Southern Times , a regional newspaper published jointly by the Zimbabwean and Namibian state media , as saying that he would run in 2008 : "" If the party says so , I will stand .
"" If he wins , he will be 90 when his new term expires in 2014 .
Mr Tsvangirai vowed there would be more demonstrations in the lead - up to elections , despite a ban : "" We will make the dictatorship costly .
They will have to buy more tear gas and put more police on standby to keep their regime in power . ""
The MDC leader tried to launch his drive for presidential elections under a new constitution on February 18 , but police forcibly dispersed that rally .
Police later announced a ban on all meetings .
Resistance to Mr Mugabe has grown dramatically , as the economic collapse has accelerated and standards of living plummet ; inflation is at 1,700 % , according to official figures .
By saying he will run , Mr Mugabe is expected to set off opposition throughout Zimbabwe , including turmoil within his party .
Zanu - PF is divided into three camps over who should succeed him , but several leaders are so determined he must go , they blocked his effort to get his term extended to 2010 .
When "" Mugabe 's project "" was put at the Zanu - PF conference in December it met unprecedented resistance ; it was not sent to parliament for the needed constitutional amendment , but instead put for approval by the party 's provincial leadership and then the central committee .
This opposition forced Mr Mugabe to simply stand for another six years . ""
By saying he 'll run for re - election , Mugabe is admitting he failed to extend his term by two years .
He is saying ' You do n't want to give me two more years ?
Then I will take six , ' "" said John Makumbe , politics lecturer at the University of Zimbabwe .
"" The most infuriated people are in his own party .
They 'll battle him .
Mugabe will not enjoy the support he had in the past .
We know has lost touch with the people , now he has lost touch with his own party .

2007-03-12,"Zimbabwean authorities were today urged by the British government to release prisoners taken in a "" violent and unwarranted "" attack on an opposition prayer meeting yesterday .
One person at the meeting was shot dead and scores were arrested , including Morgan Tsvangirai , the leader of the main opposition party , the Movement for Democratic Change ( MDC ) .
Mr Tsvangirai was badly beaten in custody , his lawyer said .
The Foreign Office minister Lord Triesman said the Zimbabwean president , Robert Mugabe , should be held personally responsible for the welfare of the prisoners .
"" I utterly condemn the violent and unwarranted action taken by the Zimbabwe government on March 11 when riot police disrupted a peaceful and legitimate gathering of Zimbabweans , "" Lord Triesman said .
"" The UK holds Robert Mugabe and his Zimbabwe government responsible for the safety of all those detained , urges the police to allow them access to legal advice , to provide them with medical care and to arrange for their immediate release . ""
After visitng Mr Tsvangirai in a Harare police station where he was being held , the MDC leader 's lawyer , Innocent Chagonda , told Reuters that he was badly assaulted in detention and was taken to hospital last night . ""
He was in bad shape , he was swollen very badly .
He was bandaged on the head .
You could n't distinguish between the head and the face and he could not see properly , "" he said .
"" I managed to see him from about 10 metres [ 33 ft ] inside the police holding fence at Borrowdale police station .
They were being paraded , "" Mr Chagonda said .
A spokesman for the political pressure group National Constitutional Assembly said its chairman , Lovemore Madhuku , also suffered a broken arm and a bad head wound in police custody . ""
In addition to the killing , they [ those detained ] were tortured in custody , "" said the organisers of the rally , an alliance of church leaders and opposition , civic , student and anti - government groups .
"" Lawyers of the Save Zimbabwe Campaign who visited the detainees report that Mr Tsvangirai fainted three times after severe beatings by the police while Mr Madhuku passed out and was rushed to Parirenyatwa hospital in Harare for urgent medical attention early this morning , "" they said .
The alliance said lawyers were still trying to establish the whereabouts of all those picked up by police , some of whom were being denied food or legal advice .
Police ordered organisers to cancel the meeting amid fears the MDC was trying to launch a street campaign to oust Mr Mugabe , who the opposition party blames for the country 's economic woes .
Authorities had declared the prayer meeting to be in breach of a three - month ban on political demonstrations .
Riot and paramilitary police reinforcements , who had been deployed since Friday in the area where the prayer meeting was to be held , sealed off approaches to a sports ground and fired tear gas to disperse the gathering .
The police spokesman Wayne Bvudzijena said Mr Tsvangirai and other top party officials were arrested because they "" instigated people to come out and commit acts of violence "" .
He said one man was shot dead when 200 opposition party "" thugs "" attacked about 20 policemen .
The organisers identified the dead protester as Gift Tandare , an MDC activist .
A Harare freelance photographer , Tsvangirayi Mukwahzi , and a freelance television producer , Tendai Nusiyu , were among the journalists arrested at the scene .
Mr Bvudzijena told state television that three police officers were hospitalised with injuries in the violence .
Opponents of Mr Mugabe , 83 , blame him for acute food shortages , deepening economic woes , record inflation of some 1,600%- the highest in the world - and repression and corruption .
They have demanded the resignation of Mr Mugabe , Zimbabwe 's only ruler since independence from Britain in 1980 ."
2007-03-13,"The Zimbabwean opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai was today sent to hospital for medical check - ups after arriving for a court hearing .
Mr Tsvangirai , the leader of the Movement for Democratic Change , and 49 other people injured in police custody were taken to hospital by ambulance .
"" I am confirming that anybody who needs medical attention should go and access it now , "" Florence Ziyambi , a state lawyer , told Mr Tsvangirai and his colleagues at the Harare courthouse .
Mr Tsvangirai appeared in court with a deep head wound and walking with a limp after he was arrested over the weekend .
Supporters said he had been tortured in custody and accused police of attempting to assassinate him .
He was detained along with other political activists when police crushed a demonstration organised by opposition groups , church leaders and students on Sunday .
Gift Tandare , an opposition activist , was shot dead in the unrest .
Mr Tsvangirai appeared in court with more than 50 other activists , some of them bandaged and bruised , on the orders of a high court judge .
Witnesses said he had a large gash on his head , and had around 10 stitches , and his face and eyes were badly swollen .
It was not immediately clear whether members of the group , who were arrested as they sang and chanted in defiance of a heavy police presence , had been charged .
Yesterday , Judge Chinemberi Bhunu ordered police to allow Mr Tsvangirai and the other detainees to receive immediate medical treatment and access to their lawyers .
He said that if officers refused to comply with his ruling , he wanted to see the prisoners in his court early today .
Beatrice Mtetwa , a lawyer acting for the detainees , said police had ignored the first order , refusing medical or legal help for the prisoners yesterday .
She said Mr Tsvangirai was in a "" deplorable state "" and had not been seen by his own doctors .
Eliphas Mukonoweshure , an opposition official , said : "" This is not consistent with the normal police brutality we have witnessed .
The injuries were deliberate and an attempt to assassinate him . ""
The allegations prompted international condemnation from observers concerned at growing political repression under the Zimbabwean president , Robert Mugabe . ""
This form of repression and intimidation of a peaceful assembly is unacceptable , and the loss of life makes this even more disturbing , "" Louise Arbour , the UN high commissioner for human rights , said .
The US state department condemned the police response to the protest as an indication of the "" repressive nature "" of Mr Mugabe 's government , while the EU criticised the "" violent suppression "" of political freedoms .
Opponents of Mr Mugabe blame him for repression and corruption , acute food shortages and the highest inflation in the world ."
2007-03-13,"There was growing concern for the wellbeing of the Zimbabwean opposition leader , Morgan Tsvangirai , last night after human rights groups said he and others arrested on their way to a prayer rally on Sunday had been denied access to lawyers after being assaulted by Zimbabwean police .
Zimbabwe Lawyers for Human Rights said its members had spoken to a few of those in police custody .
Police used truncheons and metal rods to beat many of the more than 100 arrested on Sunday when the "" Save Zimbabwe "" prayer meeting was broken up , the lawyers ' group said .
Police confirmed that they shot dead a young protester on Sunday as they broke up the rally .
They said they were fighting a crowd of "" 200 opposition thugs "" .
The rally was the second time in a month opposition supporters had thrown stones and skirmished with police in a sign that popular resistance is growing to President Robert Mugabe 's government .
Mr Tsvangirai , leader of the Movement for Democratic Change , sustained head wounds and lost consciousness at least three times , his wife , Susan , said .
State doctors bandaged his head and sutured his wounds , she said .
Mr Tsvangirai 's lawyer , Innocent Chagonda , saw his client from a distance and said he was limping . ""
He was in bad shape , he was swollen very badly .
He was bandaged on the head .
You could n't distinguish between the head and the face and he could n't see properly , "" Mr Chagonda told Reuters .
Lovemore Madhuku , chairman of the National Constitutional Assembly , had a broken arm , said organisers of the rally , and other opposition leaders had been "" thoroughly beaten "" by police .
Police spokesman Wayne Bvudzijena refused to comment on the allegations of police torture .
Beatrice Mtetwa , president of the Zimbabwe Law Society , said : "" We have applied for a hearing to get the courts to direct police to produce all those arrested .
We are serving papers at more than 15 outlying police stations where those arrested are being held .
We have credible reports of serious assaults .
This is against Zimbabwe 's own laws .
We are working to try to keep the rule of law in Zimbabwe . ""
MDC vice - president Thokozani Khupe said the party demanded the immediate release of the detainees and insisted the "" people 's march to freedom "" would continue .
"" The nation is on a knife - edge and the people want bread on their tables not bullets in their bellies , "" she said .
Analysts say the prayer rally in defiance of a police ban on all political gatherings showed that the opposition was becoming more united and assertive as rival groups joined forces .
The Foreign Office condemned the attack on demonstrators ; the US state department described it as typical of the Mugabe government 's brutal tactics to maintain its repressive rule ."
2007-03-14,"The Zimbabwean government was today unapologetic over allegations that the opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai sustained serious head injuries while in police custody .
Mr Tsvangirai , the leader of the Movement for Democratic Change , was being treated in intensive care after two days in custody following his arrest at an anti - government demonstration on Sunday .
His appearance in court yesterday , with a deep head wound , swollen face and a limp , prompted international condemnation amid accusations he had been tortured by police .
Speaking from his hospital bed , he told the BBC his beating was an inspiration for the struggle against the rule of the Zimbabwean president , Robert Mugabe , and said : "" There is no freedom without struggle , and there is no freedom without sacrifice . ""
The opposition leader 's lawyer said doctors believed he had suffered serious head injuries , a suspected fractured skull and internal injuries .
The 54-year - old was this afternoon moved to a unit where he could be more closely monitored , and is awaiting the results of a brain scan .
It is understood that he has undergone blood transfusions .
Mr Tsvangirai said he was attacked after arriving at a police station to check on colleagues who had been arrested earlier on Sunday .
"" It was almost as if they were waiting for me , "" he said in remarks broadcast on South Africa 's national radio . ""
Before I could even settle down , I was subjected to a lot of beatings ...
I think the intention was to inflict as much harm as they could . ""
Late this afternoon , Mr Mugabe arrived at the hospital where Mr Tsvangirai was being treated , but it remained unclear why he was visiting the building .
A statement released by his government suggested that Mr Tsvangirai and his supporters had brought the violence on themselves by resisting arrest .
"" Those who incite violence , or actually cause and participate in unleashing it , are set to pay a very heavy price , regardless of who they are , "" the information minister , Sikhanyiso Ndlovu , said in the statement .
Mr Tsvangirai , along with other political activists , was detained when police crushed a demonstration organised by opposition groups , church leaders and students .
Gift Tandare , an opposition activist , was shot dead in the unrest .
Many others were seriously injured during the police action and subsequent days in custody .
More than 30 injured activists were reunited with their families today after being treated for their wounds .
Around a dozen remained in hospital .
Opposition officials accused police of trying to assassinate Mr Tsvangirai , while his lawyer said police had ignored court orders to provide medical and legal help for the prisoners .
The accusations sparked international dismay , with the UN , the US and the EU condemning Mr Mugabe 's "" ruthless and repressive "" actions .
In central London , demonstrators interrupted a visit by the Ghanaian president to chant : "" Liberate Zimbabwe . ""
Even South Africa , which usually remains silent on its neighbour 's troubles , called on Mr Mugabe 's government to respect the rule of law .
Opponents of the Zimbabwean president blame him for repression and corruption , acute food shortages and the highest inflation in the world .
Political tensions in the country have mounted in recent weeks because of plans by Mr Mugabe to further extend his rule , possibly until 2014 .
He has ruled the country since it gained independence from Britain in 1980 ."
2007-03-14,"Battered and limping , Zimbabwe 's opposition leader , Morgan Tsvangirai , appeared in a Harare court yesterday before he and more than 50 other anti - government activists were taken to hospital for medical treatment .
Mr Tsvangirai had a deep gash on his head that had been sutured , and his face was swollen .
Others were carried into court and many had bandages and slings .
Amid growing international outrage at the treatment of the activists , who lawyers say were beaten and tortured after being arrested on Sunday on their way to a prayer rally , ambulances and vans , under police escort , ferried the opposition activists to a nearby hospital for treatment .
Lawyer Beatrice Mtetwa said the state intended to charge the activists with incitement to violence and refused to grant them bail .
Under Zimbabwe 's security laws they can be held for a further 72 hours without charges .
"" Morgan [ Tsvangirai ] obviously suffered a severe beating , "" the US ambassador to Zimbabwe , Christopher Dell , told the Guardian . ""
But I found that he was alert and in charge .
He was the first to be offered medical care but he refused until the whole group could go . ""
Mr Dell said he saw one young man lying on the floor of the courtroom , who appeared to be nearly unconscious .
"" There is confusion and chaos in the government .
They are not respecting their own procedures or laws .
These serious injuries speak volumes of the callous disregard the Mugabe government has for its own people .
This is abuse in the name of holding on to power , "" Mr Dell said .
In Washington , the US secretary of state , Condoleezza Rice , called for the "" immediate and unconditional release "" of those being held , and said the US held President Robert Mugabe responsible for the safety and well - being of those in custody . ""
The world community again has been shown that the regime of Robert Mugabe is ruthless and repressive and creates only suffering for the people of Zimbabwe , "" Ms Rice said .
In a significant shift , the South African government also criticised Mr Mugabe 's government yesterday .
"" South Africa urges the Zimbabwean government to ensure that the rule of law including the respect for rights of all Zimbabweans and leaders of various political parties is respected , "" said deputy foreign minister Aziz Pahad .
South Africa has previously maintained a policy of "" quiet diplomacy "" towards Mr Mugabe , arguing that public confrontation with him over allegations of human rights abuses and economic mismanagement could be counterproductive .
Among the seriously injured in court yesterday were Lovemore Madhuku , leader of the National Constitutional Assembly , who had a broken wrist and head injuries , and opposition activist Grace Kwinjeh , who suffered head wounds that nearly severed her right ear , according to the Zimbabwe Lawyers for Human Rights .
Police said the activists were injured because they had been in an anti - government riot .
But their lawyers said all were arrested at roadblocks long before they arrived at the site of the prayer meeting .
In a further crackdown yesterday , police raided the offices of the Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions and seized material promoting the national strike called for two days next month .
"" Staff were harassed , threatened , some were slapped and beaten up .
All offices were searched and flyers , files and some video tapes were seized , "" said Zimbabwe 's largest labour body in a statement .
One official was taken away by police .
Two opposition supporters were also injured by police who attempted to break up a wake being held for Gift Tandare , who was shot dead on Sunday by police dispersing stone - throwing youths ."
2007-03-15,"A week ago he was an opposition figure at risk of fading from the political scene .
Today , images of Morgan Tsvangirai 's battered and swollen face are world news , shaming even the African Union to admit that it is embarrassed by the actions of Robert Mugabe 's thugs .
The brutal beating in custody of Zimbabwe 's most famous trade unionist has focused attention on the sufferings endured by his countrymen after seven years of ineffective electioneering by his Movement for Democratic Change .
Mr Tsvangirai is no Nelson Mandela .
He has admitted lapses of judgment , such as the time he was secretly taped discussing plans to assassinate Mr Mugabe with a former Israeli spy .
It was a set up and formed the basis of one of two charges of treason , of which he was acquitted .
Under him , the MDC split on ethnic lines , between the Shona and Ndebele tribes , over whether to contest elections to the senate .
He resisted calls to take to the streets in rigged parliamentary elections of 2000 and presidential elections two years later .
Critics claim these were missed opportunities , but Mr Tsvangirai has kept faith with his people .
He is plucky and still enormously popular and he has remained a democrat .
The eldest of nine children , who had to leave school early to support the family , he is largely self - taught .
Despite the miscalculations , or perhaps because of them , there is something of the folk hero about the man who doggedly refuses to bow to the blows of Mr Mugabe 's truncheons ."
2007-03-15,"Tensions rose in Zimbabwe yesterday when President Robert Mugabe 's government warned that the opposition would pay a heavy price for what it described as a campaign of violence to overthrow the government .
At the same time the opposition leader , Morgan Tsvangirai , in intensive care with a suspected fractured skull , vowed to continue resistance .
Zimbabwean officials failed to press charges yesterday against Mr Tsvangirai and 50 other opposition leaders .
Twelve remained in hospital with Mr Tsvangirai , while 30 others were discharged and rejoined their families .
The group were arrested on Sunday when attempting to attend an anti - government prayer meeting and say they were beaten by police .
"" We 're on the road to recovery , "" Mr Tsvangirai , 55 , leader of the Movement for Democratic Change , told the Guardian from his hospital bed , where he received a blood transfusion .
"" We can not give in to such cowardly intimidation .
The violence has heightened our commitment .
They are the ones who are frightened .
We can not give up now . ""
Yesterday the government threatened to raise the stakes again .
"" Those who incite violence , or actually cause and participate in unleashing it , are set to pay a very heavy price , regardless of who they are , "" said the information minister , Sikhanyiso Ndlovu , according to Reuters .
Many of those arrested had been ordered to appear at Harare magistrates court yesterday morning , but they left after no state prosecutors appeared to file charges .
"" The fact that there was no prosecutor , no magistrate , no court officials - only police - says a lot , "" said defence lawyer Beatrice Mtetwa .
"" It says we are in a police state . ""
The images of a battered Mr Tsvangirai and other activists led South Africa 's trade unions and Communist party to urge President Thabo Mbeki 's government to denounce Mr Mugabe 's rule .
A spokesman for Mr Mugabe , Nathan Shamuyarira , was in South Africa on Monday and diplomatic sources say he was told that Mr Mugabe must moderate his policies or lose the protection that Mr Mbeki has given him at the UN , the African Union and the Southern African Development Community .
John Kufuor , the African Union chairman , said : "" The situation is very embarrassing ... in our various ways we are trying very hard to exercise some influence . ""
The foreign secretary , Margaret Beckett , said that the government would press for further measures against the Mugabe government ."
2007-03-15,"Robert Mugabe defiantly rejected growing international condemnation of Zimbabwe today , telling the west to "" go hang "" and attacking the opposition 's "" campaign of violence "" .
Amid signs that other African leaders are increasingly keen to distance themselves from the brutality of the Zimbabwean regime , Mr Mugabe robustly defended the police forces that allegedly beat opposition protesters with iron bars and truncheons earlier this week .
Morgan Tsvangirai , the leader of the country 's principal opposition group - the Movement for Democratic Change ( MDC ) - suffered a suspected fractured skull and was admitted to intensive care .
Mr Mugabe said the opposition was using violence in an attempt to topple him from power .
"" It 's the west as usual ... when they criticise the government trying to prevent violence and punish the perpetrators of that violence , we take the position that they can go hang , "" he said .
"" Here are groups of persons who went out of their way to effect a campaign of violence and we hear no criticism at all of those actions of violence , none at all . ""
Around 50 opposition leaders were beaten and arrested while trying to attend a prayer rally last Sunday .
Images of a battered and unsteady Mr Tsvangirai attending a court hearing were broadcast around the world , sparking international criticism .
Mr Mugabe , 83 , has frequently claimed that the MDC is sponsored by western countries keen to see him removed from power .
He has been especially critical of Britain , from which Zimbabwe gained independence in 1980 .
Although Mr Mugabe directed his comments against the west , African leaders are also beginning to criticise him .
The Tanzanian president , Jakaya Kikwete , made an unscheduled visit to Harare today to express the concerns of all the leaders of the Southern African Development Community over Mr Tsvangirai 's beating .
The 15-nation southern African body has tasked Tanzania , Lesotho and Namibia with mediating in Zimbabwe 's deepening crisis .
Mr Mugabe used to be able to count on support from African leaders , but this week several have publicly criticised him .
The Zambian president , Levy Mwanawasa , voiced his "" concern "" over this week 's developments and the country 's foreign minister , Mundia Sikatana , said : "" We should not pretend that all is well in Zimbabwe . ""
The Ghanaian president , John Kufuor - who is also chairman of the African Union - said in London this week that he was "" embarrassed "" by Zimbabwe .
The African Union 's human rights commission has produced a report that alleges the Mugabe government has committed many abuses , including police torture .
The South African government also implicitly criticised Mr Mugabe when it issued a statement urging the Harare government to respect the rule of law and the right of opposition parties to campaign freely .
South Africa 's president , Thabo Mbeki , has for years been Mr Mugabe 's chief protector , blocking human rights inquiries by regional bodies and the UN .
Mr Mbeki 's growing impatience with Mr Mugabe was evident today when the chief whip of the African National Congress introduced a motion in parliament expressing "" concern at the current situation in Zimbabwe , including reports of the alleged assault of opposition leaders while in police custody "" and calling for "" a thorough investigation to be conducted into these allegations , and that any necessary action will be taken in accordance with the law "" .
"" This is a fundamental shift in South African policy and in African opinion towards Mugabe , "" said Chris Landsberg of South Africa 's Centre for Policy Studies .
"" Playing the anti - west game wo n't wash for Mugabe anymore .
African leaders want to see Zimbabwe become a stable democracy and prosperous again and Mugabe is not leading the country in that direction . ""
Mr Tsvangirai is "" out of danger "" and may be able to leave hospital today , according to the MDC 's vice president , Thokozani Khupe .
Twelve MDC officials were arrested in Zimbabwe 's second largest city , Bulawayo , yesterday for trying to organise a protest over the alleged assault on Mr Tsvangirai and others , a party spokesman said ."
2007-03-15,"The crisis in Zimbabwe and the plight of opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai commands the attention of many papers this morning , including the Independent and the Mail .
It seemed to some that , as well as increasing opposition inside the country , there is a growing volume of international protest with Condoleezza Rice , Margaret Beckett , and John Kufor , chairman of the African Union , speaking out .
Some sources say that South Africa 's president , Thabo Mbeki has expressed his unease through diplomatic channels , and it is reported this morning some of South Africa 's activists in trade unions and in the Communist party have called on the president publicly to express his opposition to Mr Mugabe 's rule .
Others , though , thought the international protest was depressingly familiar and cyclical .
Noises like this were heard two years ago when squatters were evicted from their homes in Harare .
That led to a UN inquiry and a mission to Zimbabwe , which produced a report that was quietly left on a shelf and forgotten .
Apart from South Africa being mildly more critical , the argument runs , why should it be any different this time ?
Even the divisions within Mr Mugabe 's party , Zanu PF , are not that significant .
A Guardian leader on Tuesday pointed out that , "" There are three factions inside Zanu - PF : a loyalist group still prepared to back the 83-year - old president and two groups under the leadership of a presidential aspirant , Emmerson Mnangagwa , and a retired general , Solomon Mujuru , who is the husband of Vice - President Joyce Mujuru .
They both want Mr Mugabe to stand down next year , so that their party can maintain political control . ""
In addition , "" There are reports of disaffection in the junior ranks of the police and army , who complain about being paid less than the hired hands dispatched to beat up opposition groups . ""
And yesterday 's World Briefing noted : "" Yet even if Mr Mugabe goes , radical political and economic reform , including a power - sharing transitional government and a new constitution , will still be urgently required , an International Crisis Group report concluded this month . '
A deal that merely removed Mugabe while in effect maintaining the political status quo by keeping Zanu - PF in power would be no change at all ' .
"" The rebellious factions within the party are not concerned about reform but about protecting their incomes and privileges in a collapsing society .
Around 3 million Zimbabweans -- almost a quarter of the population and about three quarters of the workforce -- have fled mostly to South Africa .
This has not only weakened the economy but it has also has weakened opposition in the country .
Other Africa watchers drew a distinction between how the regime is regarded in the west and in other African countries .
Mr Tsvangirai is a hero in the west but he , along with the Movement for Democratic Change , are irrelevant in Africa .
Mr Mugabe is still seen as a brave liberator from colonialism and the concern of most African politicians and activists is how to reform Zanu PF rather than how to get support to MDC .
The point was also made that the colonial legacy in Africa is more than just rhetoric from Robert Mugabe .
There is a great distrust , especially of the UK .
Interestingly , though , John Major had a much better relationship with Mr Mugabe than Tony Blair does .
It is partly to do with Mr Mugabe 's attitude to the liberalism of New Labour , especially over homosexuality , but more to do with economics .
Mr Major 's Tory government paid for the land compulsorily purchased from white farmers .
New Labour stopped the payments and the violent farm seizures followed .
If Gordon Brown turns his attention to Africa , as he has promised , will that baggage dragging behind Mr Blair go with him ?
There is an immediate problem for Mr Brown in the autumn .
An EU African summit has been called and Mr Mugabe is on the guest list .
How will a renewed No 10 handle that one ?"

She said the British government wants the attackers of the MDC activists to be named and added to the list of those subject to visa bans .
"" It 's appalling , "" she said .
"" This is the direct responsibility of the government of Zimbabwe . ""
Although Mr Mugabe directed his most recent comments against western powers , African leaders are also beginning to criticise him .
The Tanzanian president , Jakaya Kikwete , made an unscheduled visit to Harare yesterday to express the concerns of all the leaders of the Southern African Development Community over the beating of Mr Tsvangirai .

2007-03-18,"An unofficial state of emergency has been imposed on Zimbabwe by President Robert Mugabe , with police beating people who venture on to the streets after dark and breaking up gatherings as small as four people , residents report .
In the capital , Harare , government gunmen yesterday seized the body of opposition activist Gift Tandare to prevent his burial from becoming a focal point for the opposition .
Tandare was shot dead by police at the prayer rally last Sunday where Morgan Tsvangirai and others from the Movement for Democratic Change were arrested and later beaten . '
Armed Central Intelligence Organisation men stormed the funeral home and took away Tandare 's body still in its coffin , ' Nelson Chamisa , an MDC spokesman , said . '
People attending his wake have been beaten indiscriminately .
Mugabe 's thugs are not even respecting the dead , ' Chamisa added . '
This is against African culture and against God .
It is the act of a frightened regime .
Mugabe is trying to provoke violence . '
Tsvangirai was still feeling ' dizzy ' from his injuries and resting at home , said his party officials .
He has five stitches to a head wound and a broken arm .
Four others beaten with him remain in hospital . '
This incident has just heightened the stakes , ' said Tsvangirai . '
This has created even more impetus and more determination on the part of Zimbabweans . '
Zimbabwean police also stopped two opposition officials from flying to South Africa yesterday for medical treatment for injuries in the same beatings as Mr Tsvangirai , according to their lawyer .
MDC members Sekai Holland and Grace Kwinje , who were among the most severely beaten , were prevented from boarding a flight to South Africa , said their lawyer Andrew Makoni .
They are back in a Harare hospital .
Domestic and international pressure against the Mugabe government is mounting .
The British government has this weekend called for the UN Security Council to be briefed on the humanitarian crisis in Zimbabwe , while the 14-nation Southern African Development Community announced a special meeting on the escalating Zimbabwean crisis will be held in Dar - es - Salaam on 25 - 26 March .
This follows talks between Tanzanian President Jakaya Kikwete and Mugabe on Thursday .
A defiant Mugabe retorted that his police will ' hit harder ' and threatened to expel Western diplomats , in a speech last Friday .
Exposing his growing isolation , he admitted that members of his own Zanu - PF party were plotting against him .
Mugabe blamed the opposition for instigating the violence .
Speaking to the youth wing of Zanu - PF , he lambasted critical Western diplomats . '
We will kick them out of this country , ' said Mugabe , according to the French news agency AFP . '
I have asked the minister of foreign affairs to summon them and read the riot act to them .
We shall tell the ambassadors that this is not a country which is a piece of Europe . '
Mugabe also warned the opposition against anti - government demonstrations . '
If they do it again , we will bash them again , ' he said .
Mugabe said that , because of attacks on policemen , all officers , including traffic police , would now be fully armed . '
We are under a state of emergency : it would just be a waste of breath for Mugabe to declare it , ' said political science lecturer John Makumbe .
' We are seeing police beating people in Harare , Bulawayo , Mutare , Masvingo , Kwekwe .
It has spread all over the country . '
Makumbe said police were breaking up groups of people on the street : ' Even people walking to church are harassed .
Nightclubs are closing because no one will go out after dark . '
He warned that tensions were rising and the opposition was more united and determined . '
There is a risk of more violence .
People are saying the difference between dying quietly in our houses and dying on the streets is the same .
Only negotiations can defuse the situation .
In Zimbabwe , we are pressing for a transitional period and a new constitution leading to free and fair elections .
The international community must support that , especially Africa . '
Zimbabwe was at ' a turning point ' , and there was no going back to when ' Mugabe 's power was unquestioned .
Even his own party is shaken by tremors that are weakening Mugabe . '
Restoring democracy will not be easy . '
It 's not instant coffee .
It 's going to be a long haul and messy and it has already started to be bloody . '
Many Zimbabweans are frightened . '
It 's scary .
Everybody is angry and wants change .
But police are beating us and keeping us in our homes , ' said Fred Chihota , 29 , who lives in Harare 's Mabvuku township . '
Prices go up every day and people can not buy bread .
People say nothing will get better until Mugabe goes .
Nobody supports him .
Nobody .
I do n't know what is going to happen .
It feels like things are going to explode . '
Chihota had been made redundant and now ekes out a living selling trinkets for the dwindling tourist trade . '
We want to meet and plan what to do , but the police and army break up any meeting of just a few people .
We must stay in our homes , but we contact each other by cell phones . '
Students are being sent home early from night schools because police arrested young people as they went home , reports Harare factory supervisor Iddah Mandaza : ' My son is missing his classes , but he knows he must get home early .
The police are beating people .
But people are angry because prices are going up and up every day . '
Doctors report they are treating a stream of injuries from beatings by police , the army , the Zanu - PF youth militia and the CIO .
Zimbabwe 's splintered opposition has vowed to unite under the Save Zimbabwe campaign to challenge Mugabe 's rule .
That newfound unity was highlighted last Friday when Arthur Mutambara , leader of a breakaway faction of the MDC , stood with Tsvangirai 's deputies and vowed to fight together . '
Our core business is to drive Mugabe out of town .
There is no going back .
We are working together against Robert Mugabe and his surrogates , ' said Mutambara in Harare last Friday .
Mutumbara acknowledged that opposition factions had differences but said recent events had united them . '
Confirming the opposition 's new - found unity of purpose , Tendai Biti , secretary - general of the MDC , added : ' The struggle in Zimbabwe is completely about democracy .
We are going to do it by democratic means , by being beaten up and by being arrested - but we are going to do it , ' he said . '
Mugabe and Zanu - PF have now undressed themselves before the entire world .
No longer is Zimbabwe seen as a black / white issue or a land issue .
It is a question of democracy and basic human rights , ' said Roy Bennett , the MDC 's representative in South Africa . '
Now that the leadership of the opposition have gone to the front and have been beaten , the people of Zimbabwe are going to follow .
British Foreign Office Minister Lord David Triesman called for African and European nations to step up action against Zimbabwe , telling the BBC that Mugabe 's policies were ' bordering on crimes against humanity ' .
The British envoy to the UN called for the Security Council to be briefed on developments in Zimbabwe .
Emyr Jones Parry said he sought a ' humanitarian briefing , because of the impossibility of the present situation ' .
South Africa 's UN ambassador , Dumisani Kumalo , expressed surprise at the call , saying Zimbabwe ' is not a matter of threatening international peace and security ' .
Nobel peace prize - winner Archbishop Desmond Tutu said his fellow African leaders should ' hang our heads in shame ' for not strongly denouncing abuses in Zimbabwe ."
2007-03-19,"A Zimbabwean opposition spokesman and MP , Nelson Chamisa , was beaten unconscious yesterday at Harare airport as he was about to fly to Brussels , according to his party , the Movement for Democratic Change .
The attack followed the arrest of three other opposition leaders at the airport at the weekend and the snatching by government agents of the body of activist Gift Tandare , shot dead by police , to prevent a public funeral .
About 50 people including Morgan Tsvangirai , the opposition leader , were beaten and arrested while trying to attend a prayer rally eight days ago .
Zimbabwe 's president , Robert Mugabe , threatened more violence at the weekend , while Mr Tsvangirai pledged further resistance .
Mr Chamisa , 28 , spoke to the Guardian from hospital where he was awaiting surgery late yesterday .
Doctors said he may lose an eye from the assault , which took place in front of frightened travellers .
"" Just as I was about to enter the door of the departure area , eight men jumped me and began hitting me with iron bars .
I just fell to the ground , "" said Mr Chamisa .
"" Nobody is safe in Zimbabwe .
There is no security , no rule of law .
I am praying for my country . ""
Pearson Mangofa , an opposition MP who drove Mr Chamisa to the airport , said his assailants shoved away passengers who tried to help him .
The men grabbed Mr Chamisa 's passport , bags and laptop computer before speeding off in two cars , one without a licence plate .
Seven of them wore suits while one wore an army vest .
Mr Mangofa said the attack bore the hallmarks of Zimbabwe 's domestic spy agency , the Central Intelligence Organisation .
Mr Chamisa suffered "" terrible injuries "" to his head , jaw and right eye , said Mr Mangofa , who took him to hospital .
Mr Chamisa already had injuries to his groin and head from beatings in police custody last week with Mr Tsvangirai and others .
He was due to attend a European Union parliamentary conference in Brussels .
Two of the three MDC activists arrested at the airport on Saturday were attempting to leave the country for medical treatment for injuries received at the previous weekend 's prayer rally .
Sekai Holland and Grace Kwinjeh were taken by ambulance to the tarmac to board a flight to South Africa , but government agents seized their passports and took them back to the Avenues Clinic hospital , where they were under police guard last night .
Ms Holland , 64 , has a broken arm , a broken leg and an infection in deep tissue injuries .
Ms Kwinjeh , 30 , has lost part of her ear lobe and has head injuries .
The third person arrested was Arthur Mutambara , the leader of a breakaway faction of the MDC .
He was being held by Harare police yesterday , according to lawyers who were seeking his immediate release .
At the weekend armed government agents seized the body of Gift Tandare , an MDC member who was shot dead by police on March 10 .
The men took Mr Tandare 's coffin from a funeral parlour for a secret burial to prevent a public ceremony that had been scheduled for today and would have been attended by hundreds of mourners .
Mr Mugabe claimed that the UK and the US were backing the MDC in order to overthrow his government , according to the government - controlled Sunday Mail newspaper .
"" We have given too much room to mischief - makers and shameless stooges of the west .
Let them and their masters know that we shall brook none of their lawless behaviour , "" said Mr Mugabe , who warned that his government would be provoked to "" measures which they will regret "" .
Mr Tsvangirai , however , said Zimbabwe was facing a critical moment that could bring positive change .
"" Things are bad , but I think that this crisis has reached a tipping point and we could see the beginning of the end of this dictatorship , "" he told the BBC ."
2007-03-26,"Robert Mugabe will be ousted as leader of Zimbabwe within the next year , the country 's opposition leader , Morgan Tsvangirai , predicted today .
Mr Tsvangirai said people in Mr Mugabe 's own party , Zanu - PF , wanted to replace the 83-year - old president with a new candidate in time for next year 's elections .
The opposition leader , who said he was on the "" full recovery path "" after receiving "" a brutal beating "" by police two weeks ago , insisted in an interview on BBC Radio 4 's Today programme that Mr Mugabe should stand down so the country could get on with providing basic needs for the people .
"" I foresee a future in which those looking to the future within Zanu PF see a future without Robert Mugabe .
So it converges with our opinion that Mugabe has become the stumbling block and the only way out is to have a negotiated settlement that will see this country again on the recovery path , "" Mr Tsvangirai said .
"" I do not think he will play a part in next year 's elections .
They [ Zanu PF ] want another candidate , "" he added .
Asked whether events in Zimbabwe over recent weeks suggested that the Mugabe regime had reached a tipping point , Mr Tsvangirai , leader of the Movement for Democratic Change , agreed that this was his "" prognosis "" and it was increasingly shared by others .
"" I am sure the region is as anxious as ourselves that a negotiated solution must be found , "" he said .
He suggested that contacts between his party and people close to the South African government indicated that far more public pressure from neighbouring countries was likely to be forthcoming .
Mr Tsvangirai urged Britain to put pressure on Mr Mugabe through the European Union and United Nations . ""
What I 've always said is yes , Britain should play a part , but it should play a part within a much wider context - in other words , working within the EU and the United Nations framework to try to put pressure on Mugabe to find a solution to the pressures that Zimbabwe is facing . ""
His comments today follow political and religious pressure for international action in the country .
The international development secretary , Hilary Benn , said yesterday that Zimbabwe was "" a problem for Africa "" that the troubled nation 's neighbours must take the lead in ending .
The Archbishop of York , John Sentamu , said it was time for the South African president , Thabo Mbeki , to "" show his hand "" .
The Northern Ireland secretary , Peter Hain , earlier today called events in Zimbabwe "" a tragedy on an almost criminal scale "" .
Mr Hain said he felt especially strongly about events because of his own involvement in the anti - apartheid movement in South Africa . ""
Mugabe has completely betrayed what was a noble freedom struggle from white racist minority rule in the 1970s and virtually destroyed his country , "" he said .
""
And the sooner that there is an alternative government in power , the better . ""
But he rejected the suggestion that the UK had stood by and watched Zimbabwe 's breakdown .
"" It represents a colossal failure by the whole of the international community , "" he said , arguing that it needed an African response in particular .
"" Everybody has failed to resolve this , "" he said .
"" Everybody should now focus on getting Zimbabwe into a position where it can be under democratic government ... and move forward , and then Zimbabwe hopefully can recover . "" MPs are to be updated on the situation in Zimbabwe in a ministerial statement to the House of Commons this afternoon ."
2007-03-28,"Zimbabwean police today arrested the country 's main opposition leader , Morgan Tsvangirai , just ahead of the opening of a major regional summit to discuss the country 's increasingly serious political crisis .
Mr Tsvangirai was among a group of people taken away by police in a bus , after officers sealed off streets leading to the opposition 's headquarters in Harare , the leader 's aide , Eliphas Mukonoweshuro , said .
"" We do n't know their whereabouts .
We do n't know if they have been charged , "" he added .
Mr Tsvangirai , leader of the Movement for Democratic Change , had been scheduled to hold a press conference at the headquarters on the "" escalating and systemic campaign of violence and intimidation "" by the regime of the president , Robert Mugabe , the party said .
The new arrest appears a deliberate message of defiance by Mr Mugabe towards a summit of southern African leaders , which opens in Tanzania tomorrow .
The 83-year - old Zimbabwean ruler was expected to fly to the Tanzanian commercial capital , Dar es Salaam , later today for the two - day meeting of the 14-nation Southern African Development Community ( SADC ) .
The detention comes just over a fortnight after Mr Tsvangirai was badly beaten in custody after police broke up a rally against the country 's president , Robert Mugabe , and his authoritarian government .
The incident , which saw several other opposition figures also needing hospital treatment , prompted an international outcry against the regime .
The foreign secretary , Margaret Beckett , protested at the latest arrests , while current EU president Germany said it was "" deeply concerned "" .
"" I strongly urge Mugabe and the Zimbabwean regime to heed the calls made by so many of the international community and their African neighbours to stop the oppression of the Zimbabwean people and respect their human rights , "" Mrs Beckett said in a statement .
The regional summit will be chaired by the Tanzanian president , Jakaya Kikwete , whose country is among three appointed by the SADC to try and address the political crisis in Zimbabwe .
Earlier this month , Mr Kikwete visited Zimbabwe after the brutal crackdown against the opposition drew renewed international attention to the country 's long - running political and economic crisis .
The UK has been among a series of nations lobbying Zimbabwe 's neighbours - notably South Africa - to put more pressure on Mr Mugabe 's regime .
On Friday , South Africa intervened directly by meeting Zimbabwe 's opposition leaders for the first time in three years and hosting separate talks with the country 's vice - president , Joice Mujuru .
"" It is difficult to see how a total meltdown wo n't take placec the South African deputy foreign minister , said before the talks began .
He said South Africa was trying to avert catastrophe by using "" constructive diplomacy "" to encourage dialogue between the Zimbabwean government and the opposition , and criticised Britain and US for "" megaphone diplomacy "" .
Yesterday , Mr Mugabe 's former right - hand man Jonathan Moyo told the Guardian that the president 's time as Zimbabwe 's ruler was drawing to a close because of opposition within his own Zanu - PF party .
The president would face a "" very high threat of a palace coup if he refused to retire voluntarily "" , Mr Moyo , an independent MP who broke from the president two years ago , said in Johannesburg ."
2007-03-28,"Recently we have seen some shocking human rights abuses being inflicted on hundreds of people in Zimbabwe , including the beating of Morgan Tsvangirai , leader of the opposition , the killing of political activist , Gift Tandare , and the arrest and unlawful detention of dozens of peaceful demonstrators , some of whom were badly beaten while being held .
Over the past few years thousands of Zimbabweans have experienced similar brutalities under the regime of systematic repression of all those who speak in opposition to the country 's President , Robert Mugabe and his government .
However for most of these people , the attacks against them have taken place far away from the media spotlight .
Conditions in Zimbabwe have increasingly worsened where , as well as the deterioration in economic and social conditions , the police have continued to operate in a politically biased manner .
The government 's introduction of the Public Security and Order Act ( POSA ) in 2002 has resulted in hundreds of opposition supporters , independent media workers and human rights defenders being arbitrarily arrested and in some cases beaten while in detention .
Amnesty International has documented incidents when this law has been misused to prevent civil society groups from holding public meetings .
In September last year more than 100 women activists involved in Women of Zimbabwe Arise ( WOZA ) were arrested before a planned peaceful sit - in at Town House in Harare .
Held in horrendous conditions at various police stations for two days , many of these women were denied access to lawyers , adequate food and medical care .
Five babies were also detained with their mothers .
Away from the media spotlight - the international community did not notice .
Now the world 's media has been able to get footage of the brutal repressive regime of Zimbabwe 's government in action , and attention is focused .
Surely the African Union ( AU ) must now respond ?
The United Nations secretary general and the UN high commissioner for human rights have urged Zimbabwe to respect human rights and US Secretary of State Condoleeza Rice sent a powerful signal condemning the actions of President Mugabe 's government .
Although international condemnation . has freely flowed , little action has followed .
For once , the AU has spoken out against the actions of President Mugabe , calling for human rights "" to be respected "" .
But this is far too weak a response when one considers the deteriorating human rights crisis currently unfolding in Zimbabwe .
At best it amounts to little more than finger - wagging chastisement .
Accountability for human rights violations is central to the AU 's own Constitutive Act , and that body needs to show that it has the political will to hold the government of Zimbabwe to account for these atrocities .
The AU has a real opportunity to demonstrate that it has the necessary political will to do this .
Otherwise , it is difficult to escape the conclusion that the AU after all may not be entirely different from the defunct state - centred Organisation of African Unity ( OAU ) .
As for South Africa 's response , they have described the beatings of Morgan Tsvangirai to be "" unacceptable "" .
However the South African government 's spokesman , Mr Maseko made it clear that South Africa has no intention of changing its approach to Zimbabwe 's crisis , and that they will maintain their practice of "" quiet diplomacy "" .
Surely last week 's events were evidence enough that such behind - the - scenes negotiations are clearly not working ?
Appropriate , strong action to stop these human rights abuses must be taken by all African Union member states immediately .
Amnesty International is urging the AU to organise an extraordinary session of its Assembly to discuss this worsening situation in Zimbabwe and agree on an effective integrated response .
The people of Zimbabwe know that the African Union are aware of the brutal regime under which they exist , they are now desperate to hear from them ."
2007-03-29,"Zimbabwe 's security forces detained the opposition leader , Morgan Tsvangirai , and other political activists in a raid on his party headquarters yesterday as President Robert Mugabe prepared to tell a meeting of southern African leaders today that his rule has not degenerated into lawless banditry .
The government threatened more arrests of opposition politicians and journalists , who it accuses of fomenting a coup , in what appeared an act of defiance by Mr Mugabe towards regional leaders who have become increasingly concerned about Zimbabwe 's economic collapse and critical of violence against the opposition Movement for Democratic Change .
But it may also have been a warning to the opposition before a general strike called for next week , and to a powerful dissident faction in the president 's Zanu - PF party that has been negotiating with the MDC over plans to replace Mr Mugabe with a power - sharing government .
Tomorrow Mr Mugabe faces a meeting of his party 's central committee at which the dissidents may move to prevent him from running for president next year .
The MDC party headquarters was raided just before Mr Tsvangirai was to hold a press conference about the rising number of abductions and beatings of opposition activists by squads of armed men loyal to Mr Mugabe .
Southern African leaders called a meeting in Tanzania to discuss the "" political and security situation "" in the region after international outrage at the severe beating of Mr Tsvangirai and other MDC activists earlier this month .
Mr Mugabe blames the opposition for the violence and Britain and the US for the deepening economic crisis .
But the region 's leaders are increasingly unwilling to accept that explanation for an economic implosion that has sent three million Zimbabweans across their borders , and the suppression of opposition politics .
Zambia 's president , Levy Mwanawasa , made the strongest criticism yet by describing Zimbabwe as a "" sinking Titanic "" .
South Africa , which has resisted public criticism of Mr Mugabe , last week described Zimbabwe as in "" meltdown "" and is believed to be the driving force behind the meeting of regional leaders .
But diplomats said that whatever may be said to Mr Mugabe in private , it is unlikely that his neighbours will all agree to strong criticism in public .
Tendai Biti , the MDC secretary general , has been holding what he describes as informal talks with the dissident faction of Zanu - PF led by the former army chief , Solomon Mujuru , whose wife , Joice , is Zimbabwe 's vice - president .
Mr Biti said the Mujuru camp and another Zanu - PF faction are agreed on the need for a power - sharing transitional government and a new constitution before elections , due in a year , can be held .
"" They do not want Mugabe to stand again as president and they acknowledge that you need a negotiated settlement in Zimbabwe and that the basis of negotiation is a new constitution , "" he said .
Mr Biti said the Zanu - PF factions want an interim administration to be headed by someone from their party .
"" I do n't have a problem with that provided we specify how long it will last .
We do n't want to appoint an interim government for years and years , "" he said ."
2007-08-14,"South African president Thabo Mbeki 's attempt to blame Britain for Zimbabwe 's problems may convince fellow leaders at the Southern African Development Community 's summit in Lusaka this week .
But it is unlikely to bring a peaceful resolution of the country 's crisis any closer - and is certain to deepen misgivings about perceived anti - western tendencies in South Africa 's international outlook .
The SADC asked Mr Mbeki to mediate between Zimbabwean president Robert Mugabe 's Zanu - PF party and the opposition Movement for Democratic Change after a brutal crackdown on government critics , including the beating of the MDC leader Morgan Tsvangirai , caused international repulsion earlier this year .
But regional analysts say that despite claims to the contrary , Mr Mbeki has made little substantive progress in bridging the gulf between the two sides . ""
He will put the best shine of his efforts , which are in all probability failing miserably , and that will suit the SADC because they do n't want to do anything anyway , "" said one observer .
According to leaks to South African media , Mr Mbeki 's report backs Mr Mugabe 's claims that British - orchestrated sanctions are the principal cause of Zimbabwe 's woes , including hyper - inflation and accelerating economic meltdown - and that the government is effectively the target of a "" regime change "" plot hatched in London with US backing .
Characterising the situation as a "" bilateral dispute with Britain "" , the Mbeki report states : "" The most worrisome thing is that the UK continues to deny its role as the principal protagonist in the Zimbabwean issue and is persisting with its activities to isolate Zimbabwe . ""
Britain harbours a "" death wish "" against the Mugabe government , it says .
Defending his policy of farm seizures , draconian price controls and nationalisation of foreign - owned companies this week , Mr Mugabe rehearsed the theme .
"" If indeed we are a sovereign independent nation , we see no reason whatever why our empowerment programmes should encounter undeserved opposition as comes from Britain regularly , "" he said .
"" Economic saboteurs do not have a place in Zimbabwe .
Let us continue to defend Zimbabwe from internal and external forces seeking to reverse the gains we have so far registered .
Let Zimbabwe be an impenetrable fortress . ""
Britain denies trying to overthrow Mr Mugabe , although successive governments have made no secret of their hope to see new leadership in Harare .
But while Mr Mugabe 's position , objectionable as it is , is well known in London , Mr Mbeki 's buck - passing and apparent resort to anti - colonialist arguments will cause particular alarm in Washington .
The US has until now accepted South Africa 's contention that "" quiet diplomacy "" is the way forward with Zimbabwe .
Mr Mbeki 's failure to deliver is now being set alongside a series of other foreign policy positions adopted by the African National Congress - led government that run contrary to wider US and western interests .
According to the New Republic magazine 's James Kirchick , these include recent , friendly contacts between South Africa 's intelligence minister and Ismail Haniyeh , the Hamas leader ; South Africa 's public support for Iran 's nuclear programme ; its defence of Sudan and Burma against proposed UN sanctions ; and its siding with Russia and China and on these and other issues .
"" The roots of the ANC 's willingness to overlook totalitarianism go back to its historic hostility to the west , which solidified during the apartheid years , when it was the Soviet Union that supplied the ANC and the US , Britain and Israel were unwilling to cut ties to the white government in Pretoria , "" Mr Kirchick argued in the Los Angeles Times .
Mr Mbeki and colleagues were the willing heirs to an "" anti - imperialist intellectual tradition heroically opposed to the western democracies , "" he said .
South Africa was squandering its post - apartheid moral authority and "" slowly moving into the anti - western camp "" .
In another neck of the geopolitical woods , western intelligence agencies fret privately about South Africa 's alleged reluctance to help track Islamist extremists and suspect funds .
According to one regional analyst , such hostile outside assessments typically fail to appreciate the driving force in sub - Saharan politics : the rightful insistence on African sovereignty , dignity and autonomy that trumped all other considerations , was jealously defended , and which Mr Mugabe has so shamelessly exploited .
All the same , this week 's expected repeat failure by regional leaders to tackle Zimbabwe 's crisis , coupled with South Africa 's apparent estrangement , will increase talk of rasher remedies .
Quoting recent appeals by Archbishop Pius Ncube of Bulawayo for British military intervention to topple Mr Mugabe ,
Boston Globe columnist Jeff Jacoby said this week it was time to act . ""
Countless lives could be saved and incalculable suffering ended if Mr Mugabe were forced from power , "" he said .

2008-01-23,"Morgan Tsvangirai , the opposition leader in Zimbabwe , was detained for four hours today after a pre - dawn raid on his home , hours before he was due to lead a banned political reform rally in the capital .
His 4 am arrest was part of large security crackdown aimed at stopping the rally .
Police have blocked all major roads leading into the centre of the capital , Harare .
The opposition vowed to go ahead with the march , which was due to start at 11 am ( 9 am GMT ) .
Nelson Chamisa , a spokesman for Tsvangirai 's Movement for Democratic Change , said the arrest and blockade were a deliberate snub to South African efforts to mediate in Zimbabwe .
"" It 's a mockery of President ( Thabo )
Mbeki 's efforts .
It 's a mockery of African solutions to African problems .
It 's a mockery to humankind , "" he said .
Speaking before Tsvangirai 's release , Chamisa said : "" The march is on .
Morgan Tsvangirai was not the only one who was going to march .
We are not going to be intimidated .
"" Police banned the march yesterday , saying the organisers had "" sinister motives "" .
State radio said police intelligence reports indicated the Movement for Democratic Change was working "" outside the spirit "" of an initial agreement to permit the march .
"" Police do not believe the march will be held in a peaceful and tranquil manner and it is felt it is not in the interest of public security for it to proceed , "" the police said .
Statements by Tsvangirai , Chamisa and other officials called for marchers on the "" Freedom Walk "" to pressure the government and ruling party , the police said .
Tsvangirai at a weekend rally repeated demands for more constitutional and electoral reforms before the elections and dismissed as fraud the redrawing of electoral boundaries to increase the number of parliament seats .
The opposition has called for the vote to be delayed to June , but the president , Robert Mugabe , has insisted it will be in March .
Changes to Zimbabwe 's media , security and electoral laws have been negotiated in South African - led talks between the ruling party and opposition .
They came into force on January 11 .
The new laws relax rules for journalists to obtain licences , and set up a new licensing authority - the Zimbabwe Media Commission .
Independent media groups say the amendments will be put to the test in coming weeks as foreign journalists seek visas and state media accreditation to visit Zimbabwe for the elections .
Foreign journalists are routinely denied visas and accreditation for reporting from Zimbabwe ."
2008-02-11,"Zimbabweans know from cruel experience that elections can bring hope but not change .
Exhausted by hunger , poverty and state brutality , they could also be forgiven for surrendering to Robert Mugabe 's demand that they re - elect him as Zimbabwe 's president next month .
The optimism that surrounded Morgan Tsvangirai 's bid for the post in 2002 has long gone , amid repression and economic collapse .
But last week Simba Makoni , once finance minister and a member of Mr Mugabe 's Zanu - PF , fought back , announcing that he will stand for the presidency in the contest on March 29 .
"" I share the agony and anguish of all citizens at the extreme hardships we have all endured ... these are a result of failure of national leadership , "" he said .
This is the boldest challenge that Mr Mugabe has faced from inside his own movement since Zimbabwe began its descent into calamity more than a decade ago .
But the truth is that Mr Makoni can not expect to win .
Victory would be possible , perhaps even likely , in a fair contest , but Zimbabwe 's election will be anything but fair .
Millions of people , mostly opposition supporters , have left since Zimbabweans last defied their president by voting against him in a constitutional referendum eight years ago this month .
Many voters live in rural areas and depend on the ruling party for food handouts .
Mr Makoni has no structure to support him ; he is being denounced in the state media and he faces opposition from at least one part of the now - divided Movement for Democratic Change , led by Mr Tsvangirai , though he is a diminished figure .
These are big hurdles - but there are still grounds to hope Mr Makoni might leap them .
He represents Zimbabwe 's most likely route out of chaos : change from within Zanu - PF .
At 58 , he comes from a post - independence generation .
He was an able finance minister , leaving the government in 2002 when Mr Mugabe refused to let him devalue the currency .
Unlike most senior party colleagues , he did not acquire a stolen farm in land redistribution .
As a senior Zanu - PF figure he is on the EU and US list of banned visitors , but he could win the votes of its supporters who , though sick of Mr Mugabe , do not trust the MDC .
By all appearances , he might make a good president .
Could he win ?
If he comes close to doing so , Mr Mugabe will try to fix the election .
But Harare is full of rumours of Zanu - PF splits .
Mr Makoni may have the support , public or private , of several top officials .
"" I have a deeper faith in my country than my party , "" he said last week .
"" I am genuine , I am honest , I am nobody 's tool or agent . ""
His first name , Simba , means lion in Swahili , and he will need all the bravery he can find if his roar of defiance is to succeed ."
2008-03-15,"Zimbabwe 's police and army chiefs have said they will not allow Robert Mugabe to be defeated in this month 's presidential election by opposition candidates they deride as "" puppets "" and "" sell - outs "" to Britain .
The warning comes amid mounting evidence that Mugabe intends to try to repeat the rigging that he used to steal the 2002 election through intimidating rural voters , padding voters rolls and hindering opposition supporters from casting their ballots on March 29 .
The police commissioner , Augustine Chihuri , said he would not recognise a victory by Morgan Tsvangirai , leader of the opposition Movement for Democratic Change , or by Mugabe 's former finance minister Simba Makoni , who appears to pose the greater threat to the president after breaking from the ruling Zanu - PF and taking some party members with him .
Chihuri said the opposition candidates would serve Britain by reversing the redistribution of white - owned farms . ""
This must serve as warning to puppets .
We will not allow any puppets to take charge , "" he said .
Chihuri 's comments follow those by the head of the military , General Constantine Chiwenga , who said "" the army will not salute sell - outs and agents of the west before , during and after the elections "" .
The MDC said Chiwenga 's statement amounted to a coup threat .
The rallying of the security chiefs in favour of Mugabe comes as others in Zanu - PF , including some senior military officers and liberation war commanders , have deserted him to support Makoni .
According to Zimbabwe 's independent press they include the former army chief Solomon Mujuru , and another ex - general , Vitalis Zvinavashe .
The opposition has accused Mugabe of laying the groundwork for vote - rigging .
Rural voters have been warned that food aid will be cut off if they do not vote for the president .
The government has also limited the number of polling stations in the cities where support for the opposition is strong in the hopes of discouraging people from voting .
But with his own party split , the president can no longer be certain that any vote - rigging will be entirely in his favour ."
2008-03-26,"A former trade union leader , Morgan Tsvangirai heads the larger faction of the Movement for Democratic Change ( MDC ) .
Tsvangirai 's MDC came close to winning power in parliamentary elections in 2000 and in a presidential vote in 2002 .
Tsvangirai 's credentials , however , were questioned after a serious split in MDC ranks in 2005 , when he overruled a decision by the party 's leadership to take part in elections for the senate and ordered a boycott .
Tsvangirai seemed a fading force after the MDC split , but has emerged as a strong challenger in this year 's election .
He grew in stature when he was badly beaten last year after taking part in a prayer meeting that police claimed was illegal .
Mugabe said the veteran trade unionist "" deserved "" his treatment for disobeying police orders , but pictures of a battered Tsvangirai only improved his reputation as a man courageous enough to stand up to an increasingly ruthless ruler .
The government accused Tsvangirai of plotting to kill Mugabe ahead of the controversial 2002 elections with the prosecution 's case resting on the testimony of Ari Ben - Menashe , a Canada - based consultant .
Menashe testified that in a secretly filmed meeting in December 2001 , Tsvangirai asked him to arrange Mugabe 's assassination .
The defence team said the tape was doctored as part of a plot to entrap Tsvangirai and the court subsequently acquitted Tsvangirai of the treason charges .
Before embarking on a political career , Tsvangirai used to be an official in Mugabe 's Zanu - PF party and was plant foreman of the Bindura nickel mine for 10 years .
Elected secretary general of the Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions in 1988
, Tsvangirai became increasingly active in politics as the economy deteriorated ."
2008-03-26,"Human rights groups today accused Robert Mugabe 's government of harassing and intimidating opposition supporters before Saturday 's national elections .
Amnesty International cited a case on March 7 , when three members of the Morgan Tsvangirai - led faction of the Movement for Democratic Change ( MDC ) were ordered by intelligence officers to take down election posters .
According to Amnesty , the officials forced the opposition supporters to chew the posters and swallow them .
"" We continue to receive reports of intimidation , harassment and violence against perceived supporters of opposition candidates - with many in rural regions fearful that there will be retribution after the elections , "" said Amnesty 's Zimbabwe researcher , Simeon Mawanza , who has recently returned from the country .
The US has also voiced concerns about the fairness of Saturday 's election , in which Mugabe faces two serious challengers , Tsvangirai and Simba Makoni , who has broken with the president 's ruling Zanu - PF party , to run as an independent .
"" We call on the government of Zimbabwe , including the Zimbabwe electoral commission , to take concrete actions to address these significant shortcomings , including respecting the human rights and fundamental freedoms of the Zimbabwean people , "" the US state department said .
The US , which imposed sanctions on Mugabe and his inner circle after he allegedly rigged his 2002 re - election , has been barred from sending election monitors to Zimbabwe .
EU observers have also not been invited , so the vote will be monitored by the African Union , as well as representatives from China , Iran and Russia .
Both the MDC and Makoni have accused Mugabe and his Zanu - PF party of trying to rig the ballot , using the security services to intimidate voters and depriving the opposition of media coverage .
"" The conditions are definitely not conducive to free and fair elections .
Our supporters are still being harassed , and the police are being used as weapons for intimidation , "" the MDC secretary - general , Tendai Biti , told Agence - France - Presse .
The opposition and human rights groups are particularly worried by the government 's decision to allow police into polling stations - ostensibly to assist illiterate and infirm voters .
The US state department said the move was one of several that could "" preclude free and fair elections on March 29 "" ."
2008-03-30,"Robert Mugabe was desperately attempting to cling to power tonight despite his clear defeat in Zimbabwe 's presidential election by blocking the electoral commission from releasing official results and threatening to treat an opposition claim of victory as a coup .
The Movement for Democratic Change said that what it regards as the overwhelming win by its candidate for president , Morgan Tsvangirai , is "" under threat "" despite growing support from foreign monitors for its claim of victory .
The party also said it had "" security concerns "" after a police raid on its election offices today , and Tsvangirai made no public appearances apparently out of concern for his safety .
Mugabe 's spokesman , George Charamba , warned Tsvangirai not to declare himself president because that "" is called a coup d'etat and we all know how coups are handled "" .
But sources close to the MDC said that the party leadership has put out feelers to the military and elements of the ruling Zanu - PF to try and arrange a peaceful transfer of power .
Independent monitoring groups said that returns posted at about two - thirds of polling stations gave Tsvangirai 55 % of the vote to Mugabe 's 36 % .
The monitors said there is no way now for the president , who even lost in his home territory of Mashonaland as well as other former strongholds , to legitimately win the election .
A third presidential candidate , Simba Makoni , a former finance minister who broke with Mugabe , took about 9 % .
Zanu - PF also suffered losses in the parliamentary election with at least nine members of its politburo losing their seats including the vice president , Joice Mujuru , and the defence , information and education ministers .
The MDC 's secretary general , Tendai Biti , said the party was increasingly alarmed at the refusal of the state - run Zimbabwe Electoral Commission to issue any results .
"" We are very much concerned by the lack of results from the ZEC .
It appears the regime is at a loss how to respond and is therefore taking its time .
We are really concerned by this assault on democracy .
The primary point of an election is a result .
We think there is a constitutional threat to those results , "" he said .
The commission has in the past begun issuing results as soon as they are posted at polling stations , and collated them by constituency for release within hours of the vote .
ZEC 's chairman , George Chiweshe , declined to explain why he was still not issuing results more than 24 hours after the polls closed .
"" This is a complicated election and we will release the results when we have them , "" he said .
Opposition supporters in some towns , including Bulawayo , Mutare and Masvingo , publicly celebrated but generally Zimbabweans were cautious , not quite believing that Mugabe will leave office after 28 years in power .
With more than 50 % of the vote , Tsvangirai would avoid a run - off election although his proportion might yet fall below the threshold as many of the remaining results are from rural areas where Mugabe traditionally has support .
Biti warned that there was still scope for fraud .
He said his party is still encountering irregularities including the sudden appearance of additional ballot boxes at polling stations where the count has been completed .
He also said that MDC election agents had been prevented from attending the count at several polling stations where the results then showed Zanu - PF doing significantly better than in surrounding areas .
But there was a growing acceptance among foreign monitors and diplomats that Tsvangirai had secured a clear victory over Mugabe .
South African monitors said they believed the opposition had won but would hold off on a public statement until the official results were announced .
The Pan - African parliament observer mission warned against further delays in issuing the results .
A British foreign office minister , Mark Malloch - Brown , said it was "" quite likely "" that Mugabe had lost despite "" massive pre - election day cheating "" .
Biti declined to say how the MDC will confront Mugabe if he refuses to give up power .
But he repeated hints that while the MDC would stay within the law it would encourage its supporters to challenge the government on the streets .
"" I 'm not going to prescribe a formula for Zimbabweans .
I 'm going to speak for the party I lead .
We 're going to do everything legally and constitutionally , "" said Biti ."
2008-03-30,"Zimbabwe 's opposition party claimed an overwhelming victory against President Robert Mugabe in yesterday 's presidential election , saying that the flow of results showed its candidate , Morgan Tsvangirai , had ' massacred ' the ruling Zanu - PF party .
The Movement for Democratic Change ( MDC ) defied a government ban on pre - empting the official announcement of the election results and released the count from polling stations that showed Tsvangirai beating the man who has ruled Zimbabwe for 28 years , even in the president 's home territory of Mashonaland . '
We 've won this election , ' said Tendai Biti , the MDC 's secretary - general . '
The results coming in show that in our traditional strongholds we are massacring them .
In Mugabe 's traditional strongholds they are doing very badly .
There is no way Mugabe can claim victory unless it is through fraud .
He has lost this election . '
The government 's electoral commission has yet to release the counts formally .
But the MDC said that declarations posted at polling stations across Zimbabwe last night , and gathered from its agents observing the counts , showed Tsvangirai ahead of Mugabe in every province where results were available .
The most dramatic gap was in Mashonaland West , where the MDC candidate had 88 per cent of the vote to the president 's 12 per cent .
Even in rural areas , where Mugabe has traditionally commanded support , he was taking only half as many votes as Tsvangirai , according to the MDC .
In Harare , the opposition candidate was pulling in three times as many votes as the president .
It was not clear what proportion of the overall vote the results represented , but Biti claimed it was substantial and the trend was ' irreversible ' .
He said the MDC was releasing the results ahead of the electoral commission to head off any attempt by the government to tamper with the figures when they are centrally collated , as they believe happened in the presidential election that Mugabe won by a narrow margin six years ago . '
We do n't trust the electoral commission .
It is n't independent .
We made the mistake in 2002 of not claiming our victory , ' he said . '
If they arrive at figures which are different , we will not accept that , pure and simple . '
Asked how the MDC will challenge any attempt to fix the figures , Biti hinted at popular protest . '
We will not make the same mistake again of taking court action .
But we will remain restrained as a movement .
The MDC will act inside the law .
But the MDC can not speak for the people of Zimbabwe , ' he said .
The MDC 's move came despite a warning by Zimbabwe 's police chief , Augustine Chihuri , who said he will not permit the opposition to declare victory .
He also warned against a plan by the MDC to call large numbers of people on to the streets to defend the result .
Police were posted at all major intersections in Harare yesterday , while riot police were held in reserve .
The MDC 's claim of victory came despite its protests about election irregularities earlier in the day .
Poll monitors raised concerns at the large numbers of people who were told they could not vote because of errors on the electoral roll .
African election monitors wrote to the electoral commission questioning the registration of more than 8,000 voters on vacant lots in Harare or crammed by their hundreds into small shacks .
Before the vote , Tsvangirai said the MDC had uncovered evidence of widespread vote - rigging including the names of a million ' ghost ' voters on the electoral roll .
Thousands of Zimbabweans slept at polling stations and queued for hours before they opened after the opposition called for a large turnout to counter efforts by Mugabe to rig the election .
The state - run Herald newspaper published a poll giving the president 57 per cent of the vote , enough to avoid a run - off .
The opposition says that number is no more than a guide to the scale of the fraud the government has planned ."
2008-03-30,"Welcome to the Wrap OPPOSITION CLAIMS ZIMBABWE ELECTION
TRIUMPH Many of the papers are closely watching the aftermath of this weekend 's elections in Zimbabwe .
They agree on two things : the president , Robert Mugabe , appears to have been soundly beaten in the polls , but is extremely unlikely to give up power without a fight .
The Telegraph , among others , notes that while the opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai 's Movement for Democratic Change ( MDC ) has declared itself the winner , the longer the country 's electoral commission delays in publishing the results , the greater will be the speculation that they are being rigged .
Despite unofficial figures from polling stations around Zimbabwe showing the MDC well in front , "" the official silence from Harare , the capital , was deafening "" , the Times says from Bulawayo .
The Independent fills its front page with a picture of a polling station result paper showing Tsvangirai winning almost four times as many votes as Mugabe .
The "" writing was on the wall "" for the president , it says .
In a column for the paper , Basildon Peta , a Zimbabwean journalist formerly jailed by the Mugabe regime , writes that he is "" convinced the end has finally come for the Zimbabwean president after 28 years of misrule , unbridled corruption and shameless cronyism "" .
But he warns : "" It is unlikely to be a smooth transition . ""
The Guardian quotes one Harare churchgoer , George Murangari , expressing the same fear .
"" We want to believe , but ca n't quite , "" Murangari says .
"" We know he 's lost , but we ca n't say he 's lost until he admits it .
Do you think he 's just going to give up ?
If you do , you do n't know Mugabe . ""
Now is the time for other nations to speak out and demand that Mugabe steps down , the Telegraph says in its main editorial .
"" This includes China , Zimbabwe 's main economic guarantor ; and it includes South Africa , whose ANC rulers , whether from anti - colonial solidarity or from a sneaking admiration for their neighbour 's authoritarianism , have so far been shamefully restrained in their criticism . ""
The Times agrees : "" There is every reason to conclude that this count will be freer and fairer the higher Mr Mugabe calculates the price of stealing it to be .
Now is not the time to be shy . ""

Another story takes up far more front page space today , in large part because of the dramatic pictures - the crash of a Cessna private jet into a housing estate in Farnborough , Kent , killing all five people on board .
Only the Independent and FT fail to find room for a picture of the smoking plane wreckage next to the all but destroyed house somewhere on their front pages .
The tone of the stories are similarly uniform , dwelling first on the abrupt , unlikely horror of a jet plunging out of the sky onto a quiet residential street and then on the apparent heroics of the pilot in changing course to avoid young people playing football in a park . ""
Crash pilot died a hero , "" is the verdict of the Sun , which names him as 63-year - old Mike Roberts .
The Times quotes a local man as saying the plane had been attempting to land in the field before pulling up when the pilot saw the footballers . ""
[ The pilot ] obviously made a judgment call , "" Ashley Cheesman said .
"" He did everything he could to keep that plane away from people . ""
The Mirror focuses on the reaction of the couple whose house was destroyed shortly before they returned from a holiday in Madeira . ""
Oh my God !
Not the house !
A plane into the house ! "" was 68-year - old Patricia Harman 's shocked reaction .

The FT , understandably more relaxed about executive pay , buries the news lower in its article on the bank and also notes that Applegarth 's salary was likely to "" cease if he finds another job "" .
Is this likely ?
Not according to the Mail , which spoke to one unnamed business headhunter : "" It is fair to say that no one in the corporate world is going to thank you for appointing him to a business . ""

EU LAW COULD MEAN ' LOVE '
LOST
It being Monday , many papers are ploughing their own news furrows .
The Times warns its literaphiles that internet book piracy could eventually stop authors from bothering to write , while the Independent focuses on calls by a women 's group to end the City 's "" lap dancing culture "" .
But my favourite comes in the Mail , which revives memories of the EU "" straight banana "" scare stories with a claim that pub and shop owners "" face large - scale compensation claims if their customers ogle their barmaids , waitresses or checkout staff "" .
Under EU - inspired changes to discrimination laws "" pushed through "" by the women and equalities minister , Harriet Harman , pub landlords could be sued "" if a bar worker complains about being called ' love ' , or over customers telling each other off - colour jokes "" , the paper claims .
Should we hold our breath for a flurry of lawsuits ?
Maybe not .

, there 's a rare good news story for British sport .
It seems we are good at something - track cycling .
The sport 's world championships , taking place in Manchester , ended yesterday with Britain winning nine of the 18 titles on offer .
The former rower Matthew Pinsent , writing in the Times , notes that such a haul is more gold medals than won by any British team - in all sports - at all but three of the post - war Olympics .
And the Independent has further bad news for Britain 's velodrome rivals - we were n't even trying .
Well , almost .
British Cycling 's national performance director tells the paper that certain technical innovations , devised by the so - called "" secret squirrel club "" , had been held back for this summer 's Olympics .
"" Nobody here has seen the whole range of what we have ready to roll out for Beijing , "" he said .
The cycling coverage remains broadsheet - dominated , although the Mirror hails the British team 's performance in its own way .
Victoria Pendleton , who narrowly missed out on a third world title of the championships yesterday is referred to in passing as a "" perky brunette "" .
Chris Hoy , who won a second gold , has to make do with being called "" big Scot "" , despite boasting his own rather fetching dark blond crop .

The latest news and analysis in the aftermath of the Zimbabwean elections ."
2008-03-31,"As Zimbabwean authorities announce the official election results in dribs and drabs , the nation is on tenterhooks as the results of the crucial presidential and parliamentary elections hang in the balance .
No matter who is announced winner of the presidential race - Robert Mugabe or opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai - the Zimbabwean military and police will play a key role in making sure that the result is not challenged by angry demonstrators .
Just a few weeks ago General Constantine Chiwenga , the army commander , and Augustine Chihuri , the police commissioner , gave extraordinary public pledges that they would not obey orders from anyone except Mugabe .
In the past 48 hours the army and police have displayed that loyalty to Mugabe by maintaining a heavy presence throughout Harare , especially in the populous townships which are hotbeds of support for the opposition .
Helmeted riot police , armoured personnel carriers and vehicles topped by water cannons have patrolled the townships , a clear warning to the opposition against taking to the streets to challenge the results .
Yet the loyalty of the military and police to Mugabe may not be as secure as it seems at first glance .
While the top generals and other officers have , indeed , benefited from the largesse of Mugabe , the rank and file in the army and police have suffered under poor pay and working conditions .
Police appear in shabby uniforms and it is well - known they can not afford to keep their families adequately fed and decently housed .
Mugabe , aware of the disgruntlement , last month granted hefty pay raises to his armed forces .
However , with inflation running at more than 100,000 % , the army and police officers are well aware that their pay increases are worth less every day .
Many in the security forces say privately that they are dismayed by the blatant politicisation of their once professional bodies .
They are aware that they may be held responsible for human rights abuses , including torture , committed during Mugabe 's rule .
Although the state media continue to report on the steadfast loyalty of the security forces , some independent media outlets have reported that the chiefs of the armed forces have briefed Mugabe that the army , air force and police can not be counted on to crack down on any angry demonstrators protesting against what they believe is a "" stolen election "" .
If the security forces waver in their support for Mugabe , it could well be a decisive setback for his continued rule ."
2008-03-31,"We 'll be following the developing political situation in Zimbabwe throughout the day and in tomorrow 's paper .
Chris McGreal will be talking to opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai .
With a trickle of results now being released by the electoral commission and with the opposition 's unofficial exit polls showing them with somewhere between 55 % and 67 % of the vote , it is looking more and more difficult for Robert Mugabe to hang on or for his officials to convincingly fix the results .
He may have a hard time persuading both the military and his own party that his staying on in office is now the best course for them .
But he still may declare a re - match or opt for martial law .
He also has the option , of course , to stand down gracefully .
As the crisis develops the future of Zimbabwe may rest in the hands of its people .
Will they be prepared to accept a government against their will or will they follow the examples of Kenyans or Ukrainians and take to the streets to demand fair representation ?
Zimbabweans recently have displayed a history of passivity in the face of such threats but this is now a developing situation and any outcome is possible .
We 'll also be reporting from Kenya on the plight of the Bedouin being driven from their homeland in the Negev desert , and from Gaza where Hamas has stated that Gilad Shalit , the Israeli soldier whose capture was one of the events that sparked the invasion of Gaza ( and Lebanon ) in 2006 , is still alive .
In the US , Al Gore is to launch his $ 300 m green campaign .
We 'll also be reporting on the two British marines killed this morning in Afghanistan , and on further violence in Iraq .
Here at home , the gay campaign group Stonewall will be releasing the most comprehensive study of gay and lesbian life in the UK that has ever been undertaken .
And we 'll be on the stump with Ken Livingstone and Boris Johnson in the London mayoral campaign .
The first leg of the Champions league quarter finals kick off a busy week in sport , with Roma v Man United and Schalke v Barcelona tomorrow and Fenerbahce v Chelsea and Arnesal v Liverpool on Wednesday ."
2008-03-31,"Zimbabwe 's opposition is in contact with senior military and intelligence officials to persuade them to respect the results of the election as pressure grows on President Mugabe to recognise defeat .
Sources in the opposition Movement for Democratic Change said the contacts were aimed at winning the security establishment 's support or , at the least , ensuring it did not intervene to overturn what appeared to be a clear victory for Morgan Tsvangirai over Mugabe .
Tsvangirai said last night the MDC would release its final results today confirming his victory and he called on the government 's electoral commission to respect the will of the people by immediately releasing the official presidential results .
"" There is no way the MDC will enter into any deal before [ the electoral commission ] has announced the official results , "" he said at a press conference in Harare .
"" Our country is on the precipice , on the cliff edge , as we wait . ""
Tsvangirai said there will be no negotiations with Mugabe until after the results are released , but MDC officials confirmed there have been high - level contacts with elements of the ruling Zanu - PF party and the security institutions .
But as much - delayed results continued to trickle in from the election commission amid allegations that it is manipulating the count , Zanu - PF remained defiant .
It conceded that Mugabe may not have won an outright victory but said he would win a run - off election if no candidate won more than 50 % of the vote .
On Monday , Tsvangirai approached the former army chief Solomon Mujuru , who is still a powerful figure within the military , to say the MDC is prepared to discuss the security establishment 's concerns and reassure it that a transfer of power would not lead to prosecutions for past crimes or a purge .
That contact has now broadened .
The MDC is also reaching out to elements of Zanu - PF through a third presidential candidate , Simba Makoni , a former finance minister who broke with the president but still commands party support .
The sources said they did not believe that the officials were negotiating on behalf of Mugabe , who has previously said the opposition will never govern Zimbabwe .
But the opposition calculates that winning support within the military for respecting the election results will make it considerably harder for Mugabe to cling to power .
The MDC also reached out to more moderate elements of Zanu - PF , including members of parliament with whom it has a had a working relationship .
A knowledgeable party source said the contacts were evidence that support for Mugabe within the ruling Zanu - PF was beginning to erode in the face of defeat . ""
Mugabe and some of those around him decided to try and brazen it out by fixing the results , "" said the source . ""
But Zanu - PF is not united .
It has taken a big blow that it did n't expect and there are important people who recognise that they can not go against the will of the people .
They are shocked and do not have the spirit to go down fighting for Mugabe . ""
Mugabe 's security cabinet of senior security and party officials decided on Sunday night not to recognise defeat in the presidential and parliamentary vote , and that the electoral commission — which was withholding the results — should fix them to deny Tsvangirai defeat .
MDC officials said the accounts they received of the tone of that meeting hours later had the party worried that the government might cancel the election and arrest opposition leaders , or that the military might intervene .
Before the election , the army chief , Constantine Chiwenga , said he would not recognise an MDC victory but the opposition says other officers are not prepared to go against the will of the people and prop up a defeated government that has no strategy to rescue the country from hyperinflation , food shortages and deepening poverty .
The military leadership must also be concerned about the loyalty of ordinary soldiers , many of whom will have voted for the opposition because they can barely feed their families .
The election commission began releasing results the morning after the security cabinet meeting although only piecemeal for the lower house .
Of the 132 seats declared so far , Zanu - PF had won 64 and the MDC 62 .
Six others went to a breakaway faction of the MDC .
Three government ministers have lost their seats .
But Zanu - PF had a substantial lead in the total number of votes cast — 480,000 to 400,000 for the MDC from the first 90 seats — leading the opposition to conclude that the electoral commission is gradually loading the count in favour of Mugabe .
No presidential results have been released .
However , overturning the opposition 's victory through fraud will be difficult and Zanu - PF officials conceded Mugabe may not have won an outright victory .
The MDC say its calculations give it 60 % of the presidential vote to 30 % for Mugabe .
Independent poll monitors give Tsvangirai between 50 and 55 % .
But the party 's election strategists said they were prepared for a run - off if necessary and they believed Tsvangirai would win with the support of ousted opposition candidates ."
2008-03-31,"Robert Mugabe was desperately trying to cling to power last night , despite his clear defeat in Zimbabwe 's presidential election , by blocking the electoral commission from releasing official results and threatening to treat an opposition claim of victory as a coup .
The opposition Movement for Democratic Change ( MDC ) said that what it regards as the overwhelming win by its candidate , Morgan Tsvangirai , is "" under threat "" despite growing support from foreign monitors for its claim of victory .
The party also said it had "" security concerns "" after a police raid on its election offices yesterday .
Tsvangirai made no public appearances , apparently out of concern for his safety .
Mugabe 's spokesman , George Charamba , warned Tsvangirai not to declare himself president because that "" is called a coup d'etat and we all know how coups are handled "" .
Sources close to the MDC said the party leadership had put out feelers to the military and elements of the ruling Zanu - PF to try to arrange a peaceful transfer of power .
Independent monitoring groups said returns posted at about two - thirds of polling stations gave Tsvangirai 55 % of the vote to Mugabe 's 36 % .
The monitors said there was no way for the president to win the election legitimately .
He had even lost in his home territory of Mashonaland as well as other former strongholds .
A third presidential candidate , Simba Makoni , a former finance minister who broke with Mugabe , took about 9 % .
Zanu - PF also appears to have suffered losses in the parliamentary election with at least nine members of its politburo losing their seats , including the vice - president , Joice Mujuru , and the defence , information and education ministers .
The MDC 's secretary general , Tendai Biti , said the party was increasingly alarmed at the refusal of the state - run Zimbabwe Electoral Commission ( ZEC ) to issue any results .
"" It appears the regime is at a loss how to respond ...
We are really concerned by this assault on democracy .
The primary point of an election is a result .
We think there is a constitutional threat to those results , "" he said .
The commission has in the past begun issuing results as soon as they are posted at polling stations , and collated them by constituency for release within hours of the vote .
The ZEC 's chairman , George Chiweshe , declined to explain why he was still not issuing results more than 24 hours after the polls closed .
"" This is a complicated election and we will release the results when we have them , "" he said .
Opposition supporters in some towns , including Bulawayo , Mutare and Masvingo , publicly celebrated but generally Zimbabweans were cautious , not quite believing that Mugabe will leave office after 28 years in power .
With more than 50 % of the vote , Tsvangirai would avoid a runoff election although his proportion might yet fall below the threshold as many of the remaining results are from rural areas where Mugabe traditionally has support .
Biti warned there was still scope for fraud .
He said his party was encountering new irregularities , including the sudden appearance of additional ballot boxes at polling stations where the count had been completed .
He also said MDC election agents had been prevented from attending the count at several polling stations where the results then showed Zanu - PF doing significantly better than in surrounding areas .
South African monitors said they believed the opposition had won but would hold off on a public statement until the official results were announced .
The Pan - African parliament observer mission warned against further delays in issuing the results .
A British foreign office minister , Mark Malloch - Brown , said it was "" quite likely "" that Mugabe had lost despite "" massive pre - election day cheating "" ."

The election commission has belatedly announced parliamentary results from the first six constituencies in Saturday 's poll .
They show an equal split of three wins each for Mugabe 's Zanu - PF and Morgan Tsvangirai 's Movement for Democratic Change .
The delay in announcing the results has given rise to fears that Mugabe is trying to rig the vote .
Some results were known as early as Saturday night , according to election observers .
"" Clearly the delay is fueling speculation that something might be going on , "" said Noel Kututwa , the chairman of the Zimbabwe Electoral Support Network , which includes 38 civic , church and other groups .
The MDC claims it has won 67 % of the vote , based on its returns from a third of the polling stations .
9.45am "" What will the MDC do when ZEC announces Mugabe the winner ? "" asks Bev Clark on Kubatanablogs , an online community of Zimbabwean activists .
She adds : "" All of us have to ask ourselves how willing we are to get up and get out and support the political change that is happening in Zimbabwe .
My fear is that the MDC leadership and the Zimbabwean people will once again , wait for each other to make the first move . ""
10 am The civic action group
Sokwanele is contrasting the official results from Zimbabwe 's election commission with what the opposition parties are claiming in both the presidential and parliamentary polls .
The opposition tally is described as the parallel vote tabulation , or PVT .
So far in the parliamentary election , according to this PVT count , the MDC Tsvangirai has won six constituencies , MDC Mutambara has won one , and Zanu - PF has none .

Most of the rumours come from Hope , from the group Sokwanele , who says they are "" flying crazily "" .

It says Mugabe is simply trying to "" buy time "" .
11.40am
My colleague Mark Tran has been on the phone to Andebrhan Giorgis , of the International Crisis Group thinktank .
Giorgis said it was premature of the MDC to claim victory as the result would depend not just on the urban but the rural vote , where Mugabe 's strength lies .
He was sceptical of rumours that Mugabe may have fled the country .
"" I do n't think he will go as the opposition has offered him an amnesty and it would be the lesser price to stay , "" said Giorgis , who is based in Nairobi , Kenya .
He told Mark : "" It is not outside the realm of possibility that he would accept defeat in a supreme act of statesmanship .
An act of concession would redeem him and it would be the only way of assuring stability , avoid violence and begin reversing economic decline .
"" Giorgis believes that Mugabe will come under intense pressure from elements within Zanu - PF to step down if he loses as there is a sense of exasperation among his supporters .
Many think that 28 years in power is long enough , especially considering the state of Zimbabwe after all this time .
Midday Zimnet radio claims that with 300,000 votes to be counted in the presidential poll , Tsvangirai has 58 % , Mugabe has 37 % and Simba Makoni has 5 % .
"" They are cooking up something , "" says DJ Manners .

"" Both the independent organisation Crisis In Zimbabwe Coalition and my source within the Zimbabwe Electoral Commission ( ZEC ) agree with the following figures : Tsvangirai 48 % ; Mugabe 44 % .
"" It also alleges that a Zanu - PF minister shot at a Tsvangirai supporter during a victory party .
4.45pm
What happens next ?
There are three intriguing theories / rumours doing the rounds , according to Izzy Mutanhaurwa .
Here they are : "" 1 ) The top army brass visited Mugabe early Sunday morning and told him point blank he had lost , that he should accept defeat they told him point blank that there were no guarantees that the army will protect Mugabe as allegiance had switched , Mugabe then went on to say that OK lets wait for the ZEC to finish up tallying and obviously we are still waiting . ""
2 ) The army will stage a coup and Mugabe will leave for Malaysia where he has extensive business interests , while the army rules for six months , they will then call for elections in September .
They ( the army ) will act very professionally and agree that Mugabe wanted to rig the election "" 3 ) Mugabe will win by 52.6 % the presidential election after rigging it for 24 hours .
Zanu PF will also get a majority in the parliament and the senate , they will doctor the results so that they will obtain 110 seats to MDC 's 98 . ""

2008-04-01,"On March 29 2008 , the world looked on with curiosity as Zimbabweans went to the polls to decide on the country 's leadership for the next five years .
The contest was between President Robert Mugabe , who has ruled for almost three decades , Morgan Tsvangirai , the leader of opposition Movement for Democratic Change ( MDC ) and a former leading member of Zanu - PF , Simba Makoni .
As Zimbabweans and the rest of the world wait for the final election results , inflation stands at 100,000 % .
This has been central to the country 's persisting poverty and increased human insecurity .
At the same time , members of the Zanu - PF regime have continued to see no logic in restoring respect for human rights and human security .
All this has resulted in the rise of a popular view on the need for change in Zimbabwe .
As the situation stands the opposition feels that change is only possible through the ballot box .
On the eve of the elections there were glaring cases of Zimbabweans moving out of the country rather than staying to cast their votes .
The reason was that there were growing fears about the eruption of post - electoral violence as neither the MDC nor Zanu - PF seemed to be prepared to accept defeat .
This created a scary situation indeed , considering what transpired in the aftermath of the 2008 Kenyan elections .
In another interesting development , international observers and the media , especially those viewed as hostile to the status quo , were denied entry and accreditation to observe the elections .
The opposition feels strongly that they are going to oust Zanu - PF , which also feels that it will have an edge over its opponents .
It will be difficult for Makoni on the other hand to make any substantial gain from the election .
He will , however , steal votes from the members and supporters of Zanu - PF who feel that change in Zimbabwe should come from within the party itself .
The Mugabe government has so far put the security forces on alert to quell any post - election violence .
As the results continue to arrive at the collation centre it will be interesting to see who is going to emerge victorious .
Most observer missions , including that of the Southern African Development Community ( SADC ) were divided on the credibility of the elections , suggesting the possibility of voting irregularities .
Amidst all of this , it should be noted that no matter who wins the 2008 elections , the next term of office will be a time for change and for creating a better Zimbabwe for all its citizens and the rest of the region ."
2008-04-01,"Zimbabwe 's ruling party today privately conceded Robert Mugabe had lost the first round of the presidential election to the opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai .
But Mugabe 's Zanu - PF party said a second round would be needed , according to Reuters , as Tsvangirai had failed to clinch the necessary 51 % of the vote to win outright .
Two senior party sources said projections showed Tsvangirai with 48 % of votes , Mugabe 43 % and a third candidate , Simba Makoni , a former Mugabe loyalist , 8 % .
"" What this means is that we are looking at a rerun because he did not win with a margin of over 51 % , which would have given him the job straight away , "" one of the sources told Reuters .
The government has yet to produce any results from the presidential election , heightening fears that it is trying to massage the vote in the face of a crushing defeat .
The opposition claimed that according to unofficial tallies , Tsvangirai had 60 % of the presidential vote , twice Mugabe 's total .
Private polling organisations also put Tsvangirai ahead .
Mugabe , Zimbabwe 's only leader since independence 28 years ago , denies rigging the election and his government has warned that any opposition claims of victory would be regarded as an attempted coup .
Although Mugabe 's popularity has plummeted in Zimbabwe along with the prospects of the economy , analysts believe his tight grip on the country and solid backing from the armed forces , which have benefited from widespread corruption , could see him ignore the results and claim victory .
All the signs point to a run - off in a couple of weeks , with the opposition seeking to join forces .
"" A real united front with presidential candidate Simba Makoni , who is understood to have support in the shadowy security services and in the Zanu - PF politburo , could offer some shelter for the MDC , both against last - minute rigging and in any violence stemming from the election results or in the run up to a second - round run - off , "" said Nana Ampofo , Africa analyst for the consultancy Global Insight .
Zanu - PF 's projections were close to the findings of an independent Zimbabwean election monitoring group .
The US - funded Zimbabwe Election Support Network said its projections gave Tsvangirai 49.4 % , Mugabe 41.8 % and Makoni 8.2 % .
Several European countries and the US called on Zimbabwe 's electoral commission to release the results quickly .
Slovenia , which holds the EU presidency , urged speedy action .
"" This would end the current uncertainty and prevent the risk of rising tensions , "" the presidency said in a statement .
The British prime minister , Gordon Brown , called for the immediate publication of the election results , saying the democratic rights of Zimbabweans must be upheld .
"" The eyes of the world ... will be upon Zimbabwe so that the doubts that people have and the questions people have can be answered , "" he said .
Zimbabwe 's electoral commission chairman , George Chiweshe , said the slow pace was due to the complexity of holding presidential , parliamentary and local polls simultaneously for the first time .
Official results showed Zanu - PF leading by two seats in the parliamentary poll , with 131 out of 210 constituencies declared .
A breakaway opposition party took another five seats .
A third government minister lost his seat and results showed the MDC making inroads on Mugabe 's traditional base in rural areas .
"" In our view , as we stated before , we can not see the national trend changing .
This means the people have spoken , they 've spoken against the dictatorship , "" said the MDC secretary general , Tendai Biti .
John Makumbe , a political scientist at the University of Zimbabwe , said the ruined economy had been Mugabe 's downfall .
"" All other indications are the voting reflected Mugabe 's massive loss of support because of the economy . ""
The former British Labour cabinet minister Peter Hain , a veteran anti - apartheid campaigner in his native South Africa , called on Zimbabwe 's neighbours to show they were on the side of democracy and a "" new bright future "" for the troubled nation .
He told the BBC 's Newsnight programme : "" It is long overdue for the rest of the world to stand shoulder to shoulder with the spirit of democracy which has expressed itself in Zimbabwe and which is now about to be traduced by President Mugabe and his ruling clique . ""
Moeletsi Mbeki , the brother of the South African president , Thabo Mbeki , accused his brother 's government of "" washing its hands of Zimbabwe "" .
Moeletsi Mbeki , from the South African Institute for International Affairs , told BBC News 24 that South Africa had "" long abdicated from having a strong voice on Zimbabwe "" and that its policy of quiet diplomacy amounted to doing nothing .
Asked if Mugabe was coming under pressure from the military to stand down , Mbeki said Mugabe and the army were "" partners in crime "" ."
2008-04-02,"The Zimbabwean opposition today directly challenged Robert Mugabe as it announced that its candidate , Morgan Tsvangirai , had secured enough votes to win the presidential election outright .
Brushing aside government warnings that such a declaration amounted to a coup , the Movement for Democratic Change ( MDC ) announced its version of the results at a press conference in the capital , Harare .
Later , Zimbabwe 's electoral commission conceded that the combined opposition had won a parliamentary majority - the first full official results from the weekend 's presidential and parliamentary votes .
With all but seven seats declared from 207 contested , the MDC won 96 seats and a breakaway MDC faction nine seats , while Zanu - PF took 94 seats .
One seat was won by an independent .
The presidential election results are , however , still officially unannounced .
The MDC said its figures showed Tsvangirai had won 50.3 % of the vote , Mugabe 43.8 % and Simba Makoni , a former finance minister , 7 % .
Those figures would mean Tsvangirai had taken enough votes in the first round to win the presidency . ""
Morgan Tsvangirai is the next president of the republic of Zimbawe , without a runoff [ election ] , "" the MDC secretary general , Tendai Biti , told the press conference to applause . ""
Zanu - PF has lost this election . ""
Biti 's claim for the MDC wins in the parliamentary election – 96 seats – matched the electoral commission 's figures .
In his opening remarks , he hit out at the "" unacceptable delay "" in the release of the official results . ""
Zimbabwe is bubbling with rumours , conspiracies and counter - conspiracies .
We are on the phone every minute to refute rumours because of the delay of results , particularly in the presidential elections . ""
In response , Bright Matonga , the Zimbabwean deputy information minister , accused the MDC of being "" irresponsible "" and "" mischevious "" .
"" They have got to be very careful with their activities , "" he told the BBC .
"" They think they can provoke Zanu - PF , the police and the army . ""
The MDC statement contradicted a report in the state - owned Herald newspaper , which predicted a run - off between Mugabe and Tsvangirai in the presidential election .
The paper - traditionally a Mugabe mouthpiece – also said in its morning edition that the MDC and the ruling Zanu - PF were tied in the parliamentary elections .
Today 's MDC declaration represents a risky gamble because Mugabe , who has ruled Zimbabwe for 28 years , had specifically warned the opposition not to claim victory prior to officially published results .
However , there has been nothing but silence on the presidential vote , allowing the MDC to seize the initiative .
Zimbabwean opposition officials were yesterday in contact with senior military and intelligence officials , attempting to persuade them to respect the results of the election as pressure grew on Mugabe to admit defeat .
MDC sources said the contacts were aimed at winning the security establishment 's support , or at least ensuring it did not intervene to overturn what appeared to be a clear Tsvangirai victory .
Tsvangirai said there would be no negotiations with Mugabe until after the presidential election results were released .
The South African archbishop Desmond Tutu today floated the idea of an international peacekeeping force to ensure protection for civilians in the event of violence between security forces loyal to Mugabe and MDC supporters .
He told BBC Radio 4 's Today programme he favoured a mixed force of Africans and others . ""
The situation is very volatile , "" he said .
"" Many , many people are angry .
"" I doubt that they are just going to sit back and fold their arms .
They are going to take to the streets , and I am fearful . """
2008-04-02,"Zimbabwe 's opposition were in contact with senior military and intelligence officials last night to persuade them to respect the results of the election as pressure grew on Robert Mugabe , the president , to recognise defeat .
Sources in the opposition Movement for Democratic Change said the contacts were aimed at winning the security establishment 's support or , at the least , ensuring it did not intervene to overturn what appeared to be a clear victory for Morgan Tsvangirai over Mugabe .
Tsvangirai said last night the MDC would release its final results today confirming his victory and he called on the government 's electoral commission to respect the will of the people by immediately releasing the official presidential results .
"" There is no way the MDC will enter into any deal before [ the electoral commission ] has announced the official results , "" he said at a press conference in Harare .
"" Our country is on the precipice , on the cliff edge , as we wait . ""
Tsvangirai said there would be no negotiations with Mugabe until after the results were released , but MDC officials confirmed there have been high - level contacts with elements of the ruling Zanu - PF party and the security institutions .
But as much - delayed results continued to trickle in from the election commission amid allegations that it is manipulating the count , Zanu - PF remained defiant .
It conceded that Mugabe may not have won an outright victory but said he would win a run - off election if no candidate won more than 50 % of the vote .
The MDC 's secretary general , Tendai Biti , dismissed as "" complete rubbish "" a BBC report that they were close to a deal that would see Mugabe step down .
On Monday , Tsvangirai approached the former army chief Solomon Mujuru , who is still a powerful figure within the military , to say the MDC was prepared to discuss the security establishment 's concerns and reassure it that a transfer of power would not lead to prosecutions for past crimes or a purge .
That contact has now broadened .
The MDC is also reaching out to elements of Zanu - PF through a third presidential candidate , Simba Makoni , a former finance minister who broke with the president but still has party support .
The sources said they did not believe that the officials were negotiating on behalf of Mugabe , who has previously said the opposition would never govern Zimbabwe .
But the opposition calculates that winning support within the military for respecting the election results would make it considerably harder for Mugabe to cling to power .
The MDC also reached out to more moderate elements of Zanu - PF , including members of parliament with whom it has had a working relationship .
A knowledgeable party source said the contacts were evidence that support for Mugabe within Zanu - PF was beginning to erode in the face of defeat . ""
Mugabe and some of those around him decided to try and brazen it out by fixing the results , "" said the source . ""
But Zanu - PF is not united .
It has taken a big blow that it did n't expect and there are important people who recognise that they can not go against the will of the people .
They are shocked and do not have the spirit to go down fighting for Mugabe . ""
Mugabe 's security cabinet of senior security and party officials decided on Sunday night not to recognise defeat in the presidential and parliamentary vote , and that the electoral commission - which was withholding the results - should fix them to deny Tsvangirai victory .
MDC officials said the accounts they received of the tone of that meeting hours later had the party worried that the government might cancel the election and arrest opposition leaders , or that the military might intervene .
Before the election the army chief , Constantine Chiwenga , said he would not recognise an MDC victory but the opposition said other officers were not prepared to go against the will of the people and prop up a defeated government that has no apparent strategy to rescue the country from hyperinflation , food shortages and deepening poverty .
The military leadership must also be concerned about the loyalty of ordinary soldiers , many of whom will have voted for the opposition because they can barely feed their families .
The election commission began releasing results the morning after the security cabinet meeting although only piecemeal for the lower house .
Of the 132 seats declared so far , Zanu - PF had won 64 and the MDC 62 .
Six others went to a breakaway faction of the MDC .
Three government ministers have lost their seats .
But Zanu - PF had a substantial lead in the total number of votes cast - 480,000 to 400,000 for the MDC from the first 90 seats - leading the opposition to conclude that the electoral commission is gradually loading the count in favour of Mugabe .
No presidential results have been released .
However , overturning the opposition 's victory through fraud would be difficult and Zanu - PF officials conceded Mugabe may not have won an outright victory .
The MDC say its calculations give it 60 % of the presidential vote to 30 % for Mugabe .
Independent poll monitors give Tsvangirai between 50 % and 55 % .
But the party 's election strategists said they were prepared for a run - off if necessary and they believed Tsvangirai would win with the support of ousted opposition candidates ."
2008-04-02,"Robert Mugabe 's government was dealt another blow yesterday when the ruling Zanu - PF party lost control of parliament to the opposition for the first time since independence 28 years ago .
But with no count from the presidential race released four days after the vote , impatient opposition leaders defied government warnings not to pre - empt the state 's election commission and announced that its final tally of returns gave the Movement for Democratic Change candidate , Morgan Tsvangirai , an outright majority over Mugabe .
However , the MDC 's calculation that Tsvangirai won just above the 50 % of the ballot required to avoid a run - off election means another round of voting is likely if Mugabe wants it .
The trickle of official results from Saturday 's election delivered the two wings of the MDC an outright majority in the lower house of parliament with 114 of the 210 seats .
Zanu - PF took 94 .
Seven of Mugabe 's cabinet ministers lost their seats .
In the presidential race , the MDC figures gave Tsvangirai 50.3 % of the vote to 43.8 % for Mugabe .
A third candidate , Simba Makoni , a former finance minister , took nearly 6 % .
The state - run Herald newspaper added to speculation that Mugabe would hold out for a second round by saying the presidential results that have yet to be released by the election commission pointed to a run - off .
The MDC secretary general , Tendai Biti , said the official results should be released immediately , and should reflect Tsvangirai 's outright victory , but that the MDC is ready for a second round of elections "" under protest "" .
"" One of the key pillars of the state , the legislature , is now controlled by the opposition , "" he said .
"" What these results show is everyone in Zimbabwe is ready for change .
It appears the state media is preparing the public for a run - off ...
A run - off really serves no purpose other than to embarrass certain elderly quarters . ""
Mugabe 's spokesman , George Charamba , who previously warned that the MDC announcing it had won would amount to "" a coup "" , again threatened the party .
"" You are drifting in very dangerous territory and I hope the MDC is prepared for the consequences , "" he said .
Zanu - PF 's deputy information minister , Bright Matonga , called the MDC 's declaration "" mischievous "" and accused it of trying to provoke a reaction from the security forces .
Before the election , the country 's police chief and a hardline Mugabe loyalist , Augustine Chihuri , warned the opposition not to declare victory before the official results were released .
A former senior Zanu - PF official who retains close contact with elements of the party said that Chihuri is one of the top security officials opposed to recognising defeat and favours declaring victory or going to a second round of voting in the hopes of changing the outcome .
But there are dangers for Mugabe in a run - off .
Most of those who voted for Makoni can be expected to swing behind Tsvangirai , particularly in Matabeleland , where Makoni did well and Mugabe is hated for the military campaign and massacres there in the 1980s .
That would easily deliver Tsvangirai victory based on the MDC presidential election figures .
But the next round may not be like the first .
The opposition says two new factors were among the most important in changing the conduct of this election - the posting of results at each polling station , which made it harder to rig the final results , and the relative absence of violence .
Killings and beatings of opposition activists and supporters in previous elections scared people away from rallies and the polls , particularly in rural areas .
This time Tsvangirai was able to take his campaign into areas that were traditionally strongly Zanu - PF and no - go areas .
That helped the MDC make inroads into Zanu - PF 's rural heartland .
The opposition won three out of four parliamentary seats in Manicaland .
Three years ago it took just two seats out of 16 in the province .
In another mostly rural province , Masvingo , the MDC won more than half the seats ; in 2005 it had almost no showing .
But the opposition recognises things might not be the same second time round .
While it would be too blatant to refuse to post the results at polling stations again , the MDC fears a desperate Zanu - PF will again unleash the war veterans and its militias against activists and voters .
With Mugabe apparently holding out against admitting defeat , there are also growing questions over the reaction of the military rank and file , which is likely to have voted largely for the opposition .
The former senior Zanu - PF official said there were increasing concerns among mid - ranking army officers over the loyalty of troops if they are asked to put down popular protests against any attempt by Mugabe to overturn election results .
But Matonga said : "" The army is behind President Mugabe .
The police force is behind him .
President Mugabe is going nowhere . """
2008-04-04,"Robert Mugabe and hardliners in the ruling Zanu - PF party decided yesterday to contest a run - off presidential vote if there is no outright winner from last week 's election , raising fears of a bloody fight to the finish by Zimbabwe 's president .
A week after the presidential election there is still no sign of the official results being released , raising suspicions that the election commission is waiting for political direction on whether the final count should make a run - off necessary .
The MDC claims that its candidate , Morgan Tsvangirai , won an outright victory with more than 50 % of the vote based on polling station returns .
However , the party said it was prepared to contest a second round and would "" crush "" Mugabe , who took only four out of 10 votes in last week 's election , according to its count .
But the MDC said it feared that the campaign would be marked by war veterans and Zanu - PF militias unleashing violence and intimidation against MDC supporters , which was absent before last week 's vote but a widespread tactic in previous elections .
"" I think a second round will be bloody , "" said Theresa Makone , a newly elected MDC MP .
"" People will be bludgeoned into submission . ""
The law requires a run - off within 21 days of the final count being announced but the MDC secretary - general , Tendai Biti , said the ruling party had threatened to use presidential emergency power to extend the period . ""
Zanu - PF is suggesting they want to change the period of the rerun to 90 days .
They would use that time against us , "" he said .
Hundreds of war veterans marched through Harare yesterday and vowed to "" defend the country 's sovereignty "" , taken to be a warning to the opposition , who are accused of being "" British puppets "" intending to return farms to their white former owners . ""
The election has been seen as a way to reopen the invasion of our people by whites , "" said the veterans ' militant leader , Jabulani Sibanda .
"" A good number of white people have been seen proclaiming victory for their candidate Morgan Tsvangirai . ""
Zanu - PF 's administration secretary , Didymus Mutasa , said a five - hour meeting of the party 's politburo endorsed the run - off .
He declined to give details but the leadership has been divided since a meeting of Mugabe 's security cabinet on Sunday night decided not to admit defeat .
Mutasa also accused the MDC of bribing electoral officials and said Zanu - PF would challenge the results in 16 seats in the lower house of parliament , enough to overturn the MDC 's six - seat majority which offered the prospect of an end to 28 years of Zanu - PF control .
Results trickling in for the 60 seats in the largely ceremonial upper house of parliament , the senate , give Zanu - PF 21 seats to a total of 22 for two MDC factions .
Parts of the security establishment favoured holding out for a second round of presidential elections believing that Zanu - PF could claw back support .
The head of the police and the military chief of staff have argued for not conceding defeat .
But some senior political figures believe there is no hope of winning and think the party should seek the best possible deal .
MDC sources say that Zanu - PF 's announcement that it would fight on may be no more than a negotiating tactic .
Mugabe 's aides have told the MDC that he is prepared to step down in return for an amnesty from prosecution for crimes such as the Matabeleland massacres in the 1980s and other guarantees .
But the opposition was concerned that the move might be a delaying tactic while Mugabe weighed his options .
The MDC leadership has also been in direct talks with the army and offered written guarantees to senior officers that their pensions would be protected and that they would be able to keep confiscated farms , provided they are productive .
Tsvangirai yesterday told diplomats that he has met army chiefs who have told him they will uphold the constitution .
But there were also calls yesterday for Zimbabweans to "" defend their vote "" if the results are delayed much longer .
Lovemore Madhuku , head of the national constitutional assembly who has suffered police beatings and the firebombing of his home , urged people "" not to give in to any form of intimidation , any form of violence ... that would be used to stop change or to steal the vote "" .
There is growing international concern over the delay in releasing the results .
Yesterday the South African president , Thabo Mbeki , called Tsvangirai to discuss the situation .
"" If indeed Morgan Tsvangirai is elected in terms of the electoral law than that would be fine .
If there is to be a runoff then that is fine , "" said Mbeki .
In a further sign of Mugabe 's difficulties in winning back support , a further surge in hyperinflation forced the central bank to introduce a 50m - dollar note yesterday - worth 60p at the blackmarket rate ."
2008-04-04,"Leading figures in Zimbabwe 's party today backed Robert Mugabe for a runoff vote against the main opposition party leader , Morgan Tsvangirai , if neither won an absolute majority in last week 's elections .
The Zanu - PF administration secretary , Didymus Mutasa , said the party had endorsed a runoff if necessary .
The decision , in which Zanu - PF hardliners won out , came after a five - hour meeting of the party politburo to decide whether to concede defeat or fight on .
Official results have yet to be released – six days after the presidential vote – and the ruling Zanu - PF party has also said votes would be recounted in disputed areas .
The main opposition party has also tried to force officials to release election results using the legal system .
A high court in Zimbabwe will hear an application at 9 am tomorrow morning by the MDC , to try to pressure officials to release election results "" within four hours of the court order "" , an MDC party official said tonight .
Following the party 's electoral reverses , senior aides to the Zimbabwean president approached the MDC .
They said Mugabe was prepared to step down in return for an amnesty from prosecution for crimes such as the Matebeleland massacres in the 1980s and other guarantees .
However , it was unclear whether the approach was a delaying tactic while Mugabe weighed up his options under considerable pressure from different factions within Zanu - PF 's politburo .
Parts of the security establishment favoured holding out for a second round of presidential elections .
They believe Zanu - PF can claw back support , perhaps with a campaign of violence and intimidation against the opposition – a tactic that has worked in previous elections .
Mugabe also heard from some senior political figures who believed there was no hope of the party winning the election and thought it should seek the best possible deal with the opposition .
Tsvangirai today told diplomats he had had direct contact with army chiefs who have told him they will uphold the constitution .
If so , that would add to the pressure on Mugabe to go quietly .
Veterans of Zimbabwe 's guerrilla war for black rule marched through the capital in what appeared to be a show of force today , but the country otherwise appeared generally calm as people awaited the official election results .
The long delay in their release has fuelled fears that they are being massaged in Mugabe 's favour .
The opposition says its tallies show that Tsvangirai won an absolute majority and should be declared president immediately .
Amid rumours that security forces planned to crack down on the opposition , George Sibotshiwe , a Tsvangirai spokesman , denied that the MDC leader had gone into hiding . ""
He had a meeting with diplomats today and he is in his offices , "" he told Reuters . ""
He has no reason to hide . ""
Senate results - which must precede the presidential outcome - only began trickling out last night .
Any runoff election should be held on April 19 , three weeks after the elections , but some MDC sources say Mugabe planned to extend that to 90 days to give him time to regroup .
However , senior opposition sources said the aides warned that if the Movement for Democratic Change did not agree , Mugabe could declare emergency rule and force another presidential election in 90 days .
The opposition said the MDC leadership was in direct talks with the highest levels of the army , but was treating the approach with caution because it distrusted the individuals involved .
It has called instead for direct contact with the president , fearing delaying tactics .
Those fears were reinforced yesterday when , at one point , Zimbabwe 's election commission abruptly halted the release of official results from Saturday 's elections for "" logistical reasons "" and the police raided opposition offices .
Also yesterday , police arrested two Americans , one of whom was Barry Bearak , a New York Times correspondent .
The other works for the National Democratic Institute , a US organisation that monitors elections and promotes democracy worldwide .
Two other US citizens have been freed , the US state department said , but gave no further details ."
2008-04-05,"The demise of Robert Mugabe has been proclaimed repeatedly in the week since Zimbabwe 's voters apparently despatched him to political oblivion .
The opposition Movement for Democratic Change said he would be gone within days , and for a while it looked that way , as the ruling Zanu - PF went into shock over losing control of parliament for the first time since the birth of Zimbabwe in 1980 .
MDC 's leader , Morgan Tsvangirai , claimed an outright victory in the presidential election , and the numbers he offered suggested he had indeed beaten Mugabe .
Downing Street told reporters on Thursday that the only leader Zimbabwe 's has known would be out of office by Friday .
But Mugabe emerged from the most turbulent week of his 28-year rule apparently as determined as ever not to admit defeat and promising what might prove a very bloody fight to the finish in a run - off election in which the opposition said Zanu - PF is planning to bludgeon the voters into submission .
Meanwhile the MDC was seeking to regain the momentum created hours after the polls closed with its well planned strategy to prevent Zanu - PF from stealing the election by being first to announce an election count .
Tsvangirai 's victory declaration and Zanu - PF 's loss of parliament was a political earthquake that left the country 's liberation leader looking seriously vulnerable for the first time .
Mugabe could only garner four out of 10 votes despite exploiting the resources of the state to buy , coerce and intimidate the electorate .
Mugabe went into the election confident that intimidation and pay - offs , and the rhetoric of the continuing liberation struggle against the British , would deliver him victory .
But Zanu - PF underestimated Zimbabweans ' desperation as they struggle to survive hyperinflation , mass unemployment and virtually empty food shops .
Voters were more inclined to blame Mugabe than accept his claims that the dire economic situation is a British punishment for redistributing the white - owned farms .
The key to ensuring that the vote would be respected was a reform to election law requiring the results of each polling station to be posted at the site once the count was completed .
The MDC planned its post - election strategy around that one advantage .
It allowed the party to take the initiative within hours of the polls closing by putting together enough of a tally from its agents phoning in results to claim , at 1 am last Sunday , that Tsvangirai had won the presidential election .
In releasing its own results , the MDC wrong - footed Zanu - PF and created the perception that there was no way for Mugabe to challenge the defeat ; he should go swiftly and quietly .
The MDC initially overstated Tsvangirai 's margin of victory , claiming he had 60 per cent of the vote to Mugabe 's 30 per cent , because the results coming in from its agents at the polling stations were weighted toward the cities where the opposition is stronger .
But there were enough returns from the rural areas to realise that there was a significant shift toward the MDC in many places , particularly Manicaland and Masvingo .
When the parliamentary results finally came out , the opposition won three quarters of parliamentary seats in Manicaland : three years ago , it took just two seats out of 16 .
In Masvingo , the MDC won more than half the seats , whereas it had almost no showing in 2005 .
Eight of Mugabe 's ministers lost their seats .
The MDC also carried off an important bluff in trying to prevent the final count being altered by the election commission in Harare .
The opposition claimed to have recorded the results ' declarations at all of the 9,000-plus polling station across Zimbabwe , and to have photographed most of them .
It had n't , but it does have pictures of large numbers of returns - and the government and electoral commission do n't know which ones .
Independent monitoring groups also recorded polling stations returns in crucial areas .
Zanu - PF was paralysed and divided by the MDC 's claims of victory .
Word came in that large numbers in the army had voted against Mugabe .
The rural count shocked party officials .
The electoral commission informed Zanu - PF the day after the election that an initial count showed it had lost the parliamentary and the presidential vote .
Mugabe 's security cabinet , the Joint Operations Command , comprising senior military and intelligence officers and senior party officials met that night to consider the options .
Sources with knowledge of the JOC meeting said the Zanu - PF leadership was ' in shock ' .
There was discussion of annulling the vote or falsifying the results , some form of military intervention on the pretext of saving the country from chaos , or Mugabe using his powers to declare himself president again .
What was not discussed was accepting defeat .
The JOC settled on fighting back by using the electoral commission to fix the vote , but it was apparent that overturning Tsvangirai 's victory and delivering an outright win to Mugabe would be a problem , given the posting of results at each polling station .
So the election commission simply did not release the presidential tally , while Zanu - PF decided on a strategy .
The MDC wanted to keep the focus on pressuring the election commission to declare the official results , while quietly working to persuade more moderate elements in Zanu - PF and the military that the game was up , and that they had a future without Mugabe .
But that was complicated by false reports on the BBC and in some newspapers that secret negotiations had virtually sown up a deal for Mugabe to resign .
There were no negotiations with Mugabe , and certainly no deal , but the reports fed the paranoia within Zanu - PF of a foreign plot to get him out .
In reality , contacts with Zanu - PF early in the week were cautious and tentative .
The MDC put out feelers to those ruling party politicians with whom it had a working relationship in parliament or via Simba Makoni , the former finance minister who broke with Mugabe and launched his own bid for president with the backing of some disillusioned Zanu - PF officials .
Tsvangirai approached the former army chief , Solomon Mujuru , to reassure the military that it has nothing to fear from a handover of power and to ask what its concerns were so they could be addressed .
By the end of the week , that contact paid off and Tsvangirai met senior military commanders , who were looking for guarantees for their pensions , to keep the farms they confiscated from whites and that there will be no prosecutions for past crimes .
The MDC made all those commitments in writing .
On Friday , Tsvangirai told diplomats that the army had said it would not behave unconstitutionally .
That , said the MDC , was all that was wanted .
By then , top Mugabe aides told opposition leaders that he was prepared to give up power in return for guarantees that he would not be prosecuted for past crimes and that Zanu - PF would have four seats in Tsvangirai 's cabinet .
The MDC said it resisted Zanu - PF 's demand for cabinet seats , but the approach by Mugabe 's aides divided the party leadership .
Some , including Tsvangirai , saw it as an admission of defeat and concluded that Mugabe would be gone within days .
Foreign diplomats were optimistic about the prospect of a swift transition .
On Thursday , Downing Street gave a briefing saying that Mugabe would resign on Friday .
Mark Malloch Brown , the Africa minister , told the House of Lords that Zimbabwe 's leader would be gone within days .
Others within the MDC were more cautious .
The approach from Zanu - PF came from officials close to Mugabe , who had made commitments on behalf of the president at previous negotiations that were not fulfilled .
Some senior opposition figures argued that no offer should be trusted unless it came directly from Mugabe himself .
Those officials feared that Zanu - PF was playing for time while it regrouped , fended off the political and diplomatic pressure and forged a strategy to fight back .
They were right to be cautious .
On Friday , Zanu - PF 's politburo came out fighting .
Mugabe would , it decided , contest a run - off presidential election if there was no outright winner from last Saturday 's contest .
The politburo decision was widely interpreted as an instruction to the election commission to ensure that Tsvangirai fell below the 50 per cent threshold to claim outright victory in the first round .
That will not be hard to do , given that even the MDC claims he barely scraped home with 50.3 per cent .
With the politburo meeting , Zanu - PF found its footing again .
The generals suddenly cancelled a meeting with Tsvangirai .
The war veterans marched through Harare , a chilling reminder of the bloodshed that helped Mugabe extort victory in previous elections and that might again be a factor .
Yesterday , Tsvangirai appealed for Mugabe to talk . '
I am calling on President Mugabe to begin a dialogue with me , to begin the process of a peaceful , orderly and democratic transition , ' he said . '
In making this call , I believe it is in the interests of the people and the future of this country not to create conditions of anxiety and instability .
I want to say to President Robert Mugabe : "" Please rest your mind ; the new Zimbabwe guarantees your safety "" . '
But Zimbabweans , who have had a long time to ascertain Mugabe 's true character , doubt that his security is the real issue .
Their president is not used to accepting the humiliation of defeat .
He has always fought to the last and , whatever their hopes , they do n't really expect that it will be any different now ."
2008-04-06,"Robert Mugabe was accused last night of preparing a war against Zimbabwe 's people , in an attempt to overturn the opposition 's presidential election victory .
Morgan Tsvangirai , leader of the opposition Movement for Democratic Change , who has already claimed outright victory in last Saturday 's election , even though the official count has yet to be released , said the government was reviving the war veterans and party militias to bludgeon the opposition into submission and terrorise voters before a run - off ballot . '
Violence will be the new weapon to reverse the people 's will , ' he said . '
Militants are being prepared .
War vets are on the warpath . '
Tsvangirai called Mugabe a lame - duck President and said he ' must concede to allow us to move on with the business of rebuilding and reconstructing the country ' .
He said the MDC was reluctant to take part in a second round of presidential elections because of the mounting climate of fear - although he stopped short of threatening a boycott .
Tsvangirai said : ' It is unfair and unreasonable for President Mugabe to call a run - off . '
He reiterated his claim that taking such action was unnecessary as his party claims he won 50.3 per cent of the vote .
Opposition officials said the party would launch a new court effort today to force the official election commission to publish results , after armed police prevented lawyers from entering court yesterday .
Mugabe appears to have emerged from one of the most turbulent weeks of his 28-year rule , which began with the shock of looming political oblivion , as determined as ever not to admit defeat .
South African President Thabo Mbeki warned the world yesterday not to rush to intervene in Zimbabwe .
He insisted the lengthy delay in announcing the results was for checks to be carried out ensuring that there was ' no controversy ' over the result .
Mbeki , who will hold talks with Gordon Brown today , is leading efforts to resolve the crisis .
He said it ' was time to wait ' and see what happened in a potential re - run of the elections .
Brown , who yesterday used a press conference at a summit of world leaders attended by both men to repeat calls for the results to be published , is expected to tell Mbeki privately that there is a limit to how long Zimbabwe can wait .
But Mbeki said the elections had been conducted in accordance with the rules and the delay was due to verification by the Zimbabwe electoral commission .
Because of Britain 's history as a colonial power , the government is reluctant to be seen to meddle in internal affairs in Harare ."
2008-04-07,"The battle for power in Zimbabwe has moved into the courts .
President Robert Mugabe and his rival Morgan Tsvangirai are waiting for a court to decide whether it has the authority to order the release of delayed presidential results .
But as both sides await any legal moves , Mugabe is mobilising his war veterans against the country 's few remaining white - owned farms .

They point out quite reasonably that a recount should come only after the release of official results .
Nine days after the March 29 elections , the world is still waiting for those results , so no wonder people think Mugabe lost .
11.45am
Jacob Zuma , who is set succeed Mbeki in South Africa if he beats corruption charges , has told the Wall Street Journal that political leaders should not stick around for longer than a decade because after that "" politicians begin to personalise everything and they begin to have problems . ""
Mugabe has been in power for 28 years - the only real leader Zimbabweans have known since independence - and does not seem to be in a rush to retire .
12.15pm Paul Moorcraft , who has a new book on Zimbabwe , writes a downbeat column in the South African newspaper Business Day .
It will take decades to rebuild Zimbabwe , he says , and he wonders whether Tsvangirai is capable of rebuilding from ground zero .
Mugabe "" could have saved something of his reputation had he conceded early and gone into a dignified retirement .
Instead , he has created massive uncertainty for a transition , which could yet become a second Kenya .
Mugabe 's rule destroyed Zimbabwe .
The manner of his departure might yet disgrace the whole continent . ""
12.10pm Agence France - Presse reports that the courts have postponed until tomorrow a decision on the opposition MDC 's bid to force the immediate publication of the presidential elections results .
12.30pm
Back to Business Day .
The paper 's equally gloomy leader believes there is little option now but for South Africa and the Southern African Development Development Community ( SADC ) - the regional group - to prepare a deployment of a peacekeeping force in Zimbabwe .
"" Its purpose must be clear : confine the Zimbabwean military to barracks and maintain law and order to facilitate the democratic process that began with the election - nothing more , nothing less .
In 1998 , the SADC established a precedent for military intervention when South African troops under a combined task force entered Lesotho to stop mutinous soldiers staging a coup .
Now , as then , an SADC force must enter Zimbabwe to create a safe and stable environment for diplomatic initiatives to find a peaceful solution . ""
Perhaps this is one of the subjects under discussion during Tsvangirai 's talks with unnamed top officials in South Africa .
In a paper before the election , the International Crisis Group thinktank , predicted a political crisis following a disputed election and said the African Union would have to take the lead in offering emergency diplomatic assistance .
Kofi Annan 's services may be required again after he managed to defuse the Kenyan powder keg .
1 pm Thewordwright blog predicts a growing campaign of disinformation from Mugabe as he seeks to turn Zimbabweans on to each other instead of on him .
Thewordwright points out that Mugabe is already getting his supporters worked by spreading the word that Tsvangirai is reversing "" land reform "" by returning land to white farmers .
1.15pm Reasonandlogic makes the excellent point that "" war veterans "" is really a euphemism for Mugabe thugs , as most are too young to have fought against white rule back in the 1970s .
I shall make a point of saying "" so - called war veterans "" in future .
2 pm Liberty Mupakati , in the Zimbabwe Times , says Mugabe will fall back on tactics he used after Zanu - PF 's near defeat in the 2000 parliamentary elections .
These included enlisting village headmen to work for the party ahead of the presidential ballot to ensure that their "" subjects "" voted for Mugabe .
3 pm
More evidence that Mugabe has unleashed a campaign of intimidation against the few remaining white - owned farms .
Trevor Gifford , president of the Commercial Farmers Union , says at least 27 farms have suffered incursions in southern Masvingo province and northern Centenary .
Gifford tells the Associated Press that "" In Masvingo where the police have been very cooperative , every time they remove invaders , within five , six hours they 're re - invading .
It 's very apparent that this is being coordinated from higher up the chain of command . ""
4 pm
Our man in Harare , Chris McGreal is not surprised that Tsvangirai is in South Africa as he goes there often .
Chris emails me : "" He has gone principally to rally regional support to get the election results out and prevent some kind of rip - off in the second round but also to raise money to pay for a second campaign if it comes .
He was spotted in a Johannesburg coffee shop with the MDC 's treasurer , Roy Bennett ( who is effectively in exile after a prison stint in Zimbabwe ) .
Bennett is the party 's fund raiser . ""
4:15pm Bev Clark on Kubatana.net , which groups Zimbabwean activists , urges the opposition to hold peaceful demonstrations to boost the morale of its supporters .
"" What a bold public and active statement it would be .
It would also give the opposition forces in Zimbabwe a chance to visibly and publicly unite - inspiring confidence in Zimbabweans of a coalition in the event of a run - off ...
Zimbabweans need to see our political leaders stand up in ways other than calling press conferences and filing court applications . ""
4.20pm
The Guardian has the same spine - stiffening message for the MDC .
The opposition , its leader says , will almost certainly have to face a second round and will have to prove to its supporters that it will not be intimidated by violence .
"" This time the MDC must stand up and be counted . ""
4.45pm
The New York Times reporter arrested by Zimbabwean police was badly injured while in detention and needed medical treatment , Reuters reports .
Barry Bearak and a British reporter were granted bail after being charged with covering the election without official accreditation .

2008-04-07,"Zimbabwe 's war veterans have launched fresh invasions of the country 's few remaining white - owned farms as Robert Mugabe appears to be falling back on the tested tactics of violence and raising racial tensions , in preparation for a run - off vote in the presidential election .
The opposition Movement for Democratic Change ( MDC ) warned that it might boycott a second round of elections because it would lead Zimbabweans "" to the slaughter "" of a wave of government - sponsored violence .
It is instead taking legal action to force the state election commission to immediately release results from the presidential election , held nine days ago , which the MDC says will show that its candidate , Morgan Tsvangirai , won outright with 50.3 % of the vote , making a run - off election unnecessary .
The high court is expected to rule on the petition today .
Writing in today 's Guardian , Tsvangirai calls on Britain , the US and South Africa to come to the defence of democracy in Zimbabwe .
He said Zanu - PF was withholding the election results and planning a violent second round campaign in an attempt to maintain its "" untenable grip on power "" .
War veterans , many of whom did not actually fight in the liberation struggle against white rule , targeted at least 18 farms in Masvingo , Manicaland and Mashonaland , provinces where a significant number of rural voters swung from Mugabe to the MDC in the presidential and parliamentary elections .
In previous elections , assaults on white farmers on the pretext of righting colonial injustices provided the cover for violence against their farm workers and the wider population as a means of intimidating voters from supporting the opposition .
A camera crew from state television accompanied the war veterans on to one farm , who gave a white family four hours to get out of their home , suggesting the invasions were officially sanctioned .
Hendrik Olivier , director of the Commercial Farmers Union , said the police were failing to take action and the country 's remaining 300 white farmers , from the 4,200 a decade ago , feared they were again to be made political targets .
"" The war veterans are going round giving notice to farmers to get off immediately .
They 've been taking over equipment and livestock and telling the farmers their time is up .
This thing can quickly get out of control if it 's not dealt with , "" he said .
"" Why was the Zimbabwe Broadcasting Corporation there to film the threats to the farmer ?
You can see this thing is orchestrated . ""
Chanting war veterans , some of them beating drums , also threatened farmers in Centenary , where the owners were given hours to leave .
There were also signs of renewed pressure on the opposition .
Prosper Mutseyami , a newly elected opposition MP from Manicaland , said the police were arresting MDC election agents there .
"" Nine of our agents were beaten up by the police and then arrested for behaviour likely to provoke a breach of the peace , "" he said .
In a sign that the government intends again to make white farmers an election issue , the justice minister , Patrick Chinamasa , a Zanu - PF hardliner , claimed the MDC was bringing exiled farmers back in to Zimbabwe ready to reclaim their land . ""
The MDC claim they have won and they are unleashing former white farmers on farms occupied by new farmers to reverse the land reform programme , "" he said .
"" Their intention is to destabilise the country into chaos over the land issue . ""
If the government is hoping to revive the land battles of the past , it may not have the same resonance with voters .
"" The problem is that the countryside has turned and it will be a tall order to turn sentiment around , "" said Wilfred Mhanda , head of the Zimbabwe Liberators ' Platform , a group of war veterans who no longer support Mugabe .
"" He is a desperate man and the money printing machine will be working overtime .
Some will take part [ in land invasions ] but not out of conviction .
They will be more or less like mercenaries .
"" There 's a lot of misery in the countryside and people know who is to blame .
Life is getting more desperate for them by the day . ""
In the Guardian , Tsvangirai accuses Mugabe of a systematic attempt to overturn the election results .
"" Adept at stealing elections from the hands of voters , Mugabe is now amassing government troops ; blocking court proceedings where we have attempted to seek an order simply for the electoral commission to release the final tally of the March 29 poll , raiding the offices of the Movement for Democratic Change ; and casting a pall of suppression and gloom over the country , "" he wrote .
"" This can only mean , despite some earlier evidence to the contrary , that sanity has been discarded along with truth in the offices of Zanu - PF . ""
Zanu - PF was stalling further on releasing the results yesterday .
The state - run Sunday Herald newspaper said the party was demanding a recount , claiming the figures had been manipulated against Mugabe , in a sign that there may be resistance within the electoral commission to efforts by Zimbabwe 's president to ensure there is a second round of elections because no candidate won more than half the vote .
Tsvangirai also calls on foreign powers to defend democracy in Zimbabwe . ""
Major powers here , such as South Africa , the US and Britain , must act to remove the white - knuckle grip of Mugabe 's suicidal reign , and oblige him and his minions to retire . ""
The MDC feels badly let down by South Africa 's president , Thabo Mbeki , and other regional leaders , in particular .
In the party 's view , Mbeki has played a deceptive role in which he has projected himself as an honest broker but sought to engineer a result in which Mugabe leaves office but Zanu - PF remains in power ."
2008-04-08,"Zimbabwe 's opposition leader , Morgan Tsvangirai , is in South Africa to increase pressure on Robert Mugabe to release the result of the presidential election held 10 days ago , and to admit defeat or hold a clean run - off vote .
The Movement for Democratic Change yesterday won the backing of Gordon Brown who called for "" proper international monitoring "" of any second round vote amid growing evidence that Mugabe is planning to turn a first round defeat into a run - off victory with a campaign of violence and intimidation that has worked for the ruling Zanu - PF in previous elections .
"" I believe there is a united will of the international community that elections have got to be seen to be fair , election results have got to be published , elections have got to be properly monitored , "" Brown told a news conference .
But Mugabe 's opponents are not confident that they will receive similar backing from the region 's leaders who have been consistently unwilling to confront Zimbabwe 's rulers .
South Africa 's president , Thabo Mbeki , angered the MDC when he met Brown in the UK on Sunday but declined to back the prime minister 's call for results from the presidential election to be released immediately .
The high court in Harare is expected to rule today on an opposition petition to force the election commission to make public the count that the MDC says will show that its candidate , Morgan Tsvangirai , won the election with 50.3 percent of the vote , just above the threshold to avoid a run - off ballot .
The opposition suspects the election commission is delaying the results because they are being tampered with to ensure there is a second round , and to give Zanu - PF time to mobilise its militias .
Mbeki softened his position a little , calling for the release of the results to be "" sped up "" .
But MDC officials remain wary of him after what they regard as his duplicity during eight months of mediation on behalf of the Southern African Development Community that were supposed to establish the grounds for free and fair elections .
Mbeki told a dinner in London on Sunday night that he was "" pleased with the manner in which the elections were conducted "" and attempted to sell the negotiations as a success because they concluded with most of a draft constitution . ""
This [ the draft constitution ] exists , and we agreed a range of things would impact on the elections held now .
There was some discussion about postponement
but we agreed that the elections should be at the end of March , "" he said .
In fact , the MDC objected to the election being held in March before a new constitution was in place , but Mugabe pressed ahead with them and Mbeki did not object .
The opposition 's two negotiators , Tendai Biti and Welshman Ncube , have publicly called the talks "" a disaster "" .
Even the changes to the laws that were agreed before the election were only partially implemented .
Mbeki has been in regular contact with Tsvangirai over the past week but has not spoken to Mugabe since the election .
"" There is a problem with Mbeki .
He is not an honest broker , "" said a senior MDC official .
"" We came to conclude that he had an agenda to get Mugabe out but keep Zanu - PF in power .
We have no confidence in any African leaders to stand up for democracy . ""
Zanu - PF militia and war veterans invaded more white - owned farms yesterday after Mugabe urged Zimbabweans to "" protect their land from former colonisers "" and said they could not afford to "" retreat in the battle for land "" .
The Commercial Farmers Union yesterday accused the government of leading an "" apartheid "" campaign against white farmers .
Two foreign journalists , Barry Bearak of the New York Times and a British reporter , arrested last week and charged with "" illegally observing an election "" , were released on 300 million Zimbabwe dollars ( £ 4 ) bail yesterday ."
2008-04-08,"Zimbabwe will need an election runoff between Robert Mugabe and Morgan Tsvangirai to settle the question of who will fill the office of president of Zimbabwe in 2008 .
Mugabe will go into the runoff on the back foot given his failure to claim Tsvangirai 's scalp in the first election round and Zanu - PF 's doomed attempt to attain a majority in parliament .
A plethora of political commentators , politicians and the media have proclaimed Mugabe 's end , and in so doing have underestimated his and Zanu - PF 's steely determination not to surrender sovereignty .
Sovereignty is Mugabe 's means for securing a good life for himself and the Zanu - PF political elite .
The font of sovereignty is the powerful executive presidency through which Zanu - PF has privatised the institution of the state as a means to authoritarian rule and personal aggrandisement .
When Mugabe and Zanu - PF play up sovereignty it is in order to protect their hold on power and the material benefits that come with it .
Their uses of sovereignty are less about protecting the country and its inhabitants ' sovereignty from British imperialism but more about protecting the enormous palpable advantages and privileges sovereignty affords them .
In Zimbabwe it is not the governed who are sovereign - it is Zanu - PF .
The party elites live for sovereignty .
Thus , the necessity of maintaining a hold on sovereignty commands broad consensus in Zanu - PF and the party will strive - at all costs - to control sovereignty by retaining the presidency in the looming runoff .
A runoff between Mugabe and Tsvangirai may suit Mugabe better than facing Simba Makoni because if there is anything many in Zanu - PF and Zimbabwe 's top security officials are united on , it is that Tsvangirai must not rule .
Those comprising the status quo not only stand to lose their sovereignty but also fear prosecution for crimes committed in office if Tsvangirai prevails .
Zanu - PF was divided in this election but expect it to put its differences aside and to rally behind Mugabe forcefully in a runoff with Tsvangirai .
Mugabe risked damaging defections if he had faced Makoni in a run off .
A Mugabe - Makoni runoff would have presented Makoni 's secret and powerful backers in Zanu - PF , such as Solomon Mujuru , with the opportunity to abandon Mugabe in favour of Makoni .
Mugabe will also find it easier to marshal Zanu - PF 's rank and file to campaign for him against Tsvangirai as opposed to Makoni who has many sympathisers in the ruling party .
Indeed some will not need to be marshalled at all , since retaining the presidency means guaranteeing their life of privilege .
Zanu - PF was complacent in the rural areas and some of its rural party structures were not as formidable as they normally are .
It underestimated the extent to which Tsvangirai would make significant inroads into its rural strongholds .
The free political space Tsvangirai enjoyed in the rural areas during this campaign will be gone in the runoff .
A runoff in three weeks , or 90 days as has been suggested , also allows Zanu - PF some time to tinker its rigging machinery .
The war veterans have started making violent threats and invading the few remaining white - owned commercial farms .
There is a developing discourse proclaiming the return of "" colonial "" white farmers and about how the land revolution can only be defended by re - electing Mugabe .
The military will be more involved than ever before in guaranteeing Mugabe 's re - election .
We are about to be blitzed with everything Zanu - PF has left - violence and intimidation especially ."
2008-04-11,"Zimbabwe 's opposition today called for a general strike until the results of the presidential vote , held two weeks ago , are declared .
The call for industrial action followed yesterday 's announcement by the Movement for Democratic Change ( MDC ) that its candidate , Morgan Tsvangirai , would boycott an election run - off because he had won the March 29 ballot against Robert Mugabe "" hands down "" . ""
From Tuesday , let us all stay at home until the presidential result has been announced , "" pamphlets distributed by the MDC said .
"" We call upon transporters , workers , vendors and everyone to stay at home the power is in our hands . ""
Zimbabweans have been taken for granted for too long .
We demand that the presidential election results be announced now . ""
In further signs of rising tension , Zimbabwean police banned all political rallies because of a lack of manpower to maintain order at large gatherings , state radio said today .
A police spokesman was quoted as saying that most police officers were still guarding ballot boxes from the March 29 election .
Some had been deployed in towns to guard against possible violence .
The call for a strike came on the eve of an emergency summit meeting in Zambia .
Mugabe has decided to stay away after initial indications that he , along with Tsvangirai , would take part .
State radio said Zimbabwe would be represented by three ministers at the Lusaka summit of the Southern African Development Community ( SADC ) , called to discuss the country 's election deadlock .
Mugabe 's decision was a direct snub to the Zambian president and SADC chairman , Levy Mwanawasa , who called the meeting .
Last year , Mwanawasa described Zimbabwe as a "" sinking Titanic "" .
The US - based Human Rights Watch group said the summit was the "" last real chance "" for SADC to resolve the crisis in Zimbabwe , with its knock - on effects on the rest of the region .
Millions of Zimbaweans have fled into neighbouring South Africa , away from economic turmoil in their home country , where food and fuel are in short supply , inflation is running at over 100,000 % a year and unemployment is at 80 % .
The huge influx into South Africa has inevitably created friction with the local population .
Tomorrow 's summit represents a diplomatic coup for Tsvangirai , because the South African president , Thabo Mbeki , has advocated "" quiet diplomacy "" and resisted calls for outside intervention .
In a meeting yesterday , Tsvangirai urged Mbeki to use his influence to get Mugabe to step down .
However , it remains unclear whether the SADC - considered by critics to be largely impotent - will take decisive action against Mugabe , who is regarded by some as a liberation hero for leading the independence struggle against Ian Smith 's white regime .
Mugabe , who has ruled since Zimbabwe won independence 28 years ago , appears determined to use a run - off , preceded by a campaign of intimidation , to cling on to power .
The results of the presidential ballot vote have yet to be released almost two weeks after the election , although the ruling Zanu - PF party has admitted losing control of parliament for the first time since Zimbabwe gained independence .
Yesterday , the electoral commission indicated that the results would have to await the outcome of an opposition legal case .
The MDC has gone to the high court to try to force the release of the presidential vote , and a judge has promised a verdict by Monday .
The state - controlled Herald newspaper reported that Zanu - PF was not keeping the long - delayed results from being released .
The ruling party and Mugabe "" are also eagerly waiting for the ( election commission ) to complete its ballot votes verification freely , without any interference and without pressure not to release the results , "" the paper quoted the information minister , Sikhanyiso Ndlovu , as saying .
"" It is not true that the president or government is holding the Zimbabwe election results . """
2008-04-17,"The Zimbabwean opposition leader today called on the South African president , Thabo Mbeki , to stand down as a mediator and make way for a new initiative .
Morgan Tsvangirai has been pressing Mbeki to drop his approach of "" quiet diplomacy "" and put pressure on Robert Mugabe to give up power following his apparent loss in the March 29 presidential elections .
South Africa today hardened its position towards Mugabe when its government spokesman called for the prompt release of the election results . ""
The most important thing is that the results need to be verified and released as soon as possible , "" Themba Maseko said .
This , however , was too little , too late for Tsvangirai , the leader of the Movement for Democratic Change ( MDC ) , who claims to have won the presidential vote .
He told reporters he had asked the Zambian president , Levy Mwanawasa - who is also the chairman of the Southern African Development Community ( SADC ) - to launch a new initiative . ""
President Mbeki needs to be relieved from his duty , "" Tsvangirai told a news conference in Johannesburg , adding that Mugabe had "" unleashed an orgy of violence against the people "" after the election .
Mbeki has resisted calling Zimbabwe 's the post - election deadlock a crisis , and the US today criticised Africa for its lack of action on Zimbabwe .
"" It is time for Africa to step up , "" the secretary of state , Condoleezza Rice , said .
"" Where is the concern from the African Union and from Zimbabwe 's neighbours about what is going on in Zimbabwe ? ""
Nevertheless , diplomats in Zimbabwe said they had been encouraged by tougher statements from South Africa and particularly from Jacob Zuma , the head of the ruling African National Congress party .
"" There is a feeling that South Africa 's policy , which has been glacial , is finally changing , slowly , slowly , "" a diplomat said .
Despite a tougher line from the South African government , Pretoria agreed to let a shipment of Chinese weapons go through its territory to Zimbabwe .
A Chinese ship , the An Yue Jiang , docked in Durban harbour after receiving approval from port authorities late yesterday .
The Beeld newspaper said the vessel was carrying nearly 3 m rounds of ammunition for small arms and AK-47 machine guns , about 3,500 mortars and mortar launchers and 1,500 rockets for grenade launchers .
South Africa said that as long as administrative papers were in order , it could not block shipments to its landlocked neighbour .
"" We are not in a position to act unilaterally to prevent a trade deal between two countries , "" a government spokesman said , adding that there was no trade embargo against Zimbabwe .
China is one of Zimbabwe 's main trade partners and allies .
The EU today called for the immediate publication of the election results . ""
Clearly , the publication of the results is needed , and it 's needed now , "" a spokesman said .
"" Further delays are unacceptable and would just be considered as stalling the democratic process . ""
Foreign ministers of the G8 group of eight industrialised countries , including the UK , made similar calls as they met in Tokyo .
They stressed that violence and intimidation must have no place in the process .
The Zimbabwean justice minister , Patrick Chinamasa , today accused Tsvangirai of treason .
"" It is clear from the correspondence that Tsvangirai … is seeking regime change in Zimbabwe , and on the part of Tsvangirai this is treasonous , "" Chinamasa , quoted in state - controlled media , said .
"" There is no doubting the consequences for acting in a treasonous manner . ""
Tsvangirai dismissed the claims as "" outrageous "" ."
2008-04-18,"Zimbabweans have been here before .
They vote , the opposition wins despite the pressures and threats to keep Zanu - PF in power , and Robert Mugabe brazenly fixes the figures to stay on and take his country to new depths of decline .
The three weeks since the election have seen the initiative swing back and forth between Zanu - PF and Morgan Tsvangirai 's Movement for Democratic Change .
The MDC caught Zanu - PF off balance by swiftly producing its tally of results and claiming victory .
Zimbabwe 's rulers were clearly shocked that Mugabe took only four in 10 votes and appeared to have lost parliament for the first time since independence 28 years ago .
They looked seriously vulnerable .
But Mugabe regained the initiative .
He sat on the presidential election results while giving himself a second chance by , in effect , calling a run - off ballot with Tsvangirai , even though official figures had not been released .
Zanu - PF then unleashed its tested tactic of beatings and murders to terrorise rural voters and curb the MDC 's ability to campaign in a second round .
Once again the opposition was left looking powerless and unable even to protect its own members from systematic violence .
The MDC called a general strike this week , the first test of its ability to mobilise popular protest since the election .
It was a flop .
That was no surprise .
The few people with jobs cling to them .
Before the election , the MDC had one eye on the Kenyan opposition 's mass mobilisation after vote - rigging there , but Zimbabweans are generally more fearful and passive .
The MDC leadership , to its credit , is also reluctant to risk people 's lives by calling them on to the streets .
Zimbabweans looked to their neighbours for support but were let down , particularly by South Africa 's president , Thabo Mbeki .
He said there was no crisis in Zimbabwe and played into Mugabe 's hands by calling the long delay in releasing the election results part of the normal electoral process .
Mbeki kept the lid on the 14-nation Southern African Development Community ( SADC ) at its summit last weekend ; some leaders were less indulgent of Zimbabwe 's president , but Mbeki pressed his own agenda aimed at easing Mugabe out with dignity but keeping Zanu - PF in power .
Tsvangirai also faced the dilemma of the run - off vote .
The MDC said he would refuse to participate on the grounds that he won the election outright .
But that became a difficult position to maintain , particularly when the MDC 's own count gives him only a fraction above the 50 % threshold needed to avoid a run - off .
To shy away from the second round risked making Tsvangirai appear afraid of a head - to - head contest with Mugabe .
But what point is there in his participating if it ends up legitimising another stolen election while supporters are bludgeoned into submission ?
Subsequently Tsvangirai regained the initiative to some extent by saying he is after all prepared to take Mugabe on in another vote as long as the process is open for the world to see .
Here the MDC leader has learned one of the lessons of Kenya 's political confrontation in seeking to draw support in the rest of the continent - and his regional tour of the past week may pay off .
Mbeki 's own African National Congress has broken with him over his handling of Mugabe , and that has laid the ground for others in the SADC to follow .
Tsvangirai felt emboldened enough after his meetings with the ANC 's new leader , Jacob Zuma , to call for Mbeki to step down as mediator in favour of Zambia 's president , Levy Mwanawasa , who wants Mugabe out .
If the ANC and other governments in the region have the courage to decry the charade and refuse to legitimise another rigged election , Mugabe may cling on but he will do so as a fatally weakened and unwanted despot .
chris.mcgreal@theguardian.com"
2008-04-18,"Robert Mugabe accused Britain of bribing his political opponents to recolonise Zimbabwe in an uncompromising and , at times , bitter speech to mark his country 's 28th anniversary of independence yesterday .
Mugabe 's long and vitriolic denunciations bore the hallmark of a campaign appeal as Zimbabweans await the results of recounts today in 23 constituencies , and a final declaration of the presidential election held three weeks ago .
The ruling Zanu - PF party has said it expects the result to lead to a run - off vote between Mugabe and Morgan Tsvangirai .
A Harare court yesterday rejected an attempt by Tsvangirai 's Movement for Democratic Change to block the recounts that it says will be used to fraudulently overturn the opposition 's newly won majority in parliament , which forced Zanu - PF into opposition for the first time since independence , and to inflate the presidential vote in favour of Mugabe .
The Zimbabwe president 's hour - long speech at a stadium in Highfield , a Harare township where his Zanu - PF party was founded but which is now solidly pro - opposition , began with extended denunciations of Britain in English and Shona .
"" We need to maintain utmost vigilance in the face of vicious British machinations and the machinations of other detractors who are allies of Britain , "" said Mugabe . ""
Yesterday they ruled by brute force .
Today they have perfected their tactics to be more subtle .
They are literally buying people to betray their government and accept to be politically manipulated in abandoning their rights .
We are being bought like sheep because they have money and because we are suffering . ""
Mugabe , whose election campaign characterised a vote for the MDC as surrendering the country to British control and the return of white farmers , kept up the theme yesterday .
"" Things will never ever change , never ever change to the extent that they can come back and reoccupy our farms , our land .
Zimbabwe will never be a colony again , "" he said .
"" Down with the British .
Down with thieves who want to steal our country .
"" Mugabe also touched on the deepening economic crisis which saw inflation surge to 165,000 % this week , but again he blamed Britain .
On Thursday , the state - run Herald newspaper published documents that purport to show various plots linking Tsvangirai to a range of hate figures from Gordon Brown to the Afrikaner neo - Nazi leader , Eugéne Terre'Blanche , as well as accusing the MDC of planning "" Rwanda - style massacres "" .
The justice minister , Patrick Chinamasa , called Tsvangirai a traitor and threatened to deal with him as such .
The opposition said the documents were fake .
The British embassy denied a Herald story claiming Gordon Brown had written to Tsvangirai promising to support him and to lobby the UN security council to impose sanctions against Zimbabwe 's government . ""
No such letter , or wider correspondence , exists .
It reflects the regime 's desperation that Zanu - PF and state - controlled media have resorted to faking documents for crude propaganda purposes , and not for the first time , "" said the embassy in a statement .
All but one of today 's recounts are in constituencies lost by Zanu - PF to the MDC .
If the results in just nine of the 23 constituencies are reversed , Mugabe 's party will regain its majority in parliament .
The state - run election commission says the recounts are necessary after the police arrested 11 commission officials for allegedly tampering with the results to diminish Mugabe 's proportion of the vote .
But the MDC says it suspects the recount is in part a rigging exercise and also a tactic to delay the final declaration of the presidential result while Zanu - PF unleashes a wave of violence and intimidation against the opposition in rural areas ahead of the expected run - off vote .
Yesterday , Mugabe accused the MDC of plotting violence .
"" We know some people are planning that there will be places where there will be violence , with people burning shops and cars , "" he said .
"" Those who are planning this , please stop it immediately otherwise you are going to be in serious trouble with us . ""
The MDC 's secretary - general , Tendai Biti , held talks with Kenya 's new prime minister , Raila Odinga , yesterday to seek advice on how he faced down President Mwai Kibaki 's attempts to steal the election earlier this year .
"" Kenya is special to us , it is not by accident that we came to the office of the prime minister , "" Biti said in Nairobi .
But the MDC has sought to avoid the kind of violence that claimed at least 1,500 lives in Kenya , many of them ethnic killings , and displaced hundreds of thousands of people ."
2008-04-22,"The president of South Africa 's ruling party , Jacob Zuma , today described the delay in the announcement of Zimbabwe 's election result as unacceptable , his strongest comments to date on the crisis .
The intervention by Zuma , who is due to meet Gordon Brown in London tomorrow , came as the Zimbabwean opposition leader , Morgan Tsvangirai , called on all African leaders to acknowledge that he won last month 's disputed presidential vote .
Tsvangirai adopted a conciliatory tone towards President Robert Mugabe , describing him as a "" liberation hero "" and indicating that he would be allowed to make an "" honourable exit "" .
Zuma , who heads the African National Congress , told Reuters that Africa should send a mission to Zimbabwe to end the delay in publishing results from the March 29 election . ""
It 's not acceptable , "" he said .
"" I do n't think the constitution says : ' If you like , you can hold the results ' , "" said Zuma . ""
The electoral commission must issue the results because it is actually destroying its own credibility as an institution that is supposed to be neutral . ""
His forthright comments will distance him further from the South African president , Thabo Mbeki , who has called for "" quiet diplomacy "" and been criticised for playing down the gravity of the crisis .
Zuma called on other African leaders to "" unlock this logjam "" . ""
Concretely this means African countries should identify some people to go in there , probably talk to both parties , call them and ask them what the problem is , as well as the electoral commission , "" he said .
Zuma toppled Mbeki as head of the ANC in December and he suggested that his political rival 's mediation efforts needed a boost . ""
When I say leaders should go [ to Zimbabwe ] , I 'm saying that we are fully aware that Mbeki is the mediator , "" Zuma said .
"" But ... what I 'm saying when I say other leaders should come , is that ... given the gravity of the situation , we should add other leaders to assist what Mbeki is doing in Zimbabwe . ""
The opposition Movement for Democratic Change ( MDC ) says Tsvangirai , won the presidential poll and the party 's candidates took a majority in the Zanu - PF - dominated parliament .
A partial recount of the parliamentary vote in 23 constituencies is being carried out , which the MDC has denounced as illegal .
Tsvangirai told a news conference in Accra , Ghana : "" Robert Mugabe is a liberation hero on our continent and he must be convinced to make a graceful exit ...
We believe the time has come for him to have an honourable exit . ""
"" We are calling ... on every head of state in Africa to stand in defence of the people of Zimbabwe , "" Tsvangirai told a news conference in Accra , Ghana . ""
Robert Mugabe is a liberation hero on our continent and he must be convinced to make a graceful exit .
In fact , we have no intention of violating his rights .
We believe the time has come for him to have an honourable exit . ""
Meanwhile , a shipment of arms headed for Zimbabwe may be recalled to China , Beijing 's foreign ministry said today .
The South African Transport and Allied Workers Union refused to handle the weapons because of concerns that Robert Mugabe 's government might use them against opponents in Zimbabwe 's post - election stalemate .
The freighter left South Africa after a judge on Friday barred the arms from passing through the country and Mozambique authorities stopped it from docking over the weekend .
Zambia 's president , Levy Mwanawasa , yesterday urged other countries in the region to bar the An Yue Jiang from entering their waters .
A Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman , Jiang Yu , defended the shipment as "" perfectly normal "" but said it may be heading back because of its failure to unload .
She said the contract for the cargo was signed last year and was "" unrelated to recent developments "" .
A spokesman for the International Transport Workers ' Federation ( ITF ) said it believed the ship was "" en route to Angola at reduced speed to conserve fuel "" and could take days to reach the capital , Luanda .
"" We just want the government to grant that they are not going to transit the arms , they 'll refuel with an understanding that the ship returns to China , "" he told theguardian.com .
Yesterday , the director of the Institute of Angolan ports told Luanda Radio : "" This ship has not sought a request to enter Angolan territorial waters and it 's not authorised to enter Angolan ports . ""
But the ITF spokesman said that because the ship was in "" real danger "" due to the lack of fuel , it should be allowed to dock without unloading its cargo .
US intelligence agencies are tracking the vessel and American diplomats have been instructed to press authorities in at least four nations — South Africa , Mozambique , Namibia and Angola — not to allow it to dock .
Two officials , speaking anonymously , said diplomatic efforts were now concentrated on Namibia and Angola , who were being told that allowing the An Yue Jiang to dock could harm their relations with the US .
The state department 's top Africa official , Jendayi Frazer , plans to visit the region this week to underline US concerns about the shipment and the failure to publish results from the March 29 presidential elections ."
2008-04-28,"Leaders of Zimbabwe 's rival opposition factions reunited yesterday to claim control of a parliamentary majority and demand that President Robert Mugabe step down .
Morgan Tsvangirai and Arthur Mutambara , leaders of rival factions of the Movement for Democratic Change ( MDC ) declared they had put aside their differences after election commission officials completed a partial recount of votes in the parliamentary election .
Although five seats were still outstanding last night , the confirmed results gave the MDC a majority and broke the grip of the ruling Zanu - PF party for the first time in Zimbabwe 's 28 years as an independent state .
The opposition leaders moved fast to consolidate their gains as Mugabe 's hold on power tangibly weakened .
"" We are here to ... say there will be no divisions among ourselves , "" Mutambara said at a joint press conference with Tsvangirai in South Africa .
"" We are all going to work together in case Robert Mugabe and Zanu - PF try to sabotage the will of the people .
We are in control of parliament .
We are also controlling the senate .
This is the state of affairs in our country . ""
The election commission said the long - delayed count in the March 29 presidential election had also been completed , and that the process of verification , in which official tallies would be compared with those of the rival parties , could begin today .
Independent observers believe Tsvangirai beat Mugabe but perhaps not by enough to avoid a runoff .
Tsvangirai , however , rejected the prospect of a second round . ""
The question about a runoff does n't arise , "" he said .
"" It does n't arise because of the simple fact that the people have spoken , the people have decided .
"" Addressing Mugabe directly , he said : "" Old man , go and have an honourable exit . ""
Tsvangirai said the MDC was also willling to work with Simba Makoni , the ex - finance minister and third presidential candidate , whom Mutambara 's faction backed in the election , as well as amenable Zanu - PF MPs .
Diplomats in Zimbabwe said Mugabe appeared to be playing for time and preparing for a second round in the presidential race with a campaign to intimidate MDC supporters in the countryside .
In an attempt to increase the pressure , the US state department 's chief Africa envoy , Jendayi Frazer , said the international community had a responsibility to intervene to prevent post - election human rights abuses .
"" When a government deploys its military and its police and its intelligence operatives , as well as mobilising youth militia then the international community has a responsibility to step in and to try to stop that government from beating its own population , "" Frazer told the Associated Press .
In a separate interview with the BBC , she said the US would back UN sanctions against Zimbabwe if the post - election crisis continued .
As Mugabe and Tsvangirai prepared to meet the electoral commission today to compare vote tallies in the presidential race , electoral officials said challenges from either side would lead to further delays in the declaration of final results .
The UN security council is due to discuss the post - election crisis in Zimbabwe today under pressure from both the US and Britain ."
2008-04-30,"Zimbabwe 's opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai won 47 % of the presidential election to Robert Mugabe 's 43 % , senior government sources told Reuters news agency tonight .
One of the sources told Reuters a run - off would be needed because Tsvangirai did not win enough votes – 50 % – for an outright victory .
Electoral commission officials said this week it had a final result in the election but it would not be released until both sides had approved it .
There was no immediate comment on the leaked result from the commission , which had invited candidates to start verifying the count from tomorrow .
Opposition officials were not immediately available for comment .
It was not thought the leak would be followed quickly by an official announcement .
Zimbabwe analyst Nana Ampofo of Global Insight told Guardian.co.uk that he would be surprised if Zimbabwe 's electoral commission would agree to such an early release of results .
"" It was only recently that they asked the party candidates to verify the results , "" he said .
A top official in Mugabe 's Zanu - PF party told Reuters : "" Those figures are in line with the official figures and the MDC knows that the official tally is more or less around that
but they have been inflating their numbers to claim a false victory .
"" A partial recount of the parliamentary election vote was completed over the weekend and showed Mugabe had failed to overturn any of the original results giving the opposition the majority of seats .
Tsvangirai 's Movement for Democratic Change has said he won the March 29 vote outright and accused Mugabe — in power for 28 years — of delaying results to rig victory .
Tsvangirai has said there is no need for a second round because he won outright but has also suggested he could take part if it were overseen by UN election observers .
If Tsvangirai refused to take part in a run - off , Mugabe would be declared the winner , according to election rules ."
2008-04-30,"Zimbabweans are bracing for a bloody second round of elections after government sources today said a recount of the presidential vote held a month ago shows that President Robert Mugabe lost to Morgan Tsvangirai but that neither won an outright majority .
Senior government sources told Reuters that Tsvangirai took 47 % of the vote to 43 % for Mugabe , a remarkable admission that the man who has ruled Zimbabwe for 28 years was beaten .
If those figures are confirmed by the state - run election commission , a run - off election is likely to be held before the end of May.
But the opposition Movement for Democratic Change ( MDC ) claims
Tsvangirai has won an outright majority , based on the returns posted at each polling station , and said it will not participate in a second round of voting .
Tsvangirai 's spokesman , George Sibotshiwe , accused the government of fixing the election results .
"" As a people we voted and expressed ourselves democratically through the ballot and somebody is now trying to subvert our will .
Mugabe now needs to concede defeat and step down , "" he said .
But Mugabe 's Zanu - PF party is far from conceding defeat , despite also losing control of parliament for the first time since independence in 1980 .
In the four weeks since the election , the ruling party has unleashed a campaign of violence and terror against opposition activists and supporters apparently aimed at discouraging support for the MDC in the run - off vote .
The opposition says at least 20 of its supporters have been murdered by a military - directed campaign with many hundreds more brutally beaten and thousands driven from their homes .
Tsvangirai has shifted position several times on the question of a second round .
At first he insisted that what he claimed was an outright win with 50.3 % of the vote should be recognised .
Then he said he would be prepared to contest a run - off provided the government allows extensive international monitoring of the vote and count , including permitting the presence of organisations such as the United Nations , which was barred from the last election on the grounds it is under the control of imperialist powers .
However , Tsvangirai hardened his stance as the violence escalated against his supporters and again said he would not participate in another vote .
But that position may be hard to maintain given that Tsvangirai won just a fraction above the 50 % threshold and risks appearing as if he is shying away from a one on one contest against Mugabe .
The MDC also risks allowing Zimbabwe 's president to claim victory by default .
Nonetheless , Mugabe will face an uphill struggle to win a second round .
A third candidate , Simba Makoni , a former finance minister who broke with the president and was expelled from Zanu - PF , took nearly 10 % of the vote , according to the government 's figures .
A high proportion of Makoni 's supporters are likely to go to Tsvangirai , particular the significant numbers of people who voted for Makoni in Matabeleland , where there has been deep hostility to Mugabe since the army 's massacres in the province of dissidents and their families in the 1980s .
For now , Zanu - PF appears to be relying on its tested tactic of violence and intimidation to swing the vote back in its favour .
Last month 's ballot was peaceful compared to other recent elections in which the opposition was prevented from campaigning in many rural areas through the killing and beatings of its activists .
The ruling party appears to have drawn the lesson that the lack of intimidation swung the vote against Mugabe and it is now pursuing a highly organised strategy of identifying villages and towns that went over to the opposition and is targeting them with violence .
Human Rights Watch ( HRW ) has accused the army of directing the attacks , and of providing weapons and transport to Zanu - PF militia .
"" The army and its allies - ' war - veterans ' and supporters of the ruling party Zanu - PF - are intensifying their brutal grip on wide swathes of rural Zimbabwe to ensure that a possible second round of presidential elections goes their way , "" said Georgette Gagnon , the group 's Africa director .
HRW also said it has identified two cases of "" revenge attacks "" by MDC activists .
But despite the considerable evidence of a state - run campaign against opposition supporters , Zimbabwe 's police chief , Augustine Chihuri , today blamed the MDC for the violence . ""
The old trick of claiming human rights violations when somebody steps on your toe , yet you yourself are poking out other people 's eyes , will not work this time around , "" he said .
Before the election , Chihuri said he would not allow "" puppets "" to take power .
Mugabe has repeatedly described Tsvangirai as a puppet of British imperialism ."

2008-05-02,"Zimbabwe 's election commission yesterday confirmed that President Robert Mugabe lost the election held five weeks ago but that his opponent , Morgan Tsvangirai , fell below the 50 % of the vote required to avoid a run - off ballot between the two later this month .
The commission 's figures , giving Tsvangirai 47.9 % to 43.2 % for Zimbabwe 's leader since independence in 1980 , are close to the numbers leaked by the ruling Zanu - PF earlier in the week .
However , the formal declaration of the results is still some days away as the count has to be approved by the contenders .
Tsvangirai says that his Movement for Democratic Change 's own tally gave him 50.3 % , enough for an outright win , and that he will not participate in a second round of elections .
Officials from Zanu - PF said yesterday Mugabe would run in the second round of presidential election .
Tendai Biti , the MDC secretary general , yesterday told the Guardian that the party would not shift from that position even if it allows Mugabe to declare himself president again by default . ""
If he thinks he can be president when he lost , or by having a run - off election all on his own , who will give him legitimacy ?
They think we will play ball but they are wrong .
Sooner rather than later we will form a government , "" said Biti in Johannesburg .
The government is threatening to jail Biti if he returns to Zimbabwe for allegedly inciting violence and "" illegally "" publishing election results in a move apparently intended to further undermine the opposition if there is a second round of voting .
The state - run Herald newspaper said Zimbabwe 's police chief , General Augustine Chihuri , who recently said he would never allow the opposition to come to power , has written to Biti accusing him of contravening election laws by announcing the MDC 's own tally of station returns and declaring Tsvangirai the winner .
"" You know for sure , your violation of the country 's laws by declaring presidential results ... is still to be attended to by the police , "" Chihuri said in the letter to Biti .
The police chief also accused the MDC secretary general of responsibility for violence sweeping rural areas , even though the victims and human rights groups say it is orchestrated by the state against opposition supporters , that has seen hundreds seriously injured and about 20 killed .
Biti said he has not received the letter but that there is no such crime as releasing the election results , particularly when all he was publicising were the counts posted at each polling station available to anyone .
The accusations appear to be aimed at further deterring Biti and other opposition leaders from returning home .
"" I really want to go back but the problem is I have no illusion about the capacity of those people to do evil , "" said Biti .
Tsvangirai has also remained abroad for the past month , in part to lobby governments in the region but also because of fears over his safety .
The European commission called yesterday for Zimbabwe to allow international monitors in the event of a presidential run - off , insisting that the second round must be "" free and fair and run in the correct way "" ."
2008-05-02,"Officials from Zimbabwe 's ruling Zanu - PF party today said the president , Robert Mugabe , would run in the second round of the country 's presidential election .
The news came after Zimbabwe 's electoral commission finally confirmed the results of the poll , which was held five weeks ago .
Commission officials said Mugabe lost the election but that his opponent , Morgan Tsvangirai , had gained less than the 50 % of the vote required to avoid a run - off ballot .
The figures - giving Tsvangirai 47.9 % to 43.2 % for Mugabe , Zimbabwe 's leader since independence in 1980 – were close to those leaked by Zanu - PF earlier in the week .

The British foreign secretary , David Miliband , said Mugabe had ' clearly lost ' the election .
Miliband urged him to call an immediate halt to the campaign of violence and intimidation which the MDC said had been unleashed against its supporters following the poll five weeks ago .
He said any second round of voting must be ' free , fair and open to international monitors "" .
Zimbabwe 's government is threatening to jail Biti if he returns to Zimbabwe , alleging that he has incited violence and "" illegally "" published election results .
The threat appeared to be designed to further undermine the opposition in the event of a second round of voting .
The state - run Herald newspaper said Zimbabwe 's police chief , General Augustine Chihuri - who recently said he would never allow the opposition to come to power - had written to Biti , accusing him of contravening election laws by announcing the MDC 's own collation of polling station returns and declaring Tsvangirai the winner .
"" You know for sure your violation of the country 's laws by declaring presidential results ... is still to be attended to by the police , "" he wrote in the letter .
The police chief also accused the MDC secretary general of being responsible for the violence sweeping rural areas .
Hundreds of people have been seriously injured and around 20 killed .
The accusation came despite victims and human rights groups saying it had been orchestrated by the state against opposition supporters .
"" What is very conspicuous in the Zimbabwean political arena today is your prominent role in urging and abetting political violence through unbridled rhetoric of incitement , "" Chihuri wrote .
Biti said he had not received the letter , but that there is no such crime as releasing election results - particularly when he was merely publicising the counts posted at each polling station for anyone to read .
The accusations appear to be aimed at further deterring Biti and other opposition leaders from returning home .

Tsvangirai has also remained abroad for the past month , in part to lobby governments in the region but also because of fears for his safety ."
2008-05-03,"After a day of top level meetings , Zimbabwe 's main opposition party yesterday failed to make a decision on whether it will take part in presidential run - off elections scheduled for next month .
Observers now fear that there is a fierce dispute within the Movement for Democratic Change - whose leader Morgan Tsvangirai is staying out of the country for his safety - over whether to boycott the second round of voting that was announced on Friday by Zimbabwe 's Electoral Commission .
Tsvangirai claimed an outright majority after the polls and the MDC says the results released this weekend were doctored .
Election officials announced on Friday that Tsvangirai had beaten Mugabe in the 29 March presidential poll but failed to win the absolute majority necessary to avoid a second ballot .
The MDC has accused the officials of rigging the results , which showed Tsvangirai won 47.9 per cent of the vote to Mugabe 's 43.2 per cent - falling short of the 50 per cent needed to avoid a runoff .
The party says Tsvangirai won the election outright with 50.3 per cent of the vote and that Mugabe 's rule is over .
But the MDC has not signalled how it will handle the run - off .
Many believe that participating would legitimise Mugabe 's rigging and worsen a volatile situation in the country where 20 of its supporters have been killed , thousands displaced and hundreds are in hiding from marauding ruling party militias .
Yesterday a senior member of the smaller faction of Zimbabwe 's opposition warned Tsvangirai against a boycott , saying it would effectively hand the presidency with some legitimacy to Mugabe .
David Coltart , whose party led by Arthur Mutambara announced last week that it would back Tsvangirai if he took part in the run - off , said that the veteran opposition leader had no option but to contest the run - off . '
My advice is that he should participate in the run - off under protest , ' said Coltart , who is also the MDC secretary for legal affairs .
He said that , despite evidence that Zanu - PF was preparing for a violent fightback , the odds were still stacked against Mugabe winning because of the bad economic situation .
The election stand - off has been accompanied by a wave of political violence in rural areas that human rights groups and aid agencies say has killed several people and forced hundreds to flee their homes .
Rights groups and the MDC say the violence is aimed at people who voted for the opposition and is designed to intimidate them into voting for Mugabe in a second round . '
I have information from credible sources , a group of doctors , which says 600 people have been hospitalised throughout the country because of the ongoing violence , ' said Coltart .
There are also signs of widening divisions within the ruling Zanu - PF .
Simba Makoni , a former finance minister in Mugabe 's cabinet , stood against him in the 29 March vote and is thought to be garnering support within his old party for a possible government of national unity , a plan ruled out by Tsvangirai .
Mugabe 's waning popularity among the rank and file in his party could work against the 84-year - old leader 's electoral chances , as will the pressing need for action to tackle the inflation rate - now estimated at 200,000 per cent - unemployment , the health crisis and food and energy shortages within Zimbabwe .
Both the police and the civil service are becoming increasingly disaffected ."
2008-05-04,"Zimbabwe 's ruling party has said that a second round of presidential elections could be delayed by up to a year in a move that would extend Robert Mugabe 's rule even though he admits to having lost the first round of voting five weeks ago .
The election commission is expected to meet soon to set a date for the run - off vote between Mugabe and the opposition candidate , Morgan Tsvangirai .
The law required it to have been held within three weeks of the original election , but the commission has the power to extend the period between the votes .
The deputy information minister , Bright Matonga , said at the weekend that the run - off might take place in three weeks , but could take up to a year , suggesting that Zanu - PF remains concerned at Mugabe 's ability to win , despite a state - sponsored campaign of violence and intimidation against the opposition .
Mugabe won only four out of 10 votes in the first round , according to the election commission , leaving him with a considerable task to win the run - off .
The election commission gave him 43.2 % of the vote to 47.9 % for Tsvangirai of the Movement for Democratic Change .
While it is not clear whether Matonga was speaking with Mugabe 's authority in suggesting a long delay , political analysts in Zimbabwe say Zanu - PF is not in any hurry for another election .
The opposition also fears that spreading political violence will provide a pretext for Zanu - PF to drag out the election further on the grounds that there is too much instability to hold another vote , even though the ruling party is principally responsible for creating the upheaval .
Thousands of people have been beaten , thousands more driven from their homes and about 20 murdered , according to the opposition , in an army - led campaign of violence focused on rural areas where the opposition performed well .
Yesterday , Zimbabwe 's teachers union threatened a national strike unless the government stops attacks on teachers who acted as election officials .
The union said 1,700 teachers had fled their homes and hundreds more had been arrested to deter them from overseeing the next election because they were neutral .
Meanwhile , the MDC is wavering over its previous refusal to take part in a second round after calling the results "" scandalous daylight robbery "" .
It said Tsvangirai won the presidential election outright with 50.3 % , based on returns from each polling station .
It accused the government of altering the results by 87,000 votes in favour of Mugabe to force Tsvangirai below the 50 % mark to avoid a run - off .
However Tsvangirai risks looking as if he is unwilling to compete if he shies away from a run - off , and could hand victory to his rival by default .
The US and other western governments have warned that state - sponsored violence against activists and voters since the first round of elections has made a democratic run - off impossible .
They have been joined by groups such as Human Rights Watch , whose Africa director , Georgette Gagnon said : "" The ruling party 's bloody crackdown makes a free run - off vote a tragic joke . ""
The Roman Catholic church in Zimbabwe yesterday called on the UN and African Union to supervise the next ballot .
In a statement read to Sunday services , it said the state election commission could not be trusted to be neutral , because it took five weeks to release the results of the first round .
With the economy in tatters , there is also the question of cost .
The former finance minister , Simba Makoni , who ran a poor third in the presidential race , said Zimbabwe could not afford another election and a power - sharing deal had to be negotiated ."
2008-05-10,"The leader of Zimbabwe 's main opposition party announced today that he would return to the country within two days to prepare for an election run - off in which he hopes to unseat President Robert Mugabe .
Morgan Tsvangirai , the leader of the Movement for Democratic Change ( MDC ) , left Zimbabwe shortly after disputed elections were held on March 29 when official results showed he had beaten Mugabe in the presidential poll – but not by enough votes to secure an absolute majority and avoid a run - off .
He and his supporters were subsequently subjected to a campaign of violent intimidation .
Tsvangirai had previously said that he won the first round outright and that official figures showing the need for a second round were fraudulent .
Today 's announcement is the first time he has committed to participating in a run - off .
Speaking at a news conference in South Africa this morning , Tsvangirai said : "" I shall return to Zimbabwe within the next two days , "" but reiterated his position that he would only participate in the run - off if international observers and the media had full access to ensure the poll was free and fair .
The opposition have accused Mugabe and his ruling Zanu - PF party of trying to intimidate voters and rig the ballot . ""
The MDC ... will contest the run - off .
I am ready , and the people are ready for the final round .
"" We want unfettered access of all international observers , "" he said , listing the conditions for his participation . ""
Media access should be unfettered , both print and international media . ""
But Zimbabwe 's justice minister , Patrick Chinamasa , slapped down Tsvangirai 's conditions .
"" The run - off will be held within the framework of the constitution and the electoral laws .
There will be no conditionalities that will be outside this framework , "" he told Reuters .
Opposition officials and independent human rights activists have questioned whether a second round can be free and fair with the opposition unable to campaign freely because of attacks and threats .
Tapiwa Mudiwa , a 26-year - old MDC supporter said : "" How are we going to campaign in the run - off as MDC supporters ?
We ca n't wear MDC T - shirts .
We fear we ca n't even go for rallies .
Cars are being burned . ""
Tsvangirai acknowledged the risks today , but said his consultations with a wide range of Zimbweans had convinced him they wanted him to run .
"" They believe that we as a nation are brave enough , we are strong enough and we are angry enough to fight an election once again , "" he said .
"" A run - off election could finally knock out the dictator for good . ""
No date has been set for the vote , but Tsvangirai said it should be held within 21 days of the May 2 announcement of presidential results .
Zimbabwean government officials have said the electoral commission has up to a year to hold the vote .
In a parallel parliamentary vote , Zanu - PF lost its majority to the opposition for the first time since independence in 1980 .
The party has already launched its presidential run - off campaign ."
2008-05-10,"Amid escalating political violence in Zimbabwe , opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai finally announced yesterday that he would stand against Robert Mugabe in a presidential run - off and that he would return from his self - imposed exile in neighbouring South Africa within days .
The long - awaited response from the leader of the Movement for Democratic Change ended what had been a tense stand - off and allayed fears of many that he would boycott the vote , leaving the way clear for the despotic Mugabe to declare himself the legitimate winner .
The government - backed official results from the poll on 29 March put Tsvangirai ahead of the President , but not with a sufficient margin to avoid a second round .
But the MDC believes it was cheated of thousands of votes in poll - rigging by the ruling Zanu - PF , and the more likely result is that Tsvangirai won 53 per cent , giving him an outright majority .
Tsvangirai had expressed doubts over whether he would take part in a run - off he sees as illegal and was pushing for conditions , notably allowing international observers to monitor the new election .
But it seems unlikely that Mugabe has budged .
Tsvangirai has been out of the country since just after the vote , visiting other African leaders and trying to drum up support for further pressure to be applied on Mugabe .
On Friday he attacked the South African President , Thabo Mbeki , appointed as a mediator on behalf of the Southern African Development Community , declaring he ' has no confidence in Mbeki ' and has called for him to step aside and allow Zambian President Levy Mwanawasa to take over the diplomatic efforts .
Mwanawasa has been more critical of Mugabe , while Mbeki has stuck to so - called ' quiet diplomacy ' .
On Friday the South African leader was greeted with a warm embrace by Mugabe as he arrived at Harare airport for his third visit as mediator and the two men laughed as they walked hand - in - hand from the plane .
They then held talks for four hours before Mbeki went home .
The next step will be for the Zimbabwe Electoral Commission to set a date for the run - off , which by law should be held within 21 days of the result , finally published on 2 May , although the commission has the power to extend it .
The MDC says any further delays in resolving this drawn - out contest will only give the authorities and their militias time to rig the vote and orchestrate and carry out even more attacks on its supporters .
Several white farmers have been viciously beaten and at least two have had to flee their lands and go into hiding .
High - profile Zanu - PF opponents have been rounded up and MDC activists have described beatings by government - backed militias .
The Zimbabwe Association of Doctors for Human Rights said 22 people had died and 900 have been tortured in the past four weeks .
But ' violence is now on such a scale that it is impossible to properly document all cases ' , the association said in a statement this weekend .
On Friday alone Harare hospitals and clinics treated 30 people for broken limbs , it said .
Those admitted to hospitals with injuries included elderly men , breast - feeding women and a three - year - old boy . '
The level of brutality and callousness exhibited by the perpetrators is unprecedented , ' said the doctors .
They also raised concerns about the intimidation of health workers and a shortage of medical supplies .
Witnesses inside the country have detailed many occasions of individuals being targeted and attacked , of homes razed and bodies dumped in fields .
Meanwhile , the Herald newspaper , the virulent state mouthpiece , accused MDC supporters of burning houses while quoting the deputy director of army public relations , Major Alois Makotore , claiming no soldiers had been involved in harassment or assaults on civilians .
Government and party officials have denied they were responsible for the violence and blamed the opposition .
On Friday the US ambassador to Zimbabwe , James McGee , along with envoys from Angola , Britain , Spain and Sweden , visited victims of political violence in Harare hospital , listening to their accounts and later expressing outrage at the brutality . '
The violence in Zimbabwe has to stop , ' McGee said after touring wards of the Avenues Clinic where about 20 victims of political violence were being treated .
The MDC says more than 30 of its supporters have been killed in the attacks .
Human Rights Watch and other groups say the violence is state - sponsored and has involved the Zimbabwean military both directly and through provision of arms and transport , notably in the attacks on the farmers and their workers .
The abandonment of several farms will only add to the woes of Zimbabwe , where food prices and shortages are increasing daily ."
2008-05-11,"The Zimbabwean opposition leader , Morgan Tsvangirai , is expected to return to Harare today to contest a runoff election against President Robert Mugabe amid mounting criticism of his decision to flee the beleaguered country while thousands of his supporters were being attacked and some killed .
Tsvangirai has chosen to contend the second round of elections after previously saying he would not run again because he won the first vote outright .
The Movement for Democratic Change leader said Zimbabweans would feel betrayed if he did not run and allowed Mugabe to become president again by default .
"" I shall return to Zimbabwe to begin a victory tour .
Some might say this term ' victory ' is cold and callous , given the hardships endured by the people .
But the people are victorious and they are being punished for their victory , "" he said in Johannesburg , where he has spent much of the past six weeks .
"" We must free ourselves from those who would steal victory from fellow brothers and sisters by using guns , sticks and screwdrivers , "" Tsvangirai made a number of demands that are unlikely to be met , including that the ballot be held within the next fortnight .
The government has said it could take months .
The MDC leader has switched his position several times on the issue of a second round , after claiming victory against Mugabe in the March 29 vote with 50.3 % of the vote .
The state - run election commission declared Tsvangirai the winner with about 48 % of the vote , to 43 % for Mugabe , making a runoff necessary as neither won an outright majority .
Tsvangirai said his party had a difficult decision to make over whether to participate , given what it says was the rigging of the first round and the continuing violence against opposition supporters .
He said the MDC feared he could lose because the ruling Zanu - PF 's attacks on his supporters - which have left more than 30 dead and thousands injured - would prevent large numbers of people from voting and discourage many others .
The MDC appears to have finally decided that it could not walk away from the contest , not least because it would make it appear Tsvangirai was shying away from a one - on - one battle with Mugabe . ""
A runoff election could be the knockout round in a fight to liberate ourselves from our former liberator , "" Tsvangirai said .
His absence has come under criticism from some of his supporters .
The Zimbabwe Independent , a fierce critic of Mugabe , joined the call for Tsvangirai to return . ""
He is needed here .
His supporters are taking a beating from the thugs who have been unleashed across the country , "" the newspaper said .
"" It is time for him to identify with their suffering and give a lead to his followers .
He has been the victim of poor advice on staying outside the country .
This is our next president . """
2008-05-12,"Morgan Tsvangirai was right to decide to return to Zimbabwe to contest the second round runoff .
His departure , over a month ago , to lobby the governments of southern Africa was initially a shrewd move , and did much to undermine Thabo Mbeki 's attempts to shield his embattled friend Robert Mugabe .
But staying away from his homeland , when his supporters were being killed , tortured and chased out of their homes , was a different matter .
Had Mr Tsvangirai spent the time instead visiting the war veterans ' victims in their hospital beds , he would have been able to keep the region 's focus on what is happening in Zimbabwe .
The leader of the Movement for Democratic Change is not going back on his own terms .
He has failed to achieve a halt to the violence , a new Zimbabwe Electoral Commission ( ZEC ) , unfettered access for international observers or a peacekeeping force manned by the Southern Africa Development Community ( SADC ) .
Indeed the justice minister Patrick Chinamasa said yesterday that his country would not allow in election monitors from western countries or the UN until sanctions were lifted .
However , Mr Tsvangirai 's principal handicap is that he has not yet got an assurance about the timing of the run - off .
Since he lost control of parliament , Mr Mugabe and the rump of Zanu - PF have been playing for time .
The delay allowed them to chase 40,000 farm workers from their homes , kill at least 22 people and torture 900 others , according to the Zimbabwe Association of Doctors for Human Rights .
MDC stalwarts , like the senator and human rights activist David Coltart , say that the violence will not work .
Even the massacres of 20,000 people carried out by a North Korean trained army unit in 1985 failed to deter Matabeleland from voting for the opposition , he said .
Perhaps it is for this reason that Zanu - PF is still prevaricating .
Mr Mugabe can not be sure that he has yet bludgeoned enough of the opposition into submission .
The ZEC has yet to set a date for the second round and Zanu - PF has said it could be delayed for up to a year .
The SADC must insist that the run - off happens within weeks , not months .
The MDC leader is returning with some advantages .
Mr Mugabe no longer has a majority in parliament and if he goes back to ruling by decree , his orders can be annulled .
In fact , the opposition is only 30 votes away from the numbers needed for impeachment .
Another major task for Mr Mugabe is to find more than 200,000 votes , if he is to overturn the results of the first round .
There is , still , all to play for if the run - off is held promptly .
It is up to Zimbabwe 's neighbours to ensure that it is .
Otherwise , they too will have blood on their hands ."
2008-05-15,"Zimbabwean authorities have said the election run - off between the president , Robert Mugabe , and the opposition leader , Morgan Tsvangirai , will be held by July 31 , state media reported today .
The state - run Herald newspaper reported that an official government notice yesterday announced an extension to the deadline for holding the run - off .
The notice said the justice minister , Patrick Chinamasa , was empowered under election laws to extend the original 21-day period to 90 days from when the results of the first vote were released on May 2 .
Tsvangirai claims he won the presidential race outright , but official results released weeks after the March 29 poll showed he did not win enough support to avoid a second round of voting against Mugabe .
The opposition has protested against any extension to the run - off deadline , calling it a violation of election laws .
It has accused Mugabe 's party of using delays to mount a campaign of violence and intimidation against opposition supporters .
A South African government spokesman , Themba Maseko , said his country , which is mediating between Zimbabwe 's government and the opposition , would have preferred the run - off to have been held within the originally stipulated period . ""
But if the parties agree that it is in the interests of long - term stability to have a run - off at a different date ... we think that the decision of the Zimbabweans must be respected , "" he said at a media briefing in Cape Town ."
2008-05-16,"The Zimbabwean opposition leader , Morgan Tsvangirai , today predicted he would win the long - delayed election run - off with President Robert Mugabe , provided it is a fair contest .
Tsvangirai 's prediction came as Zimbabwe 's electoral commission finally set a date for the run - off vote .
A terse statement in the government gazette said : "" It is hereby notified that the Zimbabwe electoral commission with the approval of the minister of justice made the following notice : a poll shall be taken on Friday , June 27 , 2008 , for the purpose of electing a person to the office of president . ""
Tsvangirai attended an international conference in Belfast today where he demanded an end to the violence that has plagued his country since the first poll at the end of March .
The Movement for Democratic Change ( MDC ) leader said he hoped to win a decisive victory by uniting other groups with his party .
He said : "" We are actually going to broaden the coalition beyond just the MDC , and I am confident that even some members of Zanu - PF [ the ruling party ] would rather work for the MDC than work for Mugabe - who is 84 years , by the way . ""
Tsvangirai , who has been abroad since shortly after the March election trying to garner support , said he planned to return home later today .
He insisted he did not fear assassination and called for the 15-nation Southern African Development Community to send observers to ensure Mugabe 's forces did not intimidate voters . ""
Violence has to cease for an election to be conducted , otherwise that election will not be legitimate , "" he said .
"" My own party , the Movement for Democratic Change , is a government - in - waiting that is not prepared to wait any longer . ""
Mugabe told a Zanu - PF party conference today he would not be beaten by an opposition he said was backed by "" a hostile axis of powerful foreign governments "" and western imperialists .
Tsvangirai had previously expressed doubts over whether he would participate in a run - off that he saw as illegal , and was pushing for conditions , notably the presence of international observers to monitor the new election .
He subsequently decided to contest the ballot to prevent Mugabe from simply declaring himself the winner .
The MDC had called for the second poll to be held on May 23 in accordance with electoral law , and described the delay as "" irresponsible "" .
The electoral commission this week extended the deadline for the run - off to 90 days from the official announcement of the first results , saying more time was needed for logistical reasons .
A spokesman told the pro - Mugabe Herald newspaper : "" Some of the resources were depleted during the first election , so we need more time to prepare for the run - off . ""
The delay will raise fears the government is preparing to rig the election and carry out more attacks on Tsvangirai supporters .
The Zimbabwe Association of Doctors for Human Rights said 22 people had died and 900 had been tortured in the past month .
The government and officials of the ruling Zanu - PF party have denied responsibility for the violence and have blamed the opposition .
The government - backed official results from the original poll on March 29 put Tsvangirai ahead of Mugabe , but not by a big enough margin to avoid a second round of voting .
The MDC has said it believes it was cheated of thousands of votes through poll - rigging and claimed Tsvangirai won 50.3 % of the ballot , giving him a slender outright majority .
Tsvangirai 's party won control of parliament in legislative elections held alongside the presidential vote - the first time since independence 28 years ago that Mugabe 's party lost control of parliament ."
2008-05-16,"Robert Mugabe and his Zanu - PF party are continuing to punish rural Zimbabweans for their "" disloyalty "" in the March 2008 elections , through a military - led campaign of systematic violence .
This is in preparation for the looming do - or - die presidential election runoff between Mugabe and the MDC opposition leader , Morgan Tsvangirai .
The violent campaign is codenamed Operation Mavoterapapi , a Shona word meaning "" Where did you place your vote ? "" .
Zanu - PF 's strategy is to decimate the MDC 's rural party structures , to break its rural support through trauma , intimidation and displacement , and to bring the countryside under paramilitary control .
The instruments of violence are fists , sticks , boots , stones , bicycle chains and metal poles - tools of the "" soft "" violence that does not risk external intervention .
If you turn on the television news , flip the pages of international and independent Zimbabwean newspapers , or access the plethora of websites belonging to Zimbabwean and global human rights groups , you can not escape the director 's cut of Zanu - PF 's violence .
That is , images of rural Zimbabweans ' terribly beaten and bruised bare buttocks , thighs , torsos , feet etc .
We are watching fetish pornography every other day , courtesy of Mugabe and Zanu - PF .
The digital images of beaten Zimbabweans tell a compelling narrative : a narrative about human dignity lost , a narrative about a cry for the restoration of human rights in Zimbabwe , a narrative that relies on the revolution in communications that took off at about the same time the human rights movement received a major fillip from communism 's demise .
In the 1990s , the human rights movement could name and shame human rights abusers in ways previously unimagined .
Genocide could be broadcast in real time , live on CNN and the internet .
In Kantian and human rights idealist terms , a human rights violation anywhere was now felt everywhere .
However , the human rights revolution of the 1990s is distant .
It is like a black hole in the memory .
It has suffered serious reversals in fortune , not least because of September 11 , which rolled back many human rights gains by subordinating human rights to reasserted state power and by ushering in a "" war on terror "" that became a veneer - and not just for America - for the justification of human rights violations .
Torture is in ; human dignity is out .
Indeed , the "" human rights revolution "" may have been a hollow one to begin with .
For while it unfolded , genocides in Rwanda and Yugoslavia were also unfolding , with little or no concerted international effort to halt them .
Even the tried and tested tactic of naming and shaming is tired .
Naming and shaming is no longer a potent means to express dispraise of human rights violators .
A bad human rights reputation does not make abusers respect human rights , as the behaviour of Mugabe 's government proves , time and again .
In addition , the sympathy and moral outrage of non - victims dissipates rapidly or is easily fatigued .
Human rights - abusing governments have also worked out how to commit abuses under the glare of international attention and still get away with it .
Moreover , what if the human rights abusers being "" shamed "" do not understand what the word "" shame "" means ?
Mugabe and Zanu - PF certainly do not understand the meaning of the word , which is why they can look their human rights critics straight in the eyes and tell them to "" go hang "" , as Mugabe infamously did in March 2007 after Tsvangirai was savagely beaten by the police for staging a public meeting .
And what is "" international respectability "" , when from America to Britain , to China , to Burma , to Sudan and to Zimbabwe , there is no decent standard of human rights respectability left because of Guantánamo Bay , the Iraq invasion and post - invasion crisis , human rights double standards , state - sanctioned killings and internal repression ?
We have very bad international instruments for dealing with human rights - violating governments .
But is the dissemination of more of Mugabe 's fetish porn , in the name of naming and shaming , all that human rights groups can do ?
And are non - victims resigned to watching numbing doses of Mugabe 's porn ?
We need to move beyond naming and shaming as a strategy for confronting human rights - abusing governments .
Information deficiency is not the problem .
The failure to adhere to one human rights standard for all and an unwillingness to genuinely integrate mainstream human rights into our foreign policies are part of the problem .
We have also lacked ingenuity in dealing with the Mugabe government 's human rights abuses .
For close to a decade , we have isolated his government , attacked its excesses confrontationally , and we have applied targeted sanctions religiously .
Mugabe has only become more belligerent and his human rights abuses have worsened .
It is a bitter pill to swallow for many in the human rights movement and in Whitehall , but engagement , not confrontation , with Mugabe may be the way out ."
2008-05-17,"Zimbabwe 's opposition leader , Morgan Tsvangirai , has delayed his return home after an assassination plot against him was uncovered , one of his spokesmen said today .
"" We have received information from a credible source concerning a planned assassination attempt against President Tsvangirai , "" George Sibotshiwe told Reuters .
He said Tsvangirai had postponed his return indefinitely while party officials consulted their security experts and regional leaders .
Tsvangirai , who attended a conference in Belfast yesterday , had been due to return to Zimbabwe today after announcing that he would contest the long - delayed run - off presidential election , now set for June 27 .
The Movement for Democratic Change leader has reluctantly decided that he must take part in the run - off , otherwise the president , Robert Mugabe , would win unchallenged .
Tsvangirai , who has been out of Zimbabwe for more than a month trying to garner international support , was to return this weekend to start campaigning .
He has said , however , that "" violence has to cease for an election to be conducted or that election will not be legitimate "" .
Mugabe told a party meeting yesterday that the first - round result had been "" disastrous "" after he trailed behind Tsvangirai , who failed to win an outright majority .
The president said he was not prepared to lose power to an opposition he said was backed by "" a hostile axis of powerful foreign governments "" , according to Reuters .
Since the election , Mugabe 's ruling Zanu - PF party has unleashed a wave of attacks against Tsvangirai supporters that appear to have the twin aims of deterring opposition activists from campaigning and driving opposition supporters from their homes so they can not vote .
Tens of thousands of people are believed to have been displaced , with thousands more beaten or arrested and more than 30 killed , according to the opposition .
Amnesty International yesterday described the violence as "" reaching crisis levels "" .
The run - off was called after the election commission declared that Tsvangirai won nearly 48 % of the vote in the first round , compared to just over 43 % for Mugabe .

2008-05-17,"Zimbabwe has called a much delayed runoff presidential election for June 27 amid escalating violence against Robert Mugabe 's opponents that human rights groups say makes a fair vote almost impossible .
Mugabe told a party meeting yesterday that the first - round result had been "" disastrous "" after he lost to Morgan Tsvangirai but without his opponent winning an outright majority .
The president added that he was not prepared to lose power to an opposition he said was backed by "" a hostile axis of powerful foreign governments "" , according to Reuters .

2008-05-19,"Zimbabwe 's opposition party today gave more details of an alleged plot by the country 's military to assassinate its presidential candidate , Morgan Tsvangirai .
The Movement for Democratic Change ( MDC ) announced on Saturday that Tsvangirai had delayed his return home after a creditable tip - off about the murder plot .
Today , the MDC alleged the military was planning to kill Tsvangirai using snipers .
"" We know there are 18 snipers , and the military intelligence directorate is in charge of this , "" the party 's secretary general , Tendai Biti , told Reuters .
He said he could not divulge further detail as it would endanger the lives of those that leaked the information .
Biti claimed the campaign of violence by President Robert Mugabe 's regime could backfire , as many of the millions of Zimbabweans who fled the country plan to return to vote in next month 's run - off presidential election .
He condemned the "" paralysis of leadership "" among African leaders negotiating his country 's electoral crisis .
Tsvangirai was due to return home over the weekend , after announcing he would contest the delayed run - off now set for June 27 .
The opposition leader decided he must take part in the run - off , because otherwise Mugabe would win unchallenged .
Biti said Tsvangirai would return "" very soon "" , despite the alleged plot .
The run - off was called after Zimbabwe 's election commission declared Tsvangirai won nearly 48 % of the vote in the first round , compared to just over 43 % for Mugabe .
The opposition , which believes it was cheated of thousands of votes through ballot - rigging , claims Tsvangirai won 50.3 % of the ballot , giving him the necessary majority for an outright victory .
Since the poll at the end of March , Mugabe 's ruling Zanu - PF party has unleashed a wave of attacks against Tsvangirai supporters that appear to be aimed at intimidating the opposition .
An MDC rally planned for today in Bulawayo was banned .
At least 32 people have been killed , hundreds have been beaten and tens of thousands have been intimidated into fleeing their homes .
Yesterday , the Observer gave details of how two of the regime 's critics , Gibson Nyandoro and Emmanuel Nelson , died after being seized by the police ."
2008-05-19,"Zimbabwe 's opposition party has accused the military of deploying 18 snipers in a plot to kill Morgan Tsvangirai , who beat President Robert Mugabe in a first round of elections in March .
The Movement for Democratic Change secretary general , Tendai Biti , said the threat to Tsvangirai 's life is the principal reason he has not returned to Zimbabwe to campaign for a second round of presidential elections on June 27 .
But Tsvangirai 's long absence is the source of increasing disquiet among many of his supporters amid a wave of state - orchestrated violence against MDC activists and voters aimed at ensuring victory for Mugabe in the runoff .
The MDC says at least 40 of its supporters have been murdered and thousands beaten .
Biti said the alleged plot was hatched by Mugabe 's security cabinet , the Joint Operational Command .
"" We know there are 18 snipers , and the military intelligence directorate is in charge of this , "" he said .
"" Mugabe 's military intelligence has compiled a list of 36 to 40 people to be assassinated .
Top of the list are our leader , Morgan Tsvangirai , myself and our spokesman , Nelson Chamisa . ""
Biti said Tsvangirai will return to Zimbabwe once security measures are in place .
But if the plot is real it will be difficult to protect him .
Zimbabwe 's deputy information minister , Bright Matonga , said the MDC was fantasising .
"" We are not aware of any plot against anyone , but we 're sure he 's playing to the international media gallery . """
2008-05-22,"Zimbabwe 's opposition leader , Morgan Tsvangirai , today said he would return home this weekend despite alleged assassination threats from the Mugabe regime .
"" I am going home ...
[ on ] Saturday , "" he told Zimbabweans seeking protection at a Johannesburg police station after vicious anti - foreigner attacks in South Africa .
Tsvangirai had postponed his return to Zimbabwe for the presidential run - off after his Movement for Democratic Change accused the Joint Operational Command , President Robert Mugabe 's security cabinet , of plotting to kill him .
Bright Matonga , the Zimbabwean deputy information minister , accused the MDC of fantasising and said the party was playing to the international media gallery .
Tsvangirai has spent much of the time since the disputed March 29 elections touring southern Africa and Europe in an attempt to drum up support against Mugabe , although his prolonged absence has worried MDC supporters .
After months of prevarication , the Zimbabwean government has named June 27 as the run - off date .
The MDC had at first said it would not contest a second round , claiming Tsvangirai had won 50.3 % of the votes cast in March , giving him a narrow outright victory .
Faced with the prospect of Mugabe walking away with an unchallenged win , Tsvangirai has been forced to change tack .
However , he has called for the presence of international observers to ensure a free and fair election .
Opposition politicians and human rights groups have accused the ruling Zanu - PF party of pursuing a campaign of intimidation , beating and threatening opposition supporters prior to the vote .
Tsvangirai said Zimbabwe 's crisis had spilled over into South Africa .
"" I am hoping that we are able to solve our crisis back home , "" he added .
The economic and political meltdown in Zimbabwe has forced more millions to flee to South Africa .
Resentment that foreigners are competing for scarce jobs and houses has led to a wave of attacks against them over the past 10 days ."
2008-05-24,"Zimbabwe opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai flew back home yesterday after a six - week self - imposed exile , telling reporters he felt ' quite safe ' .
He called off a return flight into Harare last week , saying he was the target of a military assassination plot .
Tsvangirai has been the target of at least three assassination attempts in the past but his absence from the country was beginning to raise criticism at a time when his supporters are enduring a campaign of politically motivated violence and intimidation by President Robert Mugabe 's ruling party militias .
He went straight from Harare airport to visit some of the victims of the violence in the capital 's main hospital .
More than 40 people have been killed , hundreds injured and tens of thousands have fled their homes since the results of the 29 March presidential election were announced , giving Tsvangirai the majority of the vote , but not enough to prevent a run - off , now fixed for 27 June .
Tsvangirai has spent his time garnering support and funds from other African nations to fund his second run at unseating the increasingly despotic Mugabe ."
2008-05-24,"Morgan Tsvangirai returned to Zimbabwe today , saying he felt safe despite fears of a possible assassination attempt .
The leader of the opposition Movement for Democratic Change party returned to his homeland after six weeks , warning that opposition supporters were facing a campaign of state - sponsored violence prior to the country 's presidential election run - off .
Independent human rights groups say those backing Zimbabwe 's opposition have been threatened and intimidated in an attempt to ensure that the 84-year - old president , Robert Mugabe , wins the vote .
The violence poses serious questions about whether the vote could be free and fair .
Tsvangirai seemed relaxed as he travelled to Johannesburg 's OR Tambo International airport to catch a plane to Harare , telling the Associated Press : "" I feel quite safe . ""
On arrival , he left Harare airport and sped off in a three - car convoy .
Police had been out in force , manning roadblocks on the airport route , but did not intervene as he left the airport .
Later , Tsvangirai visited a Harare hospital where victims of political violence were being treated .
"" I return home to Zimbabwe with a sad heart , "" he told reporters .
"" I have met and listened to the stories of the innocent people targeted by a regime seemingly desperate to cling to power . ""
Tsvangirai faces the run - off election against Mugabe on June 27 .
He won the first round of voting at the end of March , but not by the simple majority needed to avoid a second round , and has spent most of the time since the March 29 election outside Zimbabwe .
He planned to return to the country last Saturday , but delayed the trip after the MDC said he was the target of a military assassination plot .
Tsvangirai , 56 , has survived three assassination attempts , including one in 1997 by unidentified assailants who tried to throw him from a 10th floor window .
Last year , he was taken to hospital after a brutal assault by police at a prayer rally , and images of his bruised and swollen face have come to symbolise the plight of Zimbabwean dissenters .
The MDC has said that more than 30 of its supporters and activists have been killed since March 29 , with its leaders increasingly being targeted in attacks ."
2008-05-25,"Zimbabwe 's president , Robert Mugabe , today threatened to expel the US ambassador to his country and compared Washington 's top official on Africa to a prostitute .
In angry remarks at the formal launch of his campaign for next month 's scheduled presidential run - off against Morgan Tsvangirai , who flew back to the country yesterday , Mugabe criticised ambassador James McGee for urging Tsvangirai to return . ""
He says he fought in Vietnam , but fighting in Vietnam does not give him the right to interfere in our domestic affairs , "" Mugabe said of McGee .
"" I am just waiting to see if he makes one more step wrong .
He will get out .
As tall as he is , if he continues to do that I will kick him out of the country . ""
Mugabe also had harsh words for Jendayi Frazer , the US state department 's top diplomat for Africa , after she said Tsvangirai and his opposition Movement for Democratic Change won the disputed March 29 elections .
"" You saw this little American girl trotting around like a prostitute celebrating that the MDC had won .
A disgraceful act , "" Mugabe said .
Tsvangirai flew back home yesterday after six weeks of self - imposed exile .
Having called off a return to Harare last week , saying he was the target of a military assassination plot , the opposition leader told reporters he now felt "" quite safe "" .
Tsvangirai has been the target of at least three assassination attempts but his absence from the country was beginning to raise criticism as his supporters have been left to endure politically motivated violence and intimidation by Mugabe 's ruling party militias .
Tsvangirai went straight from Harare airport to the capital 's main hospital , where he visited some of the victims .
More than 40 people have been killed , hundreds injured and tens of thousands chased from their homes since the results of the presidential election were announced .
Tsvangirai won the majority of the vote , the electoral commission said , but not by enough to prevent a run - off , which has been set down for June 27 .
Tsvangirai spent his time abroad canvassing support and funds from other African nations for his second run at unseating Mugabe , 84 , whose Zanu - PF party has ruled Zimbabwe since independence in 1980 ."
2008-05-30,"Zimbabwe 's main opposition group , the Movement for Democratic Change ( MDC ) , today declared itself the country 's new ruling party and convened what it called a session of parliament , in defiance of President Robert Mugabe .
The MDC won 110 seats in the 210-seat parliament in the March elections , which gave it control of the legislature for the first time since independence from Britain in 1980 .
But parliament has yet to sit and a run - off of the presidential election between MDC leader Morgan Tsvangirai and Mugabe is not scheduled to take place until June 27 .
However , in what he called a state of the nation address , Tsvangirai said Zimbabwe was about to witness "" a new and different era of governance "" and described Mugabe 's Zanu - PF party as now being in opposition .
Tsvangirai won March 's presidential ballot but not by an outright majority , according to official results .
The MDC claimed its leader won 50.3 % of the vote .
He said today the MDC should woo "" those peaceful members of Zanu - PF whose eyes are open to the disastrous state of our nation "" . ""
Healthy democracies have at least two parties and a reformed Zanu - PF should be one of them , "" said Tsvangirai .
He asked his party 's newly elected MPs , gathered at the Harare International Conference Centre , to stand for a minute 's silence for more than 50 people who have died in violence since the March elections .
Tens of thousands of opposition supporters have been driven from their homes .
Tsvangirai called for party lawmakers to immediately begin work on a timetable to rewrite the constitution and repeal sweeping security and media laws .
He also said they should implement changes needed to restore the economy .
"" It is up to each of us in this room to say Zimbabwe is open for business , "" said Tsvangirai .
A "" restore hope "" campaign was proposed , encompassing human and democratic rights , reconciliation and the nation 's return from international isolation .
The party proposed establishing a truth and justice commission to investigate crimes against ordinary people and calculate compensation for victims .
Tsvangirai said there would be no witch - hunt against police , soldiers or civil servants . ""
But there will be no tolerance or amnesty for those who continue to rape and kill our people , "" he said .
Zimbabwe 's justice minister , Patrick Chinamasa , said Zanu - PF was confident of winning the presidential run - off .
"" We went into the [ first ] election divided within ourselves , "" he said .
"" We have now reconciled and closed ranks behind our candidate . ""
Chinamasa accused the MDC of being "" anti - Zimbabwean "" and said it threatened to reverse "" all the sacrifices the Zimbabwean people have made over the years "" ."
2008-05-30,"Morgan Tsvangirai , Zimbabwe 's opposition leader , claimed yesterday that Robert Mugabe 's party no longer ruled the country .
This is technically true .
The Movement for Democratic Change won a majority of seats in parliament after the first round of elections on March 29 .
But a bitter , and probably bloody , month of campaigning lies ahead before Mr Tsvangirai can really put his claim to the test in the presidential runoff .
Mr Tsvangirai called for "" peaceful members "" of Zanu - PF to participate in talks over a national unity government .
The offer was instantly dismissed by the justice minister , Patrick Chinamasa , who likened the MDC 's political platform to "" a declaration of war "" .
In the meantime , a real war is being waged on MDC supporters .
Bands of soldiers , war veterans and Zanu - PF activists have been terrorising outlying rural areas which voted against the party and Mr Mugabe in the first round .
They have razed villages and beaten , tortured , abducted and murdered MDC activists .
The body of one was found this week with his eyes gouged and his tongue cut out .
At least 50 people have been killed , 1,600 treated in hospital and 50,000 forced from their homes .
This campaign is targeted against specific areas and people : those most at risk are second- and third - tier MDC activists , people with no international profile living in areas cut off from the global information village .
It is premeditated violence , designed to instil the fear of God into the rural heartlands of the country which deserted Mr Mugabe in the first round .
By the time the runoff is held on June 27 the roving bands of killers will have melted into the night , but the memory of them will linger on - or at least that is the intention .
These are tried and tested tactics of intimidation .
And they have worked before in taming unruly provinces .
A brigade of soldiers trained by the North Koreans put down a rebellion in Matabeleland at the cost of 20,000 lives between 1982 and 1985 .
It was called the gukurahundi ( the rain which washes away the chaff before the spring rains ) .
A similar , though lesser , downfall is washing away opposition support in three provinces of Mashonaland in northern Zimbabwe .
The question that must be preying on Mr Mugabe 's mind is : will it work again ?
He can not be sure .
Here the narrative switches from atrocities that should be referred to an international court , to a parallel world of cold , political calculation .
Mr Mugabe needs to find 200,000 votes .
He has already dealt with 50,000 of them , by forcing MDC supporters from the villages where they can cast their votes , and he is guessing that the reign of terror in the north will account for the rest .
The MDC is also doing its sums .
Mr Tsvangirai won the first round by a six - point margin or 160,000 votes .
Add to that the vote gained by Simba Makoni , the Zanu - PF renegade supported by one faction of the MDC , and a further 170,000 votes will be gained .
More votes can be culled , the MDC claim , from higher turnout , and voters returning home from abroad .
But their real hope is that the campaign of violence will backfire against its perpetrators , and will harden the resolve to get rid of a dictator in the dying days of his regime .
This may be just another example of misplaced optimism .
No one will know until the ballot takes place .
In the meantime , the fate of thousands of Zimbabweans lies in the hands of the Southern African Development Community , who have this week been deciding how many observers to send .
There are 9,000 polling stations to monitor , theoretically entailing a force of 18,000 observers .
This is unlikely , as the SADC only mustered 200 people for the first round .
But if the SADC is going to send in a substantial force , it needs to be dispatched now .
Wait any longer and calm will have returned to Mashonaland .
But it will be the peace of the grave ."
2008-06-01,"The Zimbabwean opposition leader , Morgan Tsvangirai , has told South Africa 's president , Thabo Mbeki , that he is no longer fit to serve as the region 's mediator in Zimbabwe 's political crisis owing to a "" lack of neutrality "" , and that "" there will be no country left "" if Mbeki continues to side with President Robert Mugabe .
The warning comes in a letter from the Movement for Democratic Change ( MDC ) leader to Mbeki made public just days after it was revealed that the South African president had written a four - page letter to George Bush demanding that the US president stop criticising Mugabe .
In his letter , Tsvangirai accuses Mbeki of colluding with Mugabe to play down the deepening political crisis , of blocking UN security council discussions on Zimbabwe and of trying to facilitate a controversial weapons delivery from China to the Zimbabwean military .
But some of the strongest criticism is over Mbeki 's reaction to the escalating state - sponsored campaign of murder , violence and arrests against the opposition in the run up to the run - off presidential election between Mugabe and Tsvangirai at the end of this month .
At least 50 people have been killed and thousands beaten .
The letter , dated May 13 , accuses South Africa 's president of ignoring evidence that Harare was planning the violence , including a leaked Zimbabwean military document outlining the strategy that Tsvangirai personally handed to Mbeki .
"" When you started mediating , Zimbabwe still had a functioning economy , millions of our citizens had not fled to other countries to escape political and economic crisis , and tens of thousands had not yet died from impoverishment and disease .
In fact , since the March 29 election , Zimbabwe has plunged into horrendous violence while you have been mediating .
With respect , if we continue like this , there will be no country left , "" writes Tsvangirai .
"" As you know , when MDC attempted to appeal to the UN security council to investigate and help stop the carnage , it was you , the so - called ' neutral ' mediator , who blocked a possible road to resolution of the crisis . ""
Tsvangirai says Mbeki continued to act as if everything was normal , even after the Zimbabwean government blocked the release of poll results showing that Mugabe and his Zanu - PF party had lost . ""
Your lack of neutrality became increasingly evident when I arrived to the Lusaka summit to see you and Mr Mugabe on television together proclaiming there is ' no crisis ' in Zimbabwe , "" the letter says .
Tsvangirai also accuses the South African government of facilitating the delivery of weapons via Durban from a Chinese ship that was eventually turned away by dock workers and legal action .
"" Not only have you been unable to denounce the well - documented post - election attacks on our people , but your government even played a role in Zimbabwean government procurement of weapons of repression ... and agree to allow passage of arms of war purchased by the same government through South African territory during the troubled post - election period , "" he writes .
The letter demands Mbeki step down as the Southern African Development Community mediator on Zimbabwe , as the MDC no longer has confidence in him .
His spokesman , Mukoni Ratshitanga , has denied knowledge of the letter even though the MDC says it has a receipt showing it was delivered to Mbeki 's office .
Ratshitanga has also denied knowledge of the letter to Bush revealed by the Washington Post last week in an article which quotes an unnamed US official as saying Mbeki told Bush to "" butt out "" of Zimbabwe .
But the US embassy in Pretoria confirmed that Mbeki 's letter existed and was delivered to Bush .
Yesterday , the leader of a breakaway MDC faction , Arthur Mutambara , was arrested and charged over a newspaper column criticising Mugabe 's handling of the economy , with inflation now above 1,000,000 % , and accusing the security forces of abuses ."
2008-06-04,"An opposition party official says police have released the Zimbabwean opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai .
Tsvangirai spokesman George Sibotshiwe says Tsvangirai and a group of about 14 officials from the Movement for Democratic Change were released after being held for eight hours at a police station in Lupane , north of the city of Bulawayo .
No charges have been filed .
Sibotshiwe says Tsvangirai had been campaigning in the area when police stopped his convoy Wednesday .
Tsvangirai faces off against President Robert Mugabe in a presidential runoff later this month ."
2008-06-04,"Robert Mugabe 's assault on the opposition ahead of this month 's run - off presidential election has widened , with accusations he is using food as a weapon against a hungry population , and with the detention of the opposition candidate , Morgan Tsvangirai , yesterday .
Tsvangirai , who beat Mugabe in the first round of elections in March but did not win an outright victory , according to official figures , was stopped at a roadblock in south - western Zimbabwe , along with his Movement for Democratic Change party 's deputy leader , Thokozani Khupe , and chairman , Lovemore Moyo .
All three were later released after being held for eight hours , and no charges were filed against them .
MDC officials said they believed the detentions were intended to hinder Tsvangirai 's campaign for the June 27 run - off election , and say that it has already become virtually impossible for him to hold political rallies because the military occupies venues and intimidates those who try to attend .
Speaking before his detention yesterday , Tsvangirai said : "" Mugabe is determined to turn the whole country into a war zone in order to subvert the will of the people and steal the June 27 election by any means possible . ""
Opposition leaders have been changed with criminal offences for criticising Mugabe , amid state - sponsored violence against grassroots activists and voters that has left at least 50 people dead and tens of thousands homeless .
Pressure on rural voters has also risen with an international dispute over who is responsible for millions of Zimbabweans going hungry , a day after Mugabe blamed what he called British - led sanctions at the UN food summit in Rome .
Human Rights Watch said much of the blame in fact lies with the regime in Harare , which has politicised food distribution by ordering a major aid group , Care International , to suspend operations after accusing it and other humanitarian groups of secretly working for Tsvangirai .
The US described the move as evidence of Mugabe 's "" callous indifference "" to his people .
Care , which has denied any political role , feeds about 110,000 people in Zimbabwe .
Other groups have also been ordered to stop distributing food to the 4 million people in need because of the regime 's failed land policies , weather and a collapsing economy . ""
The decision to let people go hungry is yet another attempt to use food as a political tool to intimidate voters ahead of an election , "" said Tiseke Kasambala , the rights group 's researcher for Zimbabwe .
""
President Mugabe 's government has a long history of using food to control the election outcome .
"" On Tuesday Mugabe told the Rome food conference that aid agencies were being used by western governments to channel funds to the opposition . ""
These western - funded NGOs also use food as a political weapon with which to campaign against the government , especially in the rural areas , "" he said .
Mugabe 's comments came days after his minister of local government , Ignatious Chombo , ordered all food deliveries to be controlled by his ministry and carried out by official structures .
"" This decision effectively puts all food distribution in these areas under the full control of President Mugabe 's governing party , "" said Kasambala .
"" The government should put its political aims aside and let independent aid agencies feed people . ""
President George Bush 's press secretary , Dana Perino , said : "" We urge the Mugabe regime to take real action , including the reversal of this ill - advised decision , to prevent government - induced starvation in Zimbabwe . ""
Some aid workers suspect that they have been ordered out of rural areas to prevent them witnessing escalating state - sponsored violence ."
2008-06-04,"Morgan Tsvangirai , the Zimbabwean opposition leader , has been held illegally by police after being stopped at a roadblock , his spokesman said today .
The Movement for Democratic Change leader is due to contest a presidential election run - off with the incumbent , Robert Mugabe , on June 27 .
George Sibotshiwe , travelling with Tsvangirai , said : "" We are currently held up .
They are saying there 's a commanding officer whom we should wait for .
They are not saying why they are holding us up .
It 's not an arrest but illegal detention .
It appears they want to disrupt our campaign programme . ""
Tsvangirai was stopped with his entourage at 12 pm ( 11 am BST ) , the MDC said .
Police searched all vehicles and inspected documents .
Sibotshiwe said Tsvangirai was being held with about 14 MDC officials at a police station in Lupane , north of Bulawayo , and no charges had been filed .
On Sunday , the leader of a breakaway MDC faction , Arthur Mutambara , was arrested and charged over a newspaper column .
He had criticised Mugabe 's handling of the economy , with inflation now above one million per cent , and accused the security forces of abuses .
Tsvangirai won March 's presidential ballot , but official results did not award him an outright majority .
The MDC disputes the results , saying he won 50.3 % of the vote .
Mugabe 's regime is accused of encouraging violence against the MDC and its supporters .
After the March 29 poll , Tsvangirai was mostly out of the country for six weeks .
He returned on May 24 , saying he had been drumming up support from European and African leaders and had not stayed away in fear ."
2008-06-04,"Zimbabwe 's president , Robert Mugabe , has been accused of using food as a weapon to starve opposition supporters in the run - up to a second round of presidential elections .
The accusations came after the government ordered some international aid agencies to stop feeding hundreds of thousands of people .
A day after Mugabe told the UN food summit in Rome that British - led sanctions are responsible for widespread hunger in his country , Human Rights Watch said today that much of the blame lies with the regime in Harare , which has politicised food distribution by ordering a major aid group , Care International , to suspend operations and accusing it of backing the opposition presidential candidate , Morgan Tsvangirai .
Care , which has denied any political role , feeds about 110,000 people in Zimbabwe and helps hundreds of thousands more with other forms of aid .
Other groups have also been ordered to stop distributing food to the 4 million people in need because of failed land policies , weather and a collapsing economy . ""
The decision to let people go hungry is yet another attempt to use food as a political tool to intimidate voters ahead of an election , "" said Tiseke Kasambala , the rights group 's researcher for Zimbabwe .

"" This decision effectively puts all food distribution in these areas under the full control of President Mugabe 's governing party , "" said Kasambala .
"" The government should put its political aims aside and let independent aid agencies feed people . ""
Mugabe 's Zanu - PF party has withheld food , or threatened to , in previous elections as a means of pressuring voters , but the government has found it difficult to control distribution of aid delivered through the UN and international agencies .
Some aid workers suspect that they have been ordered out of rural areas to prevent them witnessing escalating state - sponsored violence against the opposition in the run up to the 27 June presidential election .
Tsvangirai 's Movement for Democratic Change says that more than 50 of its activists and supporters have been murdered by ruling party militia or the security forces , thousands severely beaten and tens of thousands forced from their homes , making it difficult for them to vote ."
2008-06-05,"Manicaland , in eastern Zimbabwe , was one of the provinces where Robert Mugabe 's Zanu - PF party was shocked by the strength of support for the opposition MDC in March .
The party lost a string of parliamentary seats and Morgan Tsvangirai outpolled Mugabe in the presidential race .
But it is hard to believe the province is ready to repeat this defiance on June 27 .
In Rusape , Zanu - PF youth militias jog along the streets , singing liberation songs .
Some wave clubs or axes at passing vehicles .
Chinese - made Zanu - PF pickup trucks are everywhere .
In Mutiweshiri , villagers are being enticed to party rallies by the arrival of a truck from the government - run Grain Marketing Board , loaded with imported maize meal .
Only those pledging support for Zanu - PF will benefit .
Goodwill , a secondary school teacher explained what this meant .
"" I should be apolitical , but the government has labelled all teachers as MDC sympathisers , so I wo n't eat "" .
Goodwill has greater reason than hunger for fear .
A Zanu - PF youth militia raided the school where his wife teaches .
The youths , armed with axes and sticks , led the teachers out to the playing field , ordered them to lie on their stomachs then beat them on the legs and buttocks .
When these beatings began in April , they were generally superficial , but attacks with axes , clubs and now guns causing deaths and serious injuries are becoming more common .
Goodwill was tipped off that his school would be raided and has started sleeping out in the open to avoid attack .
In Nyanga , David , another teacher fleeing violence is sleeping on a relative 's floor , too scared to live at home .
"" I have been unable to access any assistance , "" he says .
"" The international NGOs are saying there are no resources for displaced people ,
Perhaps it is because we are seen as political "" .
Without even his limited income of £ 4 per month , David relies on his extended family for support .
But in the absence of UN refugee centres or feeding stations , family networks are coming under strain , as more refugees arrive from rural areas .
MDC activists say they are under siege .
Promise , a newly elected councillor in Mutare , gave an account of a typical attack .
"" I was asleep at home when I heard a knock on my door at 4 am .
I ignored it , but the Zanu - PF people tricked my mother into opening the door .
"" They dragged me into my back yard and asked my age .
When I said I was 36 , they said I would get a beating for every year .
They hung me upside down and beat me all over "" .
Promise has a broken hand and complains that his ears have not stopped ringing since the attack .
Promise , like many other MDC officials , has fled his area and wonders how his party can campaign with its activists in such disarray : "" Nothing can stop
Zanu - PF stealing the election now "" .
The only optimistic thought he can offer is that , "" the village people surprised us with their courage on March 29 and they may do so again "" .
But it will not be easy for villagers to vote freely .
According to Promise , Zanu - PF has activated "" sniffers "" in each ward to "" consolidate fear . ""
And villagers in Honde Valley have been instructed to vote with solid Zanu - PF supporters , so their ballots can be monitored .
The police are careful not to get in the way of Zanu - PF .
But many officers have encouraged the MDC to resist attacks .
Promise recalls one officer telling him : "" You are the majority now . ""
The MDC set up self - defence groups in April , which resisted attacks in parts of Manicaland and Masvingo .
Abendigo , a senior provincial official still at his post , said : "" For a while we could say to them , if you burn one house in Chikuku , MDC will burn two "" .
But these groups , armed only with sticks , are now outgunned .
Zanu - PF has deployed army units and issued its own militias with guns .
Reports of shooting victims are now streaming in .
In Zaka this week , armed men attacked an MDC office , shooting those sleeping inside , then pouring petrol over them , setting them alight and locking the office to trap them in the blaze .
Two people were killed and two more suffered life - threatening burns .
The Zaka attack demonstrates Zanu - PF 's new willingness to use lethal force .
The MDC is powerless to resist and local officials are confused as to what response to offer .
Some despair of victory on June 27 , as so many supporters have been driven from their homes .
Others remain optimistic , but call for a delay in the voting or the deployment of peacekeepers .
As Abendigo says : "" People are blaming the leadership for fleeing violence , but leaving the voters to face it .
Many people say to us , ' Where are you ?
Ca n't you save us ?
Ca n't you give us guns ' ?
"" Karl , a senior trade unionist in Mutare explains Zanu - PF 's tactics . ""
When Zanu - PF names you as an opposition supporter , you have to confess your sins and hand something over to show your repentance – your MDC t - shirt or membership card – to prove you have been born again and baptised in the name of Robert Mugabe "" .
Karl believes that Zanu - PF is not prepared to relinquish power and has plans to respond to all possible outcomes .
The violence might be sufficient to deter opposition voters , allowing Mugabe to win outright .
Alternatively , Mugabe could announce victory , despite a Tsvangirai win , and call for a government of national unity under his presidency .
Karl 's assessment is that many opportunists within Tsvangirai 's ranks would take the chance of power .
If , "" by some miracle "" , Tsvangirai is declared the winner , Mugabe 's generals are signalling their readiness to stage a coup .
Mugabe 's new unofficial slogan is , according to Karl : "" There will be war if I lose "" .
Two months ago , areas like Manicaland were hopeful , confident that a change of government was possible , despite Mugabe 's will for power .
Hope has now faded .
The outcome of Zimbabwe 's election will depend on whether the poorest and most marginalised people defy their hardships .
Names have been changed .

2008-06-06,"Zimbabwean police today stopped the opposition candidate , Morgan Tsvangirai , and his party from campaigning in the build - up to the presidential run - off election .
With the run - off only three weeks away , police imposed a ban on any rallies by his Movement for Democratic Change , the party said .
Tsvangirai was stopped at two roadblocks as he attempted to campaign around Bulawayo , Zimbabwe 's second largest city .
When he was stopped for the second time , he was ordered to go to Esigodini police station , about 30 miles away , and was released two hours later .
The opposition leader and the reporters with him were escorted back to Bulawayo by police , and appeared to have been instructed not to resume campaigning .
Tsvanigirai 's detention today is his second in recent days .
"" We are dismayed that our president has not been allowed to access the Zimbabwean people at a crucial stage in this campaign , "" Tsvangirai 's spokesman , George Sibotshiwe , said today .
The MDC said police had told them that rallies had been banned because of safety concerns for Tsvangirai and other party leaders .
But Sibotshiwe called the justification "" nonsense , "" and said the ban was "" a clear indication that the regime will do everything necessary to remain in power . ""
Police spokesman Wayne Bvudzijena said he was not aware of today 's incidents , but said that it is not uncommon for police to stop drivers at roadblocks to ensure they are not transporting weapons .
""
Tsvangirai and his convoy are not immune to search , "" he said .
"" They can be searched at any roadblock they pass . ""
He also said candidates had been told they needed to inform police before holding a political rally .
The latest setback for Tsvangirai came amid growing international concern over the halting of work by overseas aid agencies in Zimbabwe .
UN aid agencies said they were deeply worried by the move , which will hamper food deliveries to many severely impoverished areas of the country .
Speaking today , the international development secretary , Douglas Alexander , raised concern about the millions of Zimbabweans close to starvation . ""
The task of the international aid agencies working in Zimbabwe is purely humanitarian – to feed … hungry people and to tackle the terrible poverty and deprivation which afflicts the country , "" he said .
"" For Robert Mugabe to use the threat of hunger as a political weapon shows a callous contempt for human life . ""
This indefensible decision , which seems to be part of a strategy ahead of the presidential run - off , demonstrates to the world the lengths to which Mugabe will go to cling on to power . ""
Last week , Mugabe instructed a number of non - governmental organisations ( NGOs ) to suspend their activities in Zimbabwe , but today 's new announcement covers all overseas aid workers in the country .
The government accused them of campaigning for opposition parties during the disputed presidential elections in March .
"" I hereby instruct all PVOs ( private voluntary organisations)/NGOs to suspend all field operations until further notice , "" the Zimbabwean social welfare minister , Nicholas Goche , said .
Today 's shock tactic means British charities working in Zimbabwe are now unlikely to be able to provide care for the millions of Zimbabweans who are reliant on aid .
"" We are seriously concerned about the consequences relating to reports of the suspension of aid operations in Zimbabwe , particularly for the most vulnerable children who we work with and who need our help , "" Dominic Nutt , a spokesman for Save the Children , said .
Judith Melby , Africa specialist for Christian Aid , which has been involved in Zimbabwe since its independence in 1980 , said : "" It is certainly going to have an extremely detrimental effect - it is quite frightening , frankly . ""
Some 10 million Zimbabweans out of a total population of 13 million live below the poverty line .
Four million of those rely on food aid .
Earlier this week , Zimbabwe ordered the Care International aid agency to halt its operations pending an investigation into allegations that it had been politically active .
Care recalled its field staff but strongly denied the accusation and said its projects were benefiting more than 1.8 million Zimbabweans .
In a statement , Oxfam said : "" International NGOs - Oxfam included - have been unable to conduct food need assessments , making preparation difficult for the impending hungry season .
"" We reject the present government 's assertion that international civil society agencies are aiding and abetting the opposition . ""
Yesterday , security forces in the country detained and harassed UK and US diplomats trying to investigate reports of violence against the opposition .
Zimbabwe 's ambassador to Britain , Gabriel Machinga , was summoned to the Foreign Office to explain why the diplomats , who were travelling in two separate convoys , had been stopped at roadblocks north of the capital , Harare .
David Miliband , the foreign secretary , condemned what he called a "" serious incident "" , but confirmed that no violence had been directed at the UK personnel .
"" It gives us a window into the lives of ordinary Zimbabweans , because this sort of intimidation is something that is suffered daily , especially by those who are working with opposition groups , "" he added .
"" It 's a window into lives that , in some cases , are marked by brutal intimidation , by torture and , in 53 cases that have been documented over the last few weeks , by death . ""
US embassy officials in the country blamed the move on Mugabe 's government , which it accuses of trying to intimidate Tsvangirai supporters ."
2008-06-06,"The Zimbabwean government yesterday banned the opposition presidential candidate , Morgan Tsvangirai , from holding political rallies three weeks ahead of his run - off election against Robert Mugabe .
The police told Tsvangirai of the ban , ostensibly over concerns for his safety , when he was arrested for a second time this week while trying to campaign .
But the move appears to reflect a growing concern in Mugabe 's camp that its strategy of violence , intimidation and nationalist appeals will not be sufficient to ensure victory in the June 27 vote after Tsvangirai won the first round in March but fell just short of an outright majority .
The Foreign Office condemned the ban on campaigning : "" Nothing we 've seen since the first round suggests that Mugabe has changed .
He 's trying to steal the election now exactly as he did in the first round . ""
The ban on opposition rallies came a day after the government barred international aid agencies , including the United Nations , from working in Zimbabwe for the duration of the election campaign .
The US described the restrictions as further evidence that Mugabe wants to control food distribution to use it as a political weapon to blackmail Zimbabweans into voting for him .
But aid workers said they believed it is also an attempt to prevent them from witnessing the escalating state - sponsored attacks on the opposition Movement for Democratic Change and its supporters in rural areas .
The MDC says more than 60 of its activists and supporters have been murdered by pro - Mugabe militias or security forces and thousands more have been severely beaten .
The UN described the new restrictions as "" scandalous "" and warned that children will be particularly vulnerable to the cutback in food deliveries to about 4 million people - one - third of the population - who rely on aid to survive .
Unicef , the UN 's children 's agency , said that about 180,000 will be seriously at risk from curbs to nutrition and healthcare .
Britain described the restrictions on aid agencies as a reflection of Mugabe 's "" callous contempt for human life "" .
Tsvangirai was attempting to campaign in Bulawayo , Zimbabwe 's second city , when he was detained and taken to a police station about 30 miles from the city .
He was released after about two hours but with a warning that he was not permitted to campaign any more , according to his spokesman , George Sibotshiwe .
"" We are dismayed that our president has not been allowed to access the Zimbabwean people at a crucial stage in this campaign , "" he said .
The security forces had already blocked Tsvangirai from holding rallies by sending soldiers to occupy stadiums booked by the MDC and to intimidate ordinary people into staying away .
But the MDC leader had continued to hold small , sometimes impromptu , meetings .
Sibotshiwe said the claim by police that the formal ban was solely intended to protect Tsvangirai and other MDC leaders was "" nonsense "" and "" a clear indication that the regime will do everything necessary to remain in power "" .
Zanu - PF was clearly shocked after the first round of elections at the inroads Tsvangirai made into the ruling party 's former strongholds , particularly in Mashonaland .
The MDC leader had campaigned heavily in rural areas for the first time because of the relative lack of violence compared to other recent elections .
Mugabe has evidently fallen back on violence once again but in banning foreign aid agencies , and detaining British and American diplomats on Thursday , the authorities evidently do not want outside witnesses .
On Thursday , foreign aid organisations were ordered to suspend field work indefinitely .
Mugabe this week accused NGOs of acting as a front for western support for the MDC .
The UN 's Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs ( OCHA ) said the ban would severely hamper assistance to millions of people .
"" These restrictions are also coming at a time when food security in Zimbabwe is deteriorating , leaving an increasing number of people vulnerable , "" Elisabeth Byrs , a spokeswoman for OCHA , told the Associated Press .
Two British aid agencies affected by the ban , Save the Children and Christian Aid , condemned it .
Christian Aid described the restrictions as certain to have an "" extremely detrimental effect "" and "" frightening "" .
In London , the international development secretary , Douglas Alexander , told Channel 4 News that Mugabe 's use of "" the threat of hunger as a political weapon in his re - election strategy shows a callous contempt for human life "" ."

2008-06-07,"Zimbabwean police arrested a prominent opposition lawyer yesterday in a dawn raid at his home , a day after the leader of the Movement for Democratic Change , Morgan Tsvangirai , was detained for a second time and banned from holding political rallies .
Yesterday it was revealed that it was only the direct intervention of the South African President , Thabo Mbeki , that had led to Tsvangirai being released .
With just 19 days to go until the presidential run - off on 27 June , Robert Mugabe 's government is intensifying a vicious crackdown on the MDC and its supporters .
Eric Matinenga , an MP and Tsvangirai 's lawyer during his 2005 treason trial , yesterday became the sixth MDC legal adviser to have been arrested and detained since the result of the first presidential poll on 29 March was eventually announced .
That was won by Tsvangirai , but without the majority needed to avoid a run - off with Mugabe .
Matinenga was rearrested two days after a magistrate had ordered him to be released from custody , saying he had been wrongly charged with inciting public violence .
MDC spokesman Nelson Chamisa said yesterday Matinenga 's arrest was illegal and accused Mugabe of sabotaging campaigning in order to keep his 28-year hold on power .
All week police have been closing off areas where MDC rallies were planned to take place and arresting activists , including David Nyathi , the MDC 's provincial director of elections .
Tsvangirai was detained twice as he tried to campaign in the southwestern province of Matabeleland .
On Thursday , Tsvangirai , his deputy Thokozani Khupe , and the MDC national chairman Lovemore Moyo , were detained at a roadblock and held for more than 11 hours .
Tsvangirai told The Observer that their bullet - proof vehicle was impounded and remains in a police lock - up .
Police spokesman Wayne Bvudzijena insisted : ' People are free to campaign as they choose . '
But he said Tsvangirai had consistently broken the law by failing to notify police of his rallies . '
For now , we are just warning him , ' Bvudzijena said .
Mbeki 's spokesman , Mukoni Ratshitanga , confirmed yesterday that Mbeki had came to Tsvangirai 's rescue . '
Discussions did take place with government representatives in Harare in which the President appealed for Mr Tsvangirai 's release , ' Ratshitanga said .
The Southern African Development Community appointed Mbeki last year to facilitate talks between Zanu PF and the MDC with a view to finding a lasting solution .
The talks collapsed and Mbeki has come under heavy criticism for his softly - softly approach to Mugabe .
After several weeks of intimidation and violent attacks by police and militias that have seen more than 60 MDC supporters killed , and tens of thousands flee their homes , Mugabe 's strategy now seems to be to cripple the opposition by arresting its leaders and militarising his former strongholds in the rural areas , where Tsvangirai made major gains in March . '
They are trying to cripple the electoral capacity of the MDC in every way .
Many of our leadership in the frontline have been killed , abducted , beaten and generally harassed , ' said Eddie Cross , an opposition MP .
At the same time , a familiar tactic of starving the opposition is being played out .
On Thursday , Mugabe 's government announced a ban on non - government organisations providing food aid in the countryside , accusing them of ' political activity ' and leaving Zanu PF clear to use food to coerce votes .
The UN and the Food and Agriculture Organisation are warning that Zimbabweans are enduring unusually huge shortages of food supplies .
Bread in particular is becoming scarce and the goverment 's grain silos are said to be empty .
American and British officials said food was being used as a weapon , because with the charities banned millions of the poorest Zimbabweans have to turn to Mugabe .
Only the government and Mugabe 's Zanu PF will now be distributing food and other aid .
The outspoken US ambassador to Zimbabwe , James McGee , said on Friday that the authorities were now supplying food mostly to Mugabe supporters .
In a video - conference from Harare , McGee said his embassy has evidence food was being offered to opposition members only if they hand over their ID cards .
Speaking in South Africa , Simba Makoni , the former Zanu PF minister who turned independent to run in the first round of the presidential race , is advocating delaying the elections until officials could ensure a fair poll .
Makoni said : ' Even if by the remotest of chances we could have an election whose results would resemble the will of the people , it would still not resolve the crisis .
Neither of the two leaders ... would be able to form an effective government if they won the run - off . '
But Mugabe 's chief election agent , Emmerson Mnangagwa , said that the President was misunderstood by anyone who thought that he would not abide by a democratic vote and relinquish power .
He said the President ' does not think he will lose and hand over power ' .
But he added : ' If Mugabe loses the election , I will be the first to go to him as his chief election agent and say , "" Boss , we have lost .
We brought democracy to Zimbabwe and we should defend it .
"" I will ask him if I should draft his resignation speech , or whether he would rather draft his own statement . '
Tsvangirai spoke confidently , too , saying he expected the crackdown to backfire : ' If Mugabe did not hear the voice in March , he 's going to hear a much louder voice that people no longer enjoy their confidence in this government . '
Whether the terrified and hungry people of Zimbabwe will feel able to cast their vote on 27 June remains to be seen ."
2008-06-07,"Zimbabwean police arrested a prominent opposition party lawyer today in a dawn raid at his home , a day after the Movement for Democratic Change leader Morgan Tsvangirai was himself detained for a second time and banned from holding any political rallies .
It was also revealed today that it was only the direct intervention of South African president Thabo Mbeki in a personal phone call to the Zimbabwean government that had led to Tsvangirai being released after he was held on Thursday .
With just weeks to go until the presidential run - off on June 27 , Robert Mugabe 's government is intensifying a vicious crackdown on its opposition and their supporters .
Today Eric Matinenga , an MP and Tsvangirai 's lawyer during his 2005 trial for treason , became the sixth MDC legal advisor to have been arrested and detained for various offences since the result of the first , March 29 presidential poll , was eventually announced .
That was won by Tsvangirai , but narrowly according to official results , and without the majority needed to avoid a run - off with President Mugabe .
Matinenga was re - arrested just two days after a magistrate had ordered him to be released from custody , saying he had been wrongly charged with inciting public violence in his constituency , Buhera West .
MDC spokesman Nelson Chamisa said today that Matinenga 's arrest was illegal and accused Mugabe of sabotaging campaigning in order to keep his 28-year hold on power .
All week police have been moving ahead of the MDC , closing off areas where rallies were planned to be take place and arresting MDC activists , including David Nyathi , the MDC 's provincial director of elections .
Tsvangirai was detained twice as he tried to campaign in the rural south - west province of Matebeleland .
On Thursday Tsvangirai , his deputy Thokozani Khupe and the MDC national chairperson Lovemore Moyo , were detained at a roadblock and held for over 11 hours .
Tsvangirai told the Observer that their bullet - proof vehicle was impounded and remains in a police lock - up , alleging the driver was breaking licensing legislation .

The business newspaper the Zimbabwe Independent today quoted sources saying that President Mbeki had spoken by phone to senior Zimbabwe government officials appealing for Tsvangirai 's release .
Mbeki 's spokesperson Mukoni Ratshitanga confirmed that Mbeki had came to Tsvangirai 's rescue . '
Discussions did take place with government representatives in Harare in which the president appealed for Mr Tsvangirai 's release,""Ratshitanga said .
The Southern African Development Community appointed Mbeki last year to facilitate talks between Zanu PF and the MDC with a view to finding a lasting solution to the country 's crisis .
The talks collapsed and Mbeki has come under heavy criticism for his softly softly approach to Mugabe amid a rapidly escalating humanitarian crisis inside Zimbabwe .
After several weeks of intimidation and violent attacks by police and militias on MDC voters that has seen more than 60 MDC supporters killed , and tens of thousands flee their homes , many forced to flood over the borders into South Africa or Botswana , Mugabe 's strategy seems now to be to attempt cripple the opposition by arresting its key leaders .
He is also increasing the military presence in his former strongholds in the rural areas , where Tsvangirai made major election gains in March .
"" They are trying to cripple the electoral capacity of the MDC in every way .
Many of our leadership in the front line have been killed , abducted , beaten and generally harassed , "" said Eddie Cross , an opposition MP .
"" They are working in every field to reduce our capacity to campaign and win the run - off .
Radio stations are being jammed , newspapers burnt and journalists harassed , "" he said .
At the same time , a familiar tactic of starving the opposition is being played out .
On Thursday Mugabe 's government announced a ban on non - government organisations providing food aid in the countryside , accusing them of ' political activity ' and leaving the ruling party , Zanu PF clear to use its tried and tested method of using food to coerce votes .
The UN and the Food and Agriculture Organisation are warning that Zimbabweans are enduring unusually huge shortages of food supplies .
Bread in particular is becoming scarce and the government 's grain silos are said to be empty ."
2008-06-11,"Zimbabwe 's opposition is under intense political and violent pressure to agree to call off a second round of presidential elections in a fortnight and join a coalition government that keeps Robert Mugabe in power .
Morgan Tsvangirai , the Movement for Democratic Change leader won the first round of elections in March but narrowly failed to win an outright majority .
He has rejected any deal that leaves Mugabe in office , and says there can be no agreement on power - sharing before a run - off vote .
But there is concern among some opposition politicians that , if the MDC insists on taking power , the government will use escalating state - sponsored violence as a pretext to call off the polls at the last minute and impose emergency rule .
South Africa 's president , Thabo Mbeki , the former Zambian leader Kenneth Kaunda , and Mugabe 's former finance minister , Simba Makoni , are pressuring Tsvangirai to accept a deal modelled on the recent post - election "" African solution "" in Kenya .
This would see Mugabe remain as president but Tsvangirai become prime minister .
Hoever .
the MDC regards Kenya as a bad example because the opposition victory was overturned through violence .
Makoni said that he has been acting as an informal mediator between the MDC and Mugabe 's Zanu - PF party , along with Mbeki , to press the opposition to agree to a transitional government , because of rising violence . ""
In the current situation , there is no hope that a free and fair election can be undertaken , "" Makoni said .
Kaunda has added to the pressure on Tsvangirai with a public call for him to accept the post of prime minister under a Mugabe presidency . ""
The authority between president and prime minister must be fairly shared , "" Kaunda said .
The MDC replied that , as it is Mugabe who has created the violence and political instability , it would be perverse to reward him by allowing him to remain president - when Tsvangirai should serve as the country 's leader during any transitional government , because he won the first round of voting .
Tsvangirai said that while the MDC is prepared to accept Zanu - PF into a power - sharing government , Mugabe has to go and his party must be in a minority . ""
The Kenyan model of a government of national unity is not an option because ... our circumstances are different .
The people 's choice must be respected , "" he said .
But there is fear among some of Mugabe 's opponents that he will use the violence as a pretext to claim there is too much instability to hold a vote .
The state - run press has laid the groundwork with an attempt to blame the victims by portraying the MDC as responsible for the campaign of beatings and killings , which the opposition says has left at least 60 dead and about 200 missing .
More than 3,000 people have been treated in hospital after severe beatings , and tens of thousands have been forced from their homes , as a result of the violence across Zimbabwe .
Tsvangirai said the campaign had been devastating : "" The structure of our party has been decimated and our polling agents remain prime targets . ""
Yesterday Mbeki described the violence as a "" serious concern "" which needs to be addressed by regional leaders .
The South African president has angered the MDC by declining to specifically identify the government as instigating the attacks ."
2008-06-11,"Morgan Tsvangirai is under intense pressure to form a government of national unity with Robert Mugabe .
It comes from South Africa 's president , Thabo Mbeki , Zambia 's founding president , Kenneth Kaunda , and the Zanu - PF rebel candidate Simba Makoni .
They argue that the run - off can not be held on June 27 in current conditions of violence .
The best way forward , they say , is the Kenyan model : there , a disputed election disintegrated into communal violence and the solution only came when the president shared power with his main opponent as executive prime minister .
There are several flaws in drawing a parallel with Kenya .
The violence in Zimbabwe has not erupted , as it did in Kenya , between rival groups of supporters .
Some of the worst ethnic violence , in towns like Kisumu in western Kenya , was perpetrated by opposition supporters .
This is not happening in Zimbabwe , where violence is state - sponsored and targeted at specific constituencies where Zanu - PF lost .
This is , by now , a well - documented fact , which even Mr Mugabe 's shock troops do little to disguise .
Yesterday Zanu - PF officials in southern Masvingo province boasted of setting up units of war veterans "" against troublesome spots "" where the opposition Movement for Democratic Change had taken root .
Even if Mr Tsvangirai won the second round , Mr Makoni argues , the country is so traumatised from the violence and exhausted from a decade of economic collapse that neither Zanu - PF nor the MDC could govern on their own .
This is true , but it sidesteps the cause and chief sponsor of the violence - an 84-year - old man who will not release his grip on power .
Mr Tsvangirai is right to reject talk of a national unity government until the central demand of the MDC is met : that Mr Mugabe step down .
Only after he goes does power - sharing and reconciliation become possible .
The Kenyan model would merely serve as another device for keeping him as president .
Perhaps this is why Zanu - PF is attracted to the idea .
If Zanu - PF was confident it could beat the rural heartlands into submission , why would the party be putting out feelers to the opposition ?
Why would the first lady , Grace Mugabe , say that the opposition leader will never step foot inside State House , or Major General Martin Chedondo , the army chief of staff , call on troops to remain loyal ?
Mr Mugabe can not be sure that the stick he wields is having the desired educational effect .
His former information minister Jonathan Moyo insists his old boss has lost the country for good .
If this is true , the run - off remains the only game in town and the country should be flooded with thousands of African observers to ensure that it is held ."
2008-06-12,"Police in Zimbabwe yesterday arrested the secretary general of the main opposition party , the Movement for Democratic Change , and detained its leader , Morgan Tsvangirai , as he campaigned for the June 27 presidential run - off .
Tendai Biti , a lawyer who became the public face of the MDC during the first round of voting , was arrested as he flew in to Harare from South Africa .
Police later said Biti would be charged with treason and would face "" the death penalty or life in prison "" if convicted .
Tsvangirai 's campaign convoy , which included his tour bus , was stopped at a roadblock near the central town of Kwekwe , and he was taken to a police station where he was held for two hours .
It is the third time he has been detained since returning to Zimbabwe from South Africa three weeks ago .
The detentions are the latest examples of what human rights groups and opposition parties say is harassment and intimidation ahead of the run - off .
Tsvangirai won the first round with 47.9 % of the vote , compared with 43.2 % for Mugabe .
Recent statements by the military leadership and Mugabe 's wife Grace suggest he has no intention of leaving office after the vote .
Biti , who is the party 's third in command , had left Zimbabwe shortly after the March 29 vote for security reasons , and travelled around Africa helping Tsvangirai seek support from other countries .
Last month police authorities were quoted in the state - run press saying that Biti had broken the law by declaring that Tsvangirai had won the presidential election before official results were released .
Before leaving Johannesburg yesterday Biti learnt that he would be arrested .
He said going home was a "" stupid decision "" , but an unavoidable one .
The MDC said that 10 plainclothes policemen had taken Biti from Harare airport to an undisclosed location .
"" We are charging him with treason and communicating statements prejudicial to the state , "" said a police spokesman , Wayne Bvudzijena .
Tsvangirai appears determined to contest the poll whatever the obstacles .
Police have blocked several of his rallies , while there have been widespread reports of brutal violence against MDC supporters in rural areas .
There are also increasing indications that the military is running Mugabe 's campaign , a tactic not seen in previous elections .
The Southern African Development Community said yesterday it would deploy 400 observers during the election , triple the number used for the first round .
The US ambassador , James McGee , said : "" We 'd like to see three to four times that [ number ] .
Then I think we would have an opportunity [ for free and fair elections ] "" .
Mugabe maintains that western governments are backing the opposition because of his seizure of white - owned farms , and that the country 's sovereignty is under threat .
But in a rare admission of failure yesterday , he said that only 42 % of the seized land was in full use , and threatened to repossess under - performing farms .
"" We would soon ask people who are not utilising their land to retire from the A2 [ large - scale commercial ] farms we allocated them , "" Mugabe told business leaders and government officials , according to the Herald newspaper .
"" We do not want settlers .
We will get that land and give it to people who deserve it . """
2008-06-12,"A senior Zimbabwe opposition politician who was arrested at Harare airport today could face the death penalty after police said he would be charged with treason .
Tendai Biti , the secretary general of the Movement for Democratic Change ( MDC ) , was detained after arriving from South Africa , his party 's supporters told Reuters .
The party 's leader , Morgan Tsvangirai , who will face Robert Mugabe in a presidential run - off vote , was also arrested today and briefly detained .
It was his third arrest in little more than a week .
Biti , seen as the MDC 's second - in - command , could face the death penalty if convicted of treason .
Wayne Bvudzijena , a police spokesman , said Biti would also be charged with making false statements .
The MDC is under intense political and violent pressure to call off the second voting round in a fortnight and join a coalition government that keeps Robert Mugabe in power .
The party says activists from Mugabe 's ruling Zanu - PF party have killed 66 opposition supporters to intimidate voters before the presidential run - off .
Tsvangirai won the first round of elections in March , but narrowly failed to win an outright majority .
He has rejected any deal that leaves Mugabe in office , and said there could be no agreement on power - sharing before the run - off .
There is concern among some opposition politicians that should the MDC insist on taking overall control , the government would use the escalating violence as a reason to call off the polls at the last minute and impose emergency rule .
The South African president , Thabo Mbeki , the former Zambian leader Kenneth Kaunda , and Mugabe 's former finance minister , Simba Makoni - who ran in the first round - are putting pressure on Tsvangirai to accept a deal modelled on the recent post - election "" African solution "" in Kenya .
This would see Mugabe remain as president and Tsvangirai become prime minister .
However , the MDC regards Kenya as a bad example because the opposition victory was overturned through violence .
Makoni said he had been acting as an informal mediator , along with Mbeki , between the MDC and Zanu - PF to press the opposition to agree to a transitional government to halt rising violence .
Kaunda has added to the pressure on Tsvangirai with a public call for him to accept the post of prime minister under a Mugabe presidency .
A senior UN official is due to visit Zimbabwe next week to discuss the political situation and forthcoming presidential elections .
Haile Menkerios , the assistant secretary general for political affairs , will visit South Africa from June 16 to 20 .
The UN has a permanent presence in Zimbabwe , but Menkerios 's trip represents the world body 's deepest involvement so far in the country 's political crisis .
Tsvangirai has demanded that international observers monitor the June 27 vote .
UN diplomats say they expect the UN to support , but not itself conduct , election monitoring by outsiders .
The UN security council is due to discuss the humanitarian crisis in Zimbabwe , whose economy lies in shambles , at closed consultations today .
Western diplomats said they had wanted a broader discussion of Zimbabwe , but that South Africa , Russia and China blocked the move ."
2008-06-13,"Zimbabwe 's war veterans are preparing to violently overthrow the Movement for Democratic Change if the opposition party triumphs in elections later this month , Robert Mugabe said today .
The country 's ageing president , who faces a run - off election for the presidency on June 27 , told young members of his ruling Zanu - PF party in Harare that the veterans had told him they would launch a new bush war if the MDC leader , Morgan Tsvangirai , wins . ""
They said if this country goes back into white hands just because we have used a pen [ voted ] , we will return to the bush to fight , "" Mugabe said , according to Reuters .
The war veterans , who usually act alongside Zimbabwe 's youth militia , have regularly been used as shock troops to intimidate government opponents .
The threats emerged as 14 of Africa 's most high - profile dignitaries , including the former UN secretary general , Kofi Annan , called for free and fair elections overseen by independent observers .
In full - page advertisements in the Financial Times and the South African daily Business Day , African academics , former heads of state and religious leaders said they were deeply troubled by reports of intimidation and violence . ""
As Africans we consider the forthcoming elections to be critical .
We are aware of the attention of the world , "" said the appeal , signed by some of Africa 's most well - known figures , from the Nobel laureate Desmond Tutu and the Senegalese musician Youssou N'Dour to the former Mozambique president Joaquim Chissano .
"" We call for an end to the violence and intimidation , and restoration of full access for humanitarian and aid agencies . ""
The current UN secretary general , Ban Ki - Moon , who was in London for talks with Gordon Brown , repeated the plea . ""
The June 27 run - off should be held in a most transparent and objective way so Zimbabweans can be given a free choice of leader , "" he said .
Brown called for an end to violence and oppression and demanded the immediate restoration of food aid .
British officials say around 400 election observers could be needed to ensure the poll is fair .
Tsvangirai was released overnight after being detained by police – the fourth time he has been held in the last fortnight .
However , an MDC spokesman said there was still no word on Tendai Biti , the party 's third - in - command , who was arrested yesterday at Harare airport after arriving from South Africa .
Police said he would be charged with treason on allegations of "" communicating statements prejudicial to the state "" .
They would not say where he was being held .
Biti had left Zimbabwe shortly after the March 29 vote for security reasons , and travelled around Africa helping Tsvangirai seek support from other countries .
Last month , police authorities were quoted in the state - run press saying that Biti had broken the law by declaring that Tsvangirai had won the presidential election before official results were released .
Before leaving Johannesburg yesterday Biti learned he would be arrested .
He said going home was a "" stupid decision "" , but an unavoidable one .
The MDC said 10 plainclothes policemen had taken Biti from Harare airport to an undisclosed location .
Senior MDC officials made frantic efforts to contact the South African president , Thabo Mbeki , to secure Biti 's release , Business Day reported .
Last week , Mbeki helped secure Tsvangirai 's release from police detention .
The escalation of repression — and Biti 's arrest — came one day after Mugabe 's Zanu - PF negotiators had agreed during talks with the MDC in Pretoria that the crackdown would stop .
The negotiators told South African mediators and MDC representatives Biti would be allowed to return home safely after nearly two months in South Africa .
Tsvangirai was twice stopped by police as he tried to campaign yesterday .
His party said he was first held for about two hours , then detained again late into the night before being released .
The detentions are the latest examples of harassment and intimidation ahead of the elections , human rights groups claim .
Tsvangirai won the first round with 47.9 % of the vote , compared with 43.2 % for Mugabe .
Recent statements by the military leadership and Mugabe 's wife , Grace , suggest he has no intention of leaving office after the vote .
US diplomats said 20 tonnes of American food aid heading to Zimbabwean children had been seized by authorities last week and given to Mugabe supporters at a rally .
"" This is a government that is taking tremendous and , frankly , awful strides to maintain its power , that is increasingly abusing its own citizens and has raised , or should I say lowered , the bar to a level that we rarely see , "" the US state department spokesman Gonzalo Gallegos said in Washington yesterday .
The White House press secretary , Dana Perino , urged the UN security council "" to prevent further deterioration of the region 's humanitarian and security situation "" .
The council is divided over what to do and whether to hold an open debate , said the US ambassador Zalmay Khalilzad , who holds the council 's rotating presidency this month .
The UN is sending Haile Menkerios , a diplomat and former Eritrean ambassador , to Zimbabwe next week to discuss the political situation and elections ."
2008-06-17,"Robert Mugabe has threatened to arrest opposition leaders he accused of supporting mounting election violence , Zimbabwean state radio reported .
Campaigning in the central Kadoma district yesterday , Mugabe said Morgan Tsvangirai and other leaders of the Movement for Democratic Change were condoning "" arson and violence across the country "" .
Human rights groups say it is Mugabe 's police , soldiers and party militants who have orchestrated widespread violence aimed at ensuring he wins a June 27 presidential run - off .
Mugabe 's comments were followed today by the publication in the state - controlled Herald newspaper of a vow from the president not to cede power whatever the result of the run - off election .
The 84-year - old Zimbabwean leader told the paper : "" We shed a lot of blood for this country .
We are not going to give up our country for a mere X on a ballot .
How can a ballpoint pen fight with a gun ? ""
The remarks came as a UN special envoy , Haile Menkerios , arrived in the Zimbabwean capital of Harare to discuss the country 's political crisis .
The UN secretary general , Ban Ki - moon , has said that 400 election observers are to be sent to Zimbabwe for the presidential run - off to ensure a fair vote .
The British prime minister , Gordon Brown , yesterday warned that international election observers must be allowed to monitor the run - off or risk having Mugabe 's regime hijack the election . ""
[ Mugabe 's ] criminal cabal ... threatens to make a mockery of free and fair elections in Zimbabwe , "" Brown said .
Mugabe 's supporters have waged a campaign of harassment against the opposition prior to the second round of voting .
The opposition party 's secretary general , Tendai Biti , remains in custody in the notoriously harsh police jail in western Harare , his lawyer said today .
Biti did not make a scheduled appearance in court yesterday on treason charges .
His lawyer , Lewis Uriri , said police had added two extra charges under the security laws : insulting the president and making statements intended to bring about disaffection in the police and security forces .
The Matapi police station jail , in the western township of Mbare , has a reputation for dirty and harsh conditions used to intimidate suspects in custody .
Uriri said Biti was initially denied a blanket in freezing night - time temperatures .
Family members were eventually allowed to provide a blanket , fresh clothing and food during the weekend , the lawyer said .
The MDC said Biti 's arrest and continued detainment without charge was "" politically motivated "" and a part of "" malicious "" attempts by Mugabe "" to frustrate the election campaign of the MDC "" .
Human rights groups have expressed mounting concern at a concerted campaign of intimidation against government opponents less than two weeks before the run - off vote between the opposition leader , Morgan Tsvangirai , and Mugabe .
Since the first round of voting on March 29 , opposition supporters have been attacked and arrested and Tsvangirai 's attempts to campaign have been thwarted by police .
Tsvangirai has been detained at least six times since he began campaigning .
At least 66 opposition activists have been killed by the ruling Zanu - PF 's militia since the March elections , the MDC says , but Mugabe has blamed the opposition for the violence .
Tsvangirai defeated Mugabe in the March election but failed to win the absolute majority needed to avoid a run - off .
The MDC and many human rights groups have expressed doubt that Mugabe and Zanu - PF will hold a fair election ."
2008-06-18,"South Africa 's president , Thabo Mbeki , made a surprise trip to Zimbabwe today as the UN warned that 5 million people in the country faced starvation .
Mbeki 's visit was part of his efforts to mediate between Robert Mugabe and the opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai , who will contest a run - off presidential election on June 27 , a South African government spokesman said .
South African officials gave no more details about the trip , which was first reported in the Herald , a Zimbabwean government - sanctioned paper .
The Herald said Mugabe would meet Mbeki in Bulawayo , Zimbabwe 's second largest city , after addressing rallies in Gwanda and Beitbridge .
Mugabe has come under increasing criticism for a campaign of violence against the Zimbabwean opposition aimed at ensuring he wins the election , after losing to Tsvangirai in the first round in March .
In Rome , the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation and the World Food Programme said in a joint report that an estimated 2 million people in Zimbabwe faced hunger between next month and September .
That figure is projected to rise to 3.8 million people later in the year and reach about 5.1 million between January and March 2009 .
With inflation at more than 100,000 % in Zimbabwe , people increasingly struggle to buy basic food .
The UN report said Zimbabwe was expected to produce 575,000 tonnes of maize in this year 's harvest , a 28 % drop on 12 months ago .
Also today , the UN in Geneva announced that one of its workers had been expelled from Zimbabwe .
Louise Arbour , the UN high commissioner for human rights , told reporters her staff member went to the Zimbabwean capital , Harare , on Sunday to meet UN workers and to help aid groups there .
The official was expelled yesterday – the same day a UN special envoy met Mugabe .
Arbour did not give a reason for the expulsion or identify the official . ""
Unfortunately , it seems to fit a pattern of the government taking a very uncooperative attitude "" toward international humanitarian staff , she said .
In a speech before the South African parliament last week , Mbeki said his priority was to help Zimbabwe find answers through dialogue and negotiation , rather than imposing a solution from abroad .
That has been his stance for more than a year , since other regional leaders appointed him to mediate in Zimbabwe 's crisis .
Other African leaders , though , have said quiet diplomacy is failing .
Kenya 's prime minister , Raila Odinga , addressing reporters in Washington yesterday , urged world leaders to pressure Mugabe to step down , and called the run - off a "" complete sham "" ."
2008-06-22,"Morgan Tsvangirai is often described as a brave and charismatic man , qualities that have stood him in good stead as he has suffered beatings and assassination attempts while battling to unseat Robert Mugabe .
But the opposition leader 's dramatic withdrawal from the presidential runoff yesterday marked a change from his earlier defiant certainty that democracy would eventually triumph over dictatorship , despite Mugabe 's "" political thuggery "" in the elections .
Tsvangirai has often articulated the difficulties in his country : "" Democracy is an orphan in Zimbabwe , "" he wrote in the Guardian in April . ""
Since the infamous universal declaration of independence in 1965 made by the white government of Ian Smith in what was then Rhodesia - in an effort to block the extension of suffrage to the country 's black majority - the cry of democracy has been ignored .
Mugabe 's 28-year rule has similarly undermined the development of institutional democracy . ""
Tsvangirai , 56 , is the son of a bricklayer and the eldest of nine children , and had little formal education .
A mine worker who joined Mugabe 's then popular and victorious Zanu - PF party on independence from Britain in 1980 , he rose to become secretary - general of the powerful Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions , later leading it away from its alliance with the ruling party .
In 1997 , he led a series of strikes that forced Mugabe to cancel tax increases to pay for war veterans ' pensions .
A year later he narrowly escaped being thrown out of his 10th - floor office window by a group of veterans .
Tsvangirai founded the Movement for Democratic Change ( MDC ) in 1999 , but lost the 2002 presidential election to Zanu - PF amid allegations that Mugabe had rigged the polls .
In 2004 , he was acquitted of treason for an alleged plot to assassinate Mugabe in the run up to the 2002 race , the prosecution 's case resting on the testimony of a shadowy consultant who allegedly taped the MDC leader asking him to arrange Mugabe 's assassination .
Tsvangirai 's lawyers said the tape was doctored .
Last year he was beaten again , pictures of his badly swollen face enhancing his reputation for defiance in the face of official brutality .
Early this month Tsvangirai was detained and accused of threatening public security by addressing a gathering without prior authorisation .
Not for the first time , he faced criticism yesterday that he had been naive and
that by withdrawing from the race he had made it harder to carry on resisting Mugabe .
Some also attacked him for authoritarian tendencies within the MDC .
But he has long argued that others needed to do more to tackle Zimbabwe 's crisis .
"" How can global leaders espouse the values of democracy , yet when they are being challenged fail to open their mouths ? ""
Tsvangirai asked in his Guardian article .
"" Why is it that a supposed ' war on terror ' ignores the very real terror of broken minds and mangled bodies that lie along the trail left by Mugabe ? """
2008-06-22,"Zimbabwe 's opposition leader , Morgan Tsvangirai , has pulled out of the presidential run - off against Robert Mugabe saying he will no longer participate in "" this violent , illegitimate sham of an election process "" .
Tsvangirai , head of the Movement for Democratic Change ( MDC ) , announced his decision at a news conference in Zimbabwe 's capital as ruling party militants blockaded the site of an opposition rally .
Citing political violence , he said a free and fair poll on Friday would be impossible and called on the United Nations and the African Union to intervene to stop "" genocide "" in the former British colony .
Tonight South Africa 's President Thabo Mbeki said he would encourage Mugabe and Tsvangirai to meet to discuss Zimbabwe 's political crisis .
"" From our point of view it is still necessary that the political leadership of Zimbabwe should get together and find a solution to the challenges that face Zimbabwe , "" Mbeki told South African public broadcaster SABC .
"" I would hope that that leadership would be open to a process which would result in them coming to some agreement about what happens to their country .
And that most certainly is what we would try to encourage "" Earlier Tsvangirai told reporters in Harare : "" We in the MDC have resolved that we will no longer participate in this violent , illegitimate sham of an election process . ""
Conditions as of today do not permit the holding of a credible poll . ""
Given the totality of these circumstances , we believe a credible election is impossible .
We ca n't ask the people to cast their vote on June 27 when that vote will cost their lives .
We will no longer participate in this violent sham of an election . ""
On June 27 , Mugabe has declared war , and we will not be part of that war .
Our victory is certain , but it can only be delayed . ""
Tsvangirai said that by Wednesday he would release new proposals on how to take the country forward but did not provide any details about what his plans would include .
His decision follows a campaign of brutality in which independent human rights groups estimate 85 people have died and thousands have been evacuated from their homes .
The opposition leader himself has been detained by police five times while campaigning and he says at least 70 MDC members have been murdered .
Patrick Chinamasa , justice minister for Mugabe 's ruling Zanu - PF party , dismissed Tsvangirai 's reasons for a withdrawal from the poll , claiming the widespread violence is being stoked by the MDC and its international supporters .
"" It 's not true that it 's due to political violence because it is his party that has been instigating violence .
The situation on the ground is now very supportive of us and Tsvangirai knows he faces certain defeat , "" he said in an interview with Reuters .
Tsvangirai beat Mugabe in an earlier March 29 poll , but his failure to win an absolute majority triggered a run - off vote .
He had planned an afternoon address to the rally today as his main campaign event before the run - off on Friday .
But , according to the MDC , militants disrupted the rally , beating opposition supporters who were trying to reach it .
The MDC said in a statement that youth militia loyal to Mugabe had attacked the rally , beating journalists and forcing election observers to flee .
"" Thousands of Zanu - PF youth militia , armed with iron bars , sticks and other weapons , have attacked journalists and forced election observer teams to flee from the venue of the MDC scheduled rally .
Police are firing teargas , "" it said .
In a statement yesterday Tsvangirai had urged his supporters not to be intimidated and to go out and vote on Friday .
Responding to Tsvangirai 's withdrawal announcement , the US called for the Zimbabwe government and "" its thugs "" to stop violence . ""
The government of Zimbabwe and its thugs must stop the violence now , "" said Carlton Carroll , a White House assistant press secretary .
"" All parties should be able to participate in a legitimate election and not be subject to the intimidation and unlawful actions of the government , armed militias and so - called war veterans , "" he added .
Analysts questioned Tsvangirai 's decision to pull out , suggesting it could give succour to Mugabe at a time when international pressure was mounting .
Tom Cargill , Africa expert for foreign affairs thinktank Chatham House , told Reuters : "" It means Robert Mugabe is the legitimate president of Zimbabwe as far as the legal position is concerned .
It will make it harder for regional leaders to press him because he can claim his position is on the basis of the constitution . ""
They [ the MDC ] have been weakened by this .
They 've made some very bad strategic decisions in the past and their credibility is under question in the region . """
2008-06-22,"The opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai yesterday pulled out of this week 's presidential election in Zimbabwe , saying he is not prepared to ask people to die by voting for him , and accusing Robert Mugabe of "" waging a war against the people "" .
The Movement for Democratic Change leadership met and decided to withdraw from what it called a "" violent , illegitimate sham of an election "" amid the murders by the ruling Zanu - PF militia and security forces of 100 opposition activists , the torture and rape of thousands of MDC supporters , and a state - orchestrated campaign of terror across swathes of the country . ""
Mugabe has declared war , and we will not be part of that war , "" the opposition leader said .
The British , American and French governments immediately denounced the Mugabe regime for the collapse of the elections , and the crisis will move to the UN security council today as the international community considers new sanctions against the Zanu - PF leadership .
"" If Mugabe thinks this finishes it , he 's in for a big surprise .
He has united the world against him , "" Mark Malloch Brown , the foreign office minister for Africa , Asia and the UN , told the Guardian .
The White House added : "" The government of Zimbabwe and its thugs must stop the violence now . ""
In his statement , Tsvangirai said he had little choice but to withdraw : "" The militia , war veterans and even Mugabe himself have made it clear that anyone that votes for me in the forthcoming election faces the very real possibility of being killed .
"" We in the MDC can not ask them to cast their vote on June 27 when that vote could cost them their lives .
We believe a credible election , which reflects the will of the people , is impossible . ""
Zimbabwe 's justice minister , Patrick Chinamasa , said that if Tsvangirai writes to the electoral commission formally declaring he has pulled out , then the election will be called off and Mugabe declared president again .
But the decision as to whether to cancel Friday 's poll is likely to be political , as Mugabe weighs up whether he should declare himself winner by default , or press ahead with the ballot in the hope it will offer him a degree of legitimacy after losing the first round to Tsvangirai in March .
On Saturday , Tsvangirai said he was opposed to withdrawing from the vote .
The party 's national election director , Ian Makone , was also against pulling out , saying it would hand victory to Mugabe .
But Makone said the leadership was swayed by the view of party officials on the ground that they could no longer in good conscience ask people to vote when it would put them in danger . ""
Listening to the grass roots was the tipping point : that here we 've got the bullet versus the ballot .
The biggest problem was going to be deploying polling agents .
Persuading youngsters to lay down their lives was not an easy thing to do , "" he said .
Tsvangirai listed reasons "" why a free and fair election is impossible "" .
Police were "" reduced to bystanders while Zanu - PF militia commit crimes against humanity varying from rape , torture , murder , arson , abductions and other atrocities "" .
The MDC leader also accused the ruling party of "" spearheading a terror campaign in rural and urban areas "" , and Mugabe 's security cabinet and state intelligence of overseeing it .
He said that "" death and hit squads are on the loose in all provinces "" .
The MDC leader said his party structures have been "" decimated "" with the arrest of one of its top figures on treason charges , Tendai Biti , the secretary general , and detention of hundreds of other officials .
"" Over 2,000 MDC supporters including our polling agents are in illegal detention .
The arrests have targeted members of parliament , councillors , the MDC structures and election agents .
Over 200,000 people have been internally displaced .
The whole game is designed to cripple the MDC campaign , "" he said .
Tsvangirai also accused the government of crippling his campaign by banning rallies and repeatedly arresting him , and the state media of conduction an unprecedented campaign of "" hate and vilification "" against him .
Hours before the announcement , Zanu - PF militia prevented Tsvangirai from holding a rally in Harare by chasing away and beating opposition supporters .
Hundreds of Zanu - PF supporters arrived by bus and on foot to occupy open ground where the rally was to be held .
As southern African election monitors looked on , thugs grabbed MDC supporters and beat them .
Three men were forced to lie on the ground and hit brutally and repeatedly over a period of several hours .
The monitors said it was "" not their job "" to intervene .
Asked if by pulling out he was not handing Mugabe victory on a plate , Tsvangirai said that Zimbabwe 's president had never had any intention of conceding defeat .
Justice minister Chinamasa accused Tsvangirai of lying about the violence .
List of intimidation Morgan Tsvangirai 's statement alleges : · Police act as bystanders while Zanu - PF militia commit rape , torture , murder , abductions and other atrocies .
· Militia in army outfits spearhead Zanu - PF in rural and urban areas .
· Armed youths vow the Movement for Democratic Change will never rule . ·
3,000 militia bases intimidate MDC supporters into submission .
· Death squads roam in all provinces .
· Zanu - PF war veterans and youths man illegal roadblocks .
· More than 2,000 MDC are in illegal detention , especially MPs and leaders ."
2008-06-22,"Robert Mugabe has said all along that he regards this week 's presidential run - off vote not so much as an election as a war .
Yesterday his opponents , bloodied and in retreat , made what they regard as a strategic withdrawal by saying they "" will no longer play Mugabe 's game "" by participating in an election that gets bloodier by the day .
The Movement for Democratic Change hopes its pull - out will strip Mugabe of any lingering legitimacy as president , as even his former protectors in the region blow the whistle on what the MDC candidate , Morgan Tsvangirai , called a "" violent , illegitimate sham of an election "" .
Tsvangirai has a way of changing his mind , but if he sticks to this decision then the next move is down to Mugabe .
Zimbabwe 's president could call off the ballot and declare himself re - elected by default .
That has its attractions for the ruling Zanu - PF party .
Although it is clear that the military - run campaign of violence has taken a heavy toll on the opposition , with large numbers of its supporters saying they are too scared to vote or terrorised into casting their ballots for Zanu - PF , the ruling party can not be sure that it has done enough to overturn the combined opposition vote from the first round of elections .
There is also the danger for Zanu - PF that anger and desperation in a country with hyperinflation , few jobs and mass hunger would overcome fear at the ballot box .
But there are incentives for Mugabe to press ahead with the vote .
If the first - round result stands , then Tsvangirai won by 48 % to Mugabe 's 43 % , undermining the Zimbabwean president 's claim that he has popular support for extending his 28-year rule .
If Zanu - PF believes enough people can be terrorised , that could produce a substantial enough turnout and a result in Mugabe 's favour , sufficient for him to try and brazen out whatever dissent may come from regional leaders if , as looks increasingly likely , African election observers declare the poll a farce .
It will also strengthen Mugabe 's claim to remain president if he is unable to resist pressure to form a power - sharing government .
Tsvangirai said the MDC will decide in the coming days what to do next and make a public announcement on Wednesday .
The party is looking for backing from the African Union and the region 's governments .
Ian Makone , the MDC 's national election director , initially opposed withdrawing from the election but said he was persuaded in part by threats to the lives of the polling agents he was sending to rural areas .
He said his party 's next step will in part be decided by how the region reacts .
"" It remains to be seen what the various observers say , but all the indications received so far are that they will say this is a sham of an election with no credibility , and we hope they stick to that position , "" he said .
Tsvangirai said the challenge is not how to form a unity government - although his party has ruled out serving under Mugabe - but how to manage the transition to genuinely free elections .
Makone said that whatever Mugabe decides , he will not be able to govern .
For a start , the MDC has won a majority of seats in parliament , forcing Zanu - PF into opposition for the first time since independence in 1980 .
"" We 've got a parliamentary working majority and if Mugabe thinks he can run a government and ignore Morgan [ Tsvangirai ] he has another think coming , unless he thinks he can rule by decree , "" said Makone .
"" This decision to pull out is not the end of the road .
The struggle continues . """
2008-06-22,"The Movement for Democratic Change was to meet tomorrow to make what had been hailed as the most pivotal decision in its history : whether to continue with the electoral race .
But it did n't get there .
With the weeks leading up to the election run - off next Friday marred by violence and brutality - in which independent human rights groups estimated 85 people have been killed , Morgan Tsvangirai this afternoon pulled out of the run - off calling it a ' ' violent , illegitimate sham of an election process '' .
While his decision may lead to a temporary halt in the bloodshed in Zimbabwe , it leaves the nation 's people unable to express their pain at the ballot box .
The conditions , Tsvangirai said , meant a credible election was impossible .
It was not so much an election as a war said Chris McGreal in the Observer .
Jacob Mafume from the Crisis in Zimbabwe Coalition says the MDC was left with no choice but to pull out . ""
The MDC had no option .
The brutality is too much .
It 's now time for the regional leadership to show leadership on the issue . ""
In a news conference to declare his decision held in Harare this afternoon , Tsvangirai called on the UN to stop the genocide .
Many believe the international consensus deploring Mugabe 's actions is growing and sanctions have been threatened .
After the announcement today , Brian Raftopolous , a political analyst for the Zimbabwe Institute said Tsvangirai 's move could lead to diplomatic isolation for Zimbabwe .
But Patrick Chinamasa , the Zimbabwean justice minister , disputed the level of violence in the region .
"" There 's no genocide taking place anywhere , justifying any intervention .
He 's [ Tsvangirai ] only saying that to bring foreign intervention in this country . ""
Wilf Mbanga the founder and editor of the independent newspaper
, The Zimbabwean said Zimbabwean people had sensed Mugabe was a "" wounded animal "" and there had been a new found hope in the country .
But today , from his self - imposed exile in the UK , he said : "" What 's the point in taking part ?
Mugabe has already said he will not accept defeat .
"" They are a lawless government .
If Morgan had taken part in that election it would have legitimised that process .
It 's better that he pulls out . ""
However , in an interesting footnote , Tom Cargill said that while today 's developments have undermined the MDC , Tsvangirai standing down could be a catalyst for Mugabe retiring .
"" Mugabe 's aura of invincibility has still been destroyed by the election , within the region and to some extent in Zimbabwe . ""
That myth has now gone , so that undermines his position . ' '
But bizarrely there is a train of thought that this helps in the transition in that he knows he wants to retire but will only go from a position from strength . """
2008-06-22,"The decision was an impossible one , taken in murderous times .
Over several weeks , it had become obvious that Morgan Tsvangirai would simply not be allowed to win the second round of Zimbabwe 's presidential election , which had been set for Friday .
Taking part would lend dignity to a contest that had become , in his words yesterday , "" a violent , illegitimate sham "" .
But the only alternative was pulling out , and allowing President Robert Mugabe to claim instant triumph .
Yesterday Mr Tsvangirai 's Movement for Democratic Change ( MDC ) decided the second option was the lesser evil , and he announced he was quitting the race .
Making that call was excruciating because it killed any lingering hope that Mr Mugabe 's tyrannical rule might be ended by the ballot box .
Free expression and the rule of law had been under sustained assault for more than a decade , but - despite irregularities - the results from the March 29 presidential poll showed Mr Tsvangirai ahead , giving reason to hope the flame of democracy was still flickering .
Ever since , Mr Mugabe has used state power to snuff it out .
Despite his healthy lead , Mr Tsvangirai was 2 % short of an outright majority , at least according to official returns , so a second round was required .
That gave Mugabe 's Zanu - PF a window of opportunity in which to beat the country into submission .
Literally and metaphorically , the opportunity was taken , as Guardian reporting has shown .
Whole villages have been warned at gunpoint against voting MDC , particularly in provinces such as Manicaland , which deserted Mr Mugabe in March .
Politically motivated arson is alleged , as is politically inspired rape .
At least 70 MDC activists have been murdered .
An iron grip over the police allowed Zanu - PF to prevent the MDC from campaigning by seizing vehicles and personnel alike .
Mr Tsvangirai has been arrested five times , and the party 's general secretary Tendai Biti is being detained on a cooked - up capital charge .
An MDC rally scheduled for Harare yesterday was banned by the police .
On Saturday the courts overruled them .
In the end , though , the courts were overruled by gangs of Zanu - PF thugs carrying bars , who turned up and made sure the event could not happen , meting out injuries in the process .
For all the intimidation , the MDC might have gambled on hope winning out over fear if the vote had been scrutinised .
In the first round there were independent election observers , domestic civil society organisations provided 10,000 monitors , giving a check on returns .
But after much delay , only 500 licenses were handed out for such observers this time .
Neither they nor the few hundred being admitted from abroad stood any chance of scrutinising proceedings in 9,000 polling stations .
Mr Mugabe has claimed only God will remove him , hubris that may be reinforced now the ballot box can not do the trick .
His party lost no time in claiming the MDC was running scared of voters , but the whole world knows yesterday was a triumph for terror .
In a fair fight , the regime that destroyed agriculture and banned food aid would be rejected by a hungry population .
The regime may not need its people 's support , and so can continue to punish them .
But it does need South Africa for electricity , and other supplies from its neighbours .
They have been slow to condemn Mr Mugabe , owing a shared anti - imperial past .
But in recent days the Angolan president and the Tanzanian foreign minister have spoken up .
Now Mr Mugabe will lack the fig leaf of even a claimed election victory , and his reputation could suffer further .
The South African president has been shamefully complicit in Mr Mugabe 's survival , but , facing resistance from within his own party , had started manoeuvring for a delay in the Zimbabwean poll even before yesterday .
A wind of change blowing through southern Africa might - just - still finish Mr Mugabe , with or without help from God ."
2008-06-23,"The UN condemned Zimbabwe last night for intimidation and called for the presidential vote due on Friday to be scrapped .
A draft security council resolution placed the blame for the withdrawal of the opposition leader , Morgan Tsvangirai , on the Mugabe government , accusing it of "" a campaign of violence "" that had "" denied its political opponents the right to campaign freely "" .
The UN secretary general , Ban Ki - moon , spoke out against the government 's actions in strong terms .
He said Tsvangirai had been right to withdraw , and free elections would not now be possible .
"" There has been too much violence , too much intimidation , "" Ban said .
He added that if Friday 's vote went ahead , it "" would only deepen divisions within the country and produce a result that can not be credible "" .
Ban 's intervention and the security council draft statement marked a sharp increase in pressure on Mugabe 's government , and opened the door for the first time to direct UN involvement in the crisis .
The draft council statement went one step further , saying the results of the first round of elections in March , which the opposition Movement for Democratic Change won , "" must be respected "" , and called on the government to cooperate with international mediation efforts .
Urgent negotiations were also under way last night between the UN , the African Union and southern African leaders on the creation of a mediation team to send to Zimbabwe .
If agreement is reached , a joint team with representatives of the UN , the AU and the Southern African Development Community ( SADC ) would assume the mediator role until now played by the South African president , Thabo Mbeki , alone .
There were reports that Mbeki will head to Zimbabwe today for a last ditch attempt to encourage dialogue between the antagonists , though the South African authorities did not confirm this .
The UN moves represent diplomatic victories for Britain , the US and France , who spent much of yesterday lobbying other world powers not to recognise Mugabe 's continued presidency .
"" The international community must send a powerful and united message : that we will not recognise the fraudulent election rigging and the violence and intimidation of a criminal and discredited cabal , "" Gordon Brown told parliament .
In the next two days , the leaders of Angola , Tanzania and Swaziland , who take a lead role in security issues in SADC , are due to meet in the Angolan capital , Luanda .
The meeting suggests some of the group may be ready to act without Mbeki , who has emerged as Mugabe 's protector on the continent .
The AU yesterday signalled that it was prepared to take action .
The chairman of the AU commission , Jean Ping , said : "" One of the preconditions is that this violence against the people must be stopped . ""
Tsvangirai 's withdrawal and "" the increasing acts of violence in the run - up to the second round of the presidential election are a matter of grave concern "" , Ping said .
AU officials were seeking to agree a common approach before an African summit at Sharm el - Sheikh in Egypt this week .
The joint UN - AU - SADC team being negotiated yesterday would seek to hammer out agreement between Mugabe and the MDC for a national unity government , or else move for new elections .
Tanzania and Kenya suggest new elections could be overseen by AU or Sadc peacekeepers .
Kofi Annan , the former UN secretary general , who led a successful mediation mission to Kenya earlier this year , backed a similar initiative .
"" The situation in Zimbabwe imposes a grave responsibility on the AU and the UN , which they should assume , "" Annan said in a statement .
"" Zimbabwe can not do it alone . ""
Britain focused its diplomatic efforts on convincing other capitals that the MDC be treated as the only entity with political legitimacy .
"" Our objectives are to get in every forum possible a recognition that today President Mugabe no longer remains the proper , rightful leader of the country , "" Mark Malloch - Brown , the Foreign Office minister , told reporters .
The US secretary of state , Condoleezza Rice , also stepped up the pressure , saying Mugabe 's government could no longer be considered legitimate ."
2008-06-23,"The UN security council last night warned Robert Mugabe that a free and fair election in Zimbabwe was "" impossible "" , after the opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai quit the presidential race and sought refuge in the Dutch embassy in Harare amid escalating violence .
As Mugabe 's forces kept up their assault on the opposition , raiding the opposition Movement for Democratic Change 's HQ and hauling away scores of people sheltering from abductions , beatings and worse , the security council unanimously adopted a statement condemning the government 's "" campaign of violence "" that had "" denied its political opponents the right to campaign freely "" .
It was the security council 's first formal action on the crisis .
South Africa , Mugabe 's strongest regional backer , had hitherto blocked UN involvement in the crisis , but it agreed to the statement , a move described as significant by British diplomats .
The UN secretary general , Ban Ki - moon , said earlier that proceeding with Friday 's run - off ballot "" will only deepen divisions within the country and produce a result that can not be credible "" .
But the ruling Zanu - PF said the election would go ahead regardless despite Tsvangirai 's withdrawal , while Mugabe repeated threats to pursue his opponents after the ballot .
He warned he held the MDC responsible for the violence , and said the government would pursue those it regarded as responsible for the country 's economic collapse , including white businessmen . ""
Sooner or later we are going to accuse the MDC leadership of being vicariously responsible for the violence , "" he said .
Tsvangirai won the first round of elections in March , but withdrew from the run - off saying he could not ask people to die voting for him .
His move has intensified foreign criticism of Mugabe .
Earlier , Gordon Brown told parliament that governments should not recognise an election rigged "" by a criminal and discredited cabal "" .
The US said that without a fair election a Mugabe victory on Friday could not be seen as legitimate .
The African Union said Tsvangirai 's withdrawal from the race and the violence was a "" matter of grave concern "" although the organisation fell short of attributing responsibility to Zanu - PF .
The condemnations did little to curb the violence .
Many of the people taken away from the MDC 's headquarters by armed police in riot gear were women and children , families of MDC activists and officials , such as councillors .
The police said people were removed from the offices in Harare for "" health reasons "" .
Violence proliferated elsewhere .
The MDC said one of its MPs , Thamsanqa Mahlangu , was critically ill in hospital after being attacked by Zanu - PF on his way to a rally in Harare on Sunday .
The rally was to be addressed by Tsvangirai , but was called off after thousands of armed Zanu - PF supporters occupied the venue and attacked people .
Last night , Lord Ashdown said military intervention could be necessary if the situation worsened .
Zimbabwe , he told the Times , "" could deteriorate to a point where genocide could be a possible outcome - something that looks like Rwanda "" .
Tsvangirai fled to the Dutch embassy within hours of withdrawing from the presidential race on Sunday .
MDC sources said there was concern the government would arrest him or target him for assassination .
Until Tsvangirai pulled out , he was afforded a degree of protection as a presidential candidate .
Zanu - PF attacked or arrested many other senior MDC officials , including the secretary general , Tendai Biti , in jail on trumped - up treason charges .
But Zanu - PF needed to allow Tsvangirai to remain free , even if it detained him for brief periods to wreck his political rallies , to maintain the illusion of a fair election .
The Dutch embassy is one of the few in Harare which offers relative neutrality .
Tsvangirai could not go to the British or US missions because it would be used by Zanu - PF to reinforce the claim that he is a tool of the "" imperialists "" .
Diplomats said that the South Africans and most African embassies would not want him ; neither would the Chinese .
Zanu - PF said the presidential election would go ahead .
The justice minister , Patrick Chinamasa , described Tsvangirai 's withdrawal as an attempt to "" hoodwink "" Mugabe 's supporters .
"" Zanu - PF is not treating the threats seriously ; it is a nullity .
We are proceeding with our campaign to romp to victory on Friday , "" he said .
"" Tsvangirai went into the election thinking that it was a sprint , and was not prepared for a marathon and wants to avoid defeat .
He spent his time globe - trotting and gallivanting in Europe and left MDC supporters without leadership . ""
Zanu - PF exploited the opportunity and campaigned vigorously for victory .
When [ Tsvangirai ] returned , he realised that the tables had turned against him . ""
The Zimbabwe government continues to blame the MDC for the violence . ""
The MDC and its western masters are waging a war on us , and we have been forced to adopt a defensive position to safeguard our political independence and national sovereignty , "" Chinamasa said .
Tsvangirai told South African radio yesterday that he was still prepared to negotiate a political solution with the government , but first there must be peace .
He said : "" We are prepared to negotiate with Zanu - PF , but of course it is important that certain principles must be accepted before the negotiation takes place .
For instance , one of the preconditions is that the violence against the people must stop . ""
The MDC has said it is prepared to share power but that- as Tsvangirai won the first round of elections , and the party forced Zanu - PF into opposition in parliament for the first time since independence in 1980 - Mugabe must relinquish office .
His ally , President Eduardo dos Santos of Angola , urged the Zimbabwean leader to end "" all acts of intimidation and violence "" .
The Southern African Development Community election monitors are also privately saying that there is no way they will be able to endorse the election as legitimate , and they blame Mugabe .
But it remains to be seen whether they will voice such criticism in public ."
2008-06-23,"Recently a frustrated Morgan Tsvangirai , leader of the Zimbabwean opposition , wrote to tell the South African president , Thabo Mbeki , that "" there will be no country left "" in Zimbabwe by the time Mbeki finishes mediating between Robert Mugabe and Tsvangirai 's Movement for Democratic Change .
Tsvangirai was of course referring to Mbeki 's duplicity in his role as the Southern African Development Community 's official mediator between the Zimbabwean parties .
Mbeki favours Mugabe and the ruing Zanu - PF .
When pressed about the letter , Mbeki characteristically insisted that it had never arrived .
And rather than replying , Mbeki wrote to the American president , George Bush , instead , telling Bush "" in a text packed with exclamation points "" , that official US government criticisms of Mugabe were off the mark .
Mbeki , in what could also be interpreted as his first unambiguous public endorsement of Mugabe 's violent regime , charged that the Americans were "" disrespecting the views of the Zimbabwean people "" and should "" butt out , that Africa belongs to [ Mbeki ] . ""
Of course , since then Tsvangirai has pulled out of the Zimbabwean elections and Mbeki has been to Zimbabwe again , where he met with Mugabe last week .
This visit is in contrast to his behaviour , 10 days into the murderous pogrom against black immigrants to South Africa ( among them Zimbabweans fleeing the political and economic crises in their country ) , when Mbeki could only muster up a rote statement from the air - conditioned comfort of a TV studio .
A total of 62 people were murdered and thousands left homeless in the xenophobic violence .
And then Mbeki promptly left on a state visit to Japan .
Since then Mbeki has not once been out to one of the affected areas .
But he found time to visit Mugabe .
Reviewing the events of the last few weeks reminded me of the insights of the Nigerian writer and Nobel Laureate , Wole Soyinka , upon meeting Thabo Mbeki .
As Soyinka recounts it in his memoir You Must Set Forth at Dawn , he first met Mbeki at a dinner in honour of Nelson Mandela – Soyinka 's "" favourite avatar "" – in Paris , right after Mandela was released from an apartheid jail after 27 years .
The dinner was the "" most expensive "" that Soyinka ever attended .
The French president François Mitterand played host .
A small entourage accompanied Mandela , including the two men jostling to be his presumptive heir – Thabo Mbeki , who in the resistance movement 's exile was the right - hand man to Mandela 's predecessor Oliver Tambo , and Cyril Ramaphosa , who would lead the ANC in constitutional negotiations with the apartheid government .
The events of the dinner would be unremarkable , amounting to nothing more than a color piece , if not for Soyinka 's insights of Thabo Mbeki , who is now South Africa 's president .
At that time , black townships around Johannesburg and in Kwazulu - Natal province on the country 's east coast were engulfed by political violence , the result of a state - sponsored proxy war by Mangosuthu Buthelezi 's Inkatha Freedom party against members of Mandela 's African National Congress .
Soyinka , while acknowledging that Buthelezi was an unscrupulous and ethically challenged politician , reasoned that that since "" the chief "" had a large following , he needed to be recognised and engaged with – and that Mandela should personally meet with him .
So did Mandela and Ramaphosa ( Soyinka describes Ramaphosa 's manner as "" more accommodating "" ) .
The same can not be said for "" an unsmiling "" Thabo Mbeki , who said : "" It is not possible to hold a dialogue with that kind of person . ""
Mbeki could hardly pronounce Buthelezi 's name "" without his smallish , nearly triangular face expunging all expression , leaving only the hardness of his eyes . ""
( OK , even I agree that perhaps here Soyinka went a bit over the top with this description . )
Mbeki interjected a few more times , repeating his objections , what Soyinka likened to a "" a party - line diktat "" .
As Soyinka left the dinner , he summed up his impressions : "" Even the body language of the two – Thabo Mbeki and Nelson Mandela – spoke volumes , and the contrast read out a stark warning . """
2008-06-23,"While Morgan Tsvangirai 's decision to withdraw from a "" violent , illegitimate sham of an election "" ( Reports , June 23 ) is understandable , the decision will set a dangerous precedent .
Opposition parties throughout Africa , especially in Kenya , Nigeria , Democratic Republic of Congo , Uganda and Ethiopia , where violence has accompanied rigged elections , could also boycott future elections , potentially making the use of violence the only means of changing governments .
The UK and other donor countries should not focus on Robert Mugabe as the only problem in Africa .
It took centuries for British democracy to take root .
It is too much to expect Zimbabwe and the rest of Africa to fully embrace western liberal democracy in just 50 years .
Democracy can not take root and flourish without other democratic institutions .
More emphasis needs to be put on establishing independent judiciaries , state security forces and civil services , and an electoral commission in Africa .
Sam Akaki London
The idea that Morgan Tsvangirai is somehow "" handing victory "" to Robert Mugabe is surely the opposite of the truth .
It 's the only decision that makes sense , not only because it might stop some of the brutality inflicted on MDC supporters , but also in that it removes any remaining fig leaf of legality from Mugabe .
The idea that the solution to Zimbabwe 's problems could still perhaps lie in some deal to create a government of national unity also represents hope over political reality .

Will the UK Borders Agency now revoke the deportation advice letters it has sent to hundreds of Zimbabwean failed asylum seekers - failed on often the most dubious of grounds ?
I know people who have attempted suicide , threatened as they are with being forcibly returned to a country where their fate will be detention , torture and death because they supported the MDC .
These acts by our government breach the refugee convention , the Human Rights Act and the European convention .
How can we deliver these innocent people to the tyrant Mugabe ?
Whose side are we on ?
Margaret Owen London Zake Mda ( Our quiet complicity , June 21 ) was a welcome relief from all the nonsense of President Mbeki 's claim that there is no crisis in Zimbabwe .
That Morgan Tsvangirai has now pulled out of the election graphically shows that the crisis will continue in spite of Mbeki 's foreign policy .
What Zimbabwe needs now is those with power in southern Africa to have the courage to put an end to Zanu - PF tyranny and brutality .
Ordinary Zimbabweans deserve better from the Southern African Community .

2008-06-23,"A British minister today called for "" global action "" to isolate Robert Mugabe 's regime following the collapse of presidential elections .
Lord Malloch - Brown , the Foreign Office minister for Africa , Asia and the UN , said : "" We deeply regret the people of Zimbabwe have been denied the opportunity to make their voice heard . ""
He pointed out that , despite Morgan Tsvangirai 's withdrawal from the presidential race , his Movement for Democratic Change had won parliamentary elections in March . ""
That does n't make Morgan Tsvangirai president , but nor does it make Robert Mugabe president , "" Malloch - Brown said .
"" Our objectives are to get in every forum possible a recognition that today President Mugabe no longer remains the proper rightful leader of the country , "" he added .
"" We do not accept the status quo .
We do not expect the international community to accept the status quo . ""
He said an important test of international resolve would be an African Union summit at the end of the week , where Mugabe 's fellow leaders would have to decide whether to invite him . ""
The African Union has clear conditions on not accepting any national president not democratically elected to take their seats , "" Malloch - Brown said .
The minister said that Britain was exploring a raft of sanctions on Zimbabwe 's political elite that did not worsen the plight of the poor , including travel bans and the freezing of bank accounts and bans on education abroad for the children of the country 's rulers .
Malloch - Brown played down expectations that today 's meeting of the UN security council on Zimbabwe would produce concrete results , but said that the EU would probably decide on a sanctions package by mid - July .
Malloch - Brown said that South Africa was "" the key to solving the issue "" and , in an apparent message to Thabo Mbeki , added : "" It is enormously important that South Africa throws its weight behind an internationally mediated solution that respects the rights of the people . """
2008-06-23,"Morgan Tsvangirai 's decision to pull out of Friday 's presidential run - off is disappointing , but not entirely unexpected .
Ever since the March 29 election and its bitterly contested results , opinion in Zimbabwe had been divided over whether or not the Movement for Democratic Change should be part of this second - round vote .
Tsvangirai will be criticised for withdrawing , but his MDC was damned if it did , damned if it did n't .
The MDC 's participation in the run - off would have made it harder to condemn the outcome , and Zanu - PF believed that MDC participation would effectively legitimise Mugabe .
But Tsvangirai 's exit is a propaganda coup for Zanu - PF , which will portray Tsvangirai as weak and vacillating .
Zanu - PF 's strategy of violence was aimed at ensuring a victory for Mugabe rather than forcing the MDC 's withdrawal .
But the state will make the most of the situation and claim Mugabe as an elected leader .
The likely first step after the election will be for Zanu - PF to start dismantling the MDC 's narrow parliamentary majority through legal challenges and harassment of its MPs .
Zanu - PF will undermine Tsvangirai 's credentials as leader of the MDC and as a future president .
The MDC has stated its reasons for withdrawing - state - sponsored violence ; inability to campaign , with the state preventing access to its supporters ; the destruction of its party structures ; Mugabe 's announcement that he would never relinquish power ; evidence of electoral manipulation ; and the politicisation of the Zimbabwe electoral commission .
Dozens , perhaps hundreds , of people have been killed since March , and tens of thousands have been forced out of their homes .
There is little doubt that Tsvangirai would have "" lost "" the presidential run - off , since the state controlled every aspect of the process .
But it is clear that Tsvangirai 's political survival depends upon convincing MDC supporters and outside observers that his withdrawal was necessary and politically astute .
If Tsvangirai fails to convince them that he made the right decision , he will sow the seeds of division within the MDC .
He will also have to map out a post run - off plan - centring on whether the MDC intends to continue as a formal opposition , or pursue a coalition with the government .
Both options are fraught with pitfalls .
The wider strategy is the struggle for international hearts and minds , and African hearts and minds in particular .
Tsvangirai is hoping that the growing criticism of Mugabe by some of the Southern African Development Community and African Union member states will coalesce into a global "" coalition of the concerned "" that will pressure Mugabe to step down or negotiate a transition to a handover of power .
The problem is that , while there is international condemnation of the Mugabe regime , there is no consensus on what should be done .
Britain , the EU and the US insist on tougher punitive measures against Zimbabwe 's leaders ; but the SADC , the AU and South Africa are not committed to this course .
What kind of intervention should take place ?
Humanitarian intervention to feed starving Zimbabweans ?
One based on the right to protection for civilians ?
Should pressure be put on both sides to negotiate a settlement ?
The MDC is desperate to ensure it has the backing of the international community ; Zanu - PF is keen to combat its growing isolation , and its strategy is to re - inaugurate Mugabe as soon as possible , thus compelling the African community to recognise him as president .
A divided opposition would immeasurably assist this process .

2008-06-23,"The terror that Robert Mugabe unleashed on his country reached a new peak yesterday .
A day after pulling out of the race , Morgan Tsvangirai sought refuge in the Dutch embassy in Harare .
Earlier , police raided his party 's headquarters and drove 30 people away in a bus , mainly women and children who had been sheltering there .
The fear of intimidation that once haunted the rural areas has now invaded Harare 's leafier suburbs .
Gangs of Zanu - PF activists come calling door to door , rounding up maids and gardeners for "" reorientation meetings "" .
Each night , state television carries lengthy videos of rallies where MDC voters recant their sins .
The campaign of intimidation that was once aimed at the second - tier activist for the Movement for Democratic Change has now been turned on everyone else .
There are growing cracks in the support that African heads of state once showed for a liberation hero .
Jean Ping , the African Union 's top diplomat was consulting with the AU chairman Jakaya Kiwete , the president of Tanzania .
Mr Ping called the withdrawal of the opposition candidate and the political violence matters of "" grave concern "" .
Angola and Zambia too were flexing their diplomatic muscles .
The Zambian president Levy Mwanawasa , current chairman of the Southern African Development Community ( SADC ) , called for the postponement of the runoff on Friday .
Each day , Thabo Mbeki , SADC 's designated mediator on Zimbabwe , is looking more isolated in his effort to shield his old friend Mr Mugabe from the outrage .
If Mr Mbeki 's private efforts are working , it is time for him to show some results .
Otherwise it might be inferred that quiet diplomacy is a cover for procrastination and inaction .
There is little any of these wise men can do now for Zimbabweans flinching under Mr Mugabe 's blows .
Their expressions of concern are meaningless - even after this time , they are unwilling to point the finger .
They talk of political violence as if it were an extreme weather event , but avoid the issue of agency .
Mr Mugabe wants an overwhelming vote on Friday , and is prepared to beat it out of his country to get it .
He craves the legitimacy that a high turnout would give him to continue his 28-year rule .
If the hand - wringing African Union and awfully worried SADC can not ensure that an election is held freely on their patch , the very least they should do is to refuse to recognise its results , and deny Mr Mugabe the legitimacy he seeks .
His blood - soaked government should be treated by Africa as a pariah regime .
And then Mr Mugabe will be master of a currency that halves in value every week , a country with no food on its shelves and no medicine in its hospitals .
He will be master of nothing ."
2008-06-23,"How strange is the mind of a tyrant like Robert Mugabe that they sometimes feel the urgent need to uphold constitutional forms - the need for an election result - while simultaneously debauching the process .
Roman emperors , nominally elected by the republic 's ancient Senate , went to great pains to address form when often steeped in blood .
Let us turn to a more encouraging process than Morgan Tsvangirai 's withdrawal from Zimbabwe 's presidential contest .
Have I been wrong to predict that Barack Obama is doomed in America 's more firmly - established procedures , albeit ones not immune from the occasional hanging chad ?
I mention it because I keep reading and hearing things which diminish Senator John McCain , the Republican nominee , and enhance the standing of Senator Obama .
Had you realised , for instance , that McCain 's efforts to ingratiate himself with mainstream Republicans who mistrust him so have seen him retreat from many of his more idealistic reform positions ?
Cliff Schecter sets them out in detail in a new book ,
The Real McCain - Why Conservatives Do n't Trust Him and Independents
Should n't , which creates a portrait of expediency and flip - flopping rather than the famous courage of the Hanoi PoW who refused special favours because his dad was an American admiral .
He has held good on climate change , but not on abortion or even - as a torture victim himself - on the copper - bottom protection of American detainees from torture , the Guardian 's Michael Tomasky writes in a revealing review of McCain books in the current edition of the New York Review of Books .
Cut from that to a chat
I had with a well - connected US Democrat , one of many one meets these days , who insists that McCain is so old , so - bad tempered , so compromised , and Obama so charismatic , that it really will be an historic election that restores the world 's faith in the United States .
I 'm resistant to this chatter , but here 's a couple of anecdotes .
One has the Obama team discussing how to handle the crucial Texas primary - which they lost .
The staff on the ground suggest they will need to do two unethical things , one to provide "" street money "" in big cities like San Antonio and Galveston to get the vote out .
The other is to sanction what the rules call 5/27 money , whereby all sorts of election posters appear from "" supporters "" but the source of the money only surfaces much later .
Obama said no to both .
They told him he might lose the state .
He said so be it and his authority prevailed .
He also lost the state .
A wholesome story , if true .
But the claim that this is one of the best structured campaigns in modern times keeps coming round .
Few leaks , few catastrophes and now a website dedicated to instant rebuttal of some spectacular filth directed at the candidate and - this past week 's twist - his wife , Michelle .
All this may be self - deluding flattery too
and I note claims in some of today 's papers that the Obama team is too remote , too controlling .
Reporters , who are even more self - important stateside than here , are getting cross at being excluded .
McCain , who has flattered the media for years , faces similar charges .
The stakes are high and - as my friend put it - Obama is n't fighting for the usual share of the polls which would deliver victory in November , he 's looking at those who rarely vote . ""
He 's not addressing 50 % of the voters , but 100 % .
"" My chum even claims that Rupert Murdoch , now a big US player because of the intimidatory , editorial tactics of Fox News , is poised to back Obama .
I 'll believe that when I see it .
But when I raised the destructive conduct of Obama 's ex - pastor , the Reverend Jeremiah Wright , I was reminded that Senator McCain has his troubling clerics too - including one who thinks the Holocaust was well - deserved .
What does this amount to ?
None of us know for sure .
But I usually end these upbeat chats by saying : "" Well , that sounds good .
But what if McCain starts telling audiences in the heartland states ' All those cheese - eating surrender monkeys in Europe , they all want my opponent to win ' .
"" That might swing a few votes ."
2008-06-23,"Naturally despair is the primary emotion that will greet the decision by Zimbabwe 's opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai to pull out of the presidential run - off against Robert Mugabe , which was due to have been held this Friday .
With the election gone and no indication about when , or if , regime change will happen , the call for military action could develop from a low rumble into a roar .
Such talk risks dividing Africa at the very time when its leaders , finally , appeared to be uniting against Mugabe .
Given its colonial past , Britain has a responsibility to think harder than most before talking up the prospect of war .
Sadly , the Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg foolishly talked of military action on yesterday 's BBC Politics Show , and also wants to ban remittances sent by people in Britain to their relatives in Zimbabwe .
On both counts Clegg is profoundly and dangerously wrong .
To be fair to Clegg , he raised military action in the same breath as declaring that it would be "" impractical "" , a clear case of having his cake and eating it .
I want regime change in Zimbabwe as much as anybody .
Half my family is from Zimbabwe and I have visited several times .
In fact , a few months ago a cousin of mine was arrested and tortured for a week before being dumped , dazed and injured , in the bush .
His crime was simply living in a Harare neighborhood that was viewed as sympathetic to the opposition Movement for Democratic Change ( MDC ) .
With the economy having all but collapsed , many Zimbabweans depend on remittances from the estimated half a million Zimbabweans living in Britain .
Without this vital lifeline , people will die .
Clegg has clearly not done his homework on the issue of remittances .
He claimed that remittances help fund Mugabe 's regime .
That is simply not the case .
The cash goes straight from the sender to the receiver , with an international money transfer company ( mostly Western Union ) taking a cut .
There is no evidence that cash sent to help relatives is being passed on to the government .
Clegg seemed to suggest that remittances could be banned because Zimbabwe 's rate of inflation meant that money sent quickly lost its value .
Again , the Lib Dem leader is speaking out of ignorance .
Most , if not all , transfers are in American dollars .
His talk of a "" petrol embargo "" will surely be met with hollow laughter in the streets of Zimbabwe where petrol has been running increasingly scarce for the past two or three years .
Zimbabwe 's long - suffering population has already adapted to the shortage of petrol and high transport costs – they cycle and walk .
Their answer to rampant inflation and collapsing economy is to trade in the black market .
As a Lib Dem member , I am ashamed that Clegg has indulged in political opportunism over Zimbabwe , and appalled that he has embarked on this journey in such an amateurish way .
Now that Tsvangirai has abandoned the election , it is vital that the gathering momentum among African leaders continues .
The leaders of Angola , Tanzania , Kenya , Botswana , Zambia , and South Africa 's Jacob Zuma have all joined the chorus of international opinion declaring that the presidential elections would not be free and fair .
After years of procrastination for a host of self - interested reasons , this development carries with it genuine hope that Mugabe will at last read the writing on the wall .
The west can spend its time comparing Mugabe to Hitler , but the real answer is African solutions to African problems .
British actions , from tying a compensation package for white farmers to "" good governance "" clauses in the Abuja Accord , to the imposing of so - called smart sanctions , has merely stiffened the resolve of Mugabe to resist .
The diplomacy of Thabo Mbeki – wanting a graceful exit for Mugabe alongside a succession of a modern leader from within Zanu - PF ranks – has often been misinterpreted as Mbeki standing by a tyrant while failing to use the power South Africa wields to force change .
The belief that the west can simply apply pressure on South Africa to turn off the lights of its neighbour , as Clegg suggests , does not recognise the dynamics of the region .
Over the past decade Britain should by now realise that might and muscle will not bring Zimbabwe any closer to a solution .
It simply feeds the Mugabe propaganda machine and isolates the very people who can bring their influence to bear – other African leaders .
If Britain has a hung parliament at the next election and Clegg is offered a place in the cabinet
I , for one , will pray he does not become foreign secretary ."
2008-06-24,"Robert Mugabe yesterday rejected growing regional and international pressure to call off Friday 's presidential election .
African leaders joined international condemnation and the opposition candidate , Morgan Tsvangirai , formally submitted a letter withdrawing from the race .
But Mugabe said the election would go ahead .
"" They can shout as loud as they like from Washington and London and any other quarter .
Our people and only our people will decide , "" he told an election rally .
South Africa 's ruling African National Congress accused Mugabe of "" riding roughshod over hard - won democratic rights "" and said it could not remain "" indifferent to the flagrant violation of every principle of democratic governance "" .
The ANC leader , Jacob Zuma , said the situation in Zimbabwe was "" out of control "" and called for the UN and regional leaders to intervene urgently .
Senegal 's president , Abdoulaye Wade , also called for the election to be postponed , saying there was no chance of a fair vote .
South Africa 's trades union confederation , Cosatu , said it would mobilise workers across the world to isolate Mugabe .
Tsvangirai , who has sought refuge in the Dutch embassy in Harare , submitted a letter to the election commission formally pulling out of the election , and saying : "" The violence , intimidation , death , destruction of property is just too much for anyone to dream of a free and fair election , let alone expect our people to be able to freely and independently express ... themselves . """
2008-06-24,"The cricket community finally appears to be hardening its policy on Zimbabwe .
The withdrawal of Morgan Tsvangirai , leader of the opposition party Movement for Democratic Change ( MDC ) , from the second round of the country 's general election appears to have been the tipping point that has forced cricket administrators to act after several years of muddled decision making in the face of the ongoing deterioration of Zimbabwe 's social and political infrastructure .
Yesterday , even as the secretary general of the UN , Ban Ki - moon , condemned the conduct of Robert Mugabe 's government in the general election , Cricket South Africa announced it was cutting all ties with Zimbabwe Cricket .
This has forced the issue on to the agenda of the International Cricket Council 's executive board , which will meet to discuss the matter next Wednesday .
South Africa had been one of Zimbabwe 's staunchest allies in international cricket administration , and had previously blocked moves by other ICC members to impose sanctions .
ICC president - elect David Morgan stated : "" Cricket South Africa 's decision yesterday is hugely significant .
Clearly they will want something done . ""
Current ICC president Ray Mali is himself a South African and is known to be keen for the issue to be discussed by the 13 directors of the executive board .
Morgan , however , was clear that the ICC had not yet decided what course of action would be taken . ""
Quite where the various members will stand on it
I really do n't know - all of this is new as of five o'clock yesterday .
"" With the British government having repeating its public assertion that Zimbabwe 's scheduled 2009 tour to England would be "" unwelcome in the circumstance "" , and given that Australia 's decision not to tour the country in 2007 was supported by the government of John Howard , it appears that the ICC is going to be compelled to put fuller sanctions into effect .
The most immediate ramifications would be for the World Twenty20 tournament , due to take place in England in 2009 .
Zimbabwe were today included in Group A of the event but their participation is now in major doubt .
If they have to be replaced it is understood a third associate country will be included ."
2008-06-24,"Because Morgan Tsvangirai is no longer a presidential candidate , he no longer gets presidential protection .
The Movement for Democratic Change leader spent last night hiding in the Dutch embassy .
We 'll be keeping track of what moves he makes today , and of the proposals that diplomats - negotiating late into last night - have come up with .
8:30am
Tsvangirai has given an interview to the Dutch public broadcaster Radio 1 .
He sees last night 's UN statement like this : "" It recognises the people who are accountable for the violence , and it squarely places that responsibility at Mugabe 's leadership ...
I am sure that he can no longer remain defiant to that international position . ""
Though the Dutch ambassador has been given assurances that Tsvangirai will not be in danger , he will stay in the embassy for a further 48 hours .
9 am The Senegalese president , Abdoulaye Wade , has released a statement on his Zimbabwean mediation efforts , and in it provides details about how Tsvangirai came to hide at the Dutch embassy .
Late on Sunday night , soldiers allegedly "" went after "" Tsvangirai at his home .
He was only able to escape to the Dutch embassy because he was warned , moments before the soldiers arrived , that they were on their way .
9:15am
What seems to be remarkable about last night 's UN security council statement ( apart from the apparent brevity of the meeting : "" The meeting started at 7:50pm and adjourned at 7:54pm .
"" I presume they mean "" briefing "" but still , that 's efficient ) is that China and Russia have joined the condemnation of Mugabe .
Despite this and despite the UN secretary general , Ban Ki - moon , saying Friday 's presidential run - off should be delayed , Zimbabwe 's envoy told the room it would go ahead .
10 am As a reminder that there will actually be an election in Zimbabwe on Friday , the people at Kubatana post this guide to where the polling stations are within the country .
10:10am
The Frontline blog reports that sales of The Zimbabwean - "" the independent weekly printed in South Africa and shipped over the border - have risen . ""
The paper 's editor , Wilf Mbanga , not surprisingly puts this down to a hunger for hard facts ... but still : it 's amazing newspapers are getting in when a loaf of bread costs millions .
10:40am
The team at Kubatana yesterday asked their subscribers what they thought of Tsvangirai 's pull out .
80 % supported him . ""
The responses in favour of the withdrawal dramatically outweighed those who opposed the decision - by a factor of about 4:1 .
Those in favour of the withdrawal mainly hoped that this would ease the violence prevailing in Zimbabwe .
Those opposed saw the withdrawal as a betrayal of the MDC 's promise of change . ""
11:30am
Hopes of two sorts of intervention dashed : Brown has just held a cabinet meeting and quashed any rumours of military intervention in Zimbabwe ... and he 's also dismissed the idea that he 'll ask Mandela - whose 90th he 'll be help celebrate this afternoon - to intervene .
Midday
But what to do about the cricket ?
The Zimbabwe cricket team was due in the UK next year and today 's Brown 's spokesman said they 'd be "" unwelcome "" .
Not warm ... but not a slammed door either .
He said they were working on it .
3.45pm Thabo Mbeki is coming under increasing pressure from within South Africa to take a tougher line against Mugabe .
"" The time for quiet diplomacy and negotiations has long gone , "" said Helen Zille , who leads the Democratic Alliance opposition party .
She demanded that Mbeki sever ties with Mugabe and impose sanctions on elite members of his Zanu - PF party .
The conventional wisdom is that Mbeki is the only person who has any real influence over Mugabe .
But has the situation reached such a point that even if Mbeki finally turns on Mugabe , tthe effect would be minimal ?
There are also lots of suggestions on what South Africa could do to put pressure on Mugabe .
One of these would be to cut off electricity supplies .
That seems like a blunderbuss approach that would hurt ordinary Zimbaweans more than the elite .
They probably have generators ready to kick in if the power cuts out .
Peter Hain , an anti - apartheid campaigner in his youth , advocates such a course of action , but he wo n't have to sit in dark house in Zimbabwe when the lights go off .
4.15pm
This is Zimbabwe has Morgan Tsvangirai 's letter to the Zimbabwe Election Commission in full .
It starts in highly legalistic language before going into the reasons for his decision not to run in Friday 's presidential runoff .
The key line reads : "" The violence , intimidation , death , destruction of property is just too much for anyone to dream of a free and fair election let alone expect our people to be able to freely and independently express to free themselves . ""
4.45pm
Depressed by the news coming out of Zimbabwe ?
For a different perspective , take a look at this brief interview on Foreign Policy , where Gareth Penny , managing director of De Beers , takes a bullish view of Africa as a whole .
He sees investment opportunities not just in natural resources , but in telecommunications and other areas ."
2008-06-25,"Morgan Tsvangirai 's withdrawal from the Zimbabwe election is sad but understandable .
His victory in the first round was ignored , his supporters being murdered .
As Nick Clegg told Chatham House this week , it may be too late for the elections in Zimbabwe , but not too late for governments , including Britain 's , to act .
When the news came through from Harare , I was on the campaign trail in Henley .
Death by paper is the worst threat to democracy here .
One family had their recycling crate already firmly lodged under the letter box .
Unlike in Crewe , the Tories are on the defensive .
Their candidate 's record is under scrutiny , and David Cameron easily rattled in what should be a safe seat .
We met plenty of Boris voters who were switching to the charismatic Stephen Kearney .
Then there was the man who said : "" Actually , I 'm a Conservative , but I always quite liked Ken .
"" There 's no accounting for taste .
Labour seem certain to lose their deposit in Henley .
And not only there .
After a year as PM , Gordon Brown 's performance is moving from "" must do better "" to "" could n't do much worse "" .
Tony Benn always argued for policies not personalities .
And that 's my problem with Gordon Brown .
The number of children living in poverty has increased for the second year running .
More pensioners are living in poverty , too .
The abolition of the 10p tax rate , the scandal of pre - pay meter users paying more for their energy ( even before fuel price rises ) ... all of this institutionalises poverty in the most damaging way .
For others , it 's more about style .
We 're invited to contrast the easy charm of public school Tony , playing tennis in the sun , with grammar school Gordon sitting up all night doing the accounts .
As a grammar school girl myself , I understand that instinct to work hard , master every detail , pass the exam .
But politics , like life itself , is about relationships ; learning , not just from reports , but from listening to people .
Listening on post offices would be a start .
This week we heard that yet another Islington branch is proposed for closure .
Goswell Road did n't feature in any of the previous reviews .
But the Post Office now says because they have reprieved a branch in Walthamstow , eight miles away , they want to close ours instead .
We 're told this is "" part of the implementation of the government decision to reduce the UK - wide network of post office branches by up to 2,500 "" .
If Goswell Road closes , Islington will have lost 13 post offices under Labour : unlucky indeed ."
2008-06-25,"The international mining group Anglo American sought to defend itself yesterday against criticism of its investment in a platinum project in Zimbabwe amid mounting international pressure on the country 's president , Robert Mugabe , to call off tomorrow 's presidential election .
In a strongly worded statement , the firm said it was very concerned at the political situation in Zimbabwe , where the main opposition leader , Morgan Tsvangirai , has pulled out of the election because of violence against his supporters .
The mining group said it had been an investor in Zimbabwe for 60 years , adding that the Unki platinum project had been under development since 2003 but would not begin to generate revenues for years .
Responding to a report in yesterday 's Times newspaper that it was investing $ 400 m ( £ 200 m ) in the Unki project at a time when the British government was pressing companies to pull out , Anglo American said it was "" deeply concerned about the political situation in Zimbabwe and condemns the violence and human rights abuses that are taking place "" .
It said it was monitoring the situation closely but added that it had been warned that if it pulled out of the Unki development , the Zimbabwean government would take control . ""
Anglo American has a clear responsibility to protect the wellbeing of its more than 650 employees and contractors , as well as their families and all those who depend indirectly on the activity around the project , all of whose livelihoods would be jeopardised should the company withdraw from Zimbabwe . ""
The company , which is one of the largest mining and natural resources groups in the world , said the responsible development of the Unki project would create a long - term viable business in Zimbabwe .
It added that it was involved in supporting communities around the project , providing food and supplies as well as helping with agricultural development and supporting health and education projects .
The company 's statement concluded : "" Anglo American is in full compliance with all relevant national and international laws relating to its activities in Zimbabwe . ""
The UK government said yesterday it was preparing tougher sanctions against specific members of the Zimbabwean government and urged world leaders to work together to remove Mugabe from power .
"" We are preparing intensified sanctions , financial and travel sanctions , against named members of the Mugabe regime , "" Gordon Brown told parliament .
He said the way forward for the country was the United Nations and African Union "" working together for a change of regime "" .
Brown also said the government was speaking to the England and Wales Cricket Board to ensure that the Zimbabwean cricket team was banned from touring England next year .
The tour has since been cancelled by the board .
Asked specifically about the Anglo American project , the prime minister 's spokesman said the main purpose of sanctions was to prevent the regime carrying out undemocratic acts and they were designed to avoid , as much as possible , harming the welfare of ordinary Zimbabweans .
"" We do keep the issue of sanctions on Zimbabwe under review and of course we are mindful of the impact on the humanitarian situation in Zimbabwe but we would not want to see anything that propped up the regime in any way . ""
Commenting on Anglo American 's statement , Edward Davey , the Liberal Democrat foreign affairs spokesman , said : "" This shows just how weak the sanctions regime on Zimbabwe is in practice .
Creating jobs is one thing but supporting the lifeline of foreign exchange to one of the most corrupt and brutal regimes in history is another .
"" This investment will come as a huge boost to Mugabe 's regime , and will therefore represent a devastating blow to the population of Zimbabwe as a whole . ""
As well as its investment in the Unki project , Anglo American said it had a 37.2 % shareholding in Tongaat Hulett , a sugar and starch business that has operations in Zimbabwe employing 16,000 people ."
2008-06-25,"The Zimbabwean opposition leader , Morgan Tsvangirai , has returned to the Dutch embassy only hours after leaving it for the first time in two days .
He took refuge in the politically neutral territory of the embassy on Sunday night when his decision to withdraw from this Friday 's presidential run - off meant he lost the official protection given to presidential candidates .
During his brief departure from the embassy , Tsvangirai , standing outside his own home to address the press , called for international backing for a political transition in Zimbabwe .
He urged the African Union ( AU ) , backed by the UN , to lead a transitional political process in the country , where disputed elections in March have been accompanied by a wave of political violence .
He also repeated his rejection of this Friday 's run - off with Robert Mugabe .
"" I am asking the AU and SADC [ Southern African Development Community ] to lead an expanded initiative supported by the UN to manage what I will call a transitional process , "" he said .
He added that both main parties in Zimbabwe should realise the country was "" burning "" and the only answer was to sit down together and negotiate .
He said he wanted to use the African Union summit this weekend to get the wheels turning on a political solution .
Tsvangirai stressed once again that his opposition would not enter negotiations with President Mugabe 's government if Friday 's run - off elections went ahead . ""
The issue is that we will not have anything to do with a post [ June- ] 27 government arising out of this so - called election .
We have said we are prepared to negotiate on this side of the 27th , not the other side of the 27th , "" he told reporters at the conference in the capital , Harare .
It is not known whether Tsvangirai 's decision to return to the Dutch embassy following these comments was planned or forced by circumstances .
This morning , attempts to mount regional pressure on Mugabe to call off the election were dealt a fresh blow when it emerged the South African president , Thabo Mbeki , would not be attending an emergency meeting of African leaders .
Tanzania , Angola and Swaziland , which together organised today 's meeting in Swaziland of the 14-nation SADC , insisted Mbeki had been invited .
However , Mbeki 's spokesman , Mukoni Ratshitanga , issued a statement this morning saying this was not the case .
"" We are not going to Swaziland .
We have had no invitation to go to any meeting , especially Swaziland , "" Ratshitanga said .
There has been wide international condemnation of violence against the Zimbwean opposition but the SADC is seen as the only body that can influence events in the country .
Several of the organisation 's member states have been flooded by millions of refugees fleeing the economic collapse in Zimbabwe .
The South African president has been mediating between Mugabe and Zimbabwe 's opposition since last year but has been widely criticised for being too soft on Mugabe .
Mugabe has refused to call off the vote .
"" They can shout as loud as they like from Washington and London and any other quarter .
Our people and only our people will decide , "" he told an election rally .
The 84-year - old Zimbabwean president has shrugged off mounting international pressure , including Monday 's unprecedented UN security council condemnation of violence .
It said a free and fair run - off election on Friday was impossible .
South Africa 's ruling African National Congress accused Mugabe of "" riding roughshod over hard - won democratic rights "" and said it could not remain "" indifferent to the flagrant violation of every principle of democratic governance "" .
The ANC leader , Jacob Zuma , said the situation in Zimbabwe was "" out of control "" and called for the UN and regional leaders to intervene urgently .
Senegal 's president , Abdoulaye Wade , also called for the election to be postponed , saying there was no chance of a fair vote .
South Africa 's trades union confederation , Cosatu , said it would mobilise workers across the world to isolate Mugabe .
Writing in the Guardian today , Tsvangirai said Zimbabwe would "" break "" if the world did not come to its aid .
"" We ask for the UN to go further than its recent resolution , condemning the violence in Zimbabwe , to encompass an active isolation of the dictator Mugabe , "" he said .
"" For this we need a force to protect the people .
We do not want armed conflict , but the people of Zimbabwe need the words of indignation from global leaders to be backed by the moral rectitude of military force . ""
Such a force would be in the role of peacekeepers , not troublemakers .
They would separate the people from their oppressors and cast the protective shield around the democratic process for which Zimbabwe yearns . """
2008-06-26,"A piece that appeared in the Guardian newspaper and online , under the byline of Morgan Tsvangirai , president of the Movement for Democratic Change in Zimbabwe , has been removed from this site after contact from the MDC in Johannesburg and Harare yesterday made it clear that Tsvangirai had not in fact sanctioned it .
In a letter in the Guardian this morning , Tsvangirai explains that the article "" did not reflect my position or opinions regarding solutions to the Zimbabwean crisis .
Although the Guardian was given assurances from credible sources that I had approved the article this was not the case "" .
Many newspaper comment / op - ed pieces in the names of politicians ( and CEOs , union leaders and so on ) are drafted by an aide or journalist and we expect the bylined author to review and sign off on it either himself or through intermediaries before publication , to ensure that the views expressed accurately reflect the bylined author 's position .
Any drawback in this method is , we believe , outweighed by the benefit in publishing the important and influential views of the named author .
In this instance , the article was provided to the Guardian by a reliable and reputable media consultant , an experienced journalist who has had more than 400 pieces published for his clients .
He has provided a number of pieces from Tsvangirai to newspapers including the Washington Post , the Melbourne Age and the Guardian .
Indeed , it was through precisely the same channels that we received and published a piece bylined to Tsvangirai in the paper and online on April 7 .
Our liaison believed that Tsvangirai had approved the piece .
We now accept that Tsvangirai had not reviewed it and that it misrepresented his position .
Accordingly , we have removed the opinion piece from the Guardian website ."
2008-06-26,"Zimbabwe 's opposition has advised its supporters to vote for Robert Mugabe for their own safety when they are herded to the polls today amid threats of violence if there is not a resounding victory for the only ruler the country has known .
In a final push to intimidate voters , the ruling Zanu - PF 's militia forced people to political meetings across large parts of Zimbabwe yesterday .
They were again warned that their "" vote is their bullet "" if they did not support Mugabe even though the opposition candidate Morgan Tsvangirai has pulled out of the race because a state - orchestrated campaign of murder , abduction , beatings and rape made it too dangerous for his supporters to vote .
The MDC has accused Zanu - PF of conducting what it called Operation Elimination by warning those who vote for Tsvangirai that they "" will be slain "" .
Entire villages have been forced to hand over their identity cards to local chiefs who will give them back at polling stations to ensure people turn out to vote .
In other places , voters are to be given pre - marked ballots and told to hand back the blank ones they receive in polling booths as evidence that they did not vote for the opposition .
Perence Shiri , the head of the air force who led the army unit responsible for the Matabeleland massacres in the 1980s , has been touring Manicaland province , in the east of the country , where there has been widespread violence against the opposition , telling people they must pretend to be illiterate and ask for help to vote from polling officers appointed by the government .
Prosper Mutseyami , an MDC member of parliament in Manicaland , said the party was advising its supporters to vote Zanu - PF if necessary to save their lives .
"" The Zanu - PF militia , the war vets , the soldiers are still moving around , pushing people that they must vote and those who do n't vote you will be killed , "" he said .
"" In villages and townships people have been told they will be gathered in places for the whole night and taken together to vote in the morning . "" People are still being forced to Zanu - PF rallies throughout Manicaland from 8 am this morning .
They are beaten up and forced to repent for being MDC .
People are terribly cowed and terrified , especially in rural areas .
We 've advised those who can escape to do so .
Some of those near the border have gone to Mozambique .
But those who have to vote we advise them to do what they have to survive even if it means voting Zanu - PF . ""
Tsvangirai told supporters yesterday it did not matter how they voted because the election was a fraud .
With the polling stations now purged of independent election officials , such as teachers , and staffed with ruling party officials and soldiers , many voters are likely to be too afraid to resist the pressure to vote for Mugabe .
Zanu - PF 's intent appears to be to ensure a high turnout and a high proportion of the votes for Mugabe , so that the ruling party can claim he won the support of a majority of Zimbabwean voters even with the MDC 's boycott .
But whatever the size of Mugabe 's victory , the ballot appears likely to strip him of any lingering legitimacy after 28 years as Zimbabwe 's president amid international revulsion at his party 's bloody terror campaign .
He now faces heading a pariah government with no solutions to the implosion of his country 's economy under the weight of 3 million per cent inflation .
The MDC concedes it had little hope of repeating Tsvangirai 's defeat of Mugabe in the first round of elections three months ago because of the violence .
At least 100 people have been killed - although one doctors ' group puts the death toll closer to 500 - hundreds more have been abducted , about 2,000 opposition activists thrown into prison and thousands severely beaten as Mugabe 's security cabinet ran a military - style campaign to decapitate the opposition and reverse his humiliating loss in the first round of elections .
The campaign has focused on provinces such as Manicaland and Mashonaland where a significant swing in support from Mugabe to the opposition in the first round of elections in March delivered victory for Tsvangirai , although he fell just short of the 50 % plus one for an outright majority , forcing today 's run - off .
The campaign of violence has also ensured there will be few independent witnesses to the intimidation of voters or manipulation of the count .
The MDC pulled out of the election , in part , because hundreds of its polling agents were beaten and thrown into prison , and some abducted or murdered .
It said it could not , in good conscience , send them to their deaths monitoring today 's vote .
A respected independent monitoring group , the Zimbabwe Election Support Network , which played an important role in protecting the outcome of the March ballot , has said it can not send observers to polling stations today because of the threats to their lives .
The opposition yesterday accused the ruling party of planting fake MDC polling agents at voting places "" to give the impression that the MDC is participating in this sham in a desperate bid to secure some semblance of legitimacy in the so - called run - off poll "" .
But while the campaign to break support for the opposition appears to have been successful , it has also been so blatant and brutal as to strip the election of any legitimacy .
Zimbabwe 's president long ago lost credibility in the west but had hoped to win continued African support by dressing up the election as part of the struggle against the legacy of imperialism .
But that strategy was damaged by the long delay in releasing the first round of results in March , and the blatant violence since then .
Zanu - PF now faces running a country isolated internationally with , crucially , no prospect of the economic help it hoped to get from a credible ballot .
Mugabe will be returned to office facing inflation somewhere above 3 million percent - economists ca n't agree .
Food production has plummeted to about one - third of what it was a decade ago , foreign currency earnings are diminishing by the day and increasing numbers of people are dying through a combination of poor nutrition , lack of medicines and disease , particularly Aids .
There are signs that Mugabe intends to keep up the campaign after the election to wipe out the MDC as a political force .
Zanu - PF has lost control of parliament for the first time since independence since 1980 .
But if and when parliament is finally seated the MDC may have a problem mustering its majority given that a significant number of its MPs have been locked up , have fled abroad or are in hiding in fear of their lives ."
2008-06-27,"Zimbabwe 's main opposition leader today urged the international community to ignore the results of a "" sham "" presidential vote all but guaranteed to crown Robert Mugabe president thanks to widespread fraud and violence .
The 84-year - old Zimbabwean ruler was the only candidate in today 's run - off vote .
Morgan Tsvangirai pulled out after deciding a state - orchestrated campaign of murder , abduction , beatings and rape made it too dangerous for his supporters to vote for him .
Despite desperate attempts by Mugabe 's Zanu - PF to ensure a high turnout in an election condemned internationally as fraudulent , voter numbers seemed patchy .
Italy 's foreign minister , Franco Frattini , called for EU nations to recall their ambassadors from Zimbabwe , while a European commission spokeswoman in Brussels condemned any result as "" hollow and meaningless "" .
Tsvangirai , who yesterday advised supporters of his Movement for Democratic Change ( MDC ) to cast their ballots for Mugabe for their own safety if obliged to go to the polls , called for other countries to ostracise the government .
"" Anyone who recognises the result of this election is denying the will of the Zimbabwean people and standing in the way of a transition that will deliver stability and prosperity not just to the country , but to the region , "" he told reporters at his Harare home , according to the AFP news agency .
The opposition leader , who sheltered at the Dutch embassy earlier this week out of fear of arrest or attack , said he was "" heartened "" by condemnation of the vote by African nations including Botswana , Rwanda , Tanzania and Kenya and called on South Africa to do the same .
"" How can you recognise this kind of sham ? "" he said .
In Harare , Zanu - PF militia members roamed the streets , singing revolutionary songs and intimidating passers by .
At some polling stations in the city voters were being openly marshalled , with groups having their names called and ticked off from books before they headed inside .
Overall the mood seemed noticeably less enthusiastic than that seen during the initial presidential election , in March .
That vote delivered victory for Tsvangirai , although he fell just short of the 50 % plus one needed for an outright majority , forcing today 's run - off .
During the first round , hundreds of people queued at polling stations before doors opened .
This morning , fewer than 10 people were waiting at Harare 's main voting centre at 7 am , with even thinner crowds elsewhere .
The MDC has accused Zanu - PF of conducting what it called Operation Elimination by warning people who vote for Tsvangirai that they "" will be slain "" .
Entire villages were forced to hand over their identity cards to local chiefs , who were giving them back at polling stations to ensure people turned out to vote .

This morning , the US secretary of state , Condoleezza Rice , said her country would consult with other UN security council members after the vote "" to see what next steps we might need to take "" .
Rice was speaking at a G8 meeting in Tokyo , which issued a statement saying the group of leading industrial nations "" will not accept the legitimacy of any government that does not reflect the will of the Zimbabwean people "" .
The MDC concedes it has little hope of repeating Tsvangirai 's defeat of Mugabe in the first round of elections , because of the violence .

2008-06-28,"Turnout in Zimbabwe 's election run - off yesterday was "" very , very low "" , an international observer said today .
The remarks contradicted Zimbabwean state media claims that voters had delivered a ringing endorsement of Robert Mugabe .
According to the state - run Herald newspaper , the presidential vote – contested by Mugabe alone after Morgan Tsvangirai pulled out due to officially - sanctioned violence against the opposition – was peaceful , with "" massive voter turnout recorded in most parts of the country "" .
However , the head of one outside monitoring mission said many voters had defaced their ballots or even cast votes for Tsvangirai , whose name remained on the ballot paper despite his withdrawal .
Marwick Khumalo , the head of the Pan - African Parliament observer mission , said overall turnout was "" very , very low "" .
Voters yesterday described widespread threats and intimidation by militia linked to the ruling Zanu - PF , with gangs searching for anyone without an ink - stained finger to indicate that they had cast a vote .
Khumalo , an MP from Swaziland , said many voters nevertheless appeared to have stayed away .
He added that , at one rural polling station , he had seen 36 votes cast for Mugabe , 17 for Tsvangirai and 31 spoiled papers .
In a Harare voting station , 107 votes were cast for Mugabe and 76 for Tsvangirai , with 30 spoiled ballots .
"" One can believe that it was the same scenario in other areas , "" he said .
"" There was a lot of intimidation for people to vote .
You can tell people just wanted to get the indelible ink to protect themselves from the hooligans . ""
The run - off was organised after Tsvangirai beat Mugabe in a first - round presidential vote on March 29 , but did not reach the 50 % level needed to avoid another round .
His Movement for Democratic Change said last Sunday that he would withdraw from the election because the party could not ask supporters to risk their lives amid a climate of state - sponsored terror .
Mugabe opted to go ahead with the election , which has been dismissed as a sham and a farce by the US , the EU , a meeting of G8 nations and a series of African leaders .
Counting of the votes began overnight , with the first results expected this afternoon .
Zanu - PF had been aiming for a big turnout to try and add a gloss of legitimacy to Mugabe 's inevitable victory ."
2008-06-28,"The US president , George Bush , today ordered officials to draw up a list of possible sanctions against Zimbabwe and condemned Robert Mugabe 's "" blatant disregard "" for democracy .
The move could see the imposition of sanctions including an arms embargo and travel bans .
It follows Friday 's presidential election run - off - internationally condemned as a farce - in which Mugabe ran as the sole candidate after Morgan Tsvangirai pulled out amid officially - organised violence against the opposition .
Although no results from the poll have so far been released , Zimbabwean officials told reporters they expected Mugabe to be sworn in as president tomorrow .
In a statement , Bush said Washington would press for "" strong action "" at the UN following the "" sham election "" .
"" Given the Mugabe regime 's blatant disregard for the Zimbabwean people 's democratic will and human rights , I am instructing the secretaries of state and treasury to develop sanctions against this illegitimate government of Zimbabwe and those who support it , "" he said .
The run - off was organised after Tsvangirai beat Mugabe in an initial presidential vote on March 29 , but did not win the 50 % of votes needed to avoid another round .
Last Sunday , his Movement for Democratic Change said he would withdraw from the election because the party could not ask supporters to risk their safety amid the violence , which has claimed more than 100 lives .
The ruling Zanu - PF party has been desperate to ensure a high turnout and a heavy pro - Mugabe mandate in the vote .
Militia roamed the streets yesterday , warning people to cast their ballots and in some cases checking ballot papers before they were submitted .
However , an international observer said today that the turnout appeared to be "" very , very low "" , contradicting the verdict of Zimbabwe 's state - run media .
Marwick Khumalo , the head of the Pan - African Parliament observer mission , said many voters appeared to have defied the threats by either staying away , spoiling their ballots or voting for Tsvangirai , whose name remained on the paper despite his withdrawal last weekend .
Khumalo , an MP from Swaziland , said that at one rural polling station , he had seen 36 votes cast for Mugabe , 17 for Tsvangirai and 31 spoiled papers , adding : "" One can believe that it was the same scenario in other areas .
"" Results had been due from this lunchtime , but have yet to be issued .
Nevertheless , government officials told reporters privately that plans were going ahead to formally swear in Mugabe so he could travel to an African Union ( AU ) summit in Egypt next week as president . ""
The tallies are indicating that , despite the wishes of our detractors and the propaganda of our enemies , the voter turnout was very big and that we are going to see a landslide victory , "" one official told Reuters .
The inauguration would take place tomorrow at 10 am ( 0900 BST ) , one unnamed "" source close to Mugabe "" told the AFP news agency .
An AFP report said tents were being put up at State House , Mugabe 's official residence , in anticipation .
His decision to go ahead with the election has been condemned by the US , the EU , a meeting of G8 nations and a series of African leaders .
However , it remains to be seen what attitude the AU will take to calls for new UN sanctions .
At a meeting of AU foreign ministers in the Egyptian resort of Sharm el - Sheikh today , intended to pave the way for tomorrow 's summit , the talk was more of engagement . ""
History has shown us that [ sanctions ] do n't work because the leadership just dig in and dig in and feel persecuted , "" the Kenyan foreign minister , Moses Wetangula , was quoted as saying .
Mediation efforts by Zimbabwe 's neighbours , led by the South African president , Thabo Mbeki , have delivered little , and Mbeki has been criticised for his soft diplomatic approach to Mugabe ."

Officials were reported as saying that , with two - thirds of the count completed , there had been a dramatic reversal of Morgan Tsvangirai 's lead in the first round of elections three months ago , giving Mugabe a resounding victory before he heads to an African Union summit to confront growing criticism from the continent 's other leaders .
But the ruling Zanu - PF party 's claims that voters have deserted the opposition Movement for Democratic Change in droves to support Mugabe 's claim that the vote is part of a struggle to maintain Zimbabwe 's independence have met with incredulity and anger .
Washington called the vote a sham and said it will seek a UN Security Council resolution this week to send a ' strong message of deterrence ' to Zimbabwe 's leader .
The US Secretary of State , Condoleezza Rice , said Washington ' will use everything in our power for appropriate sanctions ' .
The US is also expected to press for an arms embargo on Zimbabwe and a travel ban on its officials .
Gordon Brown yesterday said that Zimbabwe had reached a new low point with the election . '
We will work with international partners to find a way to close this sickening chapter that has cost so many lives , ' the Prime Minister said .
The head of one foreign election observer mission , Marwick Khumalo , who leads the Pan - African Parliament monitors , said that many Zimbabweans had voted only out of fear and that the turnout was in truth ' very , very low ' after Tsvangirai withdrew from the race because of the violence .
Khumalo also suggested that many voters deliberately defaced their ballots after they were intimidated into going to the polls .
He said that at one polling place in rural Matabeleland nearly 40 per cent of the ballots were spoilt , and that at another in Harare the combined numbers of opposition and spoilt ballots matched the vote for the President . '
There was a lot of intimidation for people to vote , ' said Khumalo , a parliamentarian from Swaziland . '
You can tell people just wanted to get the indelible ink [ on a finger to prove they had voted ] to protect themselves from the hooligans . '
The ballot appears to have produced a low turnout in cities , but terrorised voters were herded to the polls in some rural areas and intimidated into voting for Mugabe .
He is apparently in a hurry to be sworn in so he can attend the AU summit in Egypt tomorrow from what he perceives to be a position of strength .
Tsvangirai last week called on the AU to oversee a transitional administration in Zimbabwe until legitimate elections can be held , although how such an arrangement could work is still unclear . '
It 's now a matter of peace and security , ' said Tsvangirai 's spokesman , Nelson Chamisa . '
We hope the matter gets the urgent attention it deserves .
We should not wait for rivers of blood and the complete breakdown of order . '
In an interview with the Sunday Telegraph , Tsvangirai suggested that Mugabe could still play a role in such a transitional regime , stating that it was ' not inconceivable ' that he could remain as ceremonial president , with Tsvangirai taking of the role of executive Prime Minister .
Desmond Tutu , the former Archbishop of Cape Town , urged African states to declare Mugabe an illegitimate leader and impose a blockade on Zimbabwe .
Mugabe said last week that he will tell his critics that many of their elections are worse than Zimbabwe 's .
The AU is divided .
While countries such as Nigeria , Botswana , Kenya and Tanzania have all criticised the poll to some degree , there is less inclination for a confrontation with Mugabe from South Africa and his allies , such as the Democratic Republic of Congo and Angola .
The AU commission chairman , Jean Ping , has urged compromise .
Mugabe 's Foreign Minister , Simbarashe Mumbengegwi , attempted to forestall a debate on Zimbabwe at a preparatory meeting on Friday and asked to be allowed to read a statement .
But there were strong objections from a number of countries , including Liberia , Senegal and Sierra Leone .
The European Commission , meanwhile , upped the ante by calling for future talks on a political solution to be based on the first - round election result in which Tsvangirai won most votes .
AU diplomats say Tsvangirai now needs to radically rethink his position that he would not consider power - sharing or a transitional government . '
That was never going to happen , ' said Zimbabwean political analyst John Makumbe .
' They are going to have to swallow their pride .
Do n't forget that the post - Mugabe era has already begun and there are many figures within the ruling party who are already jostling for position . '
Tsvangirai fears that , as a Prime Minister under Mugabe , he would be emasculated , just as Mugabe 's former opponent Joshua Nkomo was in the 1980s . ·

2008-06-29,"Robert Mugabe was sworn in as president of Zimbabwe today after being declared the winner of last week 's discredited poll .
The Zimbabwe Electoral Commission announced that Mugabe won 85 % of the vote in what was , in effect , a one - horse race .
The opposition leader , Morgan Tsvangirai , who pulled out of the contest , declined an invitation to attend Mugabe 's hastily - organised inauguration ceremony .
International condemnation of the election and the ongoing violence in Zimbabwe has continued .
The British foreign office minister Lord Malloch - Brown today said African nations should "" do whatever it takes "" to get rid of Mugabe .
He suggested military intervention in Zimbabwe could be necessary if the violence increased .
Malloch - Brown was speaking ahead of a meeting of African Union ( AU ) foreign ministers in the Egyptian town of Sharm el - Sheikh .
The meeting comes as African observers in Zimbabwe said the election was not free and fair and supporters of Mugabe were beating people who could n't prove they voted .
Archbishop Desmond Tutu said the international community should consider using force to intervene in the country .
He said "" a very good argument "" could be made for a military presence .
In an interview with the BBC , Malloch - Brown said : "" If law and order breaks down in the country or if Mugabe is utterly resistant to change and continues to oppress violently people 's human rights , then I hope the African neighbours will do whatever it takes to secure his departure . ""
"" What you can not accept is the status quo continuing - President Mugabe has to go .
"" The minister also suggested that some form of national unity government may be required , but said this was up to Tsvangirai . ""
Morgan Tsvangirai won the last honest vote .
He should be the senior partner .
If he wants to invite some people from the Mugabe party in that is fine , "" Malloch - Brown said .
Tutu said AU leaders should refuse to recognise Mugabe as the legitimate president of Zimbabwe .
He told the BBC : "" I think a very good argument can be made for having an international force to restore peace . ""
Kenya 's prime minister , Raila Odinga , backed such calls in a speech yesterday .
"" We want the African Union to send troops to Zimbabwe .
The time has come for the African continent to stand firm in unity to end dictatorship , "" Reuters quoted Odinga as saying .
Meanwhile , African observers called for a re - run of Friday 's poll , to ensure it was free and fair .
"" Conditions should be put in place for the holding of free , fair and credible elections as soon as possible in line with the African Union declaration on the principles governing democratic elections , "" Marwick Khumalo , head of the Pan - African parliament observer team , said at a press conference today , according to Reuters .
Human Rights Watch said it has evidence that Mugabe 's supporters are beating people who can not prove they voted .
Residents in two neighbourhoods in Harare said that in the early hours of yesterday , Mugabe supporters went door to door , forcing people to show their fingers for signs of indelible ink , which shows that a person voted .
Those who did not have ink on their fingers were taken away and beaten with batons and thick sticks , Human Rights Watch said .
Others were targeted because their names did not appear on a list compiled by Mugabe 's governing Zanu - PF party , that showed who voted ."
2008-07-02,"The Zimbabwean opposition leader , Morgan Tsvangirai , said today he would not enter power sharing talks with Robert Mugabe until Zanu - PF ended its campaign of violence .
The Movement for Democratic Change ( MDC ) leader also said "" meaningful progress "" could not be made in any talks while the South African president , Thabo Mbeki , remained the African Union 's only chief mediator in Zimbabwe .
After two days of angry exchanges at the AU summit in Egypt , Mugabe 's officials agreed to begin discussions to end the violent crisis over the widely disputed election .
But Tsvangirai , who boycotted last week 's presidential run - off vote because of attacks on his supporters , told a news conference that conditions were not suitable for talks . ""
If dialogue is to be initiated , it is essential that Zanu - PF stops the violence , halts the persecution of MDC leaders and supporters , "" he told reporters in Harare .
Tsvangirai insisted that the results of a first round of voting on March 29 , in which his party defeated Mugabe , should be the basis for talks .
And he called on the AU to send a permanent envoy to Zimbabwe .
Without that , he said , "" no meaningful progress can be made toward resolving the Zimbabwe crisis "" .
There has been criticism that Mbeki , who was reconfirmed as the AU mediator yesterday , is too soft in his diplomacy with Mugabe .
In a sign of western frustration with the South African president , Gordon Brown called on the UN to send an envoy to Harare .
"" I think it 's important to recognise that the African Union did make a step forward yesterday
but there is a lot more to do , "" he said in prime minister 's questions .
He told the Commons that the "" only credible "" election was the one in March in which "" MDC recorded a victory "" .
In response to an AU resolution today calling for a unity government , Zimbabwe 's ruling party chose to tone down its recent bellicose rhetoric . ""
The AU resolution is in conformity to what President Mugabe said at his inauguration , when he said we are prepared to talk in order to resolve our problems , "" the information minister , Sikhanyiso Ndlovu , told Reuters .
"" We are committed to talk , not just with Tsvangirai but to other parties as well . ""
Today the European Union confirmed that it would not accept a Zimbabwean government if was not led by Tsvangirai .
"" We fully support the African Union 's call for a government of national unity .
Any transitional government must include Morgan Tsvangirai as prime minister or head of government , "" spokesman John Clancy said at a media briefing .
Mugabe , 84 , was sworn in for a new five - year term on Sunday after election authorities announced he had won about 85 % of the vote in a run - off , which was condemned by monitors and much of the world as violent and unfair .
Mugabe has branded the MDC a puppet of Britain and the US and vowed to never let it rule Zimbabwe ."
2008-07-02,"Zimbabwe 's opposition leader , Morgan Tsvangirai , yesterday ruled out joining the power - sharing government called for by the African Union , and said negotiations with President Robert Mugabe should instead lay the ground for a new constitution and fresh elections .
Tsvangirai also said there could be no talks while state - orchestrated violence continued against supporters of his Movement for Democratic Change .
At least nine people have been murdered in political attacks since last Friday 's presidential runoff , and hundreds more beaten or driven from their homes .
The MDC leader criticised the AU summit for failing to recognise the "" illegitimacy "" of the election , which was boycotted by Tsvangirai after a military - led campaign of violence against the opposition .
Mugabe officially won the presidential runoff with close to 90 % of the valid votes - more than double the support he received when he lost the first round of the election to the MDC leader in March .
Tsvangirai said the AU should not have called for a national unity government without acknowledging that the MDC won the March vote and should therefore be recognised as the legitimate government of Zimbabwe . ""
A government of national unity does not address the problems facing Zimbabwe or acknowledge the will of the Zimbabwean people , "" said Tsvangirai . ""
While the MDC remains committed to negotiations , these must be based on the March results and must move towards a transitional agreement .
Our commitment to a negotiated settlement is not about power - sharing or power deals , but about democracy , freedom and justice .
Our struggle is not about power , but about democracy . ""
He said a transitional administration should serve primarily to draw up a new constitution , which would be put to a referendum , and then to hold elections .
But Zimbabwe 's information minister , Sikhanyiso Ndlovu , welcomed the AU 's position , saying it reflected Mugabe 's call for dialogue .
"" Government is ready for dialogue with whoever , a dialogue for national unity in Zimbabwe , "" he said .
Senegal 's president , Abdoulaye Wade , said that at the summit Mugabe had dismissed a proposal for power - sharing with the MDC . ""
He told me this is not possible , that he has his supporters , "" said Wade .
"" I reminded him that the MDC is a real force and that if a prime minister had to be chosen by his level of representation , it could only be Tsvangirai . ""
Tsvangirai was backed in his call by the EU , which said he should head any transitional government because it is "" essential that the will of the Zimbabwean people be reflected "" .
Gordon Brown said the UN should send an envoy to Zimbabwe to discuss a transitional arrangement based on the March election results .
Tsvangirai also said that the MDC would reject any mediation conducted solely by South Africa 's president , Thabo Mbeki , who the opposition has accused of hostility and of partisanship toward Mugabe . ""
The MDC 's reservations about the mediation process under Mbeki are well known , "" he said .
"" It is our position that unless the mediation team is expanded to include at least one permanent representative from the African Union , and the mediation mechanism is changed , no meaningful progress can be made towards resolving the Zimbabwean crisis .
If this does not happen the MDC will not be part of such a mediation process .
"" The Bush administration has drafted a UN security council resolution for further sanctions against the Zimbabwean government and demanding immediate negotiations to end the political crisis in the country ."
2008-07-03,"There was never any doubt about who was going to win the most farcical , one - sided election in Zimbabwe 's history .
Once it was announced that there would be a presidential run - off election , it was clear that Zanu - PF were going to ensure a victory for Robert Mugabe by any means necessary .
Even if Morgan Tsvangirai had not withdrawn , he would almost certainly have won the popular vote , but the official result would have been rejigged to ensure a Mugabe victory .
There is little doubt that Zanu - PF was surprised by Tsvangirai 's withdrawal from the presidential contest .
The party 's intention had been to achieve a manipulated victory at the polls , and use the elections to legitimise power .
However , when deprived of an opponent at the polls , Zanu - PF , far from bemoaning the collapse of their election strategy , realised that they had in fact been gifted an opportunity to present a fait accompli to Africa .
For Zanu - PF , a central tenet of the state 's "" total strategy "" for survival has been the need to win the battle for African hearts and minds .
As the Zimbabwean state continues to haemorrhage support from its own people , so support from African leaders has become ever more critical .
Mugabe has thus been unconcerned by the volley of criticism from the UN and the western community .
The recent SADC meeting on defence and security was of greater concern , because the current SADC chair , President Kikwete of Tanzania , has been emphatic in his criticism of Mugabe , and he has called for Mugabe to step down .
However , the absence of Mbeki from the SADC deliberations and statement immediately watered down the impact of the meeting , and provided succour for Mugabe .
The key for Mugabe has been to ensure public recognition of his position as Zimbabwe 's head of state , by his peers in Africa , and by the MDC .
The AU summit in Sharm el - Sheikh has shown that Mugabe has won the battle for African recognition , although not for support .
There was little chance that the AU would fail to recognise Mugabe : although Kenyan Prime Minister Raila Odinga was blunt in his criticism , Tsvangirai was deprived of another key ally when president Mwanawasa of Zambia was reported dead .
The AU and SADC election observer groups were critical of the run - off , but their reservations on the legitimacy of the elections were not incorporated into the Sharm el - Sheikh resolution on Zimbabwe , which urges negotiations for a government of national unity ( GNU ) .
Human rights reports on the appalling levels of violence and cruelty show that Zimbabwe has become an atrocity exhibition ; but they have found an audience of the deaf at state level .
The AU , like the OAU that preceded it , is still bound by the ties of "" patriotic blackness "" – the reflexive African solidarity and sovereignty mantra that overrules the democracy and human rights agenda .
What are the options for Zanu - PF ?
There are three : the first is to adopt a strategy of annihilation against the MDC , using the state 's panoply of legal and military resources to destroy the opposition 's leadership and divide their supporters , with the aim of destroying the MDC as a serious opposition , and to anoint a successor to Mugabe from within Zanu - PF .
This will be the preferred option for the Zanu - PF hardliners , who will now be pressing for a "" final victory "" against the MDC .
The problem is that the state of the economy is so bad , and the levels of misgovernance are so high , that there will always be serious opposition to Zanu - PF , whether from the MDC or other groups .
In addition , the more the state insists on using violence to retain power , the more the chances of ending the crisis recedes .
Thus , the strategy of annihilation , which has as its endpoint the creation of a de facto one - party state , is no solution at all .
The second option is for a government of national unity ( GNU ) – this is the option which the AU and SADC are pushing , and which the west is reluctantly beginning to endorse .
For Mugabe , this would probably be the preferred outcome , and this has been the long - term strategy from the start .
Zanu - PF has been keen to ensure that the EU and US 's preferred strategies of non - recognition , possible humanitarian / military intervention and a re - run of the elections under credible international stewardship , come to nought , and are overwhelmed by the African community 's rival vision of negotiations for a GNU .
Zanu - PF would keen to have a GNU on their terms ; this would entail an incorporation of the MDC , rather than a partnership .
Mugabe would remain as the substantive president , while Tsvangirai would be given a vice - presidential or prime ministerial role .
In essence , this would be a recreation of the 1987 unity accord between Zanu - PF and Zapu .
A GNU with the MDC as a junior partner would also leave the door open for a Zanu - PF , rather than an MDC , successor to Mugabe .
Zanu - PF will thus continue to use violence and legal means to force the MDC to the negotiating table .
The third option is a GNU with Tsvangirai as the substantive head of state .
The security sector in Zimbabwe will almost certainly veto this idea , as Tsvangirai is anathema to them , and they have persistently refused to acknowledge his status .
Even if Tsvangirai were to become leader , he would find it almost impossible to exert his authority over the securocrats .
Zanu - PF hardliners would also be unwilling to accept a substantive Tsvangirai presidency , because they fear that this would wither away their own powers and status .
On the other hand , there is little doubt that more moderate Zanu - PF groupings would be less averse to a Tsvangirai premiership , because it would virtually guarantee international reconstruction aid in a way that a continued Mugabe stewardship can not .
In cultural terms , what Mugabe craves most of all is recognition from Tsvangirai .
He wants Tsvangirai to end his insistence that Mugabe is not the legitimate head of state and that he , Tsvangirai , is both the "" people 's "" president , and the legitimate head of state .
Mugabe would like Tsvangirai to acknowledge that "" Mugabe ndiye Mambo "" ( "" Mugabe is the chief "" ) .
Where does this leave Tsvangirai ?
He has two choices ; the first is to refuse to go into a GNU with Zanu - PF , and continue the path of "" most resistance "" by fashioning himself as an "" alternative "" president of Zimbabwe , and continuing to lead the MDC in opposition to Zanu - PF .
The MDC statement of July 2 , which states that conditions are "" not right "" for talks on a government of national unity , suggests that at the moment the MDC favours this option .
The prospect of a GNU certainly has little appeal to most MDC supporters , who fear that the MDC would thus be endorsing Zanu - PF .
The second option is for the MDC to enter talks with Zanu - PF on a GNU , which he has currently ruled out on the grounds of the continuing violence .
Although most MDC supporters will be reluctant , the fact is that the MDC could be forced to negotiate with Zanu - PF .
The question of the presidency will be the most intractable issue , not just between the MDC and Zanu - PF , but also within the MDC .
Tsvangirai will find it hard to sell an agreement in which he becomes a secondary leader , to the MDC hardliners .
His other option is to try an convince Zanu - PF moderates that he is not a threat to their positions and that he can deliver an end to the crisis .
In other words , Tsvangirai will have to prise open the brittle political / security "" covenant "" which holds Zanu - PF together , and fashion a "" progressive "" Zanu - PF / MDC negotiating caucus , before ZANU - PF in turn , prises apart the MDC coalition .
Zanu - PF will be keen to exploit the differences between Tsvangirai , Mutambara , Biti and Welshman Ncube , in a strategy of reducing the MDC to a fractious interest group rather than an effective opposition , thus breaking it from within as well as without .
There will also be difficulties on matters of policy – particularly the restructuring of the security sector , constitutional reform , the judiciary , and other issues .
The nightmare scenario for the MDC is one in which the GNU is simply a reconvening of new MDC faces in an essentially Zanu - PF cabinet , with little or no substantive change in policies to move the country forward .
On the other hand , the MDC , if faced with the prospect of destruction by the military , may have little or no choice , but to go for a merger , even though this will certainly prove to be divisive within the MDC itself .
The MDC will insist that the GNU must be part of a process of transition to democracy and genuine elections , while Zanu - PF will insist that the GNU is itself the ultimate objective .
Tsvangirai will have to convince his supporters that there are no better options for the MDC , especially if it helps to save lives .
Failure to engage with will leave the MDC open to attack , not only from Zanu - PF and the security sector , but also from disenchanted MDC and other militants who may decide to wage an armed struggle against the state .
It will also leave the way open for Simba Makoni to rejoin the presidential succession struggle , possibly as a Zanu - PF candidate .
Zimbabwe 's crisis also illustrates that ideologically , Zimbabwe has become a globalised conflict – Zimbabwe 's "" world war "" .
Despite the unanimous UN security council resolution criticising the run - off , the reality is that the convergence of international opinion on Zimbabwe is only skin deep .
Both parties have built international , diametrically opposed , coalitions ; both parties are also proxies for contemporary east v west , and north v south conflicts .
There is agreement on the moral imperative for an international response to help bring about a settlement to the crisis , and the recognition that the "" atrocious violence "" of the run - off is unacceptable .
But there is a divide over what is the best way forward for the international community and for Zimbabwe .
The EU and the US , recognising the opportunity for a foreclosure on Zimbabwean authoritarianism , have refused to recognise Mugabe as the legitimate head of state , and have been canvassing for increased sanctions and a credible rerun of the presidential elections under international supervision .
The AU on the other hand , has recognised ( although not welcomed )
Mugabe as the legitimate head of state , and is advocating talks based on the GNU .
This does not mean that there is unanimous African support for Mugabe – in fact Zimbabwe has deeply polarised the AU and SADC .
For now , the GNU "" group "" , led by Mbeki , will have its way , but should the Zimbabwean government revert to type and launch violent crackdowns , this will give more ammunition to those who favour a global intervention , rather than an mediation approach .
Were this to happen , Zimbabwe 's fallen would indeed become the "" dangerous dead "" to Zanu - PF , both now and in the future ."
2008-07-06,"South Africa 's president , Thabo Mbeki , has presented a plan to Zimbabwe 's political leaders that would allow Robert Mugabe to remain as a titular head of state but surrender real power to the opposition leader , Morgan Tsvangirai , who would serve as prime minister until a new constitution was negotiated and fresh elections held .
A senior opposition Movement for Democratic Change source , who has read the document , told the Guardian that Mbeki had sent the plan to Mugabe and Tsvangirai and that it was generally welcomed by the MDC .
The opposition believes the proposal appears to represent a recognition by Mbeki - whom Tsvangirai had previously accused of "" colluding with Mugabe to play down the deepening political crisis "" - that the Zimbabwean president 's power is crumbling .
But the MDC remains suspicious of Mbeki and is demanding that the African Union be a party to any deal to ensure it is adhered to .
The proposal nonetheless adds to growing international pressure on Mugabe , who has said that while he is prepared to talk to the opposition , it must first recognise that he is the legitimately elected president and will remain so .
Mbeki 's spokesman , Mukoni Ratshitanga , said he could neither confirm nor deny that such a document exists .
Nigeria is the latest African government to condemn last month 's presidential election , in which Mugabe claimed 90 % of the valid votes after a military - led campaign of violence against the opposition .
Leaders of the Group of Eight industrialised countries are expected to consider taking "" measures "" against Zimbabwe , according to the host of this week 's summit , the Japanese prime minister , Yasuo Fukuda .
A US official said Washington expected the G8 to "" strongly question the legitimacy of [ Mugabe 's ] government "" .
The British foreign secretary , David Miliband , speaking after meeting Zimbabwean refugees in Johannesburg yesterday , said the crisis in their country was "" infecting the whole of southern Africa "" . ""
No one who meets the people here could do anything other than redouble their efforts to secure international consensus that the Mugabe regime is not a legitimate representation of the will of the people of Zimbabwe , "" he said .
He called for international backing for a US proposal at the UN security council for sanctions against Zimbabwe 's leaders .
The MDC source said the party leadership found itself in surprising agreement with much of what Mbeki was proposing , describing it as an important shift from what the opposition described as his previous positions aimed at propping up Mugabe .
The source said "" all the basic ideas of the MDC are there "" , including a recognition of the results of the first round of elections in March won by Tsvangirai .
That would be met by making the MDC leader an executive prime minister .
"" The important thing is that it recognises the outcome of the March 29 election , and that any government will be transitional on the way to new elections , "" the source said .
He said the opposition recognised it would have to make concessions , and that allowing Mugabe to remain as a titular president was acceptable if it laid the ground for a new constitution and a fresh vote .
But there are important areas of difference with Mbeki , particularly an MDC demand for an African Union mediator to work with the South African leader , and for the AU to act as a guarantor of any agreement .
There have yet to be formal negotiations on the proposal .
Mbeki flew to Harare on Saturday for a meeting requested by Tsvangirai .
But the MDC leader pulled out when , according to the opposition , he was called at short notice by the South Africans to a meeting with Mbeki and Mugabe at the presidential offices in Harare .
Tsvangirai was concerned that going to the state house would be seen as conferring recognition on Mugabe as the legitimately elected president .
The MDC also feared that such a meeting would be used by Mbeki to persuade AU and G8 leaders that he was on top of the crisis and there was no need for further international pressure or intervention .
Some of the opposition 's fears proved founded when the leader of a breakaway MDC faction , Arthur Mutambara , was invited to the meeting and pictured on the front of the state - controlled press yesterday smiling and shaking hands with Mugabe .
Mutambara holds the balance of power in the newly elected parliament .
He had previously said his MPs would back Tsvangirai , but there is clearly a concerted effort by the government to get him to side with the ruling Zanu - PF ."
2008-07-18,"As Zimbabwe lurches deeper into crisis this week , with an apparent stalemate in the tentative negotiations between the government and the opposition , the man who salvaged Kenya 's political crisis earlier this year insisted a peace deal was ' doable ' .
Nobel peace winner and former UN secretary general Kofi Annan told the Observer in an exclusive interview that there was a real possibility of a solution in Zimbabwe , but he was scathing about the plight the beleagured country 's people had been left in , saying the worsening situation there "" shamed Africa "" .
Early talks between the oppositon leader , Morgan Tsvangirai , widely believed to have secured an outright win in the March 29 general election , and President Robert Mugabe 's Zanu - PF party broke down yesterday .
Annan , now head of the Africa Progress Panel , the watchdog set up to monitor the development promises made by the G8 countries , urged the west to rethink its image of Africa and not to allow Zimbabwe to bolster the stereotype of a continent in crisis . ""
Zimbabwe shames most Africans but at the same time its wrong to judge the whole continent on what is happening there , it is not a litmus test for the region .
Mozambique came through a civil war extremely admirably , "" he said .
"" You have Botswana doing extremely well , Malawi is making great steps to improve food production , Africans hear all about Zimbabwe and are as concerned as the rest of the world .
It shames us Africans .
"" We all applaud the courage of the Zimbabwean people , they turned out en masse to express their will at the first election and we have to make sure that the Zimbabwean government understands that the will of the people has to be enforced .
"" Annan is still heavily involved in the ongoing mediation efforts in Kenya , he negotiated a way out of the stalemate between President Mwai Kibaki and his challenger , Raila Odinga , after the disputed election results last December provoked a wave of tribal violence in the country . ""
In Kenya , one of the issues was whether there should be a rerun of the election .
In my negotiations between the parties , I got them to understand it was never going to happen
and it was important for them to put their country first .
"" Against all the odds , agreement was finally reached which , says Annan , provides hope for Zimbabwe . ""
For once in Kenya we had a success when it was not the leaders focusing on how to deal up the spoils and that is progress . ""
"" And more and more in Africa the understanding is that you elect people who respect the will of the people .
More than half of African countries are being run by democratically - elected leaders .
The challenges in Africa are still there .
But we should not despair , we are making progress .
There was 6.6 % economic growth last year , which was higher than that of the Middle East . ""
Annan said he believed fervently "" a peace deal is doable "" .
"" They are talking of sending UN envoys in now and already I have talked to people involved and I would of course offer advice and my services . ""
Asked whether he would himself be willing to step in as a negotiator he said : "" Of course I would help because I am an African . ""
"" Each crisis has its own dynamics , its own personality , but in Zimbabwe , the leaders are also going to be held to account by the people and will have to accept that will of the people .
"" What may be more difficult is keeping the attention of the western countries .
With the financial pledges for Africa made by G8 nations at the Gleneagles summit in 2005 already hitting a serious shortfall , and with western countries having to face a credit crunch , Annan admitted there is a real danger of Africa slipping from the world 's conscience .
"" There is some measure of justification that with economic crises around the world , citizens in donor countries are themselves suffering and will be looking inwards .
There will be pressure on politicians or certainly it will be their political instincts to placate their own voters and to look in a domestic direction . ""
In Africa , the problems are being now compounded too by issues caused by worldwide finances .
High transport costs , fertiliser prices have quadrupled so African farmers are only tilling half their land at a time when we desperately need them to be producing food . ""
Climate change is already occurring and Africa is suffering because of the change in rain patterns , there 's progress but also we confront new problems with the global slow down .
"" Annan spoke of the difficultites of getting an international consensus . ""
In the past decade , multilaterism has taken a hit , we have suffered a very grave setback after the Iraq war .
But everyone is beginning to realise now , even the Americans , that we live in an interdependent world .
No one government can settle major issues on its own .
So the pendulum will swing back . ""
His greatest hope is in the young .
"" There are so many wonderfully talented people in Zimbabwe , in Africa , and there are other avenues opening to them , in business and as entreprenurs .
The business sector is slowly developing .
I 'm a stubborn optimist .
It does give me hope .
I think Africa is going to be the next frontier
and we are going to see Africa more going the way of those boom economies like India and China .
"" People tell me the world is 50 % optmist and 50 % pessimist , but what I know for sure is that as an optimist I will die happier . """
2008-07-21,"The rival claimants to victory in Zimbabwe 's widely criticised presidential elections - Robert Mugabe and Morgan Tsvangirai - have agreed to immediately begin intensive talks aimed at establishing a "" new government "" .
At their first meeting in more than a decade , Zimbabwe 's president and the leader of the opposition Movement for Democratic Change yesterday signed a five - page "" memorandum of understanding "" that envisages a fortnight of secret talks by representatives dealing with an array of issues from political violence against the opposition to constitutional reform .
Mugabe , who only a few weeks ago was ruling out any deal with Tsvangirai but has been forced to give ground under myriad pressures including an imploding economy , described the memorandum as a "" serious matter "" .
"" We sit here in order for us to chart a new way , a new way of political interaction , "" he said .
But he added ominously that negotiators must act without influence from the US or Europe .
He has repeatedly accused the opposition of being "" puppets "" of the west when it has demanded that he surrender power .
Tsvangirai , who won the first round of presidential elections in March but pulled out of the run - off last month after a state - orchestrated campaign of killings , torture and abductions against his supporters , said "" not finding a solution is not an option "" .
However , the obstacles to an agreement remain formidable , with Mugabe looking to legitimise the ballot that returned him to office , in which he claimed to have won 90 % of the valid votes , while the opposition says any deal must strip him of power .
South Africa 's president , Thabo Mbeki , oversaw the signing of the agreement at a Harare hotel after Tsvangirai refused to meet Mugabe at the presidential offices because it would infer recognition of his claim to power .
Mbeki , who is likely to claim the agreement as a vindication of his mediation by "" quiet diplomacy "" , said all parties wanted a rapid resolution of the political crisis .
"" It commits the negotiating parties to an intense programme of work to try and finalise the negotiations as quickly as possible , "" he said .
"" All the Zimbabwean parties recognise the urgency of the matters they are discussing and all are committed to trying to complete this process as quickly as possible . ""
Mbeki has previously proposed what amounts to a transitional government with Mugabe as a titular president and real power in the hands of Tsvangirai as an executive prime minister while a coalition draws up a new constitution and holds fresh elections .
The MDC says it can live with that so long as Mugabe is stripped of power .
But Zimbabwe 's leader says that any agreement must recognise his claim to have won last month 's presidential election run - off , even though few foreign governments have done so .
He wants a government of national unity in which the MDC serves under his leadership .
Although the military - led campaign of violence against the opposition has greatly weakened the MDC on the ground , yesterday 's signing is a reflection of the pressures on Mugabe .
The economy is imploding under the weight of hyperinflation , the Zimbabwe dollar loses half its value every day and the country is facing a looming famine after the failure of this year 's harvest .
The government is struggling to find the cash to pay public employees and , more importantly , soldiers at the end of this month .
Mugabe is also under growing pressure to install the new parliament which has yet to sit nearly four months after the election in which his Zanu - PF party lost its majority for the first time since independence in 1980 .
The ruling party 's violence has targeted opposition MPs in recent weeks in what seems to be a strategy to prevent them from taking their seats by beating them up , forcing them in to hiding or arresting them on trumped - up charges .
The MDC says the seating of the new parliament is a crucial test of Mugabe 's intent .
It warns that if it is unable to muster a majority because of the violence against its MPs , and Zanu - PF elects the new speaker , then it will boycott parliament .
The South Africans are keen to portray yesterday 's signing as a diplomatic coup for Mbeki , and a justification for his insistence that the UN security council rejected the US and British plan for sanctions against Zimbabwe 's ruling elite .
But Tsvangirai , who has accused Mbeki of bias toward Mugabe , forced the South African leader to make a humiliating climb down by including envoys from the African Union and UN - Jean Ping and Haile Menkerios - as part of a "" reference group "" handling the crisis ."
2008-07-21,"What will happen in the power - sharing talks ?
The South African president , Thabo Mbeki , will mediate the signing of a memorandum of understanding between the ruling Zanu - PF and the two factions of the opposition Movement for Democratic Change ( MDC ) to outline a framework for a formal agreement to try to resolve Zimbabwe 's political and economic crisis .
Robert Mugabe and Morgan Tsvangirai will both attend the signing in Harare .
What is Tsvangirai likely to agree to ?
Tsvangirai has previously refused to sign even a framework deal unless government militias stop their violence .
One of his key demands has been that the mediation process expands beyond Mbeki , whom he has accused of favouring Mugabe .
Last week it was announced a group of senior diplomats , including representatives from the UN , the African Union and the South African Development Community , would assist Mbeki in the negotiations , widening the mediation process .
The MDC says it is open to a government of national healing - but only one with moderate ruling party members , not Mugabe .
What will Mugabe do next ?
At the time of the election , Mugabe said he would enter talks with the opposition after the vote , suggesting he would try to form the kind of "" government of national unity "" proposed by the African Union by co - opting some members of the MDC .
But Tsvangirai has dismissed this idea .
It would also be dangerous because of the possibility of reprisals against those who refused to take part , and against Zimbabweans who did not vote .
Zanu - PF has said it is open to power - sharing but only if Mugabe heads any unity government .
What happened in the presidential run - off ?
Tsvangirai was Mugabe 's main opponent but withdrew before the polls , saying he could not ask people to endanger their lives by voting for him .
Nonetheless , the electoral commission ruled that Tsvangirai had pulled out too late to cancel the election and it went ahead .
In the end , Mugabe won more than 85 % of the vote but the MDC said most people stayed away from voting .
There have been at least nine murders since the run - off last month .
Was it possible to vote MDC ?
People could have voted for Tsvangirai , whose name remained on the ballot despite his withdrawal .
But few would have taken the risk .
Before evidence of election rigging was revealed in a Guardian film , there had been numerous reports of opposition activists being assaulted and killed by ruling party militants .
Tsvangirai said the structure of the MDC itself was being targeted .
In the run - up to the election , the party was prevented from holding rallies .
Tsvangirai was detained twice and the party 's secretary general , Tendai Biti , was arrested and charged with treason .
Who monitored the election ?
A regional group , the Southern African Development Community , sent more than 200 observers .
Zimbabwean pro - democracy groups tried to field observers , although they met repeated bureaucratic obstacles .
The observers could not move freely , particularly in the areas that had witnessed the worst pre - election violence .
What was the view of the international community ?
International opinion hardened against Mugabe .
The EU backed Tsvangirai 's position on a national unity government and said it believed that if there were to be one , Tsvangirai should lead it to reflect "" the will of the Zimbabwean people "" .
Gordon Brown said the UN should send an envoy to Zimbabwe to begin discussions on a transition agreement , and the US drafted a UN security council resolution for further sanctions against Zimbabwe .
Are there divisions within Zanu - PF ?
Zanu - PF is deeply divided over the course Mugabe is taking .
One of the vice - presidents , Joice Mujuru , and her husband , Solomon , are thought to lead a dissenting faction in the party 's politburo .
Another is led by a former finance minister , Simba Makoni , who stood against Mugabe in the first round of the presidential elections .
But since Zanu - PF 's loss of its majority in the house of assembly elections in March , the politburo has ceded power to a narrower group of hardliners and generals in joint operations command , led by Mugabe 's lieutenant , Emmerson Mnangagwa .
What has been the impact of this on the economy ?
Zimbabwe 's economic collapse under Mugabe 's rule has flooded neighbouring countries with millions of refugees and saddled the once - prosperous country with crippling food and fuel shortages .
On July 21 , the central bank in Zimbabwe issued a new 100 billion dollar note in an attempt to keep up with shortages of cash and the world 's worst inflation running at 2.2 m per cent ."
2008-07-21,"The rival claimants to victory in Zimbabwe 's widely criticised presidential elections - Robert Mugabe and Morgan Tsvangirai - have agreed to immediately begin intensive talks aimed at establishing a "" new government "" .
At their first meeting in more than a decade , Zimbabwe 's president and the leader of the opposition Movement for Democratic Change ( MDC ) today signed a five - page "" memorandum of understanding "" that envisages a fortnight of secret talks by their representatives dealing with an array of issues from political violence against the opposition to constitutional reform .
Mugabe , who only a few weeks ago ruled out any deal with Tsvangirai , has been forced to give ground under a myriad of pressures , including an imploding economy , described in the memorandum as a "" serious matter "" .
"" We sit here in order for us to chart a new way , a new way of political interaction , "" he said .
Mugabe added ominously that negotiators must act without influence from the US or Europe .
He has repeatedly accused the opposition of being "" puppets "" of the west when it has demanded he surrender power .

2008-07-21,"Yesterday 's first meeting for 10 years between Robert Mugabe and Morgan Tsvangirai took place on the day when the Bank of Zimbabwe started issuing banknotes for 100bn dollars - not enough to buy a loaf of bread - and on which fresh allegations surfaced of murder and violence against opposition supporters .
This deepening national disintegration is a far more potent reality for ordinary Zimbabweans than anything that the political adversaries have yet been able to muster .
The onus is therefore on those who promoted yesterday 's deal to show they are not building a house made of straw .
As this paper reported yesterday , millions of Zimbabweans have been reduced to a scorched earth existence merely to survive .
Harvest failure , brought on in part by mishandled land redistribution schemes , has forced many to sell precious livestock to survive and driven tens of thousands from the land to the towns and from Zimbabwe to South Africa .
Inside Zimbabwe , with its debauched currency , true survival is only possible for the Zanu - PF kleptocracy around Mr Mugabe .
According to the United Nations , 5 million people need urgent food aid that Mr Mugabe denies them on the grounds it is all a colonialist plot .
One in three Zimbabweans is malnourished .
Food shortages and inequalities threaten health and livelihood on a scale that the regime is neither capable of nor interested in combating .
If their needs are to be meaningfully addressed , Zimbabweans will need more than two men 's signatures on a piece of paper - especially when one of those belongs to Mr Mugabe .
This is not to deny that yesterday 's meeting is a sign that the status quo - economically , socially and in the shape of Mr Mugabe 's shamelessly dishonest re - election - is now indefensible .
Mr Mugabe and Mr Tsvangirai would not have met at all if the crisis had still been subcontracted to South Africa 's President Thabo Mbeki .
International pressure from Africa and beyond has combined with mounting domestic instability to force yesterday 's show of joint action .
Yesterday 's meeting and agreement , though , are little more than symbols of a preparedness to talk about a situation that is out of control .
It is not a real answer to the country 's needs .
Mr Mugabe 's real intentions remain hugely suspect , while even Mr Tsvangirai dubbed yesterday 's meeting merely tentative .
That is why the crucial questions remain those about Mr Mugabe , his network and his regime .
They are the fundamental cause of Zimbabwe 's problem and they can not be part of its solution except on terms at odds with their own instincts and self - interest .
Until those issues are confronted not ducked , Mr Mugabe 's commitment to change will be as worthless as one of his banknotes ."
2008-07-21,"Robert Mugabe 's ZANU PF party and Morgan Tsvangirai 's MDC party are reportedly close to signing a deal setting out a framework for talks on the country 's political crisis .
A political stalemate exists between both sides over the legitimacy of last month 's violent one - man presidential election runoff won by Mugabe .
The move towards the beginning of talks has been welcomed in some quarters with Zimbabwe 's leading labour group , the ZCTU , calling for the talks to be conducted swiftly because "" the economy is in bad shape "" .
Tsvangirai is reported to be in favour of pressing ahead with negotiations on the grounds that "" the people have suffered enough "" .
This emerging rush to reach a power - sharing deal between Zimbabwe 's contending political parties risks papering over the need to address the country 's enduring legacies of violence , impunity and pseudo - reconciliation .
Zimbabwe experienced one of the most bloody and bitterly fought wars against colonialism in Africa .
There were untold human rights violations on both sides but these were never addressed because of an independence settlement reached at Lancaster House that did not lay a constructive foundation for nation - building .
Systematic racial discrimination was the pillar of white domination in the colonial years but its negative legacies were not tackled post - independence .
Race relations remained problematic from 1980 but the subject was never taken seriously and some even romanticised independent Zimbabwe 's so - called racial reconciliation .
The British - sponsored , short - sighted Lancaster House agreement was more intent on appeasing and protecting the white minority 's privileges than it was long - term nation building .
The Lancaster House agreement left white Zimbabweans susceptible to envy and resentment by a majority black population that understood white dominance in terms of unresolved colonial legacies , fertile earth for demagogues attempting to rouse nationalist sentiment .
Mugabe had preferred a total military victory over the white - settler government .
His eventual resort to reconciliation was expedient .
The language of racial reconciliation bought western acceptance for his government , which many had feared would espouse communism and disregard private property rights by nationalising white - owned assets .
These unresolved legacies are part of the seed for the violent anti - white farm seizures that erupted in 2000 .
The early independence emphasis on racial reconciliation resulted in the neglect of the need for meaningful reconciliation within the black population .
Little surprise that in the early 1980s Mugabe ordered a campaign of violence aimed at crushing the Matabeleland province 's allegiance to ZAPU , a rival black nationalist party to Mugabe 's Zanu - PF .
Up to 20,000 lives were lost .
There is no existing official explanation for the atrocities and the victims have been disallowed the right to articulate their victim - hood publicly .
There have been other violent episodes in Zimbabwe 's independence period history , all of which are unaccounted for officially , nor has any form of justice been served .
In 1980 , hundreds of Zimbabwean strikers were arrested and others killed during state repression of massive strikes mostly against multi - national corporations .
In popular riots against the Zanu - PF government over increases in the price of basic commodities in 1998 , Zimbabwe 's military forces , equipped with live ammunition , guns , teargas , baton sticks and armoured vehicles , were deployed in the townships to suppress the unrest .
Mass violence , beatings , intimidation and looting ensued for three days .
Uncounted deaths , injuries and arrests transpired .
In 2005 , the Mugabe government carried out Operation Murambatsvina – a nationwide "" urban clean - up "" – in which more than 569,000 Zimbabweans lost their homes in evictions which , according to a UN report ( pdf ) "" took place before alternatives could be provided , thereby violating human rights and several provisions of national and international law "" .
The disturbing violence and human rights abuses witnessed in Zimbabwe 's presidential election runoff have some of their roots in the country 's unresolved legacies of impunity , intolerance and the primacy of a coercive state .
The current diplomatic push to reach a political deal in Zimbabwe must not overlook the pertinence of resolving these negative legacies once and for all .
If they are disregarded , as they were at Lancaster House and throughout the post - independence period , Zimbabwe will experience more violent occurrences in future – and the international media , concerned states , and international and regional bodies will once again look on helplessly wondering , "" how can such violence be happening ? """
2008-07-22,"Monday 's face - to - face meeting and handshake between Robert Mugabe and Morgan Tsvangirai in Harare to sign a "" preliminary agreement laying out terms for negotiations to wrest their land out of political chaos "" ( as the New York Times described it ) has to be judged for what it is .
This is a historic moment and even some us used to the double - dealing of Mugabe 's regime and that of Thabo Mbeki , the South African president and mediator between the parties , should celebrate it for that reason .
This is the first time the two men met since the late 1990s ( in 1999 , to be exact ) , when Mugabe was forced to meet with Tsvangirai , then head of the country 's trade union movement .
The meeting also represents somewhat of a climbdown for Mugabe , and his junta , who had vowed to govern until God removed him ( shades of Rhodesian leader Ian Smith 's "" 1,000 years "" ) and whose only response to Tsvangirai and his supporters since they first defeated Mugabe and Zanu - PF in a referendum in 2000 has been violence , murder and intimidation and outright electoral fraud .
Reports of the meeting describe Mugabe as striking more measured tones than his until now strident and incendiary rhetoric .
What happens ahead is contingent on a number of factors : there are the security forces ( the army and police ) , which both act as the private army of the ruling Zanu - PF party , state violence ( the agreement creates the pretence that both the state / Zanu - PF , on the one hand , and the opposition MDC , on the other , are equally culpable ) , and new ethical rules about the governance of state organs ( reforming electoral machinery for one ) and equal access to public media
( it is interesting that the government put the issue of "" external radio stations on the agenda "" an obvious reference to the British - based SW Radio Africa ) .
Finally , there is the question of Mr Mugabe 's legitimacy .
The last has consequences for how power will be distributed between the parties in any transitional government .
After Tsvangirai won a March 29 presidential election , the Zimbabwean government held back the result for a month , and said the opposition had not won by a large enough margin and called a new election .
Having terrorised the opposition supporters to the point where Morgan Tsvangirai felt compelled to withdraw at the last minute , Robert Mugabe went ahead , ran again himself and declared himself president for another six - year term .
As most news organisations reported , yesterday 's agreement , apart from imploring the parties ( including a Zanu - PF - leaning MDC faction sit down and talk ) does not address the central issue of Mr Mugabe 's future or goes into the details of any power - sharing arrangement .
So , what about the third major personality in this drama : Thabo Mbeki ?
Of course , Mbeki ( and what 's left of his supporters and defenders ) will claim that his policy of "" quiet diplomacy "" has worked .
Mbeki can definitely take credit for yesterday 's meeting , but that comes after eight years of despotism , hundreds of deaths , thousands homeless , and the devastation of the Zimbabwean economy .
In the process , Mbeki has also left Mugabe emboldened ( let us remember that Mugabe still holds the upper hand : he is in office , controls what 's left of the state , has the loyalty of the army , the police , prison services , electoral commission and means of propaganda ) .
And , as reports from South Africa indicate , the Mbeki policy has been privately opposed to granting the MDC a seat at the table , favoring a Zanu - PF - leaning opposition candidate , the former finance minister Simba Makoni .
Ultimately , general international pressure has been the telling factor .
It is significant that this meeting happened after Mbeki was forced to include African Union and United Nations representatives on his mediating team .
In the end , Mbeki does deserve some credit as this was probably the only process Mugabe would engage with .
But it also may be the case that Mbeki 's own influence will wane now ."
2008-07-24,"Power - sharing talks between Zimbabwe 's ruling party and opposition leaders began in earnest in South Africa today , with the two sides discussing terms for the formation of a unity government to end the country 's political crisis .
Despite a media blackout , Zimbabwe 's state - owned Herald newspaper reported that negotiators for Morgan Tsvangirai 's Movement for Democratic Change ( MDC ) and
Robert Mugabe 's Zanu - PF flew to South Africa on the same flight yesterday .
A South African paper said observers were optimistic about a final settlement being reached because the two sides had already agreed on many points on the agenda . ""
They have agreed on most of the issues except mainly the framework for a new government , Business Day quoted a source as saying .
"" The deal is basically done , but what remains are a few issues of detail , implementation and logistics . ""
An MDC official told Reuters : "" I can confirm that the substantive talks are kicking off right now in South Africa , but part of the agreement that we signed with Zanu - PF forbids the negotiating parties from talking to the media so I can not say more . ""
Patrick Chinamasa , the justice minister , and Nicholas Goche , the public services minister , will represent Zanu - PF , while Tendai Biti , the MDC secretary general , and Elton Mangoma , the deputy treasurer , will represent Tsvangirai .
The Herald newspaper said Zanu - PF 's decision - making politburo yesterday gave party negotiators approval to continue with the talks .
A senior Zanu - PF official was quoted as saying the politburo had expressed satisfaction with a framework deal signed by Mugabe , Tsvangirai and a smaller MDC faction .
The talks in Pretoria over the next two weeks will cover the objectives and priorities of a new government : a new constitution , restoration of economic stability and growth , sanctions , and the vexed issue of land redistribution .
Business Day said a quick deal is expected because the final agreement would be based on a document approved , but not signed , by the parties in January after eight months of talks .
The paper said the parties had failed to sign owing to clashes over the date of elections and the mechanics of implementing the agreement .
Mugabe reportedly would prefer to remain as executive president while Tsvangirai becomes prime minister .
However , Tsvangirai has said he would want to be prime minister with Mugabe as non - executive president .
Thabo Mbeki , the South African president , is pressing for a final deal by next month , when he takes over as Southern African Development Community ( Sadc ) chairman .
Mbeki , who was appointed mediator by Sadc last year , reportedly lobbied China to block UN sanctions on Harare , while putting pressure on Mugabe to accept a deal .
Angola today urged the EU to lift all sanctions against Zimbabwean officials on the grounds that they were obstructing negotiations .
"" There is no reason to justify the maintenance of these sanctions , '' Joao Bernardo Miranda , the foreign minister , said in an interview today on state - run Angolan National Radio .
"" The EU should very soon lift all sanctions against the leaders of Zimbabwe . ''
The EU announced yesterday that another 37 people linked to Mugabe 's ruling party would be added to its list of 131 people already targeted with sanctions .
The measures include asset freezes and travel bans ."
2008-07-28,"Power - sharing talks in Zimbabwe between the government and opposition were near collapse last night , as negotiations faltered over the role of Morgan Tsvangirai in a possible unity government .
President Robert Mugabe 's envoys left the talks in Pretoria , which had started on Thursday , with no sign of agreement .
An official of the Movement for Democratic Change opposition said Mugabe 's men were only mandated to negotiate the position of vice - presidency . ""
The MDC is the largest party in parliament , and all they could offer was the vice - presidency ?
Obviously , the MDC 's position is that that 's not acceptable , "" the official told Reuters .
Mugabe 's chief negotiators - justice minister Patrick Chinamasa , and social welfare minister Nicholas Goche - were reported to have left South Africa to fly to Harare for consultations .
A media blackout surrounding the talks makes it difficult to gauge the significance of the decision to leave .
A spokesman for Thabo Mbeki , the South African president and the longtime mediator between the parties , denied any deadlock .
Zimbabwe 's information minister , Sikhanyiso Ndlovu , had earlier told state media that "" the dialogue process is going on smoothly , and we are sure that a positive outcome would be achieved "" .
Tsvangirai had flown to South Africa earlier yesterday on a private visit , though he was expected to meet his negotiating team , headed by party secretary general Tendai Biti , to discuss progress .
When the MDC won parliamentary elections , Tsvangirai also won the first round of the presidential election ; he pulled out of the run - off with Mugabe due to widespread violence and intimidation of the opposition .
As the only candidate , Mugabe won the election , but it was criticised as a sham across Africa and the world .
The issue of who would lead a coalition governmentwas always going to be the biggest sticking point ."
2008-08-06,"Robert Mugabe and Morgan Tsvangirai - rival claimants to power in Zimbabwe - are expected to hold direct talks on a power - sharing deal today , but crucial disagreements remain over how much authority the president will continue to wield .
The negotiations are based on a proposal by South Africa 's president , Thabo Mbeki , for Mugabe to remain as a titular president , with a guarantee that he will not be prosecuted for past crimes , while political power shifts to Tsvangirai as an executive prime minister because he won the last election acceptable as credible - the first round of voting for president in March .
Mbeki is expected to travel to Harare in the coming days , but possibly as early as today , to press forward the deal .
Tsvangirai 's Movement for Democratic Change broadly welcomed such an agreement when Mbeki first proposed it in June , provided that it established a transitional administration with a focus on writing a new constitution and holding fresh elections within two years .
However , the MDC is hesitant to endorse a blanket amnesty for leaders of the ruling Zanu - PF who have overseen a bloody campaign of murder , abduction , rape and beatings against opposition supporters in recent months .
Mbeki 's aides have talked up the negotiations , suggesting that Mugabe also broadly agrees with the terms of the deal .
But there remain serious doubts over whether Mugabe and the hardline Zanu - PF leaders around him who pursued their campaign to break support for the opposition in the June presidential run - off would give it all away at the negotiating table .
Sources close to the talks say that Zanu - PF is insisting on Mugabe retaining many of his powers as president and on Tsvangirai , as prime minister , being forced to appoint a deputy prime minister from Zanu - PF .
A likely candidate for the post is Emmerson Mnangagwa , the head of the Joint Operations Command who is widely regarded as an architect of the terror campaign against voters .
A greater stake in government would not only permit senior Zanu - PF officials to maintain the considerable patronage they wield but offer protection from prosecution for their crimes , recent and distant .
Mnangagwa , for instance , is not only vulnerable to prosecution over the state - orchestrated campaign against the MDC and its supporters but also as state security minister during the Matabeleland massacres of about 20,000 people by the army in the 1980s .
Zanu - PF also wants a powersharing deal to be kept in place for five years , putting off elections that are likely to see the party devastated if there is a clean vote .
Senior MDC officials suspect that Mugabe is trying to buy time in the hope that Tsvangirai will pull out of the talks and be blamed for their collapse ."
2008-08-09,"South African president Thabo Mbeki flew to Harare last night as Zimbabwe 's government and main opposition party appeared to be moving ever closer to a power - sharing agreement .
Early reports suggest that President Robert Mugabe has agreed to opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai becoming Prime Minister , although the extent of his powers were still under discussion , a Zanu - PF official said last night .
A breakthrough is believed to have been reached when Tsvangirai 's opposition party , the Movement for Democratic Change ( MDC ) , agreed to recognise Mugabe 's legitimacy as President .
Mugabe will meet Tsvangirai today to discuss forming a possible unity government .
Mbeki , who is mediating the talks between Mugabe and Tsvangirai , is scheduled to meet both today , according to the state - run Herald newspaper in Zimbabwe .
The move by Mbeki comes after two weeks of secretive negotiations in South Africa between representatives of Mugabe and Tsvangirai .
Both claim that they are the rightful leader of Zimbabwe following two rounds of controversial presidential elections in March and June .
A smaller opposition party , an offshoot of the MDC headed by Arthur Mutambara , is also involved in the negotiations .
Mugabe and Tsvangirai are bitter rivals , and their meeting in Harare on 21 July was their first face - to - face encounter in a decade .
South Africa 's respected Business Day newspaper said yesterday that the political leaders were due to hold make - or - break talks today .
Reports from South Africa have suggested that Mbeki is pushing for a power - sharing deal that would see Mugabe remain as President , but only in a ceremonial role , with Tsvangirai running the country as Prime Minister .
A quick political settlement is seen as the key to halting Zimbabwe 's deepening socio - economic crisis .
Inflation is running at 2.2 million per cent , and a quarter of the population is reliant on food aid .
Humanitarian agencies have been operating under heavy restrictions since early June , when the government accused them of favouring the opposition .
Complicating the negotiations is the strong influence that the army and police chiefs have over Mugabe .
These forces were responsible for the campaign of violence and intimidation against supporters of the MDC during the election period .
Analysts say that senior security officials will not agree to a deal without a blanket amnesty to protect them from international prosecution .
Tsvangirai , who defeated Mugabe in the first round of elections but pulled out of the run - off because of the escalating violence , has said that he is willing to work with moderate Zanu - PF officials but not to share power directly with Mugabe .
He also wants fresh elections to be held within two years .
Mbeki is desperate to secure a political agreement .
In recent years he has come under heavy criticism , both internationally and at home , for pursuing a policy of quiet diplomacy regarding neighbouring Zimbabwe .
But Mbeki has said that denunciations and sanctions - broadly speaking , the tactics of the West towards Mugabe and his cronies - only served to further antagonise the government ."
2008-08-10,"Robert Mugabe and Morgan Tsvangirai were locked in make - or - break talks last night over how power will be distributed in a coalition government aimed at ending Zimbabwe 's deepening political and economic crisis .
The two sides have reached broad agreement that Mugabe will remain president and Tsvangirai will be prime minister at the head of a large cabinet divided evenly between their two parties , but with a smaller opposition faction holding the balance of posts .
Sources close to the talks , mediated by South Africa 's president , Thabo Mbeki , said there remained significant differences over key issues that will decide whether Mugabe retains real control of the government , in effect overturning Tsvangirai 's victory in the March presidential election .
Mbeki was pushing for an agreement that would not only resolve Zimbabwe 's crisis but permit him to claim that his strategy of quiet diplomacy , derided in the west as a failure , was ultimately successful .
In June , Mbeki proposed that Mugabe remain as a titular president , after 28 years in total control , with executive powers transferred to Tsvangirai as prime minister .
Mugabe went into yesterday 's meeting determined not to cede most of his powers , while Tsvangirai argued that he won a mandate to govern from the people in the March election - the last one widely considered to be largely legitimate .
Tsvangirai 's Movement for Democratic Change ( MDC ) said before the talks that while it would accept Mugabe in a ceremonial role , if he were to retain significant powers it would reward his Zanu - PF party 's campaign of killings , beatings , abductions and rapes that broke opposition support in a second round of elections in June .
Among the other issues in dispute is the composition of the cabinet .
Mugabe wants it to have 36 ministers , with Zanu - PF and the MDC holding 15 seats each and the remaining six held by a breakaway faction of the MDC headed by Arthur Mutambara .
Tsvangirai wants a smaller cabinet and Mutambara to have only two seats .
Zanu - PF is keen for a large number of cabinet seats in part because party leaders see sitting in government as a means of perpetuating their patronage and ensuring they are not prosecuted for past crimes .
There is also wrangling over who will hold the most powerful portfolios .
The MDC is anxious to control the ministries that oversee the police and intelligence services , believing that they are the key to ensuring that future elections are free and fair after the two organisations were roped in to the violent and bloody state - orchestrated campaign against opposition supporters .
Tsvangirai is less concerned about winning control over the army , which the opposition believes will be loyal to the government of the day .
The two parties also disagree over how long the incoming administration will serve .
The MDC wants it to sit for about two years , during which a new constitution will be written and elections held .
Zanu - PF favours a government serving a full five - year term , in part because if another ballot is held in the near future the party is likely to suffer a devastating defeat , while several years from now Zimbabweans may be less enamoured of the MDC , after they have seen it in power .
Tsvangirai holds a number of important cards in the talks .
There will be no significant financial aid from the west to stabilise Zimbabwe 's economy amid hyperinflation expected to rise to 50,000,000 % this month , without a significant shift in power to the MDC leader .
Britain , the US and the EU have all said that a £ 1bn aid package will only be released if Mugabe relinquishes control of the government .
It could also be argued that Mbeki needs an agreement as much as Tsvangirai in order to justify his much - criticised Zimbabwe policy and regain some of his rapidly eroding political credibility at home .
Some of those who have backed Tsvangirai fear he may be desperate to become prime minister and give too much away .
The Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions , which Tsvangirai once headed and which gave birth to the MDC , has criticised the fact that negotiations take place behind closed doors with only political parties present .
It said the talks should "" reflect the will of the people of Zimbabwe and not self - seeking , power - sharing agendas "" . ""
Zimbabwe is not made up of supporters of Zanu - PF and MDC alone , but a plethora of groupings which have to be consulted if the process is to gain wider acceptance by the majority , "" it said last month when talks were announced .
Backstory Zimbabwe 's political negotiations come against a background of rapid economic collapse , driven by hyper - inflation , which brought large parts of the country to the brink of starvation .
The government officially puts inflation at 2,200,000 % but economists say that it was closer to 10,000,000 % last month and they estimate it will rise to about 50,000,000 % in August .
This month , the central bank removed 10 zeros from the Zimbabwe dollar because rapid devaluation had dragged it to Z$1.5tn to the pound .
The currency has continued to implode , losing half of its value in a week .
The World Food Programme warned that up to 5.1 million Zimbabweans - nearly one third of the population - will need food aid this year because the economic crisis and the redistribution of formerly white - owned farms has led to a collapse in crop production ."
2008-08-11,"Talks to end Zimbabwe 's political crisis were bogged down yesterday as Morgan Tsvangirai resisted intense pressure to agree to Robert Mugabe retaining much of his power .
A second day of gruelling negotiations broke up last night without agreement and Mugabe gave a downbeat assessment , saying they were not making progress at present but that he hoped differences "" will be overcome "" when the talks resume today .
Opposition officials say Mugabe has made few real concessions and has rejected Tsvangirai 's claim to be the country 's legitimate leader because he won the last credible election , held in March .
Tsvangirai agreed to Mugabe remaining in office as a ceremonial president but demanded that political power be shifted to him as an executive prime minister at the head of a coalition cabinet .
But the opposition said Mugabe had demanded that the prime minister remain subordinate to the president . ""
Zanu - PF is not talking about conceding any real power .
They are talking about giving up positions in cabinet but they want to remain in control .
These guys are n't serious , "" the opposition official said .
"" The differences revolve around who will have power .
They 're not giving up anything on that .
They entered these negotiations solely to give up cosmetic issues . ""
A spokesman for the opposition said Tsvangirai came under pressure from South Africa 's president , Thabo Mbeki , who is acting as mediator , to allow Mugabe to keep some degree of real power .
But the spokesman said the MDC leader argued that would be a betrayal of the voters .
"" There is a lot of pressure on Tsvangirai ...
People in the party are telling him that he can not agree to a deal that does not recognise the people 's will and democracy .
Mugabe ... should not be allowed to keep power just because he terrorised the population into voting for him . ""
The pressure for us is coming from the people .
They do n't want to see some kind of half - hearted change .
If we were to do that we would lose credibility .
If Morgan takes something cosmetic from Zanu - PF he will lose the support of the Zimbabwean people . ""
Hours earlier Mugabe described the talks as "" raising the prospect for an all - inclusive government "" and said only minor obstacles remained to an agreement .
He told the annual commemoration to mark the country 's liberation war yesterday that Zimbabwe "" is not for sale "" and warned the opposition not to be "" used by enemies "" - usually meant to refer to Britain , which he has accused of destroying Zimbabwe 's economy as a punishment for redistributing white - owned farms ."
2008-08-12,"Robert Mugabe 's officials claimed to have reached a deal to form a coalition government with a minor opposition faction yesterday in the hope of winning international legitimacy after talks with the president 's main rival , Morgan Tsvangirai , collapsed when Zimbabwe 's leader refused to relinquish power .
An agreement between Mugabe and Arthur Mutambara , leader of a breakaway group from Tsvangirai 's Movement for Democratic Change , to form a national unity administration could give the president control of the new parliament .
But it would not open the door to the foreign aid Zimbabwe needs to stabilise its wrecked economy , which is collapsing under inflation estimated at above 10 m per cent .
Britain and other foreign donors have said they will not unlock a £ 1bn aid package until Mugabe relinquishes power to Tsvangirai who won the first round of presidential elections in March but withdrew from a run - off contest three months later amid a state - sponsored campaign of murder , beatings and abductions against his supporters .
The terms of any deal with Mutambara were not immediately clear , although it is likely Mugabe offered him the newly created post of prime minister or a vice - presidency and some cabinet posts .
Mugabe will retain real power .
Mutambara 's faction holds just 10 seats in parliament but they represent the balance of power and could keep Zanu - PF in control after it lost its outright majority for the first time since independence 28 years ago .
However , it is not certain that all of the Mutambara faction would support a deal with Mugabe .
Some of Mutambara 's aides denied Zanu - PF 's claims of an agreement and it may yet prove to be a negotiating tactic to add to pressure on Tsvangirai .
Mutambara , an Oxford - educated robotics professor who appeared to look down on Tsvangirai as his intellectual inferior but who failed to connect with the mass of voters , said he would make an announcement today .
But South Africa 's president , Thabo Mbeki , who mediated the talks in Harare , said Mugabe and Mutambara were "" agreed "" on the terms of a deal while Tsvangirai objected .
Mbeki said the talks had not failed and were adjourned to give Tsvangirai time to consider the issues .
But sources close to the MDC leader said the three days of negotiations in Harare ran into the ground after Mugabe agreed to appoint Tsvangirai as prime minister but insisted on retaining ultimate authority over government .
Among the Zimbabwean leader 's demands was that he be the most senior member of the cabinet .
Mugabe also rejected significant constitutional reform and insisted that a new coalition administration under his authority serve a full five - year term .
Tsvangirai wanted an interim government of about two years before new elections . ""
Mugabe wanted Tsvangirai as a ceremonial prime minister .
There was never any serious intent by Mugabe to give up power , "" said a source close to the negotiations .
"" There is no future for these talks unless the facilitator [ Mbeki ] is able to come forward with proposals that demonstrate a change in Mugabe 's position . ""
Last night Mugabe 's supporters were attempting to blame Tsvangirai for the failure of the negotiations , accusing him of storming out of the talks when they did not go his way .
The MDC said Tsvangirai left when the meetings were finished .
Mbeki has persistently talked up the prospects for a deal between the two main rivals for power .
He arrived on Sunday with his aides predicting an agreement within the day in the hopes that a new government and parliament would be installed this week ; that would have permitted Mbeki to claim a great success at a regional heads of government summit in Johannesburg this weekend .
But a source close to the talks described Mbeki 's role as "" hopelessly weak "" .
The source said : "" The pressure only went one way , on Tsvangirai , and he had no proposals to break the logjam . ""
Human Rights Watch yesterday said the state - orchestrated campaign of violence against the opposition had claimed at least 163 lives with more than 5,000 others beaten and tortured .

2008-08-12,"No one seriously expected that the two - week time frame laid down in the July 21 memorandum of understanding would be met .
That time frame was a marker : the issues were too serious , and the divisions between the principal stakeholders , Morgan Tsvangirai 's MDC and Robert Mugabe 's Zanu - PF , were too great for an easy solution .
Indeed , a quick settlement would have been greeted with scepticism by Zimbabweans , because it would indicate that there had been a wholesale capitulation by one side to the demands of the other side .
In politics , as in life , there are no free lunches .
The chief negotiators have been locked in talks in Pretoria and Harare since the memorandum was signed .
There have been few official progress updates , other than bland announcements that progress is being made , that there are "" sticking points "" , but that the talks are continuing .
Although the two - week time frame has clearly not been met , all stakeholders are intensely aware that time is of the essence .
President Mbeki , chief mediator in the talks , will be attending the SADC heads of government meeting on August 16 - 17 , and he desperately wants , and needs , to be able to report on tangible progress in the talks .
For Robert Mugabe and Zanu - PF , the recent revaluation of the Zimbabwe dollar and a rash of other currency changes may have made it easier to count the money , but in real terms , it has all the effectiveness of putting a sticking plaster on a cancer .
Zimbabwe 's inflation rate and soaring cost of living have become untenable for millions of Zimbabweans , and there is the very real prospect of mass starvation if a political solution is not found .
This , in itself , is not what is driving Zanu - PF to negotiate ; sooner rather than later , there will be no funds left in the national coffers to pay the security sector and , as sanctions begin to bite , there will be no remaining avenues for raising funds .
For Tsvangirai 's MDC , there is the very real risk that if it fails to reach agreement , there will be a return to violence and a likely internal settlement between Zanu - PF and the Mutambara faction of the MDC .
The first and fundamental question is whether the two sides are discussing a government of national unity ( GNU ) , similar to the 1987 unity accord between Zanu and Zapu ( which led to the demise of the latter ) ; or a transitional authority .
In purely emotional terms , Zanu - PF would prefer a GNU , because , for them , it revives happy memories of the 1987 agreement which allowed Zanu - PF to consolidate its power at the expense of Zapu .
In practical terms , a GNU as political endpoint would offer a way out for Zanu - PF .
The GNU would have a shelf life of up to five years – plenty of time for the party to regroup , rebrand itself as the "" new Zanu - PF "" by moving towards the political centre , and begin the subtle "" Zanu - fication "" of the MDC .
A long - term coalition partnership between the MDC and Zanu - PF would restrict the former 's moral and practical room for manoeuvre .
Just as importantly , a GNU would shelve the "" norm "" pushed by western governments of a "" winner takes all "" , maximalist electoral democracy , which would result in Zanu - PF becoming the party of opposition .
A transitional government with a limited life of two years , a constitutional review and credible elections within that period , would place the political process more within the MDC 's control , because this would allow the MDC to present the authority as a necessary , but temporary phase on the road to transformation , alleviating charges that the MDC had "" sold out "" to Zanu - PF .
The relative role and powers of Mugabe and Tsvangirai are the issues that have caused the most acrimony .
Initially , both men wanted the executive presidency , but Mugabe made it clear that this was a non - negotiable condition .
The question , then , was : if not the presidency , then what role for Tsvangirai ?
The answer : he would become prime minister , with Mugabe as president .
This much was expected , and tallies with Zimbabwe 's political tradition of strongly executive prime ministers and ceremonial presidents , dating back to Rhodesian days .
There has thus been much speculation that Tsvangirai will become an executive prime minister , while Mugabe becomes a figurehead .
This will not happen , any more than Tsvangirai would agree to become a figurehead prime minister – all frequent flier miles and no substance .
Neither will he permit himself to become a hollow man .
Each side , therefore , has accused the other of delaying a deal by insisting on power .
Is Tsvangirai right in insisting on some degree of power ?
Absolutely : a transitional government , which answers only to Mugabe , will not bring progress to Zimbabwe ; nor will it bring in investment .
In addition , it is vital that the MDC demonstrates that it can be a tough negotiator if it is to gain respect from Zanu - PF and end the perennial criticism that they are political babes in the wood .
Hard power requires hard talk .
There will probably be a laborious "" French model "" , by which authority is parcelled out in gobbets to both men .
The MDC does have to be realistic , however : Mugabe 's authority will certainly be gradually reduced over time , and this is crucial for Zimbabwe 's reconstruction , but attempting to remove him from the frame now could actually be counter - productive .
No one can deny that Mugabe is certainly a huge part of the problem – but he is also part of the solution , particularly with regard to the hardliners in the security sector .
Assuming that he is "" incentivised "" , Mugabe is the only figure with enough authority to corral the militants within the security apparatus , and push them to create an enabling environment for peace .
In addition , there is the question of "" saving face "" ; even as the 2008 Heroes ' Day celebrations are dedicated to Joshua Nkomo , it is clear that the dedication is not merely to try and appropriate Zapu 's legacy , but also for Mugabe to send a coded warning that he does not intend to meet the same fate as Nkomo .
And so begins the internal scramble for Zimbabwe , as both sides parcel out portfolios , as if playing a game of nhodo .
The security sector wo n't budge on the army , air force , CIO and home affairs ministry , all of which they see as strategic sectors .
The MDC will get the police , finance and , possibly , agriculture , but they 'll have a tough task to prise foreign affairs from Zanu - PF .
Reportedly , there are plans afoot to replace the JOC with a national security council ( NSC ) , which would include representatives from both parties .
The 2006 national security council , which contained the military top brass , set up nine taskforces to manage Zimbabwe 's crumbling economy .
The role of the security sector is a major issue : the MDC 's adherence to non - violent change has given it a moral authority , which Zanu - PF utterly lacks , but it also allows the generals to claim that the MDC officials are civilians who do n't deserve a place at the military table .
The power of the military will not be broken in the short term , but it is vital for the agreement to create mechanisms to dilute its power .
This means making the military accountable to parliament .
Parliament itself has to be depoliticised – in the best sense of the word – and re - professionalised .
If the NSC is created , it will need representation from civilian as well as military stakeholders , and it must be a transitional mechanism with a finite term of duty and roles .
Much has been said about the MDC 's parliamentary majority as providing leverage against Zanu - PF during the negotiations .
While its majority is important , we should n't kid ourselves that this is what has driven Zanu - PF to the table .
The MDC 's majority is , after all , notional – they are heavily dependent on the mercurial Mutambara faction for this majority , and Mutambara 's group seesaws between the two key stakeholders .
Zanu - PF is a past master at using political carrots and sticks , in parliament and elsewhere , to have its way .
The numbers are a start , but the real issue is how to end the culture of political corruption and militarism which has become all - pervasive .
The key lies in building into the agreement processes , which will re - professionalise and empower Zimbabwe 's political institutions .
This entails a pragmatic , functional compact between political sector , business , the security sector and civil society .
The relationship between the soldiers and civil society , in particular , has been poisonous , yet both sides will have to put aside their prejudices to make an agreement work ; this is not yet a time for abolitionists .
If the MDC can not sit at the soldiers ' top table , it has to push for authority over the judiciary , because , in the long term , this is the ministry that will determine Zimbabwe 's long - term governance .
A deal that allows Zanu - PF to retain control over the soldiers and the judges will leave the status quo intact .
In addition , strengthening parliamentary committees and oversight mechanisms is an essential component of reintroducing parliamentary accountability .
In the 1980s , we used to have a prime minister 's question time – the symbolic significance of reintroducing this would be very valuable .
Will the final deal essentially be an elite compact , an ambivalent hybrid agreement , which does n't represent the real wishes of Zimbabweans ?
The secrecy surrounding the negotiations does not inspire confidence .
For both Zanu - PF supporters , but more so for the MDC supporters , there are serious concerns as to what kind of deal is being made .
There has been little consultation with the people , and there is little chance of a referendum to ratify or reject whatever is hammered out .
There is also the question of external agendas .
Who ultimately benefits from a final agreement ?
The MDC needs a deal it can "" sell "" to London and Washington ; Mugabe needs a deal which he can sell to the hawks in the JOC ; Mbeki needs a deal he can sell to SADC and the African Union .
But will it be a deal that addresses the real needs of ordinary Zimbabweans ?
The question of transitional justice is vital .
There is a huge moral imperative to try the organisers and perpetrators of political violence , but the sobering reality is that the generals will not be tried anytime soon .
Much has been said about giving a "" soft landing "" to the security sector ; for the soldiers , who , after all , are the ones in power , the issue is more one of giving a "" soft landing "" to the MDC .
The military will not agree to detailed proposals for human rights tribunals .
What may be agreed is a diluted annexe to any agreement , which stipulates the need for compensation to be paid to the victims of violence , but which does n't directly blame Zanu - PF ; and a broad agreement on the need for justice against the perpetrators of the violence .
There will be nothing specific , and the question of justice and compensation for the 1980s Gukurahundi and 2000 - 2008 atrocities will not be directly addressed .
In the short term , the deal will trade peace for justice .
The talks will proceed in fits and starts , but ultimately a deal will be reached .
It is likely to be a collage , a democurenga accord ; but at least it will be a start ."

2008-08-14,"Trying to predict the outcome of the power sharing negotiations between Robert Mugabe 's Zanu - PF , Morgan Tsvangirai 's MDC and the Arthur Mutambara MDC is a leap in the dark .
The negotiating parties agreed to a wholesale media blackout before the talks began .
Accordingly , they have given very little away , barring a dribble of spin lapped up by a gullible and culpable media starved of newsworthy material about the talks .
Nobody can speak authoritatively about the negotiations – not even the negotiators themselves .
This uncertainty is symptomatic of Zimbabwean politics over the last decade .
Nobody foresaw that Mugabe 's government would seize white - owned commercial farms in the violent and economically disastrous way it did in 2000 .
The country 's economy continues its inexorable decline .
Time and again we have predicted total economic collapse .
It has proved as elusive as Osama bin Laden .
We did not fathom the lengths to which Mugabe would go in stealing election after election .
Nor did we envisage the 2005 nationwide "" urban clean - up "" , in which more than 569,000 Zimbabweans lost their homes .
It was unthinkable that Zimbabwe would become so vilified internationally , and that Africa and the international community would prove so impotent in arresting the country 's decline .
Even more unimaginable was the emigration of millions of Zimbabweans .
We got so despairing as to speculate about Mugabe 's "" failing health "" countless times .
The Zimbabwean bishop Pius Ncube prayed for his swift death .
It never came .
But , if there is anything we misunderstood and still overlook , it is the political role of the Zimbabwean security forces , who today detained Tsvangarai at Harare airport .
In January 2002 , they announced to the world that they would "" not accept , let alone support or salute , anyone "" without liberation war credentials .
This statement was repeated on the eve of every national election thereafter .
We responded by labeling their routine election time statements as intimidation .
"" They can not be serious .
Military coups are not announced , they are just staged , "" we comforted ourselves .
We were wrong .
Interviews I conducted with Zimbabwean military officials in 2006 confirmed this position .
It was first forged in the early 1980s .
Drawing from their experience of fighting in the country 's liberation war , some senior army officers see themselves as the "" guardians "" of Zimbabwean independence .
They refuse to countenance the prospect of Zimbabwe being ruled by a political party other than Zanu - PF – the "" deliverer of Zimbabwean independence "" .
And so it was that when Mugabe and Zanu - PF wobbled in the March 2008 elections , the most powerful force that mobilised to shore them up was the security establishment .
The violence that followed was overseen by senior members of the military , deployed to the country 's various provinces .
To think that the security establishment will allow Zimbabwe 's rival politicians to decide the country 's fate unfettered , through the talks , is to misread their political role once again .
On August 11 , Mugabe arrived for negotiations at Zimbabwe 's Rainbow Hotel in the company of Zimbabwe 's senior army general Constantine Chiwenga – an ominous sign .
There can be no "" success "" to the talks without the security officials ' acquiescence .
The institution of the Zimbabwe state has degenerated , but the security establishment , while a shadow of its former self , remains its most formidable and functioning arm .
It is high time we took its pronouncements seriously .
The generals will never allow Mugabe to cede executive powers to Tsvangirai .
Doing so would be tantamount to surrendering the political authority they have accrued .
Mugabe 's own power ambitions should not be downplayed either .
Mugabe is not your average eightysomething - year - old man .
Handing over executive powers to Tsvangirai is negotiating himself out of the power he thrives on .
Moreover , within the Zanu - PF politburo , the party 's supreme decision - making body , there are powerful politicians , such as Emmerson Mnangagwa and Solomon Mujuru , who have seen themselves as Mugabe 's rightful successors for years .
They too will not countenance anything that would put paid to their own power ambitions .
Tsvangirai is stuck between a lions ' den and a vipers ' nest .
He can turn his back on the negotiations and forsake a chance of gaining a foothold in government , or he can sign up to a compromise deal that does not relieve Mugabe of executive powers and risk losing the support of many Zimbabweans who see him as their champion .
Thabo Mbeki , meanwhile , can claim only a hollow victory for his "" quiet diplomacy "" if the talks "" succeed "" .
The Zimbabwe crisis developed to its current dire proportions under the South African president 's watch .
I have discussed the factors behind Mbeki 's stance on Zimbabwe on Cif before , but will add one more .
Given the Zimbabwean security forces ' political role , we must ask ourselves how Mbeki could have checkmated their power and authority .
This is a difficult question – because armies are only checkmated by other armies , and yet force was unacceptable to Mbeki and the region ."
2008-08-19,"Levy Mwanawasa , president of Zambia since 2002 , came to international prominence only recently with his forthright criticisms of the conduct of this year 's Zimbabwean elections .
He said openly that he sympathised with the plight of Morgan Tsvangirai , the Zimbabwean opposition leader , and would have no doubt led the anger of many African leaders against Robert Mugabe had he not suffered a stroke at the Sharm el - Sheikh African Union summit in June .
He was taken to a hospital in France , where he has died aged 59 .
It was his second stroke , the first coming in April 2006 .
Before that his slurred speech , arising from a serious car accident on December 8 1991 , had earned him the unfair nickname of "" the Cabbage "" .
The car accident was rumoured to have been a botched assassination attempt as Mwanawasa , by then vice - president , was outspoken against corruption .
Born in Mufulira , in the copperbelt region of central Zambia , and a law graduate of the University of Zambia , he made his name in 1989 , as the defence counsel for Lieutenant General Christon Tembo , charged with treason against the regime of President Kenneth Kaunda .
Kaunda was shocked as crowds cheered Tembo , and Mwanawasa became a celebrity .
Popular support for Kaunda continued to plummet and he lost power in 1991 .
Mwanawasa was made vice - president in the Movement for Multiparty Democracy government of Frederick Chiluba .
Mwanawasa did not take easily to politics and retired from office in 1994 , only to return and eventually succeed Chiluba as president , winning the controversial 2001 elections .
The supreme court judged , in 2005 , that those elections had been marred by irregularities , but not enough to overturn the result .
Mwanawasa won a second term in 2006 , four months after his first stroke .
Before then , in 2004 , he revealed the thin skin that had always allowed barbs to hurt him .
When the Lusaka satirist Roy Clarke likened him to a great fat elephant , Mwanawasa was enraged and ordered his deportation , to which the courts did not agree , as Clarke was not a Zambian citizen .
The episode characterised Mwanawasa 's presidency - the bold steps he took were always tempered with equivocation .
He prosecuted Chiluba on charges of corruption and instigated anti - corruption measures , but barely managed to contain the rise of greater corruption .
He improved conditions in the main hospitals , but allowed them to degenerate in the public universities .
He became the darling of the IMF and western banks for his neo - liberal reforms , but was only able to instigate these reforms on the back of an unforeseen boom in mineral prices .
And , while the macro - economic figures depicted Zambia as a rare African country in good economic health , a huge percentage of Zambians lived in poverty .
However , he did ensure the robust condition of political debate in Zambia .
Elections were flawed but fair .
A free press flourished .
Debate , if not action , on HIV was taking place .
He attracted a foreign investment and aid , roads and communications were improved , and he left the private sector in much better shape .
Mwanawasa was one of those uncharismatic transitional figures , of whom Africa probably needs more , who takes a nation imperfectly forward .
In his last few months he made the mark that no one predicted , by holding that Africa should not tolerate the situation in Zimbabwe , challenging the culture of silence much as he has done as a young lawyer .
He is survived by his wife Maureen ; he had four children by her , and two by an earlier marriage .
· Levy Mwanawasa , politician , born September 3 1948 ; died August 19 2008 · This article was amended on Friday August 22 2008 .
Our obituary of the Zambian president Levy Mwanawasa gave the name of his party as the Movement for Democratic Change .
That is the main opposition party in Zimbabwe .
Mwanawasa led the Movement for Multiparty Democracy .
This has been corrected ."
2008-08-19,"Negotiations for the creation of a transitional government in Zimbabwe are at a serious impasse .
They were suspended last week , with chief mediator Thabo Mbeki saying that while a break was needed to give opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai an opportunity to reflect on remaining sticking points , most of the issues were resolved .
But shows of optimism by the South African president or anyone else are wholly premature .
The most critical matter of all – who will actually run Zimbabwe – is no closer to resolution .
If Tsvangirai is taking time to reflect , he is completely justified .
Since his Movement for Democratic Change ( MDC ) won the historic parliamentary elections and he defeated Robert Mugabe in the first round of the presidential poll on March 29 , his popular mandate has been clear and unsullied by the June 27 presidential runoff , which he was forced to quit in the face of extreme violence against his supporters .
Tsvangirai has been entrusted by Zimbabwe 's people to lead the country out of its troubles , and he can not hope to do that if he accepts anything less than a transfer of the reins of power .
At the outset , an agreement seemed possible , making Tsvangirai head of government with full executive powers and leaving Mugabe as ceremonial head of state with a "" father of the nation "" role .
Tsvangirai made significant concessions : Mugabe would retain some powers such as the right to declare war , would co - chair the cabinet , and could make some appointments of some key government posts in consultation with him .
But Mugabe refuses to cede any serious executive power .
Hardly surprisingly , Tsvangirai has rejected outright his demand that he keep the power not only to reshuffle the cabinet but also to fire the prime minister .
Mugabe did concede that the supervision of ministries could be shared , with Tsvangirai overseeing those such as finance , foreign affairs , industry and commerce , and local government .
But all the security ministries – defence , home affairs , and intelligence – would report to Mugabe directly .
And Mugabe would continue to chair the securocratic clique known as the joint operation command ( JOC ) , his primary instrument for retaining power , and responsible for much of the recent ugly violence .
Though Mugabe wears no general 's uniform , for all practical purposes his is a military dictatorship , relying on the support of the military establishment , and brute domestic force , to cling to power .
Tsvangirai , rightly , has refused to accept being rendered impotent and irrelevant on internal security issues , arguing instead for the JOC to be reconstituted as a jointly chaired national security council , professionalised and disconnected from Zanu - PF and Mugabe himself .
Despite the evident reasonableness of Tsvangirai 's position – too moderate for some of his supporters ' taste – he has been cast by Mbeki as the more intransigent party , and borne nearly all the pressure imposed by a mediator whose impartiality continues to be called into question .
Meanwhile , there is no sign that Mbeki 's co - mediators – Jean Ping of the African Union , Jorge Chikoty of the Southern African Development Community ; and the UN 's Haile Menkerios – will be able to counterbalance his role with effective pressure of their own on Mugabe .
The opposition leader has very good reason for holding absolutely firm in the talks to acquire the powers that are rightly and democratically his , and which he needs if he is to begin to be able to bring Zimbabwe back from its unutterably miserable current economic and social dysfunction .
Tsvangirai 's ace is that he holds the key to Zimbabwe 's international acceptance .
There is ample potential support from the US and EU to rebuild Zimbabwe 's shattered economy and society , to tackle the public finance system that has permitted the hyper - inflationary meltdown , and to implement specific reforms , such as restructuring the justice sector , and professionalising the security sector .
The World Bank , the IMF and the African Development Bank are all able and willing to play major roles in the country 's macro - economic stabilisation .
What global political and institutional leaders need to do is to make even more loudly and publicly clear than they have already that any negotiated agreement , in order to be credible , to get sanctions lifted , and above all to open the door to critical new international assistance , must provide Tsvangirai with essential executive powers , including control over the key elements of internal security , and that support will only be delivered , and sustained , if minimum benchmarks are observed .
That basic sentiment is out there , but it has to be more explicitly articulated .
Short of a deal that can really enable the MDC leader to move the country in the direction the Zimbabwean people have entrusted him to take , the international message must continue to be that the results of the June 27 presidential runoff are illegitimate , political violence is completely unacceptable , and the solution to Zimbabwe 's political and economic crisis can only come through a properly negotiated process , producing a genuinely workable government that reflects the current popular will ."
2008-08-20,"The power - sharing talks between the Zimbabwean president Robert Mugabe and the opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai have been presented as the best hope of bringing peace to the embattled country .
However , power - sharing agreements are in fact a poor strategy for resolving conflicts .
They are extremely difficult to reach and possibly even more difficult to implement and sustain .
Power sharing is not a credible or viable solution to the crisis in Zimbabwe , either in the immediate or longer term .
It is unlikely to bring a durable peace , is inherently undemocratic and rewards ruthless behaviour .
Power - sharing deals are difficult to negotiate under the best of circumstances .
Reaching an agreement in Zimbabwe will be particularly problematic , for at least three reasons .
First , the ruling party 's interest in sharing power is highly questionable .
Negotiators from Zanu - PF are reportedly refusing to consider ceding any executive powers to an opposition prime minister – the main bone of contention in the power - sharing agreement that ended a standoff following Kenya 's December 2007 elections .
Zanu - PF is only sitting at the bargaining table because of international pressure , notably from South Africa and other neighbours , and will be loth to compromise .
While the opposition is more likely to be negotiating in good faith than the government , the failure of talks may help the MDC 's case that Zanu - PF is intransigent and that sterner international pressure will be required .
Another major impediment to agreement is the lack of trust between actors .
Not only has the ruling party brutalised MDC officials and supporters in myriad ways since 2000 , its previous power - sharing agreement serves as a stern warning to the MDC .
In 1987 , a deal was signed between Mugabe and Joshua Nkomo , the leader of the then main opposition party .
Nkomo was brought in as a figurehead vice - president and the deal resulted in his party 's absorption and disbandment , serving to consolidate Mugabe 's power .
A third challenge is internal fragmentation .
Though not as significant as the multiplication of actors that have plagued negotiations in the Democratic Republic of Congo or Darfur , both Zanu - PF and the MDC are factionalised .
Not all perspectives are represented at the bargaining table and further splits may be forthcoming if any eventual agreement displeases significant wings on one or both sides .
For instance , even if Arthur Mutambara 's MDC faction signs a separate agreement with Mugabe , his 10 MPs might defect to the main MDC wing , leaving Zanu - PF no closer to achieving a parliamentary majority .
In addition , high - ranking military officials in Zanu - PF , who have consolidated political and economic power in recent years , may prevent Mugabe from reaching an agreement detrimental to their interests .
Even if a deal is reached , three principal challenges threaten its viability .
First , governing elites might lack the commitment to applying the terms of the agreement .
They might actually only be seeking to co - opt the opposition and could renege on the agreement if they fail .
Alternatively , there may be institutional resistance to sharing power .
For instance , where the bureaucracy of the state and a party apparatus have been one and the same for a long time , a political agreement at the top does not guarantee compliance at the middle and lower echelons of government , and indeed resistance may be orchestrated from the top .
In Sudan , members of the National Congress party continue to dominate state institutions , in spite of the power - sharing provisions of the 2003 comprehensive peace agreement that ended the north - south conflict .
Second , government and opposition elites might lack the ability to deliver their commitments , particularly where key parts of their constituency are resistant to a political deal .
Veterans , one of Mugabe 's most powerful constituencies , may attempt to spoil a transfer of executive powers if they fear losing influence .
This is not unique to Zimbabwe .
Veterans have obstructed progress in other locales such as the Serb entity in Bosnia and Herzegovina .
Third , the MDC 's shortcomings might impede power sharing .
Where incumbents have been in power for a very long time , the opposition 's capacity to govern is likely to be limited .
That was the case in Sudan , where the Sudan People 's Liberation Movement found itself propelled to a governing position overnight .
Permitting ill - equipped opposition leaders to assume positions of responsibility is also a way of ensuring they will stumble and fall , especially when assigned near - impossible tasks .
For this reason , one could expect Mugabe to give Tsvangirai responsibility for redressing Zimbabwe 's economic woes .
Even if a power - sharing arrangement was a viable option and could prevent more violence in the shorter or longer term , it is not necessarily a strategy worth pursuing .
Allowing a small number of elites to determine outcomes is inherently undemocratic , and manifestly ignores voters ' choices .
It would make more sense to hold new elections as soon as possible , preferably under a caretaker government .
Otherwise , a terrible precedent is set , encouraging politicians who are not committed to democracy to attempt to steal elections and then , through power - sharing agreements , secure a much stronger position than they otherwise would have held .
The Zimbabwean opposition and international actors would be well advised to consider this before supporting further negotiations .

2008-08-23,"MDC may lose out over key parliamentary job Morgan Tsvangirai 's MDC party could lose out on both the speaker and deputy speaker positions when the Zimbabwean parliament is reopened tomorrow , despite its majority in the lower house .
In the 29 March parliamentary elections , the MDC won 100 seats , against Zanu - PF 's 99 .
Ten seats went to a faction of the MDC led by academic Arthur Mutambara and one went to independent candidate Jonathan Moyo .
National Constitutional Assembly chairman Lovemore Madhuku said the failure by the MDC to produce a joint candidate had opened the door for a potential deal between Mutambara 's MDC and the ruling party . '
If Zanu steals the speaker 's position from us , the people of Zimbabwe will ... judge Mugabe extremely harshly , ' said Tendai Biti , the secretary general of MDC .
Alex Duval Smith Israel lets protest boats breach its blockade Israel said yesterday it would allow a pro - Palestinian activist group to sail two boats carrying humanitarian supplies into the Gaza Strip , after earlier hinting that it would block the shipment from reaching the coastal territory .
The boats were expected to reach Gaza last night , defying Israel 's year - long blockade of the territory .
The delivery had been in question since the activists with the US - based Free Gaza Movement left Cyprus on Friday .
Israeli officials initially deemed the mission an unacceptable provocation and the crew on the boats yesterday accused Israel of sabotaging their communications equipment .
But late yesterday Foreign Ministry spokesman Arye Mekel said Israel had decided to let the boats into Gaza ' to avoid media provocation in the high seas as they [ the organisers ] planned ' .
He said Israeli authorities were satisfied that the cargo - a symbolic shipment consisting of hearing aids and balloons - was harmless .

2008-08-25,"Zimbabwe 's main opposition party struck a blow against President Robert Mugabe yesterday when its candidate was elected as the parliamentary speaker .
Lovemore Moyo of Morgan Tsvangirai 's Movement for Democratic Change ( MDC ) won the ballot by 110 votes to 98 , marking the first time that the opposition has held the powerful speaker position since independence in 1980 .
The ruling Zanu - PF party did not put up a candidate , choosing instead to back Paul Themba Nyathi of the breakaway MDC faction headed by Arthur Mutambara .
The significance of the result is revealed in the numbers .
Zanu - PF holds 99 seats in parliament , while the MDC splinter group has 10 .
During the now - stalled power - sharing talks it had been assumed that Mugabe and Mutambara had reached an agreement to work together .
That would have eclipsed the MDC , which has 100 seats , leaving Tsvangirai 's party on the outside over his refusal to accept a prime ministerial post answerable to Mugabe and with limited powers .
Moyo 's tally shows that numerous MDC - Mutambara MPs and perhaps even a few Zanu - PF members were willing to support Tsvangirai 's party .
Opposition MPs broke into song when the result was announced , mocking Zanu - PF as a spent force .
They also occupied the government benches after being sworn in , arguing that the MDC 's victory in March 's parliamentary elections gave them the right .
Emmerson Mnangagwa , the rural housing minister who is seen as a possible successor to Mugabe , appeared conciliatory in defeat . ""
Mr Speaker , sir .
This is a truly historic event and I would like , on behalf of the president , our party and this side of this august House , to congratulate you , "" he told parliament .
The speaker 's post is seen as key because Moyo will now take charge of contentious debates in the hung parliament if no power - sharing deal is reached .
Mugabe is due to officially open parliament today despite a warning from Tsvangirai that this could end hopes of reviving the power - sharing talks that the South African president , Thabo Mbeki , is trying to broker .
Tsvangirai won the first round of the presidential election but boycotted the run - off with Mugabe owing to a widespread campaign of state - sponsored violence and intimidation against his supporters .
Police have instead focused on alleged MDC crimes , accusing seven MPs of committing rape , murder and electoral violence .
Before the speaker vote yesterday , security officers arrested two opposition MPs , Elia Jembere and Shuwa Mudiwa , as they tried to enter parliament .
Jembere missed the vote ."
2008-09-06,"Some of President Robert Mugabe 's senior aides have had secret negotiations with South African mediators in an effort to secure amnesties from any future prosecution in return for supporting regime change in Zimbabwe .
Army , police and secret service chiefs have repeatedly pledged loyalty to Mugabe in public and insisted that they would never ' salute ' or support a government led by opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai , the head of the Movement for Democratic Change ( MDC ) , who secured most votes in the presidential election that took place in March this year .
But government sources in both Zimbabwe and South Africa have told The Observer that a senior army general and a Central Intelligence Organisation ( CIO ) chief visited Pretoria last weekend to seek assurances from South Africa 's President Thabo Mbeki that they would not be prosecuted in the event of Tsvangirai taking over .
Mbeki is mediating in the power - sharing talks between Mugabe 's ruling Zanu - PF party and the MDC , negotiations which appeared to be hanging by a thread last week with the MDC threatening to pull out and accusing Zanu - PF of a lack of commitment to dialogue .
MDC spokesman Nelson Chamisa said his party 's patience was being stretched to the limit after Mugabe told journalists in Zambia on Wednesday at the funeral of President Levy Mwanawasa that he would form a new government of national unity if Tsvangirai did not sign the document already agreed to during the talks . '
We feel frozen at the moment and if the MDC does not want to see the country move , then we will be left with no choice than to form a new government without them , ' said Mugabe .
Yesterday , however , the MDC backed away from its threat , insisting that it was still fully committed to dialogue .
Robert Mugabe relies heavily on Zimbabwe 's defence force chiefs , most of whom have been supporters of the ageing dictator since the 1970s war of independence and were heavily involved in conducting the murderous campaign of violence against MDC supporters and activists that erupted after the March election results were announced .
Mbeki 's spokesman , Mukoni Ratshitanga , said he knew nothing of any secret meetings and insisted power - sharing talks were continuing . '
You know quite well that we will never ever announce the contents of the talks through the press before making a feedback to the Zimbabwean community , Southern African Development Community and the African Union
, ' Ratshitanga told The Observer Sources close to the talks
said the Zimbabwe defence forces ' Lieutenant - General Constantine Chiwenga , police commissioner - general Augustine Chihuri , and CIO director - general Happyton Bonyongwe were at a private meeting in Pretoria .
Behind the scenes , Zanu - PF 'S politburo , including Mugabe , is said to be distancing itself from the violence that killed more than 120 people between the first round of voting and June 's one - man presidential run - off poll , laying the blame on the army and the CIO .
It is widely expected that , if there are any future trials for crimes against humanity , Mugabe will escape prosecution due to old age .
Tsvangirai , who will tomorrow address the largest MDC rally to be held in Zimbabwe since the outbreak of violence to mark the ninth anniversary of his party , said in the course of an interview with The Observer earlier this year that he had no thirst for vengeance against the ' old man ' .
But Mugabe 's powerful backers would need strong guarantees that an amnesty from prosecution , and even a possible future refuge outside Zimbawe , would be available to them if they are to distance themselves from the country 's leader ."
2008-09-08,"The South African president , Thabo Mbeki , will meet Zimbabwe 's rival political parties today in a new attempt to secure a power - sharing deal .
The opposition leader , Morgan Tsvangirai , said yesterday that he would rather quit the talks than sign an unsatisfactory deal , prompting fresh doubts over a compromise .
President Robert Mugabe has already threatened to form a government alone if Tsvangirai does not sign a deal and end the deadlock .
In response , Tsvangirai has challenged Mugabe to call a further election , insisting his party would win a clear majority .
In March this year , the two leaders fought a general election in which Tsvangirai fell just short of enough votes to avoid a second round of voting in June .
Mugabe went on to win the run - off unopposed after Tsvangirai pulled out , citing violence and intimidation against his supporters .
Since then , post - election talks to resolve the sharing of executive power between the two men have continued , delaying any chance of rescuing Zimbabwe 's crippled economy .
Mbeki , mandated by regional countries to mediate in the Zimbabwe talks , has come under repeated fire for not being tough enough with Mugabe .
Other southern African leaders have taken a harder line against the long - standing president , but Mugabe has refused to budge .
Yesterday , Tsvangirai held a rally marking the ninth anniversary of his party , the Movement for Democratic Change ( MDC ) .
He made it clear that he has little faith in Mbeki as mediator and confirmed he did not intend to change his position in the power - sharing talks .
Zimbabwe 's June election run - off was condemned by governments around the world .
It drew toughened sanctions from western countries whose support is vital for reviving Zimbabwe 's ruined economy .
A smaller , breakaway faction of the MDC , led by Arthur Mutambara , is the third party in negotiations aimed at forming a national unity government ."
2008-09-10,"Talks aimed at forming a government of national unity to end Zimbabwe 's political crisis resumed today amid optimism that a deal is imminent .
The president , Robert Mugabe , and the main opposition leader , Morgan Tsvangirai , were relatively upbeat when they emerged late yesterday from negotiations mediated by the South African president , Thabo Mbeki .
The state - owned Herald newspaper reported today that there was optimism about reaching a solution to the key stumbling block , namely who should have the top position in government .
The newspaper said the three parties involved were confident the talks would end today with a "" conclusive political settlement "" .
Tsvangirai has insisted on being head of government and chairing cabinet meetings , with Mugabe in the largely ceremonial position of head of state .
But Mugabe is unwilling to surrender much of the power he has wielded since the country declared independence from Britain in 1980 .
"" We are still going to talk .
There is progress and lack of it .
There are principally one or two areas that need to be finalised , "" Mugabe was quoted as saying by the Herald as he left a Harare hotel late yesterday after four hours of negotiations .
Tsvangirai said : "" There 's been a positive development . ""
The Herald , a government mouthpiece , said Mugabe had told Tsvangirai he would form a new government by the end of the week regardless of the outcome of the talks .
Some reports suggested Tsvangirai 's Movement for Democratic Change was proposing that its leader should become prime minister , with authority over ministers , while Mugabe would chair a new national security council , with control over some of the security forces .
Tsvangirai 's party won the most votes in legislative and presidential elections in March .
Mugabe was the only candidate to take part in a presidential run - off vote that followed an onslaught of state - sponsored violence against Tsvangirai supporters and was widely denounced as a sham .
Since then , Mugabe , 84 , has faced pressure to reach a deal with the opposition as the only way of breaking the political deadlock and halting economic collapse .
The government of Swaziland , which currently chairs the Southern African Development Community 's safety and security committee , had scheduled a summit - level meeting on Zimbabwe today with Mugabe and Mbeki .
The South African government said the meeting had been pushed back to tomorrow , and that Mbeki was still expected to brief participants on his mediation efforts .
The SADC has so far taken a soft approach on Mugabe in its official statements , but sharp public rebukes from member states such as Zambia and Botswana have shattered the traditional African unity .
In his first major speech since negotiations began , Tsvangirai said at a party rally on Sunday that Mugabe should accept a ceremonial presidency or "" let 's go for elections under international supervision and see who will carry the day "" .
"" We should not be pushed into a deal , "" Tsvangirai said .
"" We would rather have no deal than get a bad deal . """
2008-09-11,"South African President Thabo Mbeki says he has successfully mediated a power - sharing deal between Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe and the opposition .
Mbeki did not immediately offer details , but said today that the agreement would be signed on Monday .
Opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai had told reporters the parties "" have got a deal "" .
Mbeki has been in Zimbabwe since Monday trying to resolve the impasse over who would wield the most authority in a unity government .
Tsvangirai has said he should be head of government and preside over Cabinet meetings , while Mugabe should be relegated to a ceremonial position .
Mugabe had shown little willingness to give up much of the power he has held since independence from Britain in 1980 ."
2008-09-11,"Robert Mugabe yesterday agreed to surrender day - to - day control of the government and much of his power in a historic deal with his opponent , Morgan Tsvangirai , to end Zimbabwe 's long political crisis .
But the agreement fell short of Tsvangirai 's demand for Mugabe , Zimbabwe 's leader since independence 28 years ago , to become solely a ceremonial president after losing the last credible election six months ago .
The deal is also expected to result in a de facto amnesty for the military and Zanu - PF party leaders responsible for the bloody campaign against opposition supporters and activists over recent months .
Their attempt to overturn Tsvangirai 's election victory in March left hundreds dead and thousands badly injured .
Precise details of how power will be divided under the agreement , which has been mediated by South Africa 's president , Thabo Mbeki , will be formally released at a signing ceremony on Monday .
But according to opposition sources , Tsvangirai will become prime minister at the head of a council of ministers , the principal organ of government , which will be drawn from his Movement for Democratic Change and the president 's Zanu - PF party .
Mugabe will remain president and continue to chair a cabinet that opposition sources say will be a largely consultative body .
The real power will lie with Tsvangirai .
Mbeki , who has staked his dwindling political reputation on brokering a deal , heralded the agreement .
"" I am absolutely certain that the leadership of Zimbabwe is committed to implementing these agreements , "" he said .
British reaction was muted last night , with the government waiting to see the detail of the deal .
"" We are following the situation closely , "" said a Foreign Office spokesman .
"" We look forward to seeing the detail of the agreement announced by President Mbeki this evening .
Our overriding concern is the welfare of the Zimbabwean people .
"" If the agreement results in a real shift in power , it is likely to unlock the hundreds of millions of pounds in foreign aid desperately needed to shore up Zimbabwe 's economy , which is collapsing under the weight of hyperinflation , a key factor in Mugabe conceding authority ."
2008-09-11,"Robert Mugabe expended a lot of energy on denouncing the leader of the Movement for Democratic Change , Morgan Tsvangirai , as nothing more than a "" British puppet "" who only wanted to return the land to white farmers .
The only leader the country has known in its 28 years of independence said he would rather go back to the bush and fight another liberation war than hand over Zimbabwe to Tsvangirai .
But yesterday , Mugabe was apparently persuaded to face reality under the unrelenting pressure of economic collapse and a desperate and hungry population , agreeing to cede most of his powers to Tsvangirai .
The MDC leader 's refusal to buckle and recognise Mugabe 's flawed claim to power under pressure from some African leaders , and the continued assault on his party 's MPs and activists , had meant there was no prospect of Zimbabwe getting the foreign aid it needs to rebuild the economy .
Mugabe had retained power through a bloody campaign against the voters , overturning Tsvangirai 's victory in the first round of the presidential election in March and claiming 90 % of the vote in a second round three months later .
But it did not confer legitimacy on Mugabe 's claim to be president and he had no solutions to the deepening crisis , as inflation surged to about 20 m percent .
Tsvangirai will now become prime minister at the head of a council of ministers .
There are likely to be more than 30 of them , which could prove unwieldy .
But the council will be the principal organ of government , while Mugabe chairs a less powerful cabinet .
The council of ministers is to be divided between the MDC and Zanu - PF , and the division of the portfolios has yet to be agreed , which has the potential for further disagreement .
Mugabe wants Zanu - PF to keep control of the military through the defence ministry .
The MDC can live with that , provided it has authority over the police , which will prove crucial in ensuring the fairness of future elections .
But it is unclear if Zanu - PF will agree .
There may also be fundamental disagreement over land policy and the future of the formerly white - owned farms whose seizure helped to bring down the economy .
The opposition remained cautious last night , saying it believed Mugabe could yet back away before the signing of the agreement on Monday .
There is also concern among some of Mugabe 's critics who say he is skilled at outmanoeuvring his opponents and could still wield considerable influence .
Nonetheless , one MDC official said that it was not in Tsvangirai 's interests to reach an agreement that did not give him real power , because if he was unable to dramatically improve the lives of Zimbabweans he would be finished .
Foreign donors , including Britain and the US , said there would be no aid if Mugabe retained power - a trump card in Tsvangirai 's negotiations .
The price of change has been high .
About 4 million Zimbabweans - one quarter of the population - have left the country in recent years in search of work to feed their families .
Hundreds have been murdered , thousands beaten and tortured , and tens of thousands driven from their homes in the regime 's desperate efforts to cling to power ."

2008-09-12,"Questions were raised yesterday about Robert Mugabe 's commitment to Zimbabwe 's historic power - sharing deal after it was revealed that hours before agreeing to a coalition administration with his arch foe , Morgan Tsvangirai , the president told traditional chiefs he could never work with the opposition .
The revelation came as the two sides attempted to hammer out the composition of a coalition cabinet ahead of a formal signing of the power - sharing agreement on Monday that is expected to end the Zimbabwean leader 's 28 years of political domination .
Mugabe , Tsvangirai and the head of a smaller opposition faction are wrangling over the division of 31 cabinet seats .
Sources in Tsvangirai 's Movement for Democratic Change ( MDC ) said the party expected to secure control over the police and intelligence agency - which were central to the state - orchestrated campaign of killings and other violence against the opposition during the recent election - while Mugabe 's Zanu - PF will oversee the military through the defence ministry .
Such an arrangement could prove crucial to the MDC which plans to force fresh elections in about two years , laying the path for Mugabe 's final political demise as it appears unlikely he could ever again win a legitimate ballot in Zimbabwe .
But Mugabe 's commitment to the deal was swiftly called into question when it was revealed that hours before agreeing to the power - sharing arrangement he told a meeting of traditional chiefs that the MDC and Zanu - PF "" will never mix "" .
"" Putting Zanu - PF and the MDC together to work together is like mixing water and fire , "" he said .
"" It is quite difficult for these parties to be friends especially if one party is being supported and sponsored by the outside countries that are pushing for a regime change agenda .
They want Mugabe to go . ""
If Mugabe does sign the coalition agreement on Monday , the allocation of portfolios will help determine how much power he continues to wield as president .
But his grip will in any case be greatly weakened , with Tsvangirai destined to take over the daily running of government as prime minister and the combined opposition holding a majority in cabinet , albeit by only one seat .
Mugabe will chair the cabinet while Tsvangirai heads a new council of ministers that will undertake the daily administration of the country .
The combined opposition 's majority in both bodies means Mugabe and his party can be outvoted in government and parliament , further whittling down the president 's political control provided the two MDC factions work together .
But that may prove difficult given the animosity between Tsvangirai and the leader of the rival MDC grouping , Arthur Mutambara , who is to serve as one of two deputy prime ministers .
Perhaps crucially , the MDC also won its demand for the negotiation of a new constitution within 18 months which will lay the ground for fresh elections .
In the meantime , the new administration will face formidable challenges .
Desperate Zimbabweans are looking to a new government for relief from hyperinflation running above 20 million percent , widespread food and fuel shortages , and mass unemployment .
David Coltart , legal affairs secretary for the smaller MDC faction , said the additional challenge for the new government would be for former foes to work together . ""
The grave humanitarian and economic crises are enough to test any government .
The new cabinet that will have to address these challenges is composed of protagonists - virtually all of the cabinet ministers to be appointed by the MDC [ factions ] have at some stage in the last nine years been brutalised on the instructions of those they will now have to work with .
Zimbabwe remains highly polarised and it will take statesmanship on all sides to make this work , "" he said .
Many in the MDC also remain deeply hostile to Mugabe , reflected in the jeering of its MPs as the president opened parliament last month .
The agreement has met with scepticism from some of Mugabe 's opponents who have accused Tsvangirai of making too many concessions .
Lovemore Madhuku , head of the National Constitutional Assembly , which has been at the forefront of pressing for political reform , said he feared Mugabe would outmanoeuvre his opponents and retain control .
"" I believe that under this arrangement the MDC will now be neutralised as a political force .
But we will have to wait to see how the union will work but generally the people of Zimbabwe were also looking for some kind of settlement , "" he said .
The European Union yesterday said it would consider whether to extend sanctions against Mugabe and other Zanu - PF leaders following the agreement .
Power - sharing :
Opposition divisions may be key How will power - sharing work ?
Robert Mugabe remains president but with greatly reduced powers .
He will chair an advisory cabinet .
Morgan Tsvangirai will be prime minister and oversee day - to - day rule through a council of ministers .
Tsvangirai will also sit in the cabinet , where the opposition will have a majority of one , allowing it to set policy .
Cabinet seats are based on March 's parliamentary election .
Mugabe 's Zanu - PF will have 15 seats , Tsvangirai 's Movement for Democratic Change has 13 and a breakaway MDC faction , led by Arthur Mutambara , has three .
The opposition also has a majority of MPs .
Will it work ?
There are challenges , not least the bitter legacy of the elections .
MDC leaders must work with men who led the murder and torture of MDC activists and their families .
There is deep distrust between the two MDC factions .
Much will depend on whether Tsvangirai can assert control over the council of ministers .
If Tsvangirai does not make power - sharing work , he will quickly lose the people 's confidence .
So is this the end for Mugabe ?
Although he has had to concede much of his power , Mugabe is adept at exploiting divisions , notably within the MDC .
But some key levers of power , such as the police , will be under MDC control .
Meanwhile , a new constitution is to be put in place that could see fresh elections held in as little as 18 months ."
2008-09-13,"However you look at it , Robert Mugabe is getting away with murder .
The power - sharing deal he is expected to sign tomorrow with his arch - rival , Morgan Tsvangirai , will protect Zimbabwe 's president and his cohorts from prosecution for their bloody campaign of killings and terror against opposition supporters and their leaders .
Mugabe will remain president , even though his claim of winning 90 per cent of the valid votes in June 's election was met with universal scorn after Tsvangirai pulled out because he did not want people killed going to vote for him .
The last time Zimbabwe 's voters had a chance to cast a ballot without a gun to their heads , in the first round of presidential elections in March , Tsvangirai won .
And that was with millions of opposition voters in exile and a good deal of other kinds of intimidation by the ruling Zanu - PF party .
Now Mugabe will sit at the head of a cabinet half filled with men responsible for robbing Tsvangirai of that victory by murdering , beating and terrorising the supporters - and sometimes the families - of the other half of the cabinet .
When they were n't doing that , they were looting the central bank , stealing land and driving the economy into the ground through incompetence and cynicism , leaving millions on the brink of starvation .
So an agreement that persuades the opposition to recognise Mugabe as president and keeps Zanu - PF 's killers and looters out of jail might be viewed as a great victory for the old man .
Yet the historic deal holds the elements to dismantle Mugabe 's 28-year rule and reduce the power of the only leader Zimbabwe has known until a clean election can be held .
Behind the scenes , Movement for Democratic Change leaders are calling the agreement a watershed .
Some quietly realise that Monday could mark the end of their struggle to finish Zanu - PF 's abusive and sometimes violent political domination - the second liberation struggle , as one put it - and the beginning of the equally demanding challenge to take control of government .
If they can pull it off - and , in many ways , whether they succeed or fail lies within the MDC 's control , not Zanu - PF 's - then Mugabe 's pledge that Tsvangirai would never rule Zimbabwe , and his bloody strategy to try to ensure it did not happen , will ultimately have failed .
It is a complex arrangement , but the nuts and bolts of the agreement are that while Mugabe is president , Tsvangirai has day - to - day control of government as prime minister and head of a council of ministers .
That is a considerable asset , even though many of his ministers will be from Zanu - PF .
Tsvangirai will run the council of ministers without Mugabe present , but will sit in the cabinet chaired by the president .
Crucially , the two MDC factions have a majority of one in both bodies , as well as control of parliament , allowing the party to out - vote Mugabe and set policy .
That will allow the MDC to dismantle the apparatus of repression which helped keep Mugabe in power long after his popularity crumbled .
The government will be able to abolish legislation banning newspapers , locking up journalists and imposing severe restrictions on freedom of speech .
Tsvangirai is counting on the support of civil servants and others , who , like most middle - class urbanites , have long backed the MDC but have been afraid to say so in public .
The devil may be in the detail , which wo n't be made public until after the agreement is signed , but Tsvangirai 's aides say there are no hidden trip wires .
Much will also depend on the division of ministries , which the two leaders were wrangling over yesterday .
Mugabe is expected to keep his hands on the military through a Zanu - PF defence minister , which the MDC can live with because it will help reassure the generals .
Tsvangirai has pressed hard for control of the police , which is crucial if he hopes to assure people that they can vote as they wish in future elections .
Both sides are pressing to run the justice ministry , but that may be one that Tsvangirai loses because of fears within Zanu - PF that if he controls the police and the justice system the MDC could hold the guilty to account .
Crucially , the MDC is likely to get the finance portfolio because foreign donors will not want to hand money over to a Zanu - PF minister .
It is the prospect of that money that unlocked the prospect of agreement .
Without power for Tsvangirai there will be no foreign aid , and without hard currency Mugabe had no means of turning around an imploding economy .
The numbers are staggering .
Inflation is running above 20 million per cent a year .
Unemployment is 80 per cent .
A quarter of the population has left to look for work in South Africa and Britain .
The central bank knocked ten zeros off the Zimbabwe dollar at the beginning of last month because shops and banks could not cope with calculations in the trillions .
When it was launched on 1 August , the new dollar was Z$4 to the pound , but the black market immediately offered Z$25 .
Since then , the currency has crashed so fast that the black market rate is Z$13,000 to the pound .
The new banknotes are worthless and the government does not have the means to print new money .
Last week , it announced that it would legalise the use of US dollars and South African rand , although these are already the de facto currencies .
This weekend , there were long queues for petrol after the pipeline from Mozambique was shut down over unpaid bills .
Outside the cities , chronic malnutrition is on the way to becoming starvation .
The World Food Programme says it will have to feed up to five million Zimbabweans in the coming months .
The new government will be desperate to see foreign money soon , so that Tsvangirai can show he can deliver some relief to a distressed population .
But Western governments have said they want to wait and see if Tsvangirai is really wielding power , fearing that he may have been duped into a deal that allows Mugabe to outmanoeuvre him .
However , this will be a hard position for Britain and others to maintain .
They face being accused of neo - colonialism if they fail to embrace what is being billed as an African solution to an African problem and endorsed by all the major political players in Zimbabwe .
Whether Tsvangirai actually does hold power will depend in large part on whether he can form a working relationship with the leader of the smaller breakaway faction of his party , Arthur Mutambara .
That may prove too much for the two leaders who have not always put the country above personal or political interests .
Mutambara , a scientist , has scorned Tsvangirai as ill - educated and an incompetent political leader .
Meanwhile , Tsvangirai 's followers see Mutambara as a political opportunist out for personal gain .
Their fears have been reinforced by his willingness to play footsie with Zanu - PF because , although the Mutambara faction only won 8 per cent of the vote in the election , it holds the balance of power both in parliament and the cabinet .
But Mutambara has been reined in by his own MPs and will have to be careful not to overplay his hand .
If he is seen by the voters to be extending Mugabe 's grip they will make him and his MPs pay at the next election .
Although Mugabe and Zanu - PF will attempt to widen the divisions between the MDC factions and buy off its ministers , the MDC 's future is in its own hands .
If it puts the people before self - interest , and Tsvangirai and Mutambara can set aside their deep personal animosity , then it can set the agenda and transform Zimbabwe .
Mugabe will not be without power , but he may be reduced to obstructing more than governing .
He could probably bring down the new administration , but he is also only signing the agreement in the first place because he has no other options .
Meanwhile , a coalition government is likely to change the political equation for good .
Power sharing worked well in smoothing the transition from white rule in post - apartheid South Africa , where a sunset clause meant there would not be an immediate wholesale purge of the former administration and those who served it .
That may be all the more important in Zimbabwe , where the deep loathing and suspicion between the two sides is personal , and
Zanu - PF chiefs regard Tsvangirai with contempt for his lack of liberation struggle credentials .
Yet there are many in Zanu - PF who realise that if their party is to have a future it is without Mugabe as leader , and that crippling the coalition administration will do nothing to rebuild the party 's fortunes .
Throughout all of this , Tsvangirai will have to stay focused on getting to another election swiftly and with his credibility intact .
The agreement plans a new constitution within 18 months .
The MDC wants to see an election within two years or so .
Unless Tsvangirai messes it up completely - and it 's hard to imagine that life will not improve if the foreign money comes in - then the voters will bury Mugabe .
Zimbabwe 's president will probably never be tried for his many crimes .
But tomorrow he may well be signing the death warrant for his political career .

2008-09-14,"About £ 1bn in western aid to revive Zimbabwe 's economy will hang in the balance today as western donors watch to see how a power - sharing deal to be signed by President Robert Mugabe works in practice before committing a rescue package .
Under the deal with his arch - rival Morgan Tsvangirai , Mugabe is to surrender many of his powers for the first time in 28 years .
But though the agreement , to be formally signed today , marks a huge climbdown by Mugabe , foreign donors indicated that they want to see just how much power Tsvangirai wields as the new prime minister in the coalition government .
"" We want to see this government in action before we commit our support to it , "" said a European diplomat in Harare .
"" We need to see Mugabe is not continuing to run things .
There will be benchmarks , litmus tests of who 's really in charge . ""
Donors , including Britain , the EU and the US , are broadly agreed to inject about £ 1bn in aid over a year to reverse more than a decade of economic decline that has brought inflation above 20,000,000 % , mass unemployment , empty supermarket shelves and forced about 4 million people to leave the country to find work .
Agriculture has collapsed , leaving millions without sufficient food and reducing many to one meal every other day .
Tsvangirai will be keen to see the foreign money as soon as possible in the hope of bolstering public support by swiftly moving to alleviate people 's misery .
The power - sharing agreement brokered by the South African president , Thabo Mbeki , gives the opposition a majority of one in the cabinet and places Tsvangirai in charge of the daily administration of government .
When the 31 cabinet posts are divided in the coming days , Tsvangirai 's Movement for Democratic Change is likely to win control of the finance ministry because Mugabe recognises the donors will not want to see a Zanu - PF minister in charge of their funds .
But diplomats say that their governments will be looking for other signs that Tsvangirai is in control .
One test will be if the MDC gains authority over the police and if it is able to remove the highly partisan police commissioner , Augustine Chihuri , who said he would not salute Tsvangirai if he were elected president and whose force played an active part in the bloody assault on opposition supporters during the election .
Western donors are also keen to see the governor of the central bank , Gideon Gono , sacked because of his alleged role in the plunder of the country 's hard currency reserves and fuelling inflation by furiously printing money .
Nonetheless it will be difficult for western countries to turn their back on today 's watershed agreement because they risk being accused of failing to accept an African - mediated settlement .
The evident hostility and suspicion with which Mugabe regards Tsvangirai and the expectations of western governments was evident in a column in the state - run Herald newspaper by the president 's spokesman , George Chiramba , under a pseudonym .
It called the MDC in government the "" enemy within "" and accused it of taking its orders from Britain and other powers . ""
For a party that has always relied on government and intellect for policy incubation , [ Zanu - PF ] has to learn to govern in a new environment where the enemy is within , well embedded , "" Chiramba wrote .
"" The west will now have an eager listening post , right up to cabinet .
There will be lots of
policy pre - emption . ""
Many Zimbabweans are cautious about the political settlement .
Lining up for bread in shops with otherwise bare shelves , or queuing for the pitiful 50p - worth of currency they are permitted to withdraw from the bank each day , people are desperate for reasons to hope .
However , men such as Arthur Mubaiwa , who was part of a very long queue for petrol yesterday , say they know Mugabe
and they do not have full confidence in Tsvangirai ."
2008-09-14,"For Thabo Mbeki , it could have been the day that restored a reputation battered by perverse policies on HIV / Aids and Machiavellian strategies : the signing of a deal he brokered to end Zimbabwe 's political crisis and silence those who scorned his "" quiet diplomacy "" with Robert Mugabe .
Instead , South Africa 's president will spend this week fighting for his political life as his party debates whether to remove him from office after a damning court ruling that accused Mbeki of apartheid - style tactics in illegally abusing the justice system to try and prevent Jacob Zuma from becoming the country 's next leader .
The agreement in Zimbabwe today is a major triumph for Mbeki who managed to press Mugabe into conceding many of his powers to Morgan Tsvangirai .
But that will count for little at home as leaders of Mbeki 's African National Congress decide his future following Friday 's ruling in which a high court judge , Chris Nicholson , threw out corruption charges against Zuma and said that the prosecution was the result of "" baleful political influence "" .
Nicholson said that Mbeki and members of his cabinet had abused the prosecuting authority in an attempt to remove Zuma from the "" titanic political struggle "" for control of the ANC .
The judge likened Mbeki 's actions to those of apartheid - era governments for inducing two successive heads of the prosecutions authority to commit "" a very serious criminal offence "" by pursuing a political prosecution . ""
In terms of the law , more especially emanating from the constitution , there is responsibility attributable to the president , "" the judge said .
Now Zuma and his supporters are preparing to take revenge on Mbeki .
The ANC national executive and its trade union confederation and Communist party allies are to discuss his future this week .
The ANC 's chief whip in parliament , Nathi Mthethwa , told Johannesburg 's City Press newspaper that it is not a question of if , but when , the party will move against Mbeki . ""
As a leader of the ANC , you can not be implicated of [ sic ] plotting the downfall of your comrade and people then pretend as if nothing has happened , "" he said .
A senior ANC leader told Johannesburg 's Sunday Times newspaper that Mbeki had to go . ""
The most obvious ( position ) would be to appoint a delegation that will ask him to step down , "" he said .
Another ANC official told the paper that Mbeki would "" be pushed on ( to ) his sword if he ca n't fall on his sword "" .
Mbeki can be removed through a vote of no confidence or by calling an early election .
The ANC holds 293 of the 400 seats in parliament so if the party leadership decided to force the president out it could almost certainly win the necessary majority among ANC MPs with an eye to their future selection as candidates at the next election .
If that happened , the speaker would become acting president until parliament elected a new president , almost certainly Zuma .
If an early election is called instead , Mbeki would remain president until the vote within 90 days ."
2008-09-15,"One of the biggest cheers at the signing ceremony for power - sharing in Zimbabwe came when Morgan Tsvangirai was introduced as the country 's prime minister .
In what must have been a carefully choreographed event , the opposition leader addressed the assembled dignitaries before President Robert Mugabe , with whom there had been the briefest of handshakes .
He appealed for unity and said he had chosen to be driven by hope rather than past wrongs . ""
The agreement we sign today is a product of a painful compromise , "" Tsvangirai said .
That is an understatement .
It has been a long road for Tsvangirai .
The oldest of nine children , he left school at 16 to help support his family .
By the age of 20 he had joined his local textile union , and when he transferred to work at a nickel mine two years later he had become a labour activist .
Over the next decade he rose through the ranks of the Associated Mine Workers Union , becoming a branch chairman and later a member of its executive .
In 1988 he was elected secretary general of Zimbabwe 's equivalent of the Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions ( ZCTU ) , the overarching body of the country 's labour movement .
The movement was still attached to Mugabe 's ruling Zanu - PF party but relations deteriorated along with the economy .
The next year , Tsvangirai was to have his first spell in prison - accused of being a South African spy .
He eventually became Mugabe 's main political challenger through his leadership of the opposition party , the Movement for Democratic Change .
Although heavily influenced by the trade union movement , the MDC incorporated the church , business , women 's and students ' organisations and other interest groups .
As Zimbabwe descended into economic chaos , Tsvangirai and the MDC stepped up their challenge to the government through a series of nationwide strikes that brought the opposition into more direct conflict with Mugabe .
Tsvangirai 's MDC came close to winning power in parliamentary elections in 2000 and in a presidential vote in 2002 .
His credentials were questioned after a serious split in MDC ranks in 2005 , when he overruled a decision by the party 's leadership to take part in elections for the senate and ordered a boycott .
Tsvangirai seemed a fading force after the MDC split , but Mugabe 's tactics of harassment and intimidation backfired and only enhanced the opposition leader 's image .
He was badly beaten after he took part in a prayer meeting that police claimed was illegal .
Mugabe said the veteran trade unionist "" deserved "" his treatment for disobeying police orders , but pictures of a battered Tsvangirai did wonders for his reputation as a man with enough guts to stand up to an increasingly ruthless dictator .
In an effort to discredit Tsvangirai , the government accused him of plotting to kill Mugabe ahead of the controversial 2002 elections .
The prosecution 's case rested on the testimony of Ari Ben - Menashe , a Canada - based consultant .
Menashe testified that in a secretly filmed meeting in December 2001 , Tsvangirai asked him to arrange Mugabe 's assassination .
The defence team said the tape was doctored as part of a plot to entrap Tsvangirai and the court subsequently acquitted Tsvangirai of the treason charges .
While Tsvangirai 's bravery is not an issue , there have been questions about his political judgment and an authoritarian streak that was evident during the MDC split .
The world will soon find out whether he measures up to his new status ."
2008-09-15,"The Zimbabwean president , Robert Mugabe , and the opposition leader , Morgan Tsvangirai , today shook hands perfunctorily after signing an agreement to share power that could be the prelude to western financial help for the country 's wrecked economy .
The two arch - rivals and the leader of a breakaway opposition faction , Arthur Mutambara , signed documents at the main Harare convention centre on an occasion marked by pomp and ceremony , although Mugabe and Tsvangirai for the most part were unsmiling .
In a sign of the changing times , Tsvangirai - who will become prime minister under the deal - addressed the dignitaries first after the signing rather than Mugabe .
He appealed for unity among Zimbabweans and for help from the international community to rebuild the country . ""
Let us not be divided by the past but united in the hope for the future , "" Tsvangirai said in a speech frequently punctuated by cheers and applause .
He left until the end of his address to mention Mugabe , saying he was extending the hand that had signed the power - sharing agreement to the president .
Tsvangirai said he had chosen to be driven by hope rather than past wrongs , and spoke of the need for accountability over past abuses .
"" We must forget past hardships , "" he said .
"" We must remember the sacrifices of our colleagues .
Only in the acknowledgment of past wrongs can we begin the process of national healing . ""
Mugabe sought to link today 's event to Zimbabwe 's independence struggle in the 1970s . ""
This gathering is a re - enactment in my view of that togetherness , the partnership , the cooperation , "" that eventually led to independence for African countries , he said .
The two men pledged to make the deal work even as violence broke out among rival supporters outside the convention centre .
As the signing ceremony ended , stones were thrown and police fired warning shots and set dogs on the crowd .
Several hundred people broke through the gates into the centre 's sprawling grounds .
Police closed the barriers and struggled to contain both those inside and outside .
The signing took place after short introductions by the king of Swaziland , Mswati III , and Thabo Mbeki , the South African president , who brokered the agreement .
In a ceremony designed to show an African approach to solving an African crisis , leaders from across the continent gathered to see what could be the changing of the guard after Mugabe 's long reign .
The deal was the culmination of three months of difficult negotiations by Mbeki at the behest of the Southern African Development Community .
Mbeki arrived today with his foreign affairs minister , Nkosazana Dlamini - Zuma , and Sydney Mufamadi , a cabinet minister who has led the negotiations .
The agreement , which has yet to be made public , describes the seizure of land owned by white farmers – a policy that dramatically deepened Zimbabwe 's economic crisis - as irreversible and says Britain should compensate those whose land was taken .
Britain said it would support the new government if it started to reverse the country 's steep economic decline .
"" We hope that the new government will now reverse the tragic policies and decline of recent years , "" the foreign secretary , David Miliband , said in a statement .
"" The new government needs to start to rebuild the country .
If it does so , Britain and the rest of the international community will be quick to support them . ""
The EU welcomed the breakthrough , but its foreign policy chief , Javier Solana , said officials would probably wait until next month to consider lifting sanctions .
The EU wants to see whether Mugabe really does cede power to the opposition .
Under the broad outlines of the deal , Tsvangirai would become prime minister and would chair a council of ministers that supervised the cabinet .
Mugabe 's Zanu - PF party would have 15 cabinet seats , Tsvangirai 's Movement for Democratic Change 13 , and a splinter MDC faction three seats .
The opposition has demanded control of the police , while agreeing to allow Mugabe – who has been in power since independence in 1980 - to retain control of the military .
Both the police and military have been blamed for state - orchestrated violence and torture of Mugabe 's opponents .
Some critics who wanted Mugabe to surrender power completely have complained that the deal does not go far enough and creates a complicated arrangement that Mugabe could exploit , especially given the tension that exists between the two opposition factions .
Mugabe , who once said the MDC would never rule Zimbabwe , and Tsvangirai have been enemies for a decade .
Tsvangirai has been jailed , beaten , tortured and tried on treason charges that were dismissed in court .
The sheer scale of Zimbabwe 's economic meltdown forced the two men to the negotiating table .
The country has by far the world 's highest official inflation rate , at 11 million per cent .
Independent financial institutions put the real inflation figure closer to 40 million per cent and rising daily .
Zanu - PF and MDC negotiators met early today to discuss how to allocate the 31 ministries .
Names of individuals to head the ministries are likely to be announced later in the week , a government official said .
There would also be a national security council , replacing a joint operations command comprising security service chiefs who the opposition say were instrumental in organising a violent campaign that returned Mugabe to power ."
2008-09-15,"· Robert Mugabe will remain president with Morgan Tsvangirai as prime minister .
The leader of a small political faction , Arthur Mutambara , is deputy prime minister .
· Mugabe will head the cabinet which will set policy .
Tsvangirai will head a council of ministers to oversee cabinet decisions and day to day administration .
· Reviving the economy , particularly food production , will be a priority .
The government will establish a National Economic Council of politicians and representatives of industry to advise on economic renewal .
· There will be no reversal of the redistribution of white - owned farms .
Britain is urged to fulfil its commitment at Zimbabwe 's independence in 1980 to pay compensation to affected farmers .
But the new government will carry out a land audit designed to prevent multiple ownership , after some Zanu - PF leaders seized several farms for themselves .
· Parliament will oversee the drafting of a new constitution which will be put to a referendum . ·
The agreement assures free political activity and freedom of speech .
Government institutions will be delinked from the ruling Zanu - PF party .
· The deal calls for an end to sanctions against Mugabe and senior Zanu - PF officials and the refusal of international financial institutions to offer loans and grants . ·
A Joint Monitoring and Implementation Committee , representing all the political parties , will ensure the agreement is implemented ."
2008-09-15,"Thabo Mbeki has got his deal in Zimbabwe , although too late , probably , to save his own skin in South Africa .
Robert Mugabe retains the presidency and control over the army , and Morgan Tsvangirai , the man who bears the physical scars of his regime , has at last got executive power as prime minister .
Will any of this work ?
As the opposition senator David Coltart said , the deal signed yesterday means that virtually all of the cabinet members nominated by the two factions of the Movement for Democratic Change have now to sit down with the very people who ordered them to be brutalised .
For those seeking justice for the hundreds killed , the thousands injured , and the tens of thousands who have lost their homes , this was always going to be hard to swallow .
Mr Mugabe has got away with murder , at least for the time being .
But if the two factions of the MDC can work together - and that is a big if - the former liberation fighter turned autocrat will still have lost , and lost disastrously .
He retains the army , but the generals will abide by the constitution .
The MDC gains control of the police , which is vital if elections are to be held in two years time .
No one is in any doubt that if free elections were held , Zanu - PF would be wiped off the map .
The issue is what happens between now and then .
Zanu - PF are expected to retain control of the prisons and the prosecuting authorities .
They fear that prosecutors , unleashed from their control , would do to them what they did to the MDC .
But that still leaves the MDC not only with finance ( they will be the conduit of the foreign aid package ) but also the ministries which spend money , like health and education .
This puts the former opposition movement into a position where power and influence will naturally flow to them .
They will be the ones distributing food and relief to the hardest hit rural areas .
No longer will Zanu - PF be able to starve villagers into submission .
That , in itself , is change .
There is much that can sour .
Mr Mugabe 's power lies in his ability to exploit the personality differences between the two factions of the MDC .
Everyone remembers what his close embrace did to Joshua Nkomo 's Zapu .
But this is a power which the MDC can resist , if they set about the business of government collectively .
As the MDC 's power grows , life will become progressively more difficult for hardliners in Zanu - PF who face the threat of a free press and private prosecutions .
That is the optimistic scenario .
But it still remains the case that this settlement is the MDC 's to wreck .
They have the support of the people , control of the coffers , and the confidence of foreign governments .
The question is whether they can deliver ."
2008-09-15,"The new prime minister spoke about the future .
The old president ranted about the past .
Morgan Tsvangirai focused on hope .
It may be a tough road ahead , said the man about to take over the day to day running of Zimbabwe , but the alternative was the rapidly looming abyss of a failed state .
He promised swift action to get food to the millions on the brink of starvation and to lift the dead hand of oppression .
There was no such vision from Robert Mugabe , who signed away 28 years of political domination yesterday by agreeing to share power only because he was looking into the same abyss and could offer no way out .
He dredged up his favoured targets ( Britain and the west ) , blamed his opponents for the country 's economic collapse and the political violence , and offered a coded warning to the people with whom he will share government that they had better not be colonial stooges .
But between the implied threats and recriminations , the old and new leaders of Zimbabwe promised commitment - begrudgingly in Mugabe 's case - to making the deal work , while their supporters , celebrating in their thousands outside , could only guess at what it all means .
The men and women in Zanu - PF and Movement for Democratic Change T - shirts singing and eyeing each other with caution agreed that the deal was historic .
They agreed that Mugabe 's days in power were numbered .
But there were lots of doubts that the foes could work together .
Tsvangirai said the deal for him to be prime minister while Mugabe clings on as president required painful compromises after eight years of struggle for democracy - after all , the people voted to make Tsvangirai the president .
But it represented "" the return of hope "" for freedom from fear , poverty , hunger and oppression .
"" I have signed this agreement because I believe it represents the best opportunity for us to build a peaceful , prosperous , democratic Zimbabwe .
I have signed this agreement because my belief in Zimbabwe and its peoples runs deeper than the scars I bear from the struggle .
I have signed this agreement because my hope for the future is greater than the grief I have for the needless suffering of the past years , "" he said .
Mugabe did not see it as hope of a brighter country at all .
"" There are a lot of things in the agreement I did not like and still do not like , "" he said .
He was looking to blame and fell back on his favourite target , Britain , and how it wanted to get rid of him .
But , he made clear , he is still there .
"" They spoke of regime change and you heard them .
They 're still speaking of it .
We had not done anything to Britain .
Why , why , why the hand of the British ?
Why , why , why the hand of the Americans here ? "" he said .
He settled into a favoured theme : his seizure and redistribution of white - owned farms is irreversible - a "" salient principle "" , as he calls it .
He warned the MDC not to go against that .
Mugabe finally got around to a half - hearted endorsement of the deal .
"" We will do our best , "" he said while giving off the whiff of a defeated man seeing an unwelcome future before him .
Outside the convention hall where the agreement was signed , in the shadow of the Zanu - PF headquarters , there was hope tempered by uncertainty and suspicion .
Mugabe 's supporters were generally pessimistic , including Willard , 23 .
"" It is not a good deal .
We ca n't work with these people .
Their principles are different .
They are violent , "" he said , gesturing toward the MDC supporters .
"" We need a better life .
We need to drink beer every day .
"" Some of the MDC supporters celebrated finally being able to demonstrate their political loyalties in public .
But Mutindi Stanislous , a 52 year - old agriculturalist , remained cautious .
"" It 's not as good as we want , but for now we will accept it .
We won the election .
Zanu - PF lost .
The leader of the MDC had to succumb to the pressure to save the people , "" he said .
But Stanislous saw this as the beginning of the end for Mugabe .
Tendai Myamakope , a jobless 27-year - old , agreed .
"" We now know all Mugabe 's tricks , "" he said .
"" Everything 's got an end .
He 's going - but slowly . """
2008-09-16,"Zimbabwe 's new prime minister , Morgan Tsvangirai , yesterday described Robert Mugabe as "" giving up "" and said that he would seek to govern by sidelining the beleaguered president whose own party is "" moving on "" without him .
But , in an interview with the Guardian , Tsvangirai acknowledged that a climate of suspicion and mistrust between his own Movement for Democratic Change and Mugabe 's Zanu - PF party would test his political skills as prime minister at the head of a coalition government of former opponents - some of whom are responsible for overseeing a vicious campaign of violence against other members of the new administration .
That suspicion will not be eased by a warning from Tsvangirai that while Mugabe is unlikely to be called to account for his crimes , others in the Zanu - PF leadership - including some who may sit in the new cabinet - could face trial .
"" I do n't think Mugabe himself as a person can be held accountable .
But there are various levels of institutional violence that has taken place
and I 'm sure we 'll be able to look at that , "" he said .
"" Let the rule of law apply ...
We all cry for the rule of law , and if somebody 's committed an offence he should be prosecuted .
"" Under the power - sharing deal signed on Monday , Tsvangirai will head a council of ministers responsible for the day - to - day running of the country , while Mugabe will chair a cabinet of the same ministers to agree policy .
The two factions of the MDC combined have a majority of one in both bodies .
Tsvangirai acknowledged that working in the cabinet would be testing .
"" There 's an inherent suspicion , there 's inherent mistrust of Robert Mugabe .
It 's understandable given his history , given his role .
It 's part of his legacy .
But he also must understand that the future is not in the hands of Robert Mugabe .
The future is in the hands of those who are advocating a change of direction because that is what is going to rescue this country .
And I think he appreciates that , "" he said .
Tsvangirai believes that heading the council of ministers , without Mugabe present , will allow him to sideline the president and govern directly by establishing a working relationship with Zanu - PF cabinet ministers who realise that Mugabe is part of the past .
"" That 's the whole purpose of having a council of ministers , that we are able to build a structured relationship outside the cabinet . ""
But how is he going to control the council of ministers , many of whom have expressed contempt for him , or worse ?
"" It has to be a combination of personal cultivation of the team and to remove these negative attitudes .
I 'm sure we do n't all have to agree .
We will disagree .
But at the end of the day we have to be motivated by what is the best interests of the country .
I 'll try to encourage that , "" he said .
He acknowledged that some of Mugabe 's ministers would seek to sabotage his leadership .
"" Those will be sour grapes and I 'm sure that anyone who engages in those kind of negative tendencies is holding the country to ransom .
For what purpose ? ""
Mugabe 's speech after the signing of the accord on Monday was not a good omen .
The president dwelled on the past and gave only a belated and half - hearted commitment to make the power - sharing agreement work .
"" That was vintage Mugabe at his best : unrepentant , defiant , even when he was giving up , "" said Tsvangirai .
But he insisted that the future lay beyond Mugabe and that even his Zanu - PF party was moving beyond him .
"" They see this old man who is defiant right up to the end .
But he was also able to give the country a chance to rescue itself from the malaise and start over again .
"" Many in the MDC are suspicious of compromise .
They want to force out men such as the police chief , Augustine Chihuri , who said he would never salute Tsvangirai and who used his force as part of the assault on the MDC during the election .
Tsvangirai sees it differently . ""
Chihuri is just an individual .
We 're not talking about individuals here .
We 're talking about a process ... in which individuals have to fit a transformative agenda or find themselves not fitting with the spirit of the new agenda . ""
Or as another senior MDC official put it : "" They have to salute us or leave . ""
Tsvangirai referred back to the compromises at the end of white rule 28 years ago .
"" We had a similar kind of people in 1980 , those who refused to accept black majority rule has arrived and were even undermining the government , even going to the extent of sabotaging the government .
In the process of change of this nature that is expected , but it does not stop a train moving forward , "" he said .
But to move the train forward , Tsvangirai needs foreign money to rebuild an economy shattered by hyperinflation , plunder of the central bank , and a collapse in agriculture and manufacturing .
The Europeans and Americans have earmarked about £ 1bn in help but first they want to see that Tsvangirai really is in charge and that Mugabe really is giving up .
"" They are sceptical because they mistrust Mugabe but they are also aware of their obligations , "" he said .
"" I hope that they would look at this [ agreement ] as a positive step that should be supported ... because they were supporting the democratic struggle in the country . ""
That struggle began in earnest eight years ago as the government seized white - owned farms in the name of righting a historical wrong .
The process was so corrupt and botched that agriculture has collapsed as a result .
But on this issue , Tsvangirai now agrees with Mugabe .
The land will never go back to the white farmers .
"" Do n't underestimate the political and economic consequences of land but we want to solve this once and for all so that never again should land be used as a political tool , "" he said .
"" We do n't have any intention of going back to pre-2000 . ""
Donors cautious about aid Western donors remain cautious about the political settlement in Zimbabwe and want to see further progress before unlocking a £ 1bn aid package .
The US ambassador to Harare , James McGee , told the Associated Press that Washington was adopting a "" very careful wait - and - see stance "" .
"" If this works out the way Mr Tsvangirai hopes it will , we will be very willing to work with the people of Zimbabwe , "" he said .
But while large amounts of financial aid will not be forthcoming until the US sees evidence that it is Morgan Tsvangirai and not Robert Mugabe who is in charge , McGee said the US would provide food to alleviate widespread malnutrition .
EU foreign ministers said the government had to prove itself democratically before economic aid was resumed .
They said the EU was prepared to "" adopt a set of economic support measures "" but only in support of "" a transitional government taking the steps to restore democracy and the rule of law in Zimbabwe "" .
The French foreign minister , Bernard Kouchner , who chaired EU talks on sanctions , said : "" We are happy about what is happening there
but it 's not the end .
It will be a long process .
"" Australia 's foreign minister , Stephen Smith , described the political settlement as "" modest progress "" and said sanctions against Mugabe and other Zanu - PF leaders would not be lifted until there was evidence of progress on human rights and economic reconstruction ."

2008-09-18,"Zimbabwe 's leaders today failed to agree on how to divide up the cabinet under a power - sharing agreement that was supposed to end the country 's political crisis .
"" The meeting was inconclusive , it was a deadlock and has been referred to the negotiating teams for further work to try and find common ground , "" said Nelson Chamisa , a spokesman for the opposition Movement for Democratic Change .
President Robert Mugabe and the leaders of the two MDC factions - the would - be prime minister Morgan Tsvangirai and Arthur Mutambara - left the talks today without agreement .
Negotiations are to resume on Saturday .
The three men signed up on Tuesday to split a 31-member cabinet between the three parties .
Zanu - PF was to have 15 ministries , while the two factions of the MDC would hold 16 .
Ahead of the meeting , state media quoted Mugabe as describing power - sharing as a humiliation . ""
Anyhow , here we are , still in a dominant position which will enable us to gather more strength as we move into the future .
We remain in the driving seat , "" he was reported as saying .
The deal followed weeks of negotiations to end a political crisis following disputed presidential elections in March , when the MDC won more seats than the ruling Zanu - PF party .
Tsvangirai beat Mugabe in the presidential vote but the state - appointed electoral commission said he did not have the more than 50 % needed to avoid a second round .
Tsvangirai boycotted the runoff because of violence against his supporters .
Under this week 's complex deal , Mugabe , who has ruled Zimbabwe since independence from Britain in 1980 , will retain the presidency , head the cabinet and keep control of the army .
The police are expected to fall under the opposition 's remit .
Western governments have welcomed the deal , brokered by Thabo Mbeki , the South African president , but have said they will wait to see whether a unity government is committed to political and economic reforms before they provide aid for the ruined economy .
Once one of Africa 's brightest hopes , Zimbabwe is now an economic shambles .
Inflation has rocketed to over 11 million per cent and millions have fled to neighbouring countries ."
2008-09-25,"Robert Mugabe cast himself into the glare of media attention at the UN general assembly in New York yesterday , taking the opportunity to lash out at Britain and America , which he accused of inflicting untold suffering on the people of Zimbabwe .
The president of Zimbabwe was centre stage at the UN building when his turn came round to deliberate before the assembly about the state of the world through his eyes .
He did not refer to the elections and the violence his regime unleashed against the opposition led by Morgan Tsvangirai until their power - sharing deal , choosing instead to focus on the food crisis which he blamed on western sanctions . ""
Those who falsely accuse us of these violations are themselves international perpetrators of genocide , acts of aggression and mass destruction , "" he said .
He appealed to the assembly floor , which was notable for the absence of any US delegation , to "" apply pressure for the immediate removal of these sanctions by Britain , the United States and their allies , which have brought untold suffering to our people "" .
Mugabe also blamed global warming for the widespread scarcity of food in his country .
Droughts and floods over the past seven years had disrupted the food supply , he said , implicitly rejecting the widespread view that it stems from the economic disruption that followed his state seizure of large farms owned by whites , and the crippling inflation rate of at least 11m% and rising .
In an interview with Associated Press in advance of his UN address , Mugabe further taunted the British and US governments .
"" They are waiting for a day when this man , this evil man , called Robert Mugabe is no longer in control .
And I do n't know when that day is coming . ""
He said he had no thoughts of resigning .
Nor "" any thought of dying "" ."
2008-09-30,"The Zimbabwe power - sharing agreement today appeared near collapse after President Robert Mugabe demanded the right to appoint all key cabinet ministers , rendering the opposition toothless at the helm of the country .
After an hour - long meeting between the 84-year - old president and prime minister - elect Morgan Tsvangirai , his opposition Movement for Democratic Change ( MDC ) said it had asked South African mediator Thabo Mbeki to salvage the power - sharing process .
However , South African officials tonight could not confirm they had received such a request , amid confusion since Mbeki resigned as president on September 21 .
MDC spokesman Nelson Chamisa said : "" We want to share power .
But Mugabe wants to swallow the MDC .
We will not allow that .
He wants all the key ministries - finance , home affairs , defence , information , foreign affairs , justice and even women and youth . ""
On Monday , after returning from the United Nations General Assembly in New York , Mugabe told a crowd at Harare airport that he would appoint a cabinet "" before the end of this week "" , suggesting he would not await the agreement of the MDC .
Zimbabwe has been without a government since parliament was dissolved in January ahead of elections on March 29 in which the MDC won a lower house majority and Tsvangirai forced Mugabe to a presidential run - off poll .
The violence that preceded the second election , on June 30 , prompted the opposition leader to withdraw .
Under a power - sharing agreement mediated by Mbeki and signed on September 15 , the government was to have 31 ministries .
In a bid to reflect the parliamentary election result , 13 of the ministries were to be nominated by Tsvangirai 's MDC and a further three by another faction of the MDC , led by Arthur Mutambara .
But talks about which ministries would be offered to whom had not been completed before the signing and the process quickly began to falter amid an unrelated power - struggle in South Africa which saw Mbeki ousted as president a week later .
In New York last week , Mugabe claimed agreement had been reached on all but four ministries , which he did not name but which were believed to be home affairs , finance , local government and foreign affairs .
The international community were looking to the MDC winning control of at least the finance ministry and preferably foreign affairs before resuming full trade relations and ultimately considering lifting travel bans and asset restrictions on leading figures in the ruling Zimbabwe African National Union - Patriotic Front ( Zanu - PF ) .
Observers had suggested that Mugabe wanted to retain control of the defence ministry - and therefore the army - but might be prepared to relinquish home affairs - and thus control of the police - to the opposition .
But it now appears that negotiations had never reached such an advanced stage .
Nor did they progress while Mugabe was in the United States for 10 days .
University of Zimbabwe political analyst John Makumbe said the agreement was "" full of holes "" from the start .
He said : "" I do not know what the MDC were thinking when they signed it .
The agreement left Mugabe with all the powers .
It was defective because it never allocated the levers of power . ""
Now he has behaved in his predictable fashion .
He is not only backing out of the deal but it is clear that he was simply trying to use the MDC as a glove to bring back foreign direct investment . ""
By the end of this week we can expect to have a cabinet just as Mugabe wants it .
He is under pressure from the old guard in Zanu - PF who do not want to lose their jobs . ""
Makumbe shared misgivings expressed by several observers about Mbeki 's future role .
Despite having been endorsed by the Southern African Development Community and the African Union to continue as mediator , he is seen as lacking clout now that he is no longer president ."

2008-10-03,"Zimbabwe once again attracted remarkable international attention in 2008 , this time over highly controversial elections and protracted negotiations between Zimbabwe 's main political actors aimed at finding a resolution to the country 's political crisis .
A Thabo Mbeki brokered power - sharing deal between Robert Mugabe 's Zanu - PF and the two MDC factions , led by Morgan Tsvangirai and Arthur Mutambara respectively , was finally reached on September 15 2008 .
Southern African Development Community ( SADC ) leaders celebrated .
The international community 's response was lukewarm .
The likes of Mbeki felt vindicated after years of bearing criticism for his "" quiet diplomacy "" .
Others , such as hardliners in Zanu - PF and Zimbabwe 's security establishment , were disgruntled .
For many Zimbabweans inside the country , the deal was a ray of hope because life had become a punishing drudgery .
A life of enduring the merciless African sun while queuing for food and a worthless national currency .
The wretchedness is compounded by the breakdown of service delivery , skyrocketing inflation , the breakdown of the rule of law , the politicisation of the police , military , civil service and judiciary , and the violence meted out by the state on citizens it ought to protect .
In the midst of evident collapse and misery one would have thought that the power - sharing deal will be implemented with alacrity by the three political parties .
But Zimbabwe is a difficult country politically .
It has a penchant for throwing up the unexpected and many of its current problems have robust historical roots that will not be easily uprooted .
It is little surprise that a deadlock has developed between the political parties over the formation of a cabinet to run the country .
Zanu - PF is bent on retaining powerful ministerial posts such as state security , defence , home affairs and finance .
In spite of the MDC 's majority in parliament and Tsvangirai amassing the most votes in the first presidential election round , Zanu - PF still views the MDC as a subordinate party .
The Tsvangirai MDC has called on former South African President , Thabo Mbeki , to continue with his mediation efforts in order to break the deadlock .
On the other hand Zanu - PF insists that Mbeki 's mediation is not required because there is no deadlock .
The contestation over Mbeki 's renewed involvement in Zimbabwe is odd .
Mbeki is still recovering from the fallout of his humiliating resignation as South African president .
Whether he still has the verve and authority to continue as mediator is unclear .
The new South African president Kgalema Motlanthe has been quick to throw his weight behind Mbeki 's proposed continued mediation .
Whether this is a reflection of his faith in Mbeki 's negotiation skills or is an attempt to duck having to deal with a difficult situation that may haunt his presidency in the manner it did Mbeki 's is also unclear .
However , the issue is less about whether Mbeki should continue in his role and the various motives at play .
Mbeki 's efforts reached their peak when the power - sharing deal was signed .
There is little he or any other mediator can add to the actual power - sharing process .
The onus is on Zimbabwean politicians , particularly those in Zanu - PF , to show political maturity and commitment to the deal for the sake of national interest , and to foster trust and unity between each other and the nation .
These qualities are rare in Zimbabwean political culture because in the place of civil dialogue there is uncivil dialogue .
In the place of meritocracy there is seniority .
In the place of a culture of conflict resolution there are "" degrees in violence "" guaranteeing particular political interests .
In the place of issue - based politics there is labelling based on the extent of one 's liberation war credentials .
Being the dominant nationalist party for approximately 40 years , Zanu - PF is guilty of having generated this political culture .
The result is that Zimbabwean politics has been rendered exclusive and impenetrable to those who seek to challenge the views of Zanu - PF .
The party is the be all and end all and those outside of it are illegitimate .
As former vice - president Simon Muzenda once noted , "" If Zanu - PF puts up a baboon as a candidate , you vote for the baboon . ""
Other leading Zanu - PF politicians such as Nathan Shamuyarira boast unselfconsciously that "" the area of violence is an area where Zanu - PF has a very strong , long and successful history "" .
And while individuals associated with the MDC have attempted to develop reasoned and democratic politics , both MDCs are susceptible to a politics akin to Zanu - PF 's .
Opposition politics is also a habitat for violence and undemocratic practices .
It too is characterised by personalised and immature politics , and contemptible invective such as the Tsvangirai MDC secretary general Tendai Biti 's public branding of rival MDC member Gift Chimanikire as a "" smelly fat man who does not bath "" and Chimanikire 's retort that Biti "" suffered from diarrhoea "" .
A melancholy truth about Zimbabwean politics is its lack of gravitas .
It is rudimentary , trifling , divisive , intolerant and blind to the national interest – this is the crux of the matter , not whether Mbeki should stay on as mediator and be called in ."
2008-10-10,"This year 's Nobel peace prize has been awarded to Martti Ahtisaari , peace negotiator and former president of Finland , for his efforts on several continents and over three decades to resolve international conflicts , including in Northern Ireland , Nambia , Aceh , Kosovo and Iraq .
Reports in the run - up to today 's announcement speculated that Chinese dissidents Hu Jia and Gao Zhisheng were likely to win in a nod to this year marking the 60th anniversary of the signing of the United Nations ' Declaration of Human Rights – prompting Beijing to issue a veiled warning that the prize should go to what it called "" the right person "" .
Others said to be in the frame included the Zimbabwean politician Morgan Tsvangirai and the French - Colombian politician Ingrid Betancourt .
Some 164 individuals and 33 organisations were nominated for this year 's prize , including Bob Geldof , Vladimir Putin , Thich Quang Do and the Esperanto language .
The Norwegian Nobel Committee – a five - strong body that awards the prize each year – does not publish a list of nominees , but those who nominate ( including academics , parliamentarians and former laureates ) can choose to reveal their choices .
Former winners of the Nobel peace prize – which was first awarded in 1901 – include Martin Luther King Jr , Mother Teresa , Nelson Mandela and Shirin Ebadi .

2008-10-12,"Zimbabwe 's opposition leader , Morgan Tsvangirai , today threatened to pull out of a power - sharing deal after the country 's president , Robert Mugabe , unilaterally announced he had taken control of all major cabinet posts , including those responsible for the military and police .
South Africa 's former president , Thabo Mbeki , is expected in Harare tomorrow to try and rescue the agreement he brokered , under which Tsvangirai is appointed prime minister and Mugabe remains president but with far few powers than before .
Tsvangirai told a rally in Harare today that he would not be pressured by Mugabe into joining an administration dominated by the president 's Zanu - PF party when the opposition Movement for Democratic Change ( MDC ) won the last reputable elections in March . ""
If they do it that way , we have no right to be part of such an arrangement , "" said Tsvangirai .

That is important to Tsvangirai to ensure that Zanu - PF does not repeat its violent campaign at the next election .
Mugabe 's move is a demonstration of his power to obstruct the political deal he described as "" humiliating "" after he was forced to sign it last month .

Mugabe only signed the political agreement with the opposition because his administration has no solutions to the economic crisis .
Thus , while he can block implementation of the deal , and keep control of the government , he will be left facing even deeper problems than when he was forced into the deal .
Neither can Mugabe count on Mbeki to protect him after a change of administration in South Africa .

2008-10-12,"Zimbabwe 's opposition leader , Morgan Tsvangirai , yesterday threatened to pull out of a power - sharing deal after President Robert Mugabe unilaterally announced that the ruling Zanu - PF party would control all main cabinet posts , including the military and police .
South Africa 's former president , Thabo Mbeki , is expected in Harare today to try and rescue the deal he brokered , under which Tsvangirai would be appointed prime minister and Mugabe would remain president but with far fewer powers .
Tsvangirai told a rally in Harare yesterday that he would not be pressured by Mugabe into joining an administration dominated by Zanu - PF , when the opposition Movement for Democratic Change won the last reputable elections in March . ""
If they do it that way , we have no right to be part of such an arrangement , "" said Tsvangirai .
"" The people have suffered .
But if it means suffering the more in order for them to get what is at stake , then so be it .
We will renegotiate until an agreement is reached , but that does not mean we will compromise for the sake of it . ""

2008-10-13,"Zimbabwe 's president , Robert Mugabe , pressed ahead with his unilateral imposition of a new government yesterday , in defiance of a power - sharing deal with Morgan Tsvangirai , by swearing in two new vice - presidents .
They took office hours before South Africa 's former president , Thabo Mbeki , was expected in the capital , Harare , in an attempt to rescue the deal he brokered last month which has stalled over Mugabe 's insistence on taking control of all major cabinet posts , particularly the military , police and justice portfolios .
Under the agreement Tsvangirai is appointed prime minister while Mugabe remains president but with greatly reduced powers .
The cabinet is almost evenly divided between the two .
Tsvangirai 's Movement for Democratic Change described the swearing in of Joyce Mujuru and Joseph Msika , Mugabe 's former vice - presidents , as an act of bad faith , even though under the agreement Mugabe is allowed to reappoint them .
The MDC leader has said he will not join an administration in which Mugabe retains control of all major ministries .
Without Tsvangirai 's participation there is little chance of a government being recognised outside Zimbabwe .
"" It is important that there is an international united response that says the results of the elections need to be respected and a power grab will not be respected , "" the foreign secretary , David Miliband , said outside an EU meeting in Luxembourg .
EU foreign ministers said sanctions would not be lifted until the powersharing deal was implemented .
The French foreign minister , Bernard Kouchner , said : "" We are worried about the situation ... and will certainly not abandon Mr Tsvangirai . """
2008-10-14,"Crisis talks to break the deadlock in Zimbabwe 's power - sharing agreement have begun ahead of the first session of the opposition - controlled parliament .
The president , Robert Mugabe , and the opposition leader , Morgan Tsvangirai , arrived at a hotel in Harare to meet with the former South African president Thabo Mbeki , who flew into the Zimbabwean capital late last night to mediate the talks .
A spokesperson said Mbeki remained confident the deal could be rescued .
"" We are convinced that we should be able in the end , no matter how long it takes , to reach a conclusion , "" he said .
The agreement stalled after Mugabe unilaterally allocated key cabinet posts to members of the ruling Zanu - PF party , prompting Tsvangirai to threaten to pull out of negotiations .
Tsvangirai said he would not join an administration in which Mugabe retained control of all major ministries .
Without the opposition leader 's participation there is little chance of a government being recognised outside Zimbabwe .
Mugabe 's moves have prompted widespread condemnation .
The foreign secretary , David Miliband , yesterday called for a united international response , saying : "" The results of the elections need to be respected and a power grab will not be respected . ""
Miliband 's views were echoed by fellow EU foreign ministers who said sanctions would not be lifted until the power - sharing deal was implemented .
The French foreign minister , Bernard Kouchner , said : "" We are worried about the situation ... and will certainly not abandon Mr Tsvangirai . ""
Politicians in the opposition - dominated parliament today met for the first time since its official opening last month when Mugabe was jeered by opposition MPs .
No details about the agenda were immediately available .
The first sitting of a new session routinely starts with a debate on Mugabe 's comments at the official opening .
In March elections , the opposition narrowly won control of the 210-seat parliament for the first time since independence in 1980 ."
2008-10-17,"The power - sharing deal signed last month between President Robert Mugabe 's ruling Zanu - PF and Morgan Tsvangirai 's MDC is on the verge of collapse .
The former South African president , Thabo Mbeki , who brokered the agreement , returned as mediator on Tuesday to try to resurrect the talks which according to Tsvangirai are deadlocked .
Inflation in Zimbabwe is running at 231m% and nearly half of the population will need food aid by early 2009 according to the UN , which is predicting a "" famine emergency "" .
The west is sitting on a £ 1bn aid package for Zimbabwe which it will only release when it receives evidence that Mugabe is no longer in power .
But there is little sign of that , and reports emerging from the country last weekend indicated that several key ministerial jobs have been allocated unilaterally to members of his Zanu - PF party .
If Mugabe does go back on his word , it will not be the first time .
He did so most notably in his 1987 deal with Joshua Nkomo .
So was Tsvangirai naive to sign up to this settlement , or just desperate for peace ?
To many , this whole process appears to be at best fundamentally flawed , and at worst a complete sham .
Meanwhile , last Saturday the Zimbabwe Vigil Coalition celebrated its sixth anniversary outside the Zimbabwean embassy in London .
It has been meeting there every week to protest against human rights abuses and to call for free and fair internationally monitored elections in the country .
They are also asking for the aid package to be withheld until Mugabe is out of office , fearing that otherwise it will all go to his supporters .
For these exiled opponents in London , the struggle continues , and they clearly think that the old leopard has not changed his spots .
I asked them whether they believed that this negotiated settlement with Mugabe could ever bring peace and democracy in their country ."
2008-10-23,"Morgan Tsvangirai and the MDC have often been criticised for their failings in confronting Robert Mugabe and Zanu - PF 's authoritarian rule .
Certainly , the MDC has reproduced some of Zanu - PF 's undemocratic practices . ""
He who fights with monsters should look to it that he himself does not become a monster .
And when you gaze long into an abyss the abyss also gazes into you , "" as Nietzsche wrote .
For a long time , the MDC did not understand what sort of political animal Zanu - PF is and the lengths it would go to in order to maintain power , particularly its manipulation of Zimbabwe 's history to shore up its waning legitimacy and the party 's resort to political violence .
As Tsvangirai once admitted to me , the MDC was "" naïve "" for thinking "" Mugabe would give up power through the ballot box "" and was unaware that Mugabe would use the "" land question to delegitimise a legitimate opposition movement "" .
At its inception in 1999 , the MDC was a broad political party in terms of composition .
Consequently , defining itself was made all the more difficult .
It had to cater to its various constituencies and some of them , white farmers especially , left it exposed to Mugabe 's charge that the MDC was a "" puppet "" of white interests .
The MDC 's associations with the west also harmed the party 's image .
It did not criticise double standards over human rights in the west and the fact that Britain failed to honour its land reform commitments in Zimbabwe adequately .
Furthermore , the MDC had exaggerated faith in the power of the international community .
The international community is not a silver bullet that can open up internal space needed for democratic reform and human rights promotion .
Indeed , the international community 's involvement in Zimbabwe became part of the problem and not the solution .
"" We were a young and emerging party .
Mistakes happen , "" Tsvangirai conceded to me in 2006 .
I could go on expounding a litany of the MDC 's weaknesses : the party 's disunity ; the use of tribal politics by some of its members ; internal violence ; the party 's lack of depth in leadership qualities .
But doing so would be overlooking a point that many commentators continue to overlook when assessing the fortunes of Tsvangirai and the MDC , which is how difficult it is to conduct opposition politics in Zimbabwe .
Being an opposition party in Zimbabwe is one of the toughest political challenges in Africa and the evidence for this is long .
In the early 1980s , under the guise of crushing dissident activity , committed by a "" poorly armed group of less than 400 at their peak who survived mainly by avoiding confrontation "" , Mugabe deployed the army to Zimbabwe 's Matabeleland province where it carried out systematic violence and intimidation to crush Zapu – the main political opposition at the time .
An estimated 20,000 Zimbabweans lost their lives .
The sheer force and calculated methodology of the violence the MDC suffered at the hands of Zanu - PF in Zimbabwe 's presidential election runoff earlier this year was reminiscent of this early 1980s violence .
To be part of the opposition in Zimbabwe is to be a "" sell - out "" , "" un - African "" , "" pro - colonial "" and "" illegitimate "" .
It is to lose one 's human rights , as exemplified by Tsvangirai 's failure to attend a meeting of regional leaders , aimed at breaking Zimbabwe 's ongoing power sharing deadlock , in Swaziland on Monday because the state would not grant him a passport , curtailing his right to freedom of movement .
Tsvangirai , MDC members and supporters have , of course , witnessed worse .
Torture , beatings , detention , murder and harassment are the staple diet of those associated with the opposition .
The MDC 's continued existence – given the state 's attempts to destroy it since 1999 – speaks volumes of the immense courage and willpower the opposition has shown under Tsvangirai .
He is a flawed leader , and so is his party , but courage and the ability to endure are two qualities Tsvangirai and the MDC can never be faulted for .
Global bodies , African organisations and reform - minded African leaders owe them greater assistance in the face of Mugabe and Zanu - PF 's refusal to share power ."
2008-10-27,"The president of Zimbabwe , Robert Mugabe , and the country 's opposition leader , Morgan Tsvangirai , today finally sat down for talks aimed at ending a bitter deadlock over power sharing .
Mugabe , 84 , and Tsvangirai , the leader of the Movement for Democratic Change , declined to comment as they arrived at a Harare hotel for the summit organised by the Southern Africa Development Community ( SADC ) .
The South African president , Thabo Mbeki - who brokered the September 15 deal that foundered when Mugabe unilaterally gave key cabinet posts to his own supporters - said he was "" very optimistic "" of progress .
The leaders of fellow SADC members Angola , Mozambique and Swaziland also attended .
Tsvangirai did not go to a first round of talks in Swaziland last week after authorities in Harare failed to issue him with a new passport .
The MDC said the failure showed Mugabe 's ruling Zanu - PF was not serious about sharing power and wanted to treat it as a junior partner .
Mugabe 's main negotiator , Patrick Chinamasa , told the government - run Herald newspaper today that the latest discussions would "" end the saga over the allocation of ministries to bring finality one way or another so that the country can move forward "" .
Tsvangirai is expected to tell the meeting that his party must be allocated a sufficient share of important cabinet jobs .
The home affairs portfolio is one of the key positions in dispute .
It controls the police and was one of the posts claimed by Mugabe in his unilateral cabinet list this month .
Tsvangirai is known to be keen not to let Mugabe , who has ruled Zimbabwe since independence in 1980 , keep command of the police following what the MDC said was state - organised violence against its supporters during elections this year .
"" There is nothing wrong with the deal , but the problem is Mugabe wants to grab all key ministries , "" Tsvangirai told supporters at the weekend .
"" I will not go in if I am not given the tools to perform . ""
Tsvangirai defeated Mugabe in a presidential ballot in March , but not by a sufficient margin to avoid a run - off vote .
He pulled out of the run - off ballot in June after warning that the level of violence against MDC staff and supporters meant their lives were in danger .
If the two sides reach agreement and form a government they will finally be able to turn their attention to Zimbabwe 's economic and social crisis .
Much of the country 's population is deprived of sufficient food , fuel and other basic goods , while water , power and schools are in a state of near collapse ."
2008-11-10,"Southern African leaders last night said Zimbabwe 's politicians must form a power - sharing government immediately and end a deadlock over ministeries , but their call was rejected by Morgan Tsvangirai .
South Africa 's president , Kgalema Motlanthe , called on leaders to "" show political maturity "" in resolving a dispute over cabinet seats following the deal signed in September , which saw Robert Mugabe stay president and Tsvangirai , who won contested elections prior to the unopposed re - election of Mugabe , appointed prime minister .
Tsvangirai has refused to take his post as long as Mugabe controls all key ministries , including those for security and for finance .
The emergency summit of the 15-state Southern African Development Community ( Sadc ) , in Johannesburg , is the highest - level intervention to date .
Last night Sadc called for Tsvangirai 's Movement for Democratic Change party to co - manage Zimbabwe 's disputed home affairs ministry with the ruling Zanu - PF .
Tsvangirai said he was "" shocked and saddened "" by the outcome of the summit , after more than 12 hours of talks on the impasse and on violence in east Congo .
"" We need to form an inclusive government , today or tomorrow , "" Sadc executive secretary Tomaz Salamao said last night .
"" Sadc was asked to rule and took a decision , and that 's the position of Sadc .
Now it 's up to the parties to implement . ""
Zimbabwe 's state - run press said Mugabe would not give up key ministries .
Justice minister Patrick Chinamasa said that the government had agreed to share control of the interior ministry , which runs the police : "" The ball 's in Tsvangirai 's court . """
2008-11-10,"The Zimbabwean opposition leader , Morgan Tsvangirai , has accused the Southern African Development Community ( SADC ) of failing to stand up to the country 's president , Robert Mugabe .
The 15-nation group of southern African leaders yesterday proposed that Tsvangirai 's party share leadership of a key ministry with Mugabe 's party .
It said in a resolution that the Movement for Democratic Change ( MDC ) should form a unity government immediately with Zanu - PF and the parties should share control of the home affairs ministry , which runs the police .
But Tsvangirai said he could not accept sharing the ministry with his long - time political foe Mugabe , dashing hopes of a swift end to the country 's political crisis .
""
The MDC is shocked and saddened that the SADC summit has failed to tackle these key issues ...
a great opportunity has been missed by SADC to bring an end to the Zimbabwean crisis , "" he told a post - summit news conference .
The home affairs ministry has been one of the main sticking points in power - sharing talks , with Mugabe refusing to cede control over any aspect of the security apparatus that has helped maintain his grip on power .
Tsvangirai accused the SADC of lacking the "" courage and decency to look Robert Mugabe in the eyes and tell him his position was wrong "" , Reuters reported .
He said he would turn to the United Nations and the African Union for help , but was not abandoning the regional body , which has been mediating the Zimbabwe crisis for a year .
The South African president , Kgalema Motlanthe , said yesterday that the deal offered the only hope for Zimbabwe to ease the economic crisis .
Arthur Mutambara , the leader of a breakaway MDC faction , said the resolution calling for joint control of the ministry was backed unanimously by the SADC .
But the heads of state of Botswana and Zambia , the most outspoken regional critics of Mugabe , did not attend the summit .
Mugabe , who has been in power since independence from Britain in 1980 , was to remain president under the power - sharing deal , with Tsvangirai as prime minister ."
2008-11-24,"Talks to revive a power - sharing agreement between Zimbabwe 's political parties will resume tomorrow , the South African president , Kgalema Motlanthe , announced this morning .
His predecessor , Thabo Mbeki , will oversee negotiations to break the two - month deadlock between the Zimbabwean president , Robert Mugabe , the opposition leader , Morgan Tsvangirai , of the Movement for Democratic Change , and a breakaway MDC faction .
They will focus on a constitutional amendment that would allow the Zimbabwean parliament to authorise the formation of a power - sharing government and Tsvangirai 's appointment as prime minister . ""
Unless this root cause of the political absence of a legitimate government is solved , the situation will get worse and may implode and collapse , "" Motlanthe said .
An agreement to split cabinet posts between Mugabe 's Zanu - PF and the MDC was brokered in September but ran aground when Tsvangirai accused Mugabe of sabotaging the plan by allocating key posts – especially those relating to security – to his own party .
The main stumbling block is the allocation of the home affairs ministry , which oversees the police .
In addition , Mugabe wants to push through a constitutional amendment allowing him alone to pick the cabinet .
Tomorrow 's talks , which will take place in South Africa , will not address the issue of sharing cabinet posts .
Motlanthe 's concerns for Zimbabwe 's stability were echoed in South Africa by the ANC leader , Jacob Zuma , after a meeting with prominent figures including the former UN secretary general Kofi Annan and the former US president Jimmy Carter .
"" They believe the situation is very bad .
They believe things could collapse in a few months ' time in Zimbabwe , "" Zuma told the Reuters news agency .
"" The situation has gone [ beyond ] where we could say ' wait and see ' .
We are pleading for the leadership for the sake of the people to find a solution that would help them move forward . ""
Annan , Carter and the human rights advocate Graca Machel , who is Nelson Mandela 's wife , belong to a group of prominent figures and former state leaders known as the Elders .
They intended to visit Zimbabwe at the weekend but were barred from doing so .
On top of the rampant inflation and shortages of food and fuel that have blighted Zimbabwe , an outbreak of cholera in Harare has killed at least 294 people and prompted hundreds of others to stream across the South African border to seek treatment ."
2008-12-22,"The US yesterday called on southern African governments to force President Robert Mugabe from power , saying it had dropped support for the troubled agreement under which he was supposed to share power with his main rival , Morgan Tsvangirai .
Jendayi Frazer , the US assistant secretary of state for Africa , who has been touring the region to press its leaders to take a stronger stand against Mugabe , said in Pretoria that mediation efforts by the former South African president Thabo Mbeki had failed .
"" We think the facilitation is over .
It led to a power - sharing agreement that is flawed , "" she said .
"" We think [ Mugabe ] has reneged on the principle of power sharing . ""
Frazer said Mugabe 's attempts to blame the west for the cholera epidemic that had claimed more than 1,000 lives in Zimbabwe was evidence that he was "" a man who 's lost it , who 's losing his mind , who 's out of touch with reality "" .
Under the agreement signed three months ago , Mugabe was to cede a considerable amount of his power to Tsvangirai , the opposition leader , who was to be prime minister .
But implementation stalled because Mugabe insisted on controlling the most powerful cabinet posts , including security and finance .
Frazer said Washington had been sceptical from the beginning about the power - sharing agreement but had bowed to South African pressure to give it a chance . ""
Let 's acknowledge now that the power - sharing agreement has n't worked , "" she said .
It was now time for the region 's leaders to step in and tell Mugabe to go .
"" It is as easy as them coming together and saying to Mugabe : ' It 's over ' .
He wo n't then have the cover of saying it is the west when his brothers say ' you are no longer our comrade ' , "" she said .
Frazer said other governments in the Southern African Development Community ( SADC ) accepted that Mugabe was no longer a legitimate leader but were reluctant to take a firmer stand against him because it would lead to the total collapse of Zimbabwe , with serious consequences for its neighbours .
"" We think the country is already in collapse .
[ SADC leaders ] were hesitant to go against Mugabe because they did not want to see the whole thing fall apart , but it has fallen apart , "" said Frazer . ""
SADC is losing more of its credibility the longer this situation continues . """
2009-01-04,"As Zimbabwe limps agonisingly into 2009 , there is one immediate question which the MDC has to answer ; will they join the still notional government of national unity , or not ?
Morgan Tsvangirai stated that unless well - known activists Jestina Mukoko and other civil society and opposition figures are released , he will ask the MDC 's national council to suspend negotiations .
After the tumultuous silence following their abductions , Mukoko and her co - accused were suddenly produced , rabbit – style , out of the police hat .
Allegedly , the accused were involved in the recruitment and training of saboteurs to overthrow Robert Mugabe from bases in Botswana .
Even if this were true – and there is as yet no wisp of evidence to support the state 's case – the inhuman treatment of the activists is utterly unconstitutional and goes far beyond any crimes they have supposedly committed .
If the MDC wish to give force to their ultimatum , they should not allow themselves to be steamrollered by Zanu - PF , South Africa and Southern African Development Community ( SADC ) , into joining a Government of National Unity ( GNU ) just so they can all feed from the same trough . ""
Operation Chimumumu "" – the late 2009 assault on opposition and civil society activists by the Police and Central Intelligence Organisation ( CIO ) – is part of the carrot and stick strategy ; the carrot is the shiny new passport for Tsvangirai ( and the promise of a seat at the edge of the high table as Prime Minister if he plays ball ) .
The stick is the inevitable arrests , abductions and torture of opposition and civil society activists and the threat of worse to come if the MDC does not co - operate .
Oddly enough , Zanu - PF may have given the opposition succour in making their choice .
High court judge Yunus Omerjee ordered the immediate release of most of the accused .
He also ordered that they be given access to proper medical treatment ( many of them bear the signs of torture ) , full access to lawyers , and normal visitation rights .
Instead , the state has placed them in the notorious Chikurubi maximum security prison – a facility originally designed for the most violent criminal offenders .
There are other issues which need to be resolved –
the ministerial posts , the governorships and the question of who will control the finances .
But both MDC groups should insist on an unconditional end to political violence as a precursor to a GNU .
Zanu - PF has alleged that the MDC is training military recruits in Botswana .
If this is the case , then indeed the MDC has a case to answer ; but Zanu - PF has not yet produced any proof .
There is currently a SADC investigation into these claims .
The MDC should insist that the findings be published before any GNU is formed , otherwise it will simply be yet another stick that they will be beaten with .
The state is also making a distinction between humanitarian politics and human rights politics .
Humanitarian aid organisations have been allowed ingress into Zimbabwe 's blighted communities ; human rights activists , in contrast , have not been spared the rod .
The MDC then , if it were to join a GNU , would need to be aware of what it was getting into .
It can hardly be part of a coalition government while civilians are being abducted and killed .
There is no "" acceptable "" level of political violence , and the GNU can not be Zimbabwe 's redemption if the drums are beaten on human skin .
And what of military intervention ?
I do n't see it happening .
The most common suggestion is a military invasion of Zimbabwe from , or by , a neighbouring country ( possibly Botswana ) .
Idi Amin 's removal by Tanzania 's Julius Nyerere in 1979 is cited as a useful precedent .
There are many similarities between Mugabe 's Zimbabwe and Amin 's Uganda ; a brutal leadership , a broken economy , the flight of millions , and a restive military .
But there are some vital discrepancies – Amin provoked Tanzania and sent Ugandan forces into his neighbour 's country in a hunt for Ugandan "" dissidents "" .
Mugabe has been very careful not to overstep the mark in his war of words with Botswana , and it would be difficult for the Botswana Defence Forces or other neighbouring country to justify invading Zimbabwe , other than in self - defence .
That leaves the UK and the United States to mull the challenge of direct intervention .
This wo n't happen ; UK and US forces are at full stretch in Iraq and Afghanistan , and the Caucasus and Middle East will always be considered more important than Africa ; there is also little public or state appetite further military adventures in far away places .
It would be a huge operation and there is little indication that anyone is willing to pay the costs .
In addition , humanitarian military intervention is best applied when civilians are clustered in readily identifiable camps or zones which can be cordoned off and protected by an international mission .
This is not the case in Zimbabwe at the moment – although there has been tremendous dislocation , most people are still in their rural or urban homes , and this makes it difficult to imagine how an operation such as this would work .
More importantly , at the first intimation of a major military offensive against it , the security sector in Zimbabwe would target the opposition leadership for elimination or for use as hostages .
This is not to say that Zanu - PF will not face a military threat .
Growing dissatisfaction within the rank and file of the security establishment , increasing indiscipline and possible small - scale mutinies might be complemented by a possible "" third force "" of anti - state military operatives beginning a campaign of violence if the politics remain unresolved .
This third force , if it comes into being , would be a threat to both Zanu - PF and the MDC .
It would not be an MDC organisation , but its existence would be used by Zanu - PF to justify further repression .
For Zanu - PF , an open military challenge would bind supporters together , but it would also widen the fissures in the security sector periphery and lead to overstretch .
The year 2009 will start the way 2008 ended ; with the Zimbabwe question unresolved .
Zimbabwe will be on the SADC agenda in its January meeting , and it will also feature at the UN Security Council meeting early in 2009 .
Although the regime v opposition polemic will continue , for ordinary people what really matters is how their daily lives can be transformed for the better .
In this regard , it is local and international aid workers and non - political social activists who will likely be the real agents of change in Zimbabwe in 2009 ."
2009-01-06,"When Ghana swears in a new president on Wednesday , it will be installing an opposition candidate who has defeated the candidate of the incumbent government in a free and fair election .
People in other African countries will marvel at this , especially those in Kenya , who elected a new leader in 2007 but are still encumbered with the old one , President Mwai Kibaki .
The people of Zimbabwe will also wonder how an African country such as their own can hold elections in which not a single life is lost , while in their country Morgan Tsvangirai said of the 2008 election : "" This is not an election , but a war . ""
That is not to say that the Ghana election did n't throw up scary moments of its own .
The first presidential election , held on 7 December last year , had failed to produce a clear winner .
According to Ghana 's constitution , the winner must obtain more than 50 % of the vote , and neither the candidate of the sitting government , Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo Addo , or the opposition candidate , John Atta Mills , achieved that .
The result was as follows : out of a total of 8,465,834 valid votes cast , Nana Akufo Addo polled 4,159,439 votes ( 49.13 % ) while Atta Mills polled 4,056,634 votes ( 47.92 % ) .
So a runoff was called .
This took place on 28 December .
It became clear , as soon as the new results began to roll in , that the previous tight result would be maintained .
In fact , the outcome was so close – 50.13 % for Atta Mills and 49.87 % for Akufo Addo – that the chairman of the Electoral Commission , Kwadwo Afari - Djan , decided he would not announce a winner until voting had taken place in a single constituency , Tain , in the Brong - Ahafo region .
There had been no voting here on 28 December because electoral materials for the constituency had not arrived in time and , according to Afari - Djan , the 53,000 registered voters there could affect the outcome of the election as a whole .
At this point , the uncertainty and tension combined to create a climate of fear in the country .
As charges of electoral fraud flew – with the government claiming that the opposition stronghold , the Volta region , had been turned into a no - go area for its agents , while the opposition counter - claimed that the government stronghold , Ashanti , had been rendered equally unsafe for its representatives – the tension could have been cut with a knife .
As everyone wondered whether Ghana was "" on the way to Kenya "" , the governing party announced that it would boycott the election at Tain , and many regarded it as a declaration of war , no less .
The tension increased when the governing party also announced it was filing a court case against the chairman of the Electoral Commission to stop him from announcing a winner .
Crowds from both sides of the political divide began to congregate near the Electoral Commission headquarters .
Would the police be able to control them without calling in the army ?
If the army came in and was forced to shoot , would it stop there , or go on to carry out a coup d'etat ?
It was touch and go .
Then the outgoing president , John Kufuor , displayed statesmanship by advising his party to allow the result to be declared so that the constitutional deadline of 7 January 2009 could be met .
It could settle any complaints by due process later , he said .
The chairman of the Electoral Commission then duly announced John Atta Mills as the winner .
Most Ghanaians heaved a deep sigh of relief .
The past week had been like a cup final in which there had been an initial draw , a replay also ending in a draw , then extra time also yielding a draw , penalties which no one won , and the result decided by the toss of a coin .
Well , that 's how it felt .
What has became clear from the election is that despite 51 years of independence and its boast that it was the first British African territory south of the Sahara to gain nationhood , ethnic divisions in Ghana are as sharp as ever .
The fears of the ruling NPP and the opposition NDC about each other 's "" strongholds "" – the Volta region for the NDC and Ashanti for the NPP – are rooted deeply in fact .
It is like a boil on Ghana 's foot , which has swelled into an ulcer during each election , since way back in 1969 .
Unless an ingenious way is found to lance the boil , it will one day grow big enough to cripple Ghana altogether .
And that awful day may not wait for another 30 years to pass before it makes its terrifying appearance ."
2009-01-15,"Zimbabwe 's opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai said today he remains committed to a power - sharing deal and will meet President Robert Mugabe next week to try to resolve their differences .
South Africa 's president , Kgalema Motlanthe , will also attend the talks , which are seen as crucial if further decline in Zimbabwe is to be averted .
The country 's rapidly crumbling infrastructure has allowed a normally preventable cholera outbreak to claim more than 2,100 lives , while nearly half the population requires food aid .
Tsvangirai , who will return to Zimbabwe on Saturday for the first time since November , said he regarded Mugabe , 84 , "" as part of the problem but also part of the solution "" .
He added : "" I still believe that a political agreement offers the best means of preventing Zimbabwe from becoming a failed state .
I am committed to forming a new inclusive government in Zimbabwe and all I lack is a willing partner .
"" The two leaders agreed to form a unity government on 15 September after a disputed presidential election that saw Tsvangirai win the first round of voting but pull out of the run - off because of widespread state - sponsored violence .
Under the deal Tsvangirai was to be given a newly created prime minister 's post , while the cabinet positions were to be split equally between the government and opposition .
But the agreement stalled after Mugabe refused to give up any of the most powerful ministries .
Addressing a news conference in Johannesburg , Tsvangirai accused Mugabe 's government of continuing to intimidate and harass supporters of his Movement for Democratic Change party .
Human Rights Watch said on Wednesday that 43 opposition officials and rights activists have been unlawfully detained since September , with 11 missing since their arrest .
On Tuesday a judge freed Nigel Mutemagau , a two - year - old boy held in jail for several weeks with his parents , who are both MDC members and stand accused of plotting to overthrow Mugabe .
Among the other detainees is Jestina Mukoko , a human rights campaigner , who disappeared for several weeks after her arrest .
In an affidavit lodged last week she alleged that she had been held in solitary confinement for 19 days at Chikurubi maximum security prison while being assaulted and tortured by police .
Zimbabwe 's chief justice , Godfrey Chidyausiku , has ordered urgent medical care for Mukoko and others who claim to have been tortured in custody .
Tsvangirai said he would not allow the forthcoming round of talks to be drawn out . ""
Should it [ the deal ] collapse , the MDC will have to find alternative plans to continue with the struggle [ for democracy ] until the objective is achieved .
We ca n't sit back and mourn and regret , "" he said ."
2009-01-18,"Zimbabwe 's main opposition leader , Morgan Tsvangirai has returned to Harare for talks on the power - sharing agreement that was never implemented .
He plans talks with his Movement for Democratic Change on whether the party should pull out of the proposed national unity government .
President Mugabe 's party has grabbed nearly all the key ministries , appointed provincial leaders and reappointed the Central Bank governor , even though inflation is running at 231 m % .
The presidents of South Africa and Mozambique , and South African mediator Thabo Mbeki will come to Harare tomorrow to try to resolve the impasse ."
2009-01-18,"Zimbabwe 's president , Robert Mugabe , has warned that he will tomorrow give the opposition leader , Morgan Tsvangirai , one last chance to join a coalition government , as regional mediators head back to Harare to try and end a seven - month deadlock .
But ahead of the summit in Harare , Tsvangirai 's Movement for Democratic Change ( MDC ) today outlined several issues the opposition still wants resolved .
The two men have not met since 9 November .
Since then , inflation - crippled Zimbabwe has been hit by a cholera outbreak which the World Health Organisation says has claimed more than 2,000 lives .
In the state - run Sunday Mail , Mugabe said : "" This is the occasion when it 's either they accept or it 's a break .
If they have any issues they deem outstanding , they can raise them after they come into the inclusive government . ""
But the South African presidency , which has been mediating talks between the two parties , has already made it clear that it envisages more discussions between Zimbabwean negotiators on issues holding back the power - sharing agreement signed on 15 September .
Tomorrow 's talks in the Zimbabwean capital are due to be chaired by the South African president , Kgalema Motlanthe .
Regional mediator Thabo Mbeki is expected to attend , along with the Mozambican president , Armando Guebuza .
Tsvangirai returned to Zimbabwe on Saturday after spending two months in neighbouring Botswana waiting for a new passport .
After today 's national executive meeting , MDC spokesman Nelson Chamisa said : "" There has to be finality , either in success or failure .
All outstanding issues should be resolved before an inclusive government is formed . ""
The Zimbabwean parliament , which resumes on Tuesday , is due to give its first reading to a bill creating a prime minister 's post for Tsvangirai .
The agreement envisages Mugabe remaining as president with cabinet posts divided according to the parliamentary majority won by the MDC in the 29 March elections .
Chamisa added : "" Outstanding issues include an equitable allocation of ministerial portfolios and the composition and functions of the national security council . ""
He said the MDC also wanted more talks on diplomatic and regional appointments and the release of political prisoners .
In recent weeks Mugabe has signalled that he is ready to appoint a government unilaterally .
If he did this , the combined opposition would make it impossible for parliament to function and the 84-year - old president would probably call fresh elections to attempt to regain a majority in the lower house .
The MDC fears these would be marred by violence such as that which led Tsvangirai to pull out of the June 30 presidential run - off .
Since the power - sharing deal was signed in September the international community has hardened its stance , with the US claiming it will oppose any deal that keeps Mugabe in government .
This gives the MDC a key role in winning back donor support that is seen as crucial to the survival of a new government .
Despite claiming it would freeze aid until a process of equitable distribution was in place , South Africa last week admitted sending a £ 20 m package to Zimbabwe .
The MDC claims the maize , seed and fertiliser went to affiliates of Mugabe 's ruling Zanu - PF party ."
2009-01-20,"Zimbabwe 's main political rivals , President Robert Mugabe and the opposition leader , Morgan Tsvangirai , blamed each other as fresh power - sharing talks ended in deadlock yesterday .
Mediators from the Southern African Development Community ( SADC ) said that after 12 hours of talks no agreement had been reached over an attempt to revive a deal struck last September to resolve the country 's political crisis .
Another round of talks are scheduled to take place next week , but both Mugabe and Tsvangirai emerged from yesterday 's session gloomy at the prospects for progress .
"" It did n't go well , "" Mugabe said .
"" This has been one of the darkest days of our lives , "" Tsvangirai said .
The opposition leader said Mugabe was the "" stumbling block "" .
Mugabe accused of Tsvangirai of rejecting a proposal backed by SADC .
Under the September deal , agreed after the disputed presidential elections , Tsvangirai was to be given the newly created post of prime minister , with cabinet positions to be split equally between Mugabe 's Zanu - PF and Tsvangirai 's Movement for Democratic Change ( MDC ) .
The deal broke down after Mugabe refused to give up control of any of the most powerful ministries to the MDC .
Mugabe 's mouthpiece , the state - owned Herald newspaper , blamed Tsvangirai for the latest setback . ""
The fact that Tsvangirai wants things his way , without conceding any ground , points to an agenda at variance with what everybody else is working for , an inclusive government .
Tsvangirai should be reminded that he lost the election and is in no position to dictate to a man with a mandate to form a government , as he deems fit , "" it said .
Tsvangirai , who won the first round in the presidential ballot but pulled out of the second round after a campaign of political violence , insisted the MDC was committed to the deal .
But he said he would only agree to power - sharing if Mugabe kept to his side of the bargain by relinquishing control of key ministries such such as home affairs , finance and information .
"" We came to this meeting so that we would be able to resolve the outstanding issues and conclude the power - sharing agreement .
Unfortunately , there has been no progress made , "" he said .
The former South African president Thabo Mbeki , who has acted as a mediator in the dispute , left the meeting without commenting .
The deadlock has paralysed Zimbabwe 's government amid a spiralling economic crisis with hyperinflation that doubles prices every day .
The health , water and education systems have collapsed and most major goods are in short supply .
More than 5 million Zimbabweans are likely to need food aid this year and a cholera epidemic has killed more than 2,300 people and infected more than 42,000 ."
2009-01-21,"Zimbabwe 's power - sharing talks are close to collapse after Robert Mugabe refused to relinquish control over the key security ministries that played a leading role in rigging the last election and suppressing political opposition .
Morgan Tsvangirai , the opposition leader , described the failure of 12 hours of talks brokered by regional leaders as "" probably the darkest day of our lives "" for his Movement for Democratic Change and for the nation , which is hit by mass hunger , cholera and hyperinflation .
Tsvangirai , who won the last broadly free election in March before being robbed of victory by a bloody campaign and vote rigging in a second round of balloting weeks later , stuck by his insistence that power - sharing had to mean his party also controlled key ministries , particularly home affairs , which is responsible for the police and finance .
The MDC proposed Mugabe took defence , national security , justice and foreign affairs .
Tsvangirai said : "" For us , as the MDC , this is probably the darkest day of our lives , for the whole nation is waiting . ""
Regional leaders have called a summit for next Monday to try to break the deadlock but after months of wrangling there is no immediate prospect of a breakthrough .
The Southern African Development Community ( SADC ) has been reluctant to pressure the Zimbwean president to fulfil his commitments under a power - sharing agreement signed in September .
The MDC 's secretary general , Tendai Biti , said he was "" not hopeful "" the SADC summit would change anything .
"" You can have a million extraordinary summits but as long as no one [ in the SADC leadership ] has the courage to look at Mugabe in the face and tell him ... logic has to prevail , it will be meaningless . ""
Biti said that if the SADC summit failed to deliver a solution he expected the African Union would take over .
Zimbabwe 's new parliament opened yesterday in preparation for a constitutional amendment that would establish a prime minister 's post for Tsvangirai under the power - sharing deal .
But after the failure of the talks , parliament 's agenda was limited to a debate on the collapse of Zimbabwe 's health and education systems amid cholera that has killed more than 2,200 people .
Large numbers of teachers have fled to South Africa in search of a living wage .
Although the power - sharing agreement has been criticised for permitting Mugabe to remain as president , it marked an unusual admission of defeat by a man who said he would not talk to Tsvangirai , let alone share power with him .
Since then , Mugabe 's principal power has been to obstruct rather than govern .
He has produced no solutions to reverse the economic implosion that has seen a devaluation so rapid that the central bank last week introduced a 100 trillion Zimbabwe dollar bill that had approximately the same sterling value , of £ 20 , as Z$100,000 did just six weeks ago .
The US dollar and South African rand are now legal tender and it is almost impossible to buy food in Zimbabwe dollars .
About 5 million people , nearly half the population , rely on food aid and many eat a meal only every other day .
Children weakened by hunger are falling prey to disease in their thousands .
Britain , the EU and US have said power must shift to Tsvangirai before a £ 1bn rescue fund can be unlocked ."
2009-01-22,"It should have all been over for Robert Mugabe when he signed a power - sharing deal with the opposition last September ; a humiliating act for a man who claimed not just to lead Zimbabwe but to embody it .
But the death rattle of his regime continues .
Morgan Tsvangirai , the leader of the Movement for Democratic Change , has come under immense pressure to break the deadlock , but he has rightly resisted the temptation to sell out .
The sticking point , both then and now , is the refusal of Zanu - PF to release its hold over the ministries through which it maintains its repressive and corrupt rule , those which control the army , the courts and the police .
The ­ruling party was more than happy to hand over to the opposition the collapsed parts of the state , such as health and education .
This would make the MDC the begging bowl for international aid , without being able to ensure its effective distribution .
It would be the worst of both worlds .
Control of the police , the only instrument for ensuring a fair election , would be the acid test of a deal that was power - sharing in deed as well as in name .
The regime has raised the price of a deal at each stage .
Over 40 MDC members have been arrested or have disappeared since negotiations began in earnest last year .
Seven MDC members were charged this month with crimes which carry the death penalty .
The charges are bogus and confessions obtained by torture , but one gross human rights abuse only spawns another .
This does not render the documentation of these crimes useless .
It matters both for the victims and for future recourse to justice that Mr Mugabe 's attempts to rig the second round of last year 's elections are recorded .
They were captured on video in the GuardianFilms undercover report which has just won best news programme of the year at the Broadcast Awards .
But the regime is too far gone down the path of criminality to be overtly worried by it .
The more crimes they commit , the more they feel they are obliged to commit to stay in power .
The stalemate between Mr Mugabe and Mr Tsvangirai changes nothing within Zimbabwe .
Zanu - PF has lost control of everything except the ability to repress .
Time , if anything , is on the MDC 's side .
But the country 's prolonged agony ( at least 2,800 dead from cholera and 39,000 ill ) increases the pressure on the country 's neighbours .
The Southern African Development Community can only spin the "" quiet diplomacy "" line for so long before it too becomes a busted flush .
It has one more chance to produce a result at next week 's summit in South Africa .
As Human Rights Watch said ­yesterday , it would then be up to the African Union to step in ."
2009-01-27,""" What has Zimbabwe agreed Zimbabwe should do ? "" a confused Amanda Atwood , from Zimbabwean human rights campaign Kubatana , asks on the organisation 's blog .
The radio says there has been a deal at the summit of the Southern African Development Community ( SADC ) and that the opposition leader , Morgan Tsvangirai , is to be sworn in as prime minister , she says .
But Tsvangirai 's Movement for Democratic Change remains disappointed and had not agreed to the deal as it falls well short of its expectations .
Robb Ellis , a former Zimbabwean policeman , reckons President Robert Mugabe has never been interested in sharing power . ""
Mugabe is driven by a need to remain in control , "" he writes on his blog .
"" It goes against the basics that power be shared , and for that reason alone , the summit will result in another absolute waste of time . ""
Ray Hartley , the editor of South Africa 's Times newspaper , agrees .
"" The whole talks thing has become a regional farce , with heads of state paraded about in increasingly ludicrous garlands of dead flowers as the talks charade drags on .
The fact is that there is no political will from Mugabe and only the most flaccid interest from Tsvangirai in making this power - sharing arrangement work . ""
Atwood claims the confusion about the outcome of the talks stems from the opposition ambivalent position . ""
Does Operation Flip Flop continue ?
"" she asks . ""
Will the MDC continue to waffle its way through these negotiations – when the very notion of negotiating with an entrenched and recalcitrant dictator is absurd ?
""
She also highlight Tsvangirai 's weak bargaining position .
"" Tsvangirai is more desperate than Mugabe – desperate enough that he 's willing to negotiate in the first place , "" she says .
How can Mugabe be genuinely interested in sharing power with Tsvangirai , when the president 's mouthpiece , the Herald newspaper , continues to portray his rival as untrustworthy stooge of the west ?
Today it said : "" Tsvangirai and his handlers have never made it a secret that they want the inter - party process taken out of SADC 's hands , to the AU [ African Union ] , en route to the United Nations . ""
There they hope their handlers can find cause to have Zimbabwe on the agenda of the security council as a prelude to invasion . ""
Continued indulgence and dalliance with Tsvangirai only serves to perpetuate endless talks about talks , at a time when Zimbabwe is in serious need of executive guidance . ""
Meanwhile , Sokwanele , the blog of the Zimbabwe Civic Action Support Group , urges SADC to take action against Mugabe 's regime rather than negotiate with it .
It says : "" State institutions and their agents have become the biggest danger to the Zimbabwean people , together with the failure of SADC leaders to recognise the deterioration of the situation and take firm action against the offenders , who continue to violate SADC principles and the GPA [ global political agreement ] with impunity .
You have one final chance to do the right thing . """
2009-01-29,"Deal or no deal ?
Southern African leaders proclaimed earlier this week that agreement had been reached to work towards a unity government in Zimbabwe .
But Morgan Tsvangirai 's Movement for Democratic Change ( MDC - T ) quickly contradicted the announcement , saying the meeting 's conclusions did not meet the party 's expectations and that its national council will meet later in the week to decide whether to join the unity government or not .
Under the terms of Monday 's "" agreement "" , the home affairs ministry – which is coveted by the parties because it entails control of the police – will be shared .
The MDC - T 's demand for sole control is fair , because Robert Mugabe 's Zanu - PF already controls the military .
All the same , the MDC - T 's post - talks statement signals the prospect of even more negotiations about power sharing in the midst of a worsening humanitarian crisis .
The cholera epidemic has spread from urban to rural areas .
The state has abdicated most of its responsibilities .
Life is now unbearable under the prevailing economic conditions .
Renewed talks will serve to compound Zimbabweans ' doom and gloom .
Zimbabwe continues to attract much international attention , but many have tired or are growing tired of the intransigent nature of the country 's problems – particularly Zanu - PF 's unwillingness to accommodate the MDC .
Zanu - PF has done all it can to depict the MDC - T as the obdurate party in the talks .
"" If they ( the MDC - T ) think they can hold Zimbabwe to ransom it will be very unfortunate .
I do not think the people of Zimbabwe will allow that to happen .
They ( the MDC - T ) are pushing their luck , "" says Zimbabwe 's deputy information minister Bright Matonga .
It is two months shy of a year since Mugabe and his party looked down and out after last year 's disputed national elections .
The sight of Mugabe as president – and holding the balance of power in the unity government – is certainly a marvel .
It is emblematic of his party 's ruthless instinct for survival .
But it also shows how incapable the African Union ( AU ) and the Southern Africa Development Community are when it comes to dealing with incumbents who lose elections , only to deploy violence and fraud to remain in power .
This is at the heart of the problem .
MDC - T finds itself bereft of viable options beyond the hostage politics that has ensued since the deal was first signed .
The difficult question the party 's national council faces in the coming days is whether to enter into an unequal and flawed agreement in order to work for incremental change within the state , or to stay outside it .
Staying outside invites more Zanu - PF violence , and increased human suffering and misery for Zimbabweans under a Zanu - PF government isolated by western sanctions .
Joining the unity government as a junior partner would be a climbdown and an anti - climax for a party that seemed – at one point – to have relieved Zimbabwe from Zanu - PF 's authoritarian grip .
Many of the MDC - T 's cadre and supporters will feel betrayed at the lack of justice after the violence meted out to them by Zanu - PF in the last election .
Elections and democracy will seem more meaningless than ever .
Nonetheless , the stark reality is that the key organs of state security remain aligned to Zanu - PF and Africans will not make Mugabe compromise further , even as Zimbabweans ' suffering escalates .
MDC - T will never enter the unity government on an equal or senior footing to Zanu - PF .
Realism says the MDC - T is better off strategically working from within the government to bring about incremental change through constitutional reform , and by scrutinising and attempting to thwart ZANU PF 's undemocratic machinations .
Come the next election , the party will also find there are palpable advantages in having a foothold in the state ."
2009-01-30,"Zimbabwe 's opposition Movement for Democratic Change ( MDC ) has agreed to form a unity government with Robert Mugabe 's ruling Zanu - PF , its leader , Morgan Tsvangirai , said today .
The agreement – which has yet to backed by western governments – is being seen as a risky attempt to find a political solution to the country 's mounting humanitarian and economic crisis .
Earlier this week , the MDC rejected a recommendation from regional leaders that a power - sharing deal agreed in September should be revived .
But the MDC is said to have put aside its objections in order to avoid the alternative of Mugabe forming a government on his own .
"" We met and we have decided to abide [ by the regional leaders ' resolution ] , "" Tsvangirai told reporters after a party meeting today .
"" We are committed to joining the government of national unity , and hope that [ Zanu - PF ] are going to treat us as equal partners . ""
The MDC had refused to share power with Mugabe until he agreed to allow it to hold important cabinet posts .
The party also wanted attacks on opposition supporters to stop before it entered any unity government .
The Zanu - PF party and the leaders of neighbouring countries including South Africa have said the opposition should enter the government and then resolve outstanding issues .
On Tuesday , a summit of the Southern African Development Community called for Zimbabwe to swear - in Tsvangirai as the prime minister on 11 February .
Mugabe will remain as the Zimbabwean president under the terms of the deal .
Tsvangirai accepted the proposal despite calls from some of his allies to reject it .
Mugabe has been under pressure from senior figures in the military and government who do not want to give up power and prestige to the opposition .
Mike Davies , an Africa analyst at the Eurasia thinktank , told Reuters : "" The agreement still leaves significant executive power within Zanu - PF and under Mugabe 's control . ""
The fact that it is not supported by western governments will make it quite difficult for it to represent the advance it was initially hoped to represent . ""
The Zimbabwean commentator John Makumbe told the agency the move was "" a huge gamble , particularly if Mugabe does n't deliver on the other issues that the MDC has been demanding "" .
He said it was "" a test for the MDC which will have a big bearing on its future "" .
Meanwhile , new UN figures revealed that there are 60,000 known cases of cholera in Zimbabwe .
The disease has killed 3,161 people since August ."
2009-01-31,"Morgan Tsvangirai , the Zimbabwean opposition leader , has agreed to join a unity government with President Robert Mugabe amid intense regional pressure and warnings that the deadliest cholera outbreak in Africa for 15 years threatens to get worse .
Tsvangirai made the announcement after a meeting of the Movement for Democratic Change 's national council , which had been divided on whether to accept a settlement proposed this week by the Southern African Development Community ( SADC ) .
"" We are unequivocal , we will go into this government , "" Tsvangirai told reporters in Harare . ""
The SADC has decided and we are bound by that decision . ""
Tsvangirai is due to be sworn in as prime minister on 11 February , with ministers taking office two days later .
While the mistrust between Tsvangirai and Mugabe remains , and a number of contentious issues have yet to be decided , the political thaw will raise hopes that the country 's disastrous economic and health situation can now be eased .
The World Health Organisation said yesterday that 69 Zimbabweans had died of cholera in the previous 24 hours , taking the number of deaths to 3,161 since August .
The total number of infections was more than 60,000 , surpassing the organisation 's "" worst - case scenario "" .
On Thursday it emerged that the United Nations is to halve its food rations to 7 million Zimbabweans , about 70 % of the country 's remaining population .
The World Food Programme says it cut the ration to meet increased demand and cope with a shortfall in donations .
International donors have refused to provide financial aid until a unity government is in place .
The MDC and Mugabe 's ruling Zanu - PF party originally agreed to share power on 15 September after controversial elections that saw Tsvangirai win the first round of the presidential poll but abandon the run - off due to state - sponsored violence .
The agreement soon fell apart when Mugabe , who has held power since 1980 , refused to divide the key ministries fairly .
Police then arrested dozens of MDC activists and officials on dubious grounds , and many of them remain in custody .
With the effects of Zimbabwe 's meltdown spilling into neighbouring countries , SADC leaders have been desperate to get a coalition government in place .
Analysts say that if Tsvangirai had walked away from the power - sharing option , he could have faced domestic criticism for putting his own interests ahead of the country ."
2009-02-01,"Former US president Jimmy Carter , former UN secretary - general Kofi Annan and other world leaders have welcomed Zimbabwe 's unity government deal .
Zimbabwe 's opposition said on Friday it would form a coalition with President Robert Mugabe this month in which MDC leader Morgan Tsvangirai would become prime minister .
A political impasse has deepened the country 's economic crisis , while cholera has killed more than 3,000 people .
In a statement yesterday , Carter and Annan , who are members of The Elders , founded by former South African president Nelson Mandela , said they hoped the deal would ease the country 's humanitarian crisis .
Carter urged the world to "" give this agreement the best chances of success "" .
Annan , Carter and Graça Machel , the human rights activist and Mandela 's wife , were denied entry into Zimbabwe last year ."
2009-02-09,"There is little enthusiasm among bloggers and commentators for Zimbabwe 's unity deal , which should see Morgan Tsvangirai , the opposition leader , sworn in as prime minister on Wednesday .
The prevailing sentiment is that Tsvangirai has buckled under enormous regional pressure — especially from South Africa — to accept a deal that still leaves power concentrated in the hands of the wily Robert Mugabe .
Denford Magora , a Zimbabwean blogger , believes that Tsvangirai and his Movement for Democratic Change ( MDC ) , have capitulated to Mugabe , who has ruled since 1980 .
"" To all intents and purposes and if we go by what MDC supporters have always been saying , then their party has surrendered to Mugabe .
They go into a government that is loaded to the gills with Mugabe 's cronies . ""
Ray Hartley , the editor of the Times , South Africa , denounces Pretoria 's pressure on Tsvangirai to accept the unity deal and urges the Obama administration to reject South African demands to resume aid to the Mugabe regime . ""
South Africa and other neighbours who insist on supporting the criminal regime are free to supply aid .
But western governments must maintain their sanctions – especially those aimed at individual members of the Mugabe regime and the companies they control . ""
Eddie Cross , on the Metro Zimbabwe blog , deplores not just South Africa but the regional group , the Southern African Development Community ( SADC ) , for siding with Mugabe , who has managed to hang on to power after controversial elections that saw Tsvangirai win the first round of the presidential poll but abandon the run - off due to state - sponsored violence .
"" The fact that SADC clearly backed the position of the Mugabe regime at last week 's meeting in the face of overwhelming evidence and rationale is a real indictment of African leadership .
They were not even acting in defence of their own interests , let alone the interests of the long - suffering Zimbabwe people . ""
Daniel Molokele , on ZimOnline , is one of the few to offer a – half - hearted – defence of Tsvangirai and the MDC . ""
The MDC decision to endorse the SADC - brokered process represents a decisive shift on its part from the flamboyant idealism that exuded from its launch in 1999 to a much more down - to - earth practical approach .
The MDC appears to have opted to go down the path of realism and pragmatism in its ongoing quest for democratic change in Zimbabwe . ""
Meanwhile , the This is Zimbabwe website has published undercover pictures of emaciated prisoners and links to an article in the Zimbabwean newspaper that provides details about the grim conditions in the country 's jails ."
2009-02-10,"Morgan Tsvangirai is to be sworn in as Zimbabwe 's prime minister , pledging to take control of government , rescue millions from the brink of starvation and shunt President Robert Mugabe from power .
Many Zimbabweans and some foreign governments , including Britain , fear the power - sharing administration is a trap that will only perpetuate Mugabe 's rule .
The leader of the opposition Movement for Democratic Change today said that after months of wrangling with Mugabe over key cabinet posts his party compromised and agreed to join the government to prevent Zimbabwe collapsing under hyperinflation and the almost total ruin of agriculture and industry that has left seven million people , two - thirds of the population , reliant on foreign food aid .
Tsvangirai said joining a coalition with the man who used violence and intimidation to deny the MDC power was not an end in itself but a step toward democratic government .
"" We are not joining Mugabe .
This is part of a transitional arrangement , negotiated .
Mr Mugabe has executive authority .
I have executive authority , "" he said .
"" The MDC can not be authors of chaos by allowing the country to go over the precipice .
That 's where it is ...
We are aware of the shortcomings [ of sharing power ] but we are also aware of the potential of responding to the needs of the population of Zimbabwe . ""
The power struggle that has marked political negotiations is , however , likely to continue in the new administration .
Under the coalition agreement , Mugabe remains president , with Tsvangirai overseeing the daily administration of government as prime minister .
Cabinet seats are almost equally divided with a small breakaway MDC faction also represented .
Mugabe won the struggle to retain control of the principal security ministries , particularly defence and justice , which sceptics fear he will continue to use as tools to attack and intimidate his opponents .
Authority over home affairs , which is seen as crucial to ensuring future elections are free after the widespread violence by Mugabe 's supporters in last year 's ballot , is to be shared .
The MDC has control of the finance ministry and most social affairs ministries , such as health , which could prove an asset if the new government is able to deliver improved services .
Tsvangirai 's main concern will be to put a new constitution in place and for fresh elections within two years in which he is counting on an embittered electorate to deliver such a decisive rejection of Mugabe that he will be forced to accept defeat .
For now , the new prime minister faces a myriad of challenges , including 94 % unemployment , the worst harvest since independence and a currency so worthless that shops will only accept US dollars and South African rand .
Tsvangirai said the most important cabinet post for reviving Zimbabwe 's fortunes was that of the finance minister and named the MDC 's secretary general , Tendai Biti , for the job .
Biti , a lawyer and the MDC 's chief negotiator , is expected to use the power the finance ministry wields with its control over budgets to influence Mugabe 's ministers .
His appointment is also likely to go some way to reassure foreign donors , principally Britain and the US , whose money is seen as key to Zimbabwe 's revival but who are sceptical over Mugabe remaining president .
Britain has taken the highly unusual step of publishing a notice in the Zimbabwean press laying out its concerns about the new administration .
While saying that "" it is not for the United Kingdom to accept or reject anything "" , the notice goes on to say that it regards any administration involving Mugabe as unacceptable . ""
Given Mugabe 's resistance to change to date , his failed economic policies and his propensity to rail against the outside world , it is unlikely that any government involving Mugabe will inspire donor confidence and attract the support it so badly needs , "" the notice placed by the British embassy in Harare said .
Britain says it wants to see the new administration "" reverse the political , economic and social decline "" as a condition for aid .
The MDC says it ca n't do that without considerable financial support ."
2009-02-11,"A Guardian film smuggled out of Zimbabwe brings home the economic devastation and deprivation Robert Mugabe has wreaked upon his own people .
With Morgan Tsvangirai , the opposition leader , preparing to take up the post of prime minister in a unity government , Sam Chakaipa , at considerable risk to himself and as an act of resistance , returned clandestinely to his village , 125 miles from Harare , to document the plight of his former neighbours .
The opposition activist has produced extraordinary footage of what Zimbabweans have to do in order to survive in a wrecked economy .
As money is worthless – Zimbabwe is plagued by the world 's highest inflation rate – the villagers are reduced to panning for gold in rivers .
Instead of attending school , youngsters from the village scrabble knee - deep in muddy water or dig ever deeper holes in a desperate search for a few grains of gold .
These small supplies of the precious metal have thus become a crucial commodity Zimbabweans can trade for food ; a loaf of bread is worth 0.1 grams .
But only the young have the strength to dig and pan for gold ; the village elders must go hungry , unless they have friends or relatives they can rely on .
Some parents have been forced to feed rats to their children , and hunger has turned family members against each other .
In a particularly wrenching scene in the video , a 15-year - old girl with a swollen face describes tearfully how her grandmother beat her to drive her away as she was an extra mouth to feed .
She says she has not eaten for three days .
"" I 'm hurting all over my body , "" she says .
"" There is nothing for me . ""
Chakaipa says : "" I have never seen my people in such a desperate situation .
"" Nothing is growing in the fields , and the farmers are killing their livestock , effectively destroying their livelihood .
Chakaipa , a member of the opposition Movement for Democratic Change ( MDC ) , has suffered personally at the hands of Zanu - PF , Robert Mugabe 's ruling party .
He has been arrested and tortured , and his life was threatened when he wanted to stand as a councillor .
His house has been burned down twice .
As it is unsafe for him to stay in the village , Chakaipa has had to go into hiding in Harare .
His brother , also an MDC supporter , was not so lucky and was killed last year by Zanu - PF thugs .
At one point in the film , in a mixture of reportage and personal testimony , Chakaipa stands in the ruins of his home telling us how the Mugabe government has destroyed his life .
It is too dangerous for the opposition , beaten into submission , to hold meetings or rallies , so Chakaipa chose to make this film as a personal act of defiance .
He wants the world to see what Mugabe , who has been in power since 1980 , has done to Zimbabwe : how he has reduced a once relatively prosperous country to ruin .
Chakaipa does not hold out much hope for the unity government , in which the MDC leader , Morgan Tsvangirai , will be prime minister .
Zimbabwe 's neighbours – particularly South Africa – put enormous pressure on Tsvangirai to accept this poisoned chalice , but many MDC supporters , including Chakaipa , say this was not what Zimbabweans voted for .
He fears that if Tsvangirai works with Mugabe , "" the suffering will continue "" .
Sam Chakaipa is an assumed name"
2009-02-11,"Morgan Tsvangirai was sworn in as Zimbabwe 's prime minister today joining a government of national unity with President Robert Mugabe amid deep scepticism that the two bitter rivals can work together to drag their country back from economic ruin .
The two men stood face to face in a white tent on the grounds of the presidential palace .
In the presence of regional leaders , and as Zimbabweans across the country watched on state TV , Tsvangirai raised his right hand and declared : "" I will well and truly serve Zimbabwe in the office of prime minister of the republic of Zimbabwe , so help me God "" .
Both men looked relaxed and smiled during the brief and subdued ceremony , which also included the swearing - in of Tsvangirai 's deputies , Arthur Mutambara of a breakaway opposition party and Thokozani Khupe of Tsvangirai 's Movement for Democratic Change ( MDC ) .
Other African leaders who attended the ceremony had put heavy pressure on Tsvangirai to accept the power - sharing deal but many Zimbabweans and some foreign governments , including Britain , fear the joint administration is a trap that will only perpetuate Mugabe 's rule .
Tsvangirai yesterday said that after months of wrangling with Mugabe over key cabinet posts , his party compromised and agreed to join the government to prevent Zimbabwe collapsing under hyperinflation and the almost total ruin of agriculture and industry that has left 7 million people , two - thirds of the population , reliant on foreign food aid .
Tsvangirai said joining a coalition with the man who used violence and intimidation to deny the MDC power was not an end in itself but a step towards democratic government .
The power struggle that has marked political negotiations is , however , likely to continue in the new administration .
Under the coalition agreement , Mugabe remains president , with Tsvangirai overseeing the daily administration of government as prime minister .
Cabinet seats are almost equally divided , with a small breakaway MDC faction also represented .
Mugabe won the struggle to retain control of the principal security ministries , particularly defence and justice , which sceptics fear he will continue to use as tools to attack and intimidate his opponents .
Authority over home affairs , which is seen as crucial to ensuring future elections are free after the widespread violence by Mugabe 's supporters in last year 's ballot , is to be shared .
The MDC has control of the finance ministry and most social affairs ministries , such as health , which could prove an asset if the new government is able to deliver improved services .
Tsvangirai 's main concern will be to put a new constitution in place and to hold fresh elections within two years in which he is counting on an embittered electorate to deliver such a decisive rejection of Mugabe that he will be forced to accept defeat .
For now , the new prime minister faces a myriad of challenges , including 94 % unemployment , the worst harvest since independence and a currency so worthless that shops will only accept US dollars and South African rand .
Tsvangirai said the most important cabinet post for reviving Zimbabwe 's fortunes was that of the finance minister and named the MDC 's secretary general , Tendai Biti , for the job .
Biti , a lawyer and the MDC 's chief negotiator , is expected to use the power the finance ministry wields with its control over budgets to influence Mugabe 's ministers .
His appointment is also likely to go some way to reassure foreign donors , principally Britain and the US , whose money is seen as key to Zimbabwe 's revival but who are sceptical over Mugabe remaining president .
Britain has taken the highly unusual step of publishing a notice in the Zimbabwean press laying out its concerns about the new administration .
While saying that "" it is not for the United Kingdom to accept or reject anything "" , the notice goes on to say that it regards any administration involving Mugabe as unacceptable . ""
Given Mugabe 's resistance to change to date , his failed economic policies and his propensity to rail against the outside world , it is unlikely that any government involving Mugabe will inspire donor confidence and attract the support it so badly needs , "" the notice placed by the British embassy in Harare said .
Britain says it wants to see the new administration "" reverse the political , economic and social decline "" as a condition for aid .
The MDC says it ca n't do that without considerable financial support ."
2009-02-11,"Morgan Tsvangirai was sworn in as Zimbabwe 's new prime minister today , but was prevented from addressing the nation on television in a sign of the power struggles likely to come in the powersharing government with the president , Robert Mugabe .
Mugabe administered the oath of office to his bitter rival just a few months after saying he would never talk to the leader of the Movement for Democratic Change , let alone share power with him .
Tsvangirai stepped up to the podium and shook Mugabe 's hand .
The new prime minister raised his right hand and promised to be faithful to Zimbabwe , observe its laws and serve it well .
The rival leaders signed papers and shook hands again .
There were no smiles .
Two deputy prime ministers were sworn in , including Arthur Mutambara , the leader of a breakaway MDC faction .
Under the coalition agreement , Mugabe remains president with Tsvangirai overseeing the daily administration of government as prime minister .
Cabinet seats are almost equally divided , with a small breakaway MDC faction also represented .
Tsvangirai received an early warning that Mugabe intends to try to remain dominant when he was prevented from making a five - minute televised speech that had been previously agreed to by the president 's office .
The master of ceremonies announced that lunch was served and Zimbabwe television cut away before Tsvangirai could speak to camera .
He spoke at the lunch , but it was not the address to the nation that the MDC had expected .
Tsvangirai is expected to make a longer speech at a stadium rally in Harare later today .
He is to outline his plans for the first 100 days and appeal to Britain and other foreign governments for aid to alleviate mass hunger and turn around an economy besieged by hyperinflation estimated to run above 10 sextillion per cent .
Thousands of Zimbabweans were streaming towards the stadium even as Tsvangirai was being sworn in .
While the mood among them was upbeat , many are reserving judgement on the new government to see whether the MDC leader can gain the upper hand .
Tsvangirai was inaugurated at State House , Mugabe 's presidential palace , and permitted to bring only a small group of supporters and family .
The MDC had wanted the ceremony held at parliament – where the party won a majority last year – to emphasise an end to the days of presidential rule .
Mugabe may have been seeking to avoid the humiliation he suffered at the signing ceremony on the powersharing government in September , when Tsvangirai 's supporters packed the auditorium and booed him .
The inauguration was nevertheless a climbdown for Mugabe and the people around him who said they would never accept Tsvangirai in government , having called him a puppet of Britain and "" white Rhodesians "" .
Some senior Zanu - PF officials threatened to take up arms against Tsvangirai if he won the election .
The implementation of the powersharing agreement , which was stalled by wrangling over the division of cabinet posts , is viewed very differently by the two sides .
Tsvangirai sees it as the beginning of the final step towards removing Mugabe from office .
The MDC says Tsvangirai 's position strips Mugabe of many of his powers and this will eventually shunt Mugabe him from office with fresh elections within two years .
Mugabe 's Zanu - PF evidently sees the coalition as a means to draw in foreign aid and reverse the country 's economic collapse while keeping control of government and staving off prosecutions for the bloody political violence unleashed against opposition voters last year .
Hundreds were killed and tens of thousands beaten , tortured and abducted .
There are signs of a power struggle within Zanu - PF as hardline elements seek to undermine the new administration and continue to harass the MDC .
Plainclothes police were seeking to arrest the MDC 's newly nominated deputy agriculture minister , Roy Bennett , last night .
Police arrested two human rights lawyers yesterday and about 30 opposition activists who have been detained and tortured for several months remained in prison despite an agreement for their release before the inauguration .
The European Union 's top aid official welcomed Tsvangirai 's swearing in but said the new government "" has a heavy responsibility "" to ensure action is taken quickly on the economic crisis .
The EU still has in place a visa ban and assets freeze meant to isolate Mugabe and his supporters ."
2009-02-12,"Hours after he was sworn in as Zimbabwe 's new prime minister yesterday , Morgan Tsvangirai laid out an ambitious programme to restore the rule of law and freedoms stripped away by President Robert Mugabe 's regime , and to revive his country 's all but eradicated economy .
Tsvangirai immediately won over near - destitute government workers and soldiers by promising that they will be paid in foreign currency because the Zimbabwean dollar is now worthless .
He said he wanted to see civil servants , teachers and nurses back at work on Monday to get schools and hospitals open again and the country moving .
Addressing thousands of people at a Harare stadium , where nine months ago he was prevented from holding an election rally by a violent assault on his supporters , Tsvangirai acknowledged that sharing power with Mugabe was not ideal .
He said under the circumstances it was the best way of carrying the struggle for democratic government forward and he was determined to make it work .
"" There can be no turning back on the political agreement which each party has signed , knowing it is not a perfect agreement but still a workable one , "" he said .
"" An agreement that , if implemented with good faith , will deliver a peaceful way forward toward a stable economy , a new constitution and free and fair elections . ""
Many sceptics question whether Tsvangirai 's partner in government has any intention of acting in good faith .
The power sharing agreement has been scorned by critics at home and abroad , particularly Britain and the US , who fear Mugabe will outmanoeuvre the new prime minister and maintain control of government .
Tsvangirai 's Movement for Democratic Change acknowledges that it made a mistake in not agreeing the division of cabinet seats before signing the deal in September , allowing Mugabe to retain control of powerful security posts .
But the agreement considerably waters down Mugabe 's powers and the act of forcing the president to sign was itself an indication of his diminishing control because of his regime 's failure to address the economic collapse .
In his speech yesterday , Tsvangirai put himself forward as firmly in control of policy in the government that he will have day - to - day responsibility for administering , although Mugabe will also chair meetings of the cabinet , which is roughly split between the two sides .
Tsvangirai said the MDC , which has a small majority in parliament , would "" pass legislation to restore the people 's freedoms "" , re - establish the rule of law after years of impunity in which the ruling Zanu - PF murdered and terrorised its opponents , and allow a free press to operate again after it was shut down by Mugabe .
Tsvangirai also said parliament would lay the ground for a new constitution before fresh elections .
"" Our second priority is tackling the humanitarian crisis with every means possible , "" he added .
"" In the immediate days ahead we will focus on the cholera crisis . "" More than 3,300 Zimbabweans have died of cholera and about 70,000 have been infected .
In addition , about seven million people are in need of food aid after the collapse of agriculture following the seizure of white farms and economic decline .
Tsvangirai promised to get food aid , which has often fallen under Zanu - PF 's political control , to all who needed it .
But the greatest and most difficult task will be to restore economic stability in a country where the national currency has been wiped out by hyperinflation .
Tsvangirai said from now on he would pay government workers , the police and the army in foreign currency . ""
These hard - currency salaries will enable people to go to work , to feed their families and to survive until such time that we can begin to sustain ourselves as a country , "" he said , without stating where the foreign currency would come from .
He appealed for foreign governments to help , but recognised that before substantial aid comes , his government would have to prove that it was able to deliver on its promises ."
2009-02-12,"TSVANGIRAI TAKES ' SOUR ' OATH OF OFFICE
As Morgan Tsvangirai was finally sworn in as Prime Minister of Zimbabwe yesterday , the Times summarised the moment as "" a sour oath of office , an ice - cold embrace ... then joy and jubilation "" . ""
After a decade of bloodshed , sacrifice and suffering , Zimbabweans erupted in joy and jubilation – emotions almost extinct after 29 years of President Mugabe 's misrule – as Morgan Tsvangirai was sworn in as prime minister yesterday . ""
In the Guardian , Chris McGreal examined the significance of the date , remarked upon by Tsvangirai as it was the same day Nelson Mandela walked free from prison 19 years ago .
However , the new prime minister was quick to add that from that day followed another four years of struggle before free elections .
When Tsvangirai spoke , he referred to Mugabe 's record , and the betrayal of the people . ""
A culture of entitlement and impunity has brought our nation to the brink of a dark abyss .
This must end today . ""
Zimbabwean journalist Basildon Peta suggests that while yesterday 's ceremony was a joyous moment for some , he saw no reason to join any parties . ""
After so many years in exile , I see nothing to suggest that I can now walk back into a free democratic Zimbabwe in which my rights as a citizen will be respected .
"" There was nothing historic or momentous about yesterday .
Morgan Tsvangirai 's oath merely threw a line to a heartless , reckless dictator who lost elections but shamelessly clung to power ... ""
What happened in Zimbabwe yesterday is a monumental tragedy .
A travesty of justice .
It is n't the delivery of a democratic outcome by the regional African leaders who mediated .
It 's the betrayal or prostitution of the basic tenets of democracy .
""

The Telegraph also splashes with "" Slump is the worst since the war "" and illustrates its inside package with a black and white picture of people queuing up during the fuel shortage just to make sure we get the message . ""
In the most pessimistic assessment of Britain 's prospects in the modern era , Mervyn King said : ' The economy faces its deepest recession since the postwar years of 1945 and 1946 and its worst peacetime decline since 1931 . '
"" This all comes as Sir James Crosby resigned as vice chairman of the Financial Services Authority following allegations that he had sacked a whistleblower who had warned about excessive risk taking .
In its splash today the Guardian says it has also learnt that senior bankers warned cabinet ministers this week that although they support an overhaul of bonuses they will resist the freeze demanded by the public .

The Telegraph , which has managed to score a raft of official pictures while the other papers have had to make do with the cover shot , headlines the piece "" Sexy , stylish and in absolute command "" .
In a gushing page three piece , the paper describes the Vogue photoshoot thus : "" Here in the rich gold and amber tones of a painting , is confirmation that she has become not just the icon she was bound to be , but that she remains reassuringly real herself ... sinuous and toned , she is pictured on the cover in a sleeveless cerise sheath , smiling directly – and with an engaging sense of mischief : did n't it all turn out so well ?

One of the highlights is Sarkozy apparently telling Bruni that she could be the Marilyn Monroe to his Kennedy , which is undoubtedly an alluring offer ...
She later tells him : "" When it comes to the celebrity press , you are my amateur .

But how could you stay ... with a man who has such ridiculous calves ?

2009-02-12,"Morgan Tsvangirai could not let the significance of the date go unmentioned to the thousands of supporters who had waited 10 years for something like this moment .
The day of his inauguration as Zimbabwe 's new prime minister was
, he noted , February 11 - the date Nelson Mandela walked free from prison 19 years ago .
But , he cautioned , there followed another four years of political struggle before South Africa 's racist regime was buried by free elections .
The crowd got the message .
Tsvangirai 's swearing in yesterday by the man he has been trying to force from power for the past decade , President Robert Mugabe , was a beginning not an end .
Just in case Tsvangirai had any doubts , the inauguration itself provided a reminder that life in political cohabitation with Mugabe will be no fun .
A few hours earlier , the secret police had gone looking for one of Tsvangirai 's newly appointed ministers , Roy Bennett - a white former MP who once served eight months in jail for wrestling the minister of justice on to the floor of parliament .
The police did n't find Bennett but it was a warning that Zimbabwe 's age of terror is not yet over .
As Tsvangirai waited to be called forward to accept the oath of office , the old government 's propaganda outlets kept spewing forth the views that Zimbabweans have come to regard as emanating from some parallel universe .
The state radio reminded its listeners that the eradication of the country 's economy and 10 sextillion per cent inflation rate was nothing to do with Zanu - PF 's plunder and incompetence but all the fault of Gordon Brown .
Mugabe was called comrade .
Tsvangirai was just plain mister .
Not one of us .
After the swearing in , a young woman read an excruciating poem she had written called Rise and Shine Zimbabwe , which included such original lines as "" United we stand , divided we fall "" .
It quickly became clear that united meant behind Mugabe .
And then , as Tsvangirai prepared to deliver the agreed five - minute address to the nation as its new PM , the master of ceremonies announced lunch was served and Zimbabwe TV cut away .
Tsvangirai 's moment came at a later rally , where he delivered an elongated version of the speech he did n't make on television .
It 's not hard to see why the old regime did n't want people to hear it . ""
For too long , our people 's hopes for a bright and prosperous future have been betrayed .
Instead of hope , their days have been filled with starvation , disease and fear .
A culture of entitlement and impunity has brought our nation to the brink of a dark abyss , "" he said .
"" This must end today .
"" There was general agreement from the crowd that it would be a good idea if it did end today , although not a lot of confidence that it would .
The loudest cheer came when he promised to pay civil servants , teachers , health workers and soldiers in US dollars or South African rand until the economy works again .
The crowd went wild .
For all that , there was little of the electricity that shot through Zimbabwe in the days after the election last March when Mugabe was defeated and his regime wobbled , uncertain how to hold on .
It found a way : violence and terror .
After the rally , some of Tsvangirai 's supporters wondered aloud if Mugabe was really done for or if he might not outsmart their new prime minister .
"" We will not believe Mugabe is gone until he 's in a coffin , "" said Ernest Manyere .
"" He has tried to kill our side .
Now maybe he is trying to trick our side .
Tsvangirai must be very careful . ""
But there are good reasons to think that Mugabe 's power will diminish .
That he agreed to have Tsvangirai as PM at all is evidence of his desperation .
But with no solutions to the economy , Mugabe no longer so much governs as obstructs .
Every attempt to reverse the decline has only worsened it .
So far as Mugabe is concerned , these are Tsvangirai 's problems now .
The new prime minister will need all the help he can get , but he is only too aware that he 's not going to get it from the man who swore him in yesterday ."
2009-02-13,"Zimbabwe 's new prime minister , Morgan Tsvangirai , has called on the world "" to get over "" President Robert Mugabe and stop seeing him as the principal problem facing his country .
Speaking to the Guardian shortly before ministers in the new powersharing government were due to be sworn in today , Tsvangirai said that his most immediate challenges – from finding the money to pay government workers and prising political detainees from prison , to purging the system of some of its worst crooks– now have little to do with the man who has ruled Zimbabwe since independence 29 years ago .
"" Unfortunately people are preoccupied with Mugabe as a person .
They need to get over it .
This has gone beyond Mugabe .
People need to stop talking about him as the only issue .
Mugabe is part of the problem but he is also part of the solution .
He is not the obstacle we are now facing , "" he said .
But hours later , Tsvangirai received a sharp reminder of another more sinister challenge his administration faces as one of his new ministers , Roy Bennett , was arrested today .
The Movement for Democratic Change said Bennett , a former white farmer who is a particularly hated figure within Mugabe 's Zanu - PF , was "" abducted "" by the police law and order unit .
The detention , along with the continued imprisonment of dozens of opposition supporters who have been held for months and tortured , reflects deep divisions within the upper echelons of Mugabe 's power structure , with some of the military chiefs apparently attempting to sabotage the powersharing agreement that brought Tsvangirai into government .
The MDC believes that if it can establish itself as a partner in government , pay civil servants and bring in foreign aid , power will bleed from Mugabe and Zanu - PF to Tsvangirai .
But the coming days will be difficult as hardliners , such as the armed forces chief , Constantine Chiwenga , the police chief , Augustine Chihuri , and other senior security officials who said they would never recognise Tsvangirai 's authority , keep up attempts to undermine the new political setup .
The new prime minister won immediate support from government workers after his inauguration on Wednesday by promising that civil servants , the police and soldiers – struggling along on salaries in nearly worthless Zimbabwe dollars – will be paid in hard currency at the end of the month .
But there were immediate questions about where the money to pay them is coming from , given the state 's coffers are nearly empty and foreign governments have said they want to see if Tsvangirai is really in charge before they start handing over a £ 1.2bn aid package .
Tsvangirai needs to find about $ 100 m by the end of the month to pay 236,000 civil servants , teachers and health workers , as well as the police and military , in foreign currency .
Some of his party colleagues had urged him not to make such a specific commitment at his inauguration .
But the new prime minister told them that there was no hope of beginning to rebuild Zimbabwe without getting government employees back to work .
"" It was not something lightly considered .
It 's not something you just say .
We will meet the commitments .
I can assure you we will find the funds , "" he said .
Eddie Cross , nominated to be the MDC 's new state enterprises minister , said the government already had a commitment of $ 50 m from foreign donors , although he did not name them .
Money is the key to reviving Zimbabwe 's economy , but Britain and other donors have laid down several standards by which the new administration will be judged , before the money is released .
These include a return to the rule of law , the freeing of political detainees and the lifting of draconian restrictions on the independent press .
"" People have set benchmarks , "" said Tsvangirai .
"" We have to earn the confidence of the international community .
Their scepticism is justified .
This is 29 years of one - man rule .
But I 'm quite certain if we start moving on the benchmarks , that will be the basis for incremental support .
It 's a process of engagement . ""
An early marker will be the fate of the central bank governor , Gideon Gono , who has overseen world - record inflation running above 10 sextillion percent and the eradication of the national currency , as he did the electronic equivalent of furiously printing money by adding strings of zeros to government bank accounts .
He also facilitated the plunder of Zimbabwe 's coffers by its ruling elite .
Western governments want him out .
So do most Zimbabweans , but he has clung to office in part because he has a hold over other Zanu - PF leaders , because he knows who stole what .
Tsvangirai acknowledges that getting rid of Gono and the attorney general , Johannes Tomana , who has abused the law to lock up Mugabe 's opponents , will be seen by foreigners and Zimbabweans as an early test of his power .
"" We are dealing with that issue of Gono .
The government has to deal with it because I appreciate that people have no confidence in our central bank governor and our attorney general .
It is an issue that was addressed in the [ South Africa - brokered regional ] negotiations .
It will be dealt with , "" he said .
Asked how , he said : "" We recognise that it will be hard to win the donors ' confidence if the central bank governor is still there .
I can not say more right now
but it will be dealt with .
""
Another early test is the fate of 30 political detainees who have been held for months and brutally tortured .
Tsvangirai sought to dampen accusations that he is not doing enough for them , in part because he abandoned a pledge not to be sworn in until they were free , by visiting Chikurubi maximum security prison yesterday and demanding to see the political prisoners .
He succeeded in getting three of them moved to a private clinic for treatment , including Jestina Mukoko , who is reported to be ill .
But prison authorities removed Mukoko from the hospital a few hours later and returned her to jail .
Tsvangirai acknowledges that their continued detention is seen by many as a test of whether he wields sufficient power to overcome the hardliners .
"" I do agree that it 's a question of credibility , "" he said .
"" I went to the prison and talked with them and said it is taking longer than we anticipated
but we are dealing with it . ""
Asked why it is taking longer than anticipated , he said:""The problem is not Mugabe .
It lies elsewhere .
It is others .
We need to overcome that , "" he said , declining to name names .
Tsvangirai said that while the dissent by the old regime 's hardliners was of concern , he did not believe they would be able to retain power or carry out a coup . ""
The region wo n't accept it .
The world wo n't accept it .
They ca n't get away with it
, "" he said "" We know there are people who are disgruntled .
We know the agreement does not have support from all parties .
The leadership challenge for us is to negotiate away these areas of disgruntlement .
We can do that and we are going to begin by getting people back to work . """
2009-02-13,"The MDC 's Morgan Tsvangirai is the Zimbabwean prime minister at last .
It has been an arduous and turbulent road to his inauguration , and Tsvangirai is right to caution that it is not the end for Robert Mugabe and Zanu - PF .
The road remains long and beset with six key impediments .
First , the devil is not in the details about how the unity government will actually work .
The devil is in the lack of detail .
These grey areas threaten the unity government 's shelf life , and are sites for power battles and competition over which party will be better positioned to win the next elections , which are high on the list of priorities for all parties concerned .
Second , Zimbabwe 's unity government has received a mixed reception because of the considerable influence and control Mugabe still wields .
Many international donors are cautious about reengagement .
They have adopted a wait - and - see approach , meaning reconstruction will be slower than anticipated .
While Zanu - PF will have to reform its kleptocratic and undemocratic practices for the unity government to attract external aid , there is need for clarity about the nature of external assistance that will be required .
Short - term international donor aid is not a silver bullet for turning around the Zimbabwean economy and strengthening fragile institutions .
Long term coordinated international donor commitment fused with an active constructive role by local actors will be the primary determinants of reconstruction instead .
Third , Zimbabwe has a large diaspora , estimated at 3 million , located all over the world .
The diaspora needs to be harnessed and its resources fused with those in Zimbabwe to facilitate reconstruction .
However the term diaspora implies a cohesive community with shared values .
Contrary to this the Zimbabwean diaspora is a splintered one because of ethnic and racial differences , gender , class , immigration status , political affiliation and conflicting visions about the constituent elements of a reconstructed Zimbabwe .
As a consequence , there was no coordinated strategy by the Zimbabwean Diaspora for confronting the Zanu - PF government since the Zimbabwe crisis began in 2000 .
Presently the Zimbabwean diaspora is not coordinating on how it can play a role in Zimbabwe 's reconstruction .
Fourth , Zimbabwean civil society , while still active , has been paralysed by Zanu - PF - ordered imprisonment , violent attacks , political assassinations , and the economic crisis .
European and American donors , and international NGOs , have supported civil society groups campaigning for governance reforms and respect for human rights .
These groups will require further sustained assistance that should take into account civil society 's struggles for improved economic rights .
Land reform especially is critical for furthering economic rights .
Nonetheless there is no articulate and widely agreed upon action plan for addressing the disastrous effects of the Zanu - PF government 's "" fast track "" land - reform programme .
Moreover , institutional efficiency , transparency and fairness in land reform have been non - existent .
A robust and engaged civil society will help to alleviate these shortcomings .
Fifth , the necessity of constitutional reform can not be understated .
Indeed it would be the MDC 's greatest achievement in government if an inclusive democratic constitution were drafted and enshrined as the supreme law of the land .
Much of Zimbabwe 's governance problems have their genesis in a defective national constitution that , since 1985 , has been amended by Zanu - PF dominated parliaments to entrench the party 's rule .
Zanu - PF will look to frustrate meaningful constitutional reform in ways that could cause the unity government 's breakdown .
Sixth , constitutional reform can not go ahead in the absence of a revision of Zimbabwe 's political values system .
A political culture of violence , intolerance and kleptocracy has been fostered by Zanu - PF for decades to the extent that it is ubiquitous .
It is manifest in opposition and civil society circles .
A fundamental crisis Zimbabwe faces is a crisis of values .
Technocratic intercession without tackling the political values crisis will result in the unity government reproducing the Zanu - PF regime 's destructive rule .
Pernicious values militate against effective and strong democratic and developmental institutions ."

The detention , along with the continued imprisonment of dozens of opposition supporters who have been tortured , reflects deep divisions within the upper echelons of Mugabe 's power structure , with some military chiefs apparently attempting to sabotage the power - sharing agreement that brought Tsvangirai in to government .
The Movement for Democratic Change believes that if it can establish itself as a partner in government and strengthen support by reviving the economy , power will bleed from Mugabe and Zanu - PF to Tsvangirai .
The new prime minister swiftly won over government workers , the police and soldiers by promising to pay them in hard currency .
But there were questions about where Tsvangirai will find the $ 100 m ( £ 70 m ) required , given that Britain and other donors have laid down a set of benchmarks by which the new administration will be judged before beginning to release a £ 1.2bn aid package .
These include a return to the rule of law , the freeing of political detainees and the lifting of draconian restrictions on the independent press .
Tsvangirai said help would be forthcoming to pay the salaries , although he declined to specify from where .
But he acknowledged that it would take time to win more substantial aid .
"" We have to earn the confidence of the international community .
Their scepticism is justified .
This is 29 years of one - man rule .
But I 'm quite certain , if we start moving on the benchmarks , that will be the basis for incremental support , "" he said .
An early marker will be the fate of the central bank governor , Gideon Gono , who has overseen world - record inflation running above 10 sextillion per cent and the eradication of the national currency .
He also facilitated the plunder of Zimbabwe 's coffers by its ruling elite .
Tsvangirai acknowledges that getting rid of Gono and the attorney general , Johannes Tomana , who has abused the law to lock up Mugabe 's opponents , will be seen as an early test of his power .
"" We are dealing with that issue of Gono .
The government has to deal with it because I appreciate that people have no confidence in our central bank governor and our attorney general , "" he said .
"" We recognise that it will be hard to win the donors ' confidence if the central bank governor is still there .
I can not say more right now
but it will be dealt with . ""
Tsvangirai also acknowledges that he faces another crucial test in winning the release of 30 political detainees held for months and brutally tortured .
They were supposed to be freed before he was sworn in .
The prime minister has come under criticism for taking office when senior Zanu - PF officials had failed to deliver on a deal for the prisoners to be released .
But he blamed other forces for the problem .
"" I do agree that it 's a question of credibility , "" he said .
"" The problem is not Mugabe .
It lies elsewhere .
It is others .
We need to overcome that . ""
Tsvangirai declined to name names but the divisions in the upper echelons of Mugabe 's regime were laid bare at the new prime minister 's inauguration when the military service chiefs - including the armed forces chief , Constantine Chiwenga , and the police commander , Augustine Chihuri - refused to attend .
Tsvangirai said that while dissent by the old regime 's hardliners is a concern , he does not believe they will be able to retain power or , as some in his party fear , carry out a coup . ""
The region wo n't accept it .
The world wo n't accept it .
They ca n't get away with it , "" he said .
"" We know the agreement does not have support from all parties .
The leadership challenge for us is to negotiate away these areas of disgruntlement .
We can do that and we are going to begin by getting people back to work . ""
Challenges ahead
In the coming weeks Morgan Tsvangirai has to try to stamp his authority as prime minister on a cabinet divided between his own ministers and men from President Robert Mugabe 's party who have spent years expressing contempt for Tsvangirai .
The new prime minister must also fulfil pledges to pay government workers in hard currency , and re - establish the rule of law after years of state - sponsored violence , abductions , illegal detentions and murder .
He has promised to allow the independent press to function again .
If he succeeds , Tsvangirai will open the door to international aid , which should further strengthen the new administration as the economy improves and millions of people living with barely enough to eat start getting enough food again .
If Tsvangirai fails , the money will not come , confidence will be lost and it may prove impossible to prevent Mugabe and his party from reasserting themselves ."
2009-02-15,"A powerful five - man cabal is orchestrating a campaign of political abductions and disruption aimed at bringing a swift end to prime minister Morgan Tsvangirai 's power - sharing government , according to senior diplomats in the country .
The chaotic first days of the new administration , in which cabinet posts are shared between President Robert Mugabe 's Zanu - PF and Tsvangirai 's Movement for Democratic Change , culminated in the arrest on Friday of the MDC deputy agriculture minister Roy Bennett , which happened as the cabinet was being sworn in at State House .
Bennett has now been charged with treason , reportedly in relation to an alleged 2006 plot to overthrow Mugabe .
Human rights groups also said yesterday that scores of demonstrators were arrested in the southern city of Bulawayo as they held a Valentine 's Day protest calling for reform .
In the past few weeks , scores of Tsvangirai supporters and independent rights activists have been detained .
According to sources in Harare , the new wave of instability is the work of the Joint Operations Command ( JOC ) , a five - man body comprising the chiefs of the army , air force , police , prisons and intelligence .
Modelled on a secret command structure in the former Rhodesian regime , the JOC was revived in 1997 when Mugabe launched the "" Third Chimurenga "" ( Struggle ) to pacify liberation war veterans through patronage and political backing for land seizures .
Its five members , who vet everything from the daily front - page story in the Herald newspaper to monetary policy proposed by Reserve Bank governor Gideon Gono , are the most powerful men in the country .
All five boycotted last Wednesday 's and Friday 's swearing - in ceremonies for Tsvangirai and the country 's new ministers .
One African diplomat said : "" The JOC is the real enemy of democracy .
It obeys no laws and wants to send the signal that the MDC should not think that being in government offers it any sort of protection . ""
Tsvangirai condemned Bennett 's arrest yesterday , saying , "" His arrest ... raises a lot of concerns .
It undermines the spirit of our agreement . ""
But the new prime minister also hinted at hostile forces operating behind Mugabe .
He said : "" We have to budget for some residual resistance from those who see this deal as a threat to their interest . ""
He repeated calls for all political detainees to be released , an original condition of his joining the government , predicting that the issue would be a priority when the new cabinet ministers started work tomorrow .
The first cabinet meeting has been set for Tuesday and , after the rocky beginning to the new administration , the prime minister claimed that the coalition cabinet could still make progress together . ""
Obviously with our history , we can not immediately say we are the best of friends , "" he said .
"" As you begin to trust , the walls will start falling down . ""
Lawyers say Tsvangirai 's pledge to secure the imminent release of 30 political prisoners puts him on a collision course with the JOC , which is using the detainees as a human shield against reform .
Human rights lawyer Dzimbabwe Chimbga said the prisoners , three of whom have been transferred to hospital , were "" hostage to the JOC "" which is more powerful than Mugabe as an individual or any institution of the power - sharing government .
Observers believe the JOC is keeping the human rights activists in prison - by overruling successive court judgments - in order to negotiate amnesties for their own crimes .
The political prisoners , many of whom have been tortured , are active members of Tsvangirai 's MDC or are human rights activists .
Some have been in custody since October on trumped - up charges of bombing police stations or plotting the overthrow of the government by organising the training of insurgents in neighbouring Botswana .
They include Jestina Mukoko , director of the Zimbabwe Peace Project .
After successive court hearings , Mukoko and two others , former Tsvangirai political assistant Gandhi Mudzingwa , and Fidelis Chiramba , 72 , were sent to hospital last Thursday night .
Bennett , who was picked up on Friday at the Charles Prince airport near Harare , was one of the most provocative of Tsvangirai 's ministerial nominees .
He had only just returned from three years in South Africa after fleeing arrest on charges of masterminding a plot to kill Mugabe .
Perhaps the most powerful member of the JOC is the Zimbabwe Defence Forces Commander Constantine Chiwenga who controls the generals beneath him and ensures the armed forces get first call on food and fuel which are sold at favourable prices to parallel market operators who profit from shortages .
Chiwenga controls paramilitaries and the "" green bombers "" who invade farms and intimidate peasants .
The group suffered one setback last week when parliament , where the MDC has a majority , approved a law creating a new National Security Council to be accountable both to the MDC and the Zimbabwe African National Union - Patriotic Front ( Zanu - PF ) .
The creation of the body was a condition of the South African - brokered unity deal signed last September .
Meanwhile , it has emerged that Tsvangirai may not be able to fulfil a pledge to pay public employees in dollars .
The assertion flumoxed diplomats who questioned how the prime minister would raise the $ 50 m monthly salaries bill , given the reticence of the international community to resume spending in the country .
It now seems possible that Tsvangirai made the promise without having secured the money - either from Europe , the US , South Africa or his regional supporter , Botswana ."
2009-02-16,"The white former farmer and hate figure for President Robert Mugabe 's regime who is at the centre of a power struggle over Zimbabwe 's new government , is to appear in court today on terrorism charges .
The Movement for Democratic Change said Roy Bennett , who it nominated as a deputy minister of agriculture in the coalition government , is the victim of a "" malicious political vendetta "" by hardliners within the military intent on scuppering the power - sharing deal .
The new prime minister , Morgan Tsvangirai , and some of his ministers said such resistance was inevitable and they would not play into the hands of the hardliners by pulling out of the government .
But Tsvangirai did warn that Bennett 's arrest and the continued detention of about 30 other political prisoners , many of whom have been tortured , would undermine public confidence in the powersharing administration if the situation is allowed to continue .
Bennett was arrested on Friday , hours before the new government was sworn in .
The police at first accused him of attempting to leave the country illegally and then said he would be charged with treason .
But his lawyer says Bennett now faces prosecution under recent security legislation that was drawn up specifically to pursue Mugabe 's opponents .
The lawyer , Trust Maanda , said the police accused Bennett of plotting to buy weapons for an attack on a telecommunications station "" in order to disrupt essential services "" , after realising that the treason charge would not stick . ""
The police must have realised that they had no leg to stand on .
Their case would not hold water , "" Maanda said .
In a statement , the MDC said the police were casting around for anything to charge Bennett with and settled on the notorious Public Order and Security Act . ""
Clearly they are on a fishing expedition , clutching at straws and know fully well that there is no basis , even suspicion , at law to charge Roy Bennett , "" the party said .
"" All these charges are politically motivated , driven by a vindictive and malicious political vendetta . ""
Although Bennett 's arrest has been characterised by some critics as evidence that the new power - sharing administration is already failing , MDC leaders said such resistance was to be expected and that it would diminish if the coalition government could see through the coming weeks and win popular support by bringing in foreign cash to alleviate the deep financial crisis .
Tsvangirai told the Associated Press that while Bennett 's arrest "" undermines the spirit of our agreement "" it would not be allowed to wreck it . ""
There 's no way we will neglect our obligation , even though there are signs of resistance , "" he said .
The MDC said it believed Bennett 's detention was organised by the Military Intelligence Directorate with the collusion of the military chief of staff , General Constantine Chiwenga , and the country 's police chief , Augustine Chihuri , who has previously threatened to take up arms against a Tsvangirai - led government .
All are members of the eight - man Joint Operations Command , effectively Mugabe 's security cabinet , along with commissioner of prisons , Major - General Paradzai Zimondi , who has blocked the release of political detainees .
However , the MDC said there were signs of divisions within the JOC because it was not clear that its chairman , Emmerson Mnangagwa , a long - standing member of Mugabe 's cabinet and now defence minister , had endorsed the recent actions .
The party said that , in any case , attempting to block political changes will fail .
"" It is futile and ill - considered for anyone to go against the very momentum of history , "" said the MDC .
"" Change in Zimbabwe is inevitable.""Ro"
2009-02-16,"If Zimbabwe 's new prime minister , Morgan Tsvangirai , has any doubts about the scale of the task he has taken on , he just needs to take a look at his Kenyan counterpart , Raila Odinga .
Odinga agreed to enter a coalition with President Mwai Kibaki after a botched election resulted in some of the worst violence the country has seen for decades .
One year on , Odinga 's reputation as a reformist is under severe strain .
The coalition government he serves is hugely unpopular following a string of high - level corruption scandals .
Bad decisions such as refusal by MPs to have their lavish allowances taxed have seen public opinion of the administration fall to historic lows .
Although the Kenyan prime minister 's Orange Democratic Movement ( ODM ) claims real power still lies in the presidency , it will be judged on the record of the current government , which on present evidence is dire .
In Zimbabwe , Tsvangirai faces an even steeper challenge .
Odinga 's partner in government , President Kibaki , is a laid - back political operator who has long had a reputation as a man more comfortable on the golf course than in the bare - knuckled arena of Kenyan politics .
That means Odinga has had a more visible role in running state affairs , which is unlikely to happen in Robert Mugabe 's Zimbabwe .
Mugabe wasted little time dispensing with his long - time rival , Joshua Nkomo , the last time he was forced to share power in 1987 and his more recent Machiavellian manoeuvring to retain power means he has not mellowed with age .
Yet despite the fact that both the Kenyan and Zimbabwean solutions were imperfect options , there were few better ways to break the deadlock .
And rather than bemoan the fact they do not exercise full control , both Tsvangirai and Odinga have an important opportunity to influence change in these two countries .
United Nations secretary - general Kofi Annan was right in pointing out to Kenyan leaders that only far - reaching constitutional reforms would prevent a recurrence of the crisis .
The deal he mediated included a requirement to amend the constitution to reduce the powers of the presidency and deal with long - standing challenges such as land distribution .
Tsvangirai would be wise to demand similar constitutional changes to strengthen the institutions that would shield Zimbabwe from the expensive deadlock of the last few years .
For far too long , democracy in sub - Saharan Africa has been regarded as the mere expedient of holding periodic elections .
That is probably a result of the manner in which multi - party democracy was introduced in the early 1990s .
The fall of the Soviet Union meant that African Big Men could no longer play the west against the USSR to stay in power .
Being largely donor - dependent , they had to bow to US pressure to hold elections .
Leaders such as Daniel Moi in Kenya had little trouble fiddling with the election systems to win in the new multi - party elections .
But they doggedly resisted any attempt at the genuine reforms that would yield better governance .
In both Kenya and Zimbabwe , for example , judges are appointed by a pliant Judicial Service Commission whose members are picked by the president .
The lack of an independent judiciary means few political parties bother filing election petitions and the absence of a trusted arbiter sees disgruntled contestants resort to violence , as was the case in Kenya , or cast their hopes in international mediation à la Zimbabwe .
Tsvangirai and Odinga have an important opportunity to change that .
It is natural that leaders in both Kenya and Zimbabwe will be tempted to put off the task of constitutional reform and concentrate on the severe economic challenges both countries face .
Yet reforms that clean up the judiciary and shield electoral commissions from manipulation by changing the way commissioners are appointed would reduce the level of political risk associated with those countries .
That would help attract the levels of investment needed if they are to realistically aspire to attaining middle - income status .
It is unlikely that the administrations in Nairobi and Harare will achieve much .
The transitional nature of the governments and the distrust between all parties mean more energy will be spent jockeying for position than delivering services .
All this means that reforms that would help insulate their countries from the needless bloodshed and suffering of the last few years might be the most important achievement these leaders can chalk up ."
2009-02-18,"Prime minister Morgan Tsvangirai yesterday forced an early showdown with supporters of president Robert Mugabe by calling in ministers responsible for security and demanding from them an immediate return to the rule of law .
The move came as one of Tsvangirai 's own deputy ministers , Roy Bennett , finally appeared in court charged with plotting terrorism , insurgency and banditry , and trying to leave Zimbabwe illegally .
Bennett had been custody since being arrested hours before the new government was sworn in on Friday .
The Movement for Democratic Change described the charges as "" trumped up , scandalous and politically motivated "" , part of "" a deeper political agenda "" aimed at derailing the powersharing administration agreed between the MDC and the president 's Zanu - PF .
The court is expected to rule today on whether Bennett has a case to answer .
The unity government held its first cabinet meeting yesterday , chaired by Mugabe .
According to MDC sources , the encounter was "" fairly cordial "" but insubstantive ; Tsvangirai raised the issue of Bennett and the collapse of the rule of law more generally , but Mugabe did not address it seriously .
Afterwards , the prime minister summoned the defence minister , Emmerson Mnangagwa , the state security minister , Sydney Sekeramayi , and the home affairs minister , Kembo Mohadi , to demand they observe legality .
Tsvangirai meant Bennett 's arrest and the actions of some Mugabe loyalists in blocking the release of 30 political detainees .
But he also demanded an end to extra - legal moves to seize Zimbabwe 's few remaining white - owned farms .
On Monday , the attorney general , Johannes Tomana , who the prime minister wants to remove for locking up opposition activists , ordered the police to evict white farmers despite a binding ruling by a regional tribunal that the farm confiscations are illegal .
Whether the ministers act on the prime minister 's demands is an early test of his ability to assert control .
An MDC official took it as a good sign that the ministers met Tsvangirai and did not question his authority .
The source said the meeting was also in part a confidence - building measure aimed at establishing a personal relationship with some of the members of the cabinet most hostile to Tsvangirai .
The MDC leadership says it believes that once there is a return to orderly administration and the rule of law , power will seep away from the narrow band of military and senior Zanu - PF officials who have abused their positions to retain a grip on government .
However , an important step in realising that also lies in winning the confidence , or at least damping the hostility , of the military service chiefs who refused to attend the prime minister 's inauguration and who have previously threatened to take up arms against him .
Analysts say that Tsvangirai needs to assert his authority not only to ensure he can control Mugabe 's ministers , but to reassure foreign donors who have laid down rule of law and respect for property rights as a precondition for funding to revive Zimbabwe 's wrecked economy ."
2009-02-19,"Zimbabwe 's prime minister , Morgan Tsvangirai , has taken an important step toward establishing the new power - sharing government 's credibility by fulfilling a commitment to pay the army and other public - sector workers in dollars because the national currency is worthless .
Foreign diplomats had questioned whether Tsvangirai would be able to find the estimated $ 100 m ( £ 70 m ) required to meet the public sector 's 130,000-person payroll given the dire state of Zimbabwe 's economy .
But the new finance minister , Tendai Biti , said he had "" juggled "" the books and soldiers have received $ 100 each .
Civil servants , teachers , doctors and nurses will all have been paid a similar amount by the end of the week .
Although relatively low compared to what Zimbabwean professionals used to earn , $ 100 is a small fortune against the near worthless wages they had been receiving .
Teachers were paid several trillion Zimbabwe dollars a month but inflation , which is above 10 sextillion ( 10 billion trillion ) percent , wiped out the currency 's value .
Almost all shops in Zimbabwe now accept payment only in US dollars or South African rand .
Biti told a press conference that the hard currency payments are intended to get schools and hospitals functioning again after many teachers and health staff stopped going to work because they were paid so little , in many cases not enough to cover the transport costs of getting there .
Many government workers have also been unable to feed their families and are among 7 million Zimbabweans , about two - thirds of the population remaining in the country , reliant on foreign food aid .
"" We have to get Zimbabwe working again ; getting teachers to school is part of efforts to get Zimbabwe to work again , having examination papers being marked is part of having Zimbabwe work again , "" Biti said .
Tsvangirai had appealed to civil servants to return to work on Monday .
A Movement for Democratic Change ( MDC ) official said that some did but that the numbers at work today have risen with the payments – although it is feared that many have fled abroad in search of employment , particularly to South Africa .
The US dollar pay will be particularly important in winning support among the rank and file of the military for Tsvangirai 's authority over the new administration in which Robert Mugabe remains president and both men oversee the cabinet .
The military service chiefs have been particularly hostile to the MDC leader 's inclusion in the government but it may be more difficult for them to move against him if the ordinary soldiers stand to lose .
Biti also scrapped expensive licenses for shops to do business in foreign currency .
But he has previously said that the use of US dollars and rand is a temporary measure and has dismissed a proposal by some in Mugabe 's Zanu - PF party for Zimbabwe to adopt the South African currency permanently .
For now , though , the Zimbabwe dollar is a pariah currency .
The country 's dilapidated power and water utilities have started charging in US dollars .
Even the state - run Herald newspaper , which continues to be highly partisan toward Mugabe , can only be bought using foreign currency except at its head office , where it costs Z$1tn .
Biti said that the free use of hard currency should curb inflation . ""
Now that the country has embraced the use of multiple currencies which are relatively stable , the government expects all businesses to act responsibly on pricing ... in order to create the necessary confidence in the economy . """
2009-02-22,"Robert Mugabe marked his 85th birthday yesterday with a sumptuous banquet in Harare at the start of a week of parties which observers say is a further sign of the Zimbabwean president 's defiance in the face of growing criticism of his regime .
His latest show of excess came as prime minister Morgan Tsvangirai said "" maybe US$ 5bn ( £ 3.5bn ) "" would be needed to rehabilitate the collapsed health , social and education systems .
Surreal celebrations got under way on Friday as schoolboy pipers , accompanied by drum majorettes , marched through the decrepit capital and members of a ruling party youth organisation sold $ 10 raffle tickets .
Teetotal Mugabe 's private party yesterday was hosted by his wife , Grace , 44 , and attended by friends and a number of African diplomats .
But state television did not , as is customary , broadcast his speech .
A $ 100-a - ticket gala dinner at Harare 's Rainbow Towers Hotel on Wednesday is advertised as a musical extravaganza including Nigerian hip - hop star 2Face , Congolese rhumba band Werrason and a host of local acts .
The parties will culminate on Saturday with a public feast and concert at Chinhoyi , about 50 miles west of Harare , which is to be televised .
Dozens of animals will be slaughtered for the event and guests include hundreds of children also born on 21 February .
Zimbabwe University political science professor John Makumbe said the birthday display was the latest of many signals that the ruling Zimbabwe African National Union Patriotic Front ( Zanu - PF ) does not intend to respect the power - sharing agreement that saw Tsvangirai sworn in on 11 February . ""
The money for the parties and the cattle and chickens donated are extracted from people virtually against their will , "" he said .
"" Thousands have died from cholera and many students are not attending school or university because teachers are not paid .
It 's unbelievable that he can blow quadrillions of Zimbabwe dollars on parties .
"" The celebrations have been organised since 1986 by a Zanu - PF youth group called the 21 February Movement .
Initially modelled on scouting and aimed at promoting children 's rights , it has increasingly become a young sycophants ' association .
Zanu - PF youth leader Absolom Sikhosana defended the Chinhoyi event : "" It is not a feast per se , but an event where youths have a chance to meet their hero .
This inspires them to emulate his exemplary qualities of nation - building , patriotism and principled leadership . ""
In a sign of the times , the 21 February Movement set out to raise only $ 500,000 ( £ 350,000 ) for Mugabe 's birthday week against a reported $ 1.2 m last year .
Last week Sikhosana made a heartfelt plea on national radio for benefactors to make good on their promises : "" We know things are tough , but it would be nice to honour the pledges you made . ""
According to some reports , pledges for only £ 70,000 have come in , much in the form of food donations .
State media has reported that each district in Zimbabwe is expected to donate 50 cattle and to raise US$ 1,500 ( £ 1,000 ) .
Mugabe had already run roughshod over the power - sharing agreement by appointing 61 ministers instead of the agreed 31 , Makumbe said .
"" Each will need their Mercedes , their 4x4 , their driver , bodyguard and housing .
At the same time , Tsvangirai is trying to raise money for basic reconstruction . ""
Amid scepticism from the international community , Tsvangirai and South African President Kgalema Motlanthe did their best to indicate progress on Friday .
At a joint press conference in Cape Town , Motlanthe even claimed that the cholera crisis , which the UN says has killed 3,800 people and is worsening , had been "" contained "" .
Tsvangirai played down the plight of his deputy agriculture minister , Roy Bennett , and 30 other activists who are in jail for alleged plotting against the regime .
He said : "" We are working slowly to deal with that matter and to make sure it does not become the focus of the attention .
The real attention has to be on the plight of Zimbabweans .
"" The two men announced that Southern African finance ministers are this week expected to announce a $ 1.5bn loan to Zimbabwe , to be underwritten by the African Development Bank .
The institution is part - funded by Europe and the US , but decision - making rests with African governments .
International donors remain concerned that aid will be diverted to the ruling party , just as £ 20 m from South Africa last December mostly ended up in the hands of party supporters ."
2009-02-24,"As Zimbabwe 's autocratic president , Robert Mugabe , tightened his grip on power in the past five years , the country 's charities have faced the same violent persecution meted out to his political opponents .
As the charities struggled to help an increasingly desperate population , left hungry and impoverished by government corruption and incompetent economic reforms , dozens of their workers suffered beatings , abduction , imprisonment and torture .
Even after the establishment of a new government this month , with Morgan Tsvangirai , leader of the main opposition party the Movement for Democratic Change ( MDC ) and now prime minister , many charity workers remain locked up in terrible conditions , according to the National Association of NGOs of Zimbabwe ( Nango ) .
"" This is Zimbabwe 's Guantanamo , "" says Cephas Zinhumwe , chief executive of Nango , which represents more than 1,000 non - governmental organisations across the country .
"" Some of our members are still in jail .
Mugabe blames them for the regime change .
Tsvangirai said when he was sworn in they would be released .
But they have n't been yet .
Some of them [ the charity workers ] are sick and wo n't survive in the jails .
We want to make sure they 're allowed to get to hospital and get treatment .
No one – them or any other prisoners – should be in those conditions .
"" Zinhumwe was in the UK last week to attend the annual conference of Nango 's British counterpart the National Council of Voluntary Organisations , trying to build partnerships with international NGOs to help his members in their efforts to revitalise Zimbabwe .
He also met with the foreign secretary , David Miliband , to lobby for a change in the government 's approach to his country 's plight .
He opposes the international sanctions on Zimbabwe , arguing they have not been effective .
"" It 's the poor women and children who are suffering from the sanctions , "" he says .
The aims of his visit to the UK reflect Nango 's changing role in Zimbabwe .
It was founded in 1962 as a non - partisan umbrella body for social welfare organisations but has increasingly found itself embroiled in the country 's political turmoil .
Its championing of the interests of the poor , the marginalised and the vulnerable , and defence of the independence of its member organisations , brought it into conflict with Mugabe and his supporters over the past decade .
"" We were combating the excesses of the government , "" says Zinhumwe .
"" We did n't think it was serving the people .
"" Our major concern is to have a government that is well run and concerned about our people .
We were far ahead of other African countries but now we are 10 to 20 years behind .
We have people with no food , no medicines , no doctors . ""
If it was n't for the NGOs , the situation in Zimbabwe would be much worse .
Our members are sourcing funds and medicines to contain the cholera epidemic .
As it is now , our government has no capacity to contain it . ""
However , in pressing Mugabe 's government to tackle issues such as the independence of the judiciary and the media , Nango 's members found themselves treated as political opponents . ""
The only sector [ of our members ] to have come into direct confrontation with Mugabe is the human rights and governance sector , which is challenging the government on a range of issues , even violence , "" says Zinhumwe .
"" What we are saying is that we ca n't live in a country with this level of violence , where the government is not providing schools and hospitals and the judiciary is not independent .
But once you do that , you are seen as the enemy of the state and a collaborator with the US and UK .
"" Thirty to 40 of our members were detained last year .
Some of our members were beaten , harassed heavily and questioned by the police .
Last year some were abducted , including Jestina Mukoko , director of the Zimbabwe Peace Project , and two of her staff . ""
Mukoko , a forthright campaigner for human rights , was dragged from her home in Norton , near the capital Harare , in December in her nightdress by armed men .
She was tortured – beaten with rubber truncheons – and interrogated , and has still not been released despite demands from international human rights bodies and politicians .
But it is not just Zimbabwe 's human rights organisations that have borne the brunt of the political violence .
In the run up to last year 's general elections , Mugabe 's Zanu - PF party tried to wrest control of food distribution from independent humanitarian organisations .
"" They [ Zanu - PF ] said that food was distributed in a partisan manner that swayed votes , says Zinhumwe .
"" They wanted to see and control where the food went . ""
Three years earlier , the government had tried to push through a law that would allow the regime to manage NGOs .
But thanks to concerted efforts by a coalition of NGOs , the labour movement and the churches , the president never signed it into law .
Nango now wants a law to be drawn up that will enable charities to operate freely while ensuring they are independently monitored .
Nango is also lobbying for a new national constitution and a truth and reconciliation process similar to that held in South Africa after the end of apartheid .
Zinhumwe believes this could bridge Zimbabwe 's political divide and resolve grievances on both sides . ""
The challenge will be the demand for restitution , "" he says .
"" People have been killed , buildings destroyed , livelihoods ruined .
They want to get on with their lives and revenge wo n't help . ""
Despite the country 's dire straits and cynicism about the new power - sharing arrangement between Zanu - PF and the MDC , Zinhumwe is optimistic about his country 's future .
He says : "" Some people think the MDC sold out .
But we will support this government because there 's no alternative .
We hope it will at least produce a positive impact .
There will be a little bit of stability .
The country has lost trust in our government and our banks , but with this new government this could change . """
2009-02-26,"National leaders newly arrived in office can usually count on a brief honeymoon period of relative political harmony and goodwill .
Morgan Tsvangirai , sworn in as Zimbabwe 's prime minister earlier this month , has been afforded no such courtesy by Robert Mugabe and his isolated , violently paranoid inner circle of Zanu - PF henchmen .
With a brutish determination born of fear for their own skins , the men most responsible for Zimbabwe 's ruination are doing all they can to sink Tsvangirai before he can swim .
Mugabe is stubbornly refusing to replace Gideon Gono , the Reserve Bank mastermind whose inept policies helped shatter the economy .
Yet without a root - and - branch shake - up in policymaking , resumed international financial assistance will not be forthcoming .
Far from observing the power - sharing niceties of a unity government , Zanu - PF bosses are behaving as if they are still in sole control , Harare observers say .
Senior civil service appointments have been made without reference to Movement for Democratic Change ( MDC ) leaders .
And farm seizures by Mugabe 's cronies are accelerating – there have been up to 50 in recent weeks – even as the country 's dire food shortages and health crisis morph into regional emergencies .
Despite Tsvangirai 's generous insistence on the need for forgiveness and reconciliation , 27 MDC activists remain in arbitrary detention along with a prominent party figure and unity government minister , Roy Bennett .
Domestic media remain firmly under Zanu - PF control and independent foreign news organisations are still banned .
And as ever , lurking in the shadows , watching Tsvangirai 's every move and looking for ways to trip him up , stands the powerful defence forces chief , General Constantine Chiwenga , and the sinister joint operations command comprising senior military officers and Mugabe trusties .
The JOC is held responsible for the the reign of terror that followed last year 's stolen presidential election .
Under its direction , the attorney general , Johannes Tomana , has now reportedly dropped all murder investigations relating to that period .
"" It ca n't be denied that so far Tsvangirai is prime minister in name only .
It 's certainly the case that Mugabe is still in control of the country , "" a senior western diplomat said .
"" The MDC is finding that being in government is even heavier sledding than they imagined .
Mugabe is still the bully boy on the block and he 's dumping all the problems on the prime minister .
That 's no surprise . ""
But Tsvangirai did not have much time to make his mark and reverse the flow of power away from Zanu - PF towards the MDC , the diplomat warned .
"" The next two months will give a broad indication , will tell whether this [ the unity government ] will work or fail .
It 's not an indefinite process . ""
Western strategies to strengthen the MDC 's hand in this watershed internal battle for control are clear – but limited by political and financial considerations .
Government - funded humanitarian aid has been stepped up .
Attempts are underway to target it specifically in areas of chronic need , such as fighting the cholera epidemic , as a way of demonstrating the MDC can deliver .
But governments are simultaneously wary of reinforcing Mugabe 's caricature of Tsvangirai as a western puppet .
Diplomats say western countries are also encouraging international financial institutions such as the IMF to work with the new finance minister , the MDC 's Tendai Biti , with a view to raising the $ 5bn Tsvangirai says is needed to rescue the economy .
South Africa and the Southern African Development Community ( SADC ) , which brokered the unity deal , have a clear obligation to provide funds to make it work , they argue .
All the same , the prospect of significant international assistance while Gono remains Reserve Bank chief , and in the absence of greater transparency and improved legal and financial safeguards , is dim .
SADC finance ministers , meeting in Cape Town this week to discuss a regional aid package , were also said to be worried that scarce funds could be siphoned off by corrupt Zanu - PF officials , as in the past .
The difficulty for Britain , the US , and other concerned EU countries is that by making the resumption of full - scale developmental assistance to Zimbabwe contingent on macroeconomic reforms , renewed respect for human rights and adherence to the rule of law , they may be reducing the MDC 's chances of making a definitive difference in what could be a short - lived window of opportunity .
Tsvangirai needs to demonstrate that he , not Mugabe , is in charge and can deliver the country from the abyss .
But according to one diplomat , the danger is that he could become prime minister for the humanitarian crisis while Mugabe and his cronies and flunkies continue to control the state . ""
The question is , can the MDC find and hold the levers of real power and influence ?
The dynamic is very weak . """
2009-03-06,"Zimbabwe 's prime minister , Morgan Tsvangirai , has survived a car crash that killed his wife , Susan , near Harare today .
Tsvangirai 's Movement for Democratic Change ( MDC ) said the prime minister was injured but not critically in the collision with a lorry .
He was taken to a clinic in the capital .
The driver of his official vehicle was seriously injured .
There was no word on the condition of the lorry driver .
The party said there was no immediate reason to believe the accident was suspicious , but it was awaiting full details .
An MDC official said that from information at the scene it appeared the lorry driver fell asleep at the wheel .
MDC officials said the couple had been heading to Mr Tsvangirai 's home town of Buhera for a political rally .
Mrs Tsvangirai died at the crash scene .
The couple were married for 31 years and had six children .
Mrs Tsvangirai was widely respected in Zimbabwe as the antithesis of President Robert Mugabe 's extravagant and free - spending wife , Grace , who showed little concern for the plight of the many hungry and poor in her country .
Susan Tsvangirai largely avoided the limelight but did speak out on women 's rights and Aids .
She was deeply religious .
Zimbabwe 's roads are notoriously dangerous , having deteriorated in recent years through lack of maintenance .
Drivers are forced on to the wrong side to weave around potholes .
Many vehicles drive without proper lights and brakes because of the difficulty and expense of obtaining spare parts .
Earlier today security forces arrested a judge who granted bail to one of Tsvangirai 's most prominent and controversial aides , Roy Bennett , who has been chosen as deputy agriculture minister in the new power - sharing administration .
Bennett was arrested three weeks ago on what the MDC says are trumped - up charges of conspiracy to overthrow Mugabe 's administration by force .
Livingstone Chipadze was detained and charged with abuse of power after issuing the release papers for Bennett in line with a high court order .
As Bennett was about to leave jail clutching the papers they were confiscated by prison officials .
He remains locked up after prosecutors appealed to the supreme court and extended his detention .
Bennett has told visitors he believes he is being held hostage by hardliners at the top of the security forces who want the new administration to introduce a blanket amnesty for their crimes over the past 29 years , from the Matabeleland massacres in the 1980s to last year 's campaign of murder , torture and disappearances aimed at scaring voters into supporting Mugabe in the presidential election ."
2009-03-07,"Morgan Tsvangirai , the Zimbabwe prime minister , today left hospital a day after surviving the car crash in which his wife , Susan , was killed .
Tsvangirai was seen walking out of the hospital in the company of security guards and senior officials of the Movement for Democratic Change ( MDC ) , wearing a baseball cap pulled over his bandaged head .
He suffered head injuries and chest pains in the collision with a lorry near Harare and was first taken to a clinic in the capital .
The driver of his official vehicle was seriously injured .
The condition of the lorry driver remained unclear .
The MDC said today the accident could have been avoided if proper security had been in place .
The party 's secretary - general and finance minister , Tendai Biti , said police were examing whether foul play was involved , the Reuters news agency reported .
Biti said the party would conduct its own investigation.""If there had been a police escort , what happened would not have happened ; the authorities could have avoided this omission , "" Reuters reported him as saying .
An MDC official said that from information at the scene it appeared the lorry driver fell asleep at the wheel .
It was later reported the Zimbawean driver of the truck , which belonged to the United States development agency , admitted being asleep at the wheel .
He is in police custody .
Rumours in Harare , some spread by text messages , quickly raised questions about whether the crash was another of the assassination attempts on Tsvangirai blamed on the president , Robert Mugabe .

2009-03-08,"Zimbabwe 's prime minister Morgan Tsvangirai was flown to neighbouring Botswana yesterday to recover from the car crash that killed his wife and left him injured last Friday .
A source from his party , the Movement for Democratic Change ( MDC ) , said he was exhausted and needed time to come to terms with what had happened .
MDC officials said the party would carry out an independent investigation into the cause of the accident .
Susan Tsvangirai , 49 , was thrown from the couple 's Land Cruiser as it somersaulted off the road after being hit by an aid lorry on a potholed road , south of the capital Harare .
Yesterday Morgan Tsvangirai , who suffered neck and head injuries , was said to be "" totally devastated "" .
The 57-year - old left the private Avenues Clinic in Harare late yesterday afternoon , surrounded by tight security and flew to Botswana .
MDC officials have been trying to damp down suspicion that the accident could have been a botched assassination attempt on their new prime minister , sworn in less than a month ago as part of a power - sharing agreement with President Robert Mugabe and his ruling Zanu PF party .
"" The nation is in pain , the nation is in shock .
We have all lost a mother , "" said Nelson Chamisa , an MDC spokesman .
He warned that speculation over the cause of the accident was unhelpful . ""
Police are doing their investigations and will have a report soon , "" he said .
But it has become clear the MDC had been concerned enough to dispatch a local union official to examine the wreckage within an hour of the crash .
Deon Theron , a cattle farmer , said he had been called and asked to go to the scene to check the Toyota 's brakes and steering .
They had not been tampered with , he said , adding that he had taken photographs until the police officers on the scene confiscated his camera .
He added that the tar road had recently been poorly repaired .
The US - donated aid lorry , normally used to transport medicines , was being driven by a Zimbabwean man employed using money from a British development agency .
Police said the driver admitted that he had fallen asleep at the wheel and veered into the oncoming Tsvangirai convoy .
The Tsvangirais have six children and two grandchildren .
Their four eldest children were last night on their way back to Zimbabwe from their homes in Australia and South Africa , while ordinary Zimbabweans from Harare and beyond were making a pilgrimage to the Tsvangirais ' home to pay their respects to the woman they called amai - mother - of Zimbabwe .
Fears were growing over how Tsvangirai would cope with losing the woman who has been at his side for more than 30 years .
He has said that marrying her in 1979 was the best decision of his life , and she was devoted to him .
She was close to collapse after seeing her husband in prison in 2003 and was there supporting him in court when he faced treason charges .
"" It is an enormous loss for Morgan and for both sides of the family .
They are a very close - knit family , "" said Sekai Holland , an MDC MP .
"" She helped raise Morgan 's brothers and sisters , too , and was a wonderful woman .
To the women of the MDC she was such a figure : all of us looked to her . ""
In a rare interview in 2003 , Susan Tsvangirai promised she would one day serve tea in State House , and take up the cause of HIV and Aids sufferers , as well as standing up for women 's rights . ""
Women at the grassroots level would be my main focus , "" she said .
Jenni Williams , of the civic movement Women of Zimbabwe Arise , said : "" We have certainly long awaited a decent first lady to help further women 's rights . ""
Mugabe visited Tsvangirai in hospital on Friday night and yesterday called the accident a blow to the nation .
"" We were celebrating this major development when tragedy struck , "" he said ."
2009-03-09,"Zimbabwe 's prime minister , Morgan Tsvangirai , moved today to rule out foul play in the car accident that killed his wife , Susan , and forced him to convalesce in neighbouring Botswana .
Tsvangirai flew into the Zimbabean capital , Harare , this morning ahead of his wife 's funeral on Wednesday .
His face still swollen but with no bandages visible , Tsvangirai , 56 , told mourners at his home : "" It was an accident .
When something happens there is always speculation , but I want to say in this case ,
if there was any foul play , it was [ a likelihood of ] one in a thousand . ""
The couple , who had been married for 31 years , were travelling from Harare to their rural home in Buhera on Friday afternoon when their vehicle was involved in an accident with a lorry travelling in the opposite direction .
The prime minister , his driver and his head of security were taken to hospital .
The driver of the lorry , Chinoona Mwanda , 35 , was unhurt .
Mwanda 's lawyer , Chris Mhike , said his client was "" deeply distressed "" and intended to plead not guilty to culpable homicide at a court appearance later Monday .
Months of tension between Tsvangirai and the 85-year - old president , Robert Mugabe , led to speculation after the accident that the leader of the Movement for Democratic Change had been targeted for assassination .
Suspicious car accidents have over the years claimed the lives of prominent political figures including Josiah Tongogara , Sydney Malunga , Border Gezi , Elliot Manyika and Moven Mahachi .
Tsvangirai claims to have been the target of four attempts on his life , and has survived several severe beatings by security forces .
In the past year he has spent long stretches of time out of the country – especially in Botswana , whose president , Seretse Ian Khama , is a personal friend – amid fears for his life .
The road on which the Tsvangirais were travelling is in poor condition but potholes on the stretch where the accident happened have recently been filled in .
Near the accident site there is , however , a protruding bump that is believed to be road - mending material left by workers .
Susan Tsvangirai , who was 50 , will be buried on Wednesday at Buhera .
She is survived by six children .
The deputy prime minister , Thokozani Khuphe , is handling day - to - day affairs until at least Wednesday .
The finance minister , Tendai Biti , has stressed the government will continue its work in Tsvangirai 's absence .
"" This is a body blow to the party , but in our history we have suffered many of them , "" he said .
"" We have learned to take blows on the chin and move forward ; we shall do that again .
It is certainly what the prime minister wants . """
2009-03-09,"Morgan Tsvangirai is expected to return to Zimbabwe today after undergoing medical tests in neighbouring Botswana following the car accident on Friday that killed his wife , Susan .
The prime minister , who was flown to Botswana on Saturday , was recovering physically but remained in a state of "" enormous shock "" after being told of his wife 's death , said a spokesman for his party , the Movement for Democratic Change .
Condolences flooded in from MDC supporters and governments all over the world .
The finance minister , Tendai Biti , said Mrs Tsvangirai , who had been married to the MDC leader for 31 years and was the mother of his six children , would be "" irreplaceable "" .
The deputy prime minister , Thokozani Khuphe , is expected to handle day - to - day affairs until at least Wednesday when Mrs Tsvangirai will be buried in the couple 's home town , Buhera .
She was fatally injured when the Toyota Land Cruiser the couple were travelling in overturned after it left the road about 50 miles south of Harare on Friday afternoon .
The couple were on their way to a weekend rally in Buhera .
Tsvangirai , who will be 57 tomorrow , had given his maiden speech in parliament two days earlier .
The speech outlined an ambitious programme of reconstruction for Zimbabwe , and the prime minister called for an end to the culture of "" impunity and entitlement "" among groups that wished his unity government to fail .
Yesterday , Biti stressed the government would continue its work . ""
This is a body blow to the party but in our history we have suffered many of them .
We have learnt to take blows on the chin and move forward .
We shall do that again .
It is certainly what the prime minister wants . ""
Amid speculation that the car accident was an attempt on Tsvangirai 's life , the MDC said it would carry out its own investigation in parallel with that of the police .
Previously , there have been up to four attempts on Tsvangirai 's life in the MDC 's 10-year history .
Mr and Mrs Tsvangirai , as well as the prime minister 's head of security , Benson Okolo , were in the middle car of a three - vehicle convoy when the crash happened on a two - way tar road about 20 miles south of Beatrice .
Tsvangirai 's driver , known as Simba , remains in hospital in Harare .
Okolo was not seriously injured .
It is understood an oncoming single - cab lorry belonging to the John Snow International medical charity may have swerved into the path of the Land Cruiser , which may have taken abortive action or been shunted by the lorry .
Cattle farmer Deon Theron , who rushed to the scene on Friday afternoon , said the lorry may have swerved to avoid a "" really bad , long bump "" in the road .
Theron said : "" I climbed on top of the vehicle to examine its underside .
Everything looked normal ...
I checked the brake pipes and steering , and they were all fine . """
2009-03-09,"Susan Tsvangirai , the wife of Zimbabwe 's prime minister , Morgan Tsvangirai , was killed on Friday , at the age of 50 , when a seven - ton aid truck hammered into their four - wheel - drive .
It was part of a convoy of three vehicles passing along potholed roads .
Morgan went into hospital in Harare with head and neck injuries before being flown out to Botswana .
Parallels were drawn between this new but shortlived figure in the senior echelons of Zimbabwe 's government , and the country 's first lady , President Robert Mugabe 's wife , Grace - the "" queen of consumers "" , whose spending habits have contributed to the collapse of morale in the country .
The wife of the new premier - he was sworn in on 11 February - had run a sewing and catering business before her husband went into politics .
She made her own alterations to clothes she had bought from discount stores .
Susan was born in Buhera , as was Morgan , about 50 km south of Harare , the country 's capital ; the convoy in which the fatal accident happened was heading there so that Morgan could address a rally in his home region the following day .
The couple met in 1978 , when Morgan was foreman of a local nickel mine .
They married later that year , and had three daughters and three sons together .
An unquestioning supporter of her husband , she said of him in an interview shortly before her death : "" He is a good man , husband and a loving father .
Once he sets his eyes on a target he never takes his eyes off the target until he has achieved it . ""
He is a man of great determination , and above all a man of great courage .
I think he has proved his courage to the world .
He has fought Mugabe for 10 years and is still fighting .
We all know that Mugabe 's tactics are not always above board , but that did n't faze my Morgan . ""
In 2003 , she was very distressed to see him in prison , and sat in court to hear the treason proceedings against him .
She visited him in prison and saw the gashes in his head after he was arrested and assaulted in March 2007 .
As she put it : "" I would be lying if I said it has been easy .
There were times when I so feared for my husband 's life that sleeping was no longer part of my life , I just prayed .
As a mother , I feared for my children .
I felt that they were so vulnerable .
But at the end off the day I had to support my husband , that is the role of a wife , a good wife at least . ""
A deeply religious woman committed to the alleviation of poverty and HIV / Aids , she ran a soup kitchen from her own home in Harare .
Though she often accompanied her husband to political events , she rarely spoke publicly : when she did , her personal charm proved very effective .
Perhaps to distract herself from fears about her family , she set up the Comfort , or Nyaradzo Trust , the Shona word being taken from her middle name .
Subsequently renamed the Susan Nyaradzo Tsvangirai Foundation , it aims to help Zimbabweans , particularly women and children .
She wanted "" to not only feed them but teach them to feed themselves .
Return normality to children 's lives .
Seeing them playing in the parks , going to school .
The way things used to be in this beautiful country .
Help get things back to what they were , and make them even better if time permits . ""
Sadly , in Susan Tsvangirai 's case , it did not .
She is survived by Morgan and her children .
•
Susan Nyaradzo Tsvangirai , activist , born 24 April 1958 ; died 6 March 2009"
2009-03-10,"Zimbabwe 's president , Robert Mugabe , today described the death of Susan Tsvangirai as an act of God and urged Zimbabweans to support her husband by halting violence .
Speaking at a memorial service for the wife of Zimbabwae 's prime minister , Morgan Tsvangirai , Mugabe wished his rival - turned - coalition partner strength for the nation - building work ahead .
The body of Susan Tsvangirai , who was killed aged 50 in a car crash last Friday , rested in a closed , flower - draped coffin .
She supported her husband through years of political struggle against the veteran president .
Mugabe , who formed a unity government with Tsvangirai in February , told 1,000 government and political leaders and diplomats at the Harare Methodist church he was saddened by the death . ""
This is a difficult moment for our colleague , "" Reuters reported Mugabe as saying at the service . ""
He has lost a partner , and we must all rally to support him and lessen his burden ...
This is the hand of God . ""
To our supporters , we want to say violence should stop .
That 's what [ Susan Tsvangirai ] would have wanted : for us to coexist peacefully .
We have just started a new life after years of fighting each other and insulting each other .
We have said : let 's give peace and harmony a chance , and work together . ""
The prime minister and his children attended the service , and later some 15,000 Zimbabweans sang hymns .
Tsvangirai , who turned 57 on Tuesday , addressed the crowd briefly , saying : "" Let 's celebrate her existence as God 's gift to me and you . ""
Mugabe said the wives of politicians played important supporting roles , noting that Susan Tsvangirai was by her husband 's side when Mugabe administered the prime minister 's oath , 11 on February .
"" We are sincerely saddened by the death of Susan and we hope that Morgan will remain strong , "" Mugabe said at the church .
He added that the new coalition government had just begun efforts to rebuild a country beset by political and economic crises .
Mugabe reluctantly agreed to share power with Tsvangirai only under extreme pressure from the leaders of neighbouring countries after a year of political violence and deadlock followed a presidential election in which Tsvangirai won more votes .
Tsvangirai pulled out of a runoff because of state - sponsored attacks on his supporters , and Mugabe claimed victory despite widespread criticism that the second round had been neither free nor fair .
Zimbabwe 's long history of political violence blamed on Mugabe 's forces led to speculation that Friday 's crash was no accident .
Morgan Tsvangirai , who was injured in the crash , tried to quell the rumors on Monday , telling mourners there was "" no foul play "" .
Susan Tsvangirai 's father , who addressed mourners at the church on behalf of the family , spoke of sitting down with his son - in - law recently to discuss how power - sharing would work .
Emanuel Mhundwa said he had hoped to see his daughter help the prime minister "" bring peace and stability to the country "" .
Hazel Makumbo , a 22-year - old Harare resident who joined the crowd outside the church today , said she wanted to pay her respects to a woman who "" was helping Morgan in trying to bring democracy and good things to Zimbabwe "" .
In recent days , thousands of Zimbabweans have paid their respects at the Tsvangirai home in the capital .
The outpouring of sympathy is evidence of support for Tsvangirai , but also represents a release for emotions that have been building up over months of economic collapse and political unrest that has seen hundreds of activists jailed , tortured and killed .
Zimbabwe 's unity government faces the world 's highest official inflation rate , a hunger crisis that has left most of its people dependent on foreign handouts , and a cholera epidemic that is blamed on the collapse of a once enviable health and sanitation system .
The United Nations said yesterday the number of cholera deaths had topped 4,000 , with more than 89,000 cases ."
2009-03-10,"Zimbabwe 's prime minister , Morgan Tsvangirai , is recovering from a road accident that claimed the life of his wife Susan last Friday .
Tsvangirai has declared that there was no foul play involved , pouring cold water on raging rumours that the accident was an assassination attempt orchestrated by Robert Mugabe .
However , rumours and conspiracy theories about a Mugabe - ordered assassination attempt will continue to swirl because of Zanu - PF 's reputation for surreptitious , devious and ruthless machinations .
Zimbabwe has a long history of prominent political figures –
Mugabe 's rivals particularly – who have been involved in mysterious car mishaps .
Car accidents that proved fatal include , among others , Josiah Tongogara , commander of Zanu - PF 's guerilla army against Rhodesian rule in 1979 ; Sydney Malunga in 1994 ; Christopher Ushewokunze in 1995 ; Moven Mahachi and Border Gezi in 2001 ; and Elliot Manyika in 2008 .
Other political rivals of Mugabe , such as Edison Zvobgo , survived unexplained car accidents .
For many Zimbabweans the history of Mugabe 's opponents falling victim to curious road accidents lends credence to their conspiracies about a failed political assassination on Tsvangirai .
It is also worth recalling that in the late 1990s Tsvangirai resisted being thrown from the 10th floor of Harare 's Chester building by Zanu - PF sympathisers .
Tsvangirai has been shot at , arrested on trumped up treason charges , harassed and demonised by Zanu - PF endlessly .
When Tsvangirai was savagely beaten by Zimbabwean police in 2007 for attending a public prayer meeting Mugabe remarked that he "" deserved "" the beating .
Senior security officials , who for years vowed not to salute Tsvangirai because he did not take part in the country 's liberation war , have been recalcitrant elements since the unity government 's formation .
Was last week 's accident the work of Tsvangirai 's foes in the security sector ?
No one has the answer to this burning question .
The truck that collided with Tsvangirai 's vehicle belongs to a contractor working for US Aid .
In December 2008 a different US Aid driver was accused of shooting Zimbabwe 's air force commander , Perence Shiri – the man who led the mass killings in Zimbabwe 's Matabeleland province during the 1980s .
This has led to some local politicians such as Jonathan Moyo calling for an investigation of US Aid activities in Zimbabwe .
There are claims the lorry driver fell asleep at the steering wheel while driving .
Others claim that the driver was trying to avoid a hump on the road when the collision occurred .
Some allege that the truck driver was endeavouring to avoid a pothole .
The conflicting accounts and queer coincidences fan conspiracy theories and suspicions .
Tsvangirai 's accident will be clouded by suspicion for years .
The accident will increase the air of distrust between both MDC and Zanu - PF in the unity government .
It also illuminates an important theme about Zimbabwean politics since 2000 , which is its unpredictable , unexplainable and conspiracy - laden nature .
Predictability , rationality , formal institutions , good governance processes and the rule of law have been undermined by political violence , arbitrariness and economic failure .
Take for instance the recently renewed farm seizures , the 2005 urban clean up , and the month - long delay in releasing the final vote count in the 2008 presidential election and the accompanying violence .
The conspiracy theories and distrust surrounding Tsvangirai 's accident must be seen as symptomatic of a political climate that remains as volatile as ever ."
2009-04-03,"Zimbabwe 's new unity government has sparked public outcry by accepting a succession of perks including a "" retreat "" to a luxury resort at Victoria Falls this weekend and a fleet of $ 50,000 Mercedes vehicles for ministers while the vast majority struggles to afford basic commodities .
The perception of officials feathering their nests is particularly awkward for former opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai and his allies in the unity government , who spent years championing the lot of ordinary Zimbabweans during the economic collapse presided over by Robert Mugabe .
It is also likely to raise questions about the government 's spending priorities , coming just days after it issued an appeal for billions of dollars .
Officially billed as a brainstorming session on how to take the country forward , the weekend retreat will take place at a tourist resort famed for its five - star safari lodges and the spectacular "" Mosi - I - Tunya "" waterfalls , the "" smoke that thunders "" in the local Shona language .
Many Zimbabweans see the trip as another junket for the politically privileged .
"" It 's just spitting in peoples ' faces at a time when the cities are suffering and much of the countryside is starving , "" said Dumisani Moyo , 39 , an office worker in the capital Harare .
The government has been quoted as saying the retreat will promote tourism , particularly as most foreign visitors have forsaken Zimbabwe for Zambia 's side of the falls .
But criticism came from the most unlikely of sources : the slavishly pro - president Mugabe state - owned Herald daily newspaper .
In a rare show of dissent its political editor Mabasa Sasa wrote a column earlier this week asking why politicians needed to spend "" untold sums "" of precious foreign exchange to wine , dine and talk on the peoples ' behalf when they could stay in the capital Harare .
Satirising the bon viveur politicians ' new taste for luxury in a rebuke all the more stinging for its unexpectedness , Sasa said : "" It would be interesting to find out how high the bar tab will be considering the penchant for Chivas Regal and other exotically named whiskies and cognacs that people acquire when someone starts addressing them as Shefu [ chief ] "" .
Barely seven weeks ago many of the ministers expected to attend were in opposition fighting for their political lives or facing the truncheons of president Robert Mugabe 's security services .
But the excursion is the culmination of a series of perks .
These include the new government 's self - award of one Mercedes - Benz E - class for every minister at a time when most Zimbabweans are struggling to afford basic commodities such as cooking oil and the national maize staple mealie - meal .
Only one politician , MDC MP and minister for education David Coltart , refused the Benz .
He said a Mercedes was not practical for negotiating the potholed roads of rural constituencies .
Zimbabwe 's economic and financial needs meanwhile remain critical .
The regional Southern African Development Community announced this week that it would assist Zimbabwe in trying to raise up to US$ 8.3bn to rebuild its shattered economy .
The reforming MDC finance minister Tendai Biti said the country urgently needed US$ 2bn in aid inflows within the next two weeks to meet its debt obligations and pay civil servants .
Important , if modest , economic and political reforms have already taken place under the combined auspices of Mugabe 's Zanu - PF party and their one - time enemies the Movement for Democratic change .
But there are also deep misgivings .
Christopher Goche , 35 , a taxi driver and MDC supporter , said he was worried that politicians were "" feathering their nests when there is a long way to go "" .
Despite the national outpouring of sympathy for prime minister Tsvangirai , whose wife died in a car accident last month , there are fears that the former trade unionist is becoming co - opted by Mugabe much like one - time opposition leader Joshua Nkomo was in the 1980s .
Nkomo , once the president 's most popular rival , was incorporated into a Mugabe - led government under Zimbabwe 's "" unity accord "" in 1987 .
"" For the moment things are stable but one ca n't mistake growing disenchantment with the new unity government barely a month after its inception ...
Tsvangirai is operating under a shadow of Nkomo , "" said Dr Ibbo Mandaza , a former Zanu - PF politician and Harare - based analyst ."
2009-04-05,"The Zimbabwean prime minister , Morgan Tsvangirai , has suffered a second family tragedy within a month when his three - year - old grandson died in a swimming pool accident weeks after Tsvangirai 's wife was killed in a car crash .
The grandson , Sean , was staying at Tsvangirai 's house in Strathaven , a suburb of the capital , Harare , when he was found drowned in the family pool on Saturday afternoon .
"" The boy had wandered off and was found later in the pool of the house , "" said James Maridadi , Tsvangirai 's spokesman .
Sean was the son of Garikai Tsvangirai .
The family , who live in Canada , had only flown into Zimbabwe for the funeral of Garikai 's mother , Susan , who was killed in a car accident on 6 March .
Garikai and his wife , Lilian , had been due to return to Canada on Sunday .
Sean is to be buried next to his grandmother in her home village of Buhera .
The prime minister and leader of the Movement for Democratic Change , who had only recently returned to work after being injured in the car crash , cut short a government retreat in Victoria Falls to return to the capital .
People in Harare , a bastion of MDC support , said they were saddened by the news .
Duncan Tembe , 29 , who works at an internet shop , said : "" It 's unbelievable .
It 's too tragic , too much for one man to take . ""
Nearby in the central business district , a Sunday service at El Shadai church offered prayers for the Tsvangirai family .
The toddler 's death will raise new concerns over Tsvangirai 's preparedness to push through reforms in Zimbabwe so soon after his wife 's death and barely a month after he was sworn in to lead the country 's unity government .
Besides trying to fix the economy , Tsvangirai is expected to take a key role in fashioning a new constitution , implementing a land audit , attempting to stop land invasions and organising fresh elections within the next 18 months .
On all of these issues Tsvangirai will have to assert his authority over the president , Robert Mugabe , if he is to win over sceptical western donors – particularly the US and EU – who want to see a sustained period of reform before giving aid .
According to his spokesman , Tsvangirai 's ministerial colleagues from MDC and Zanu - PF , including Mugabe , sent a note of collective condolence for his loss .
It said : "" Our deepest condolences .
Be strong . """
2009-04-18,"Morgan Tsvangirai is sitting in the converted maid 's quarters that serves as his office , at his home in the Harare suburbs .
It overlooks the garden with the pool where his two - year - old grandson Shawn drowned a fortnight ago , only a month after his wife Susan was killed in a car crash .
In his first interview since the double tragedy , he describes the depths of his grief and pays a touching tribute to his wife of 31 years .
"" I do n't know how to replace her , "" he says .
"" It 's almost unimaginable that anyone could ever take her place , with the same qualities and the same love and care . ""
The deep voice cracks as he struggles to hold back tears . ""
Susan and I were married for 31 years .
As you can imagine , that made her almost a lifelong companion .
She was humble .
Not very pretentious at all . ""
He seems to be missing a cufflink but does not say so , just fiddles with his shirt under his jacket sleeve . ""
Sometimes you become totally absent - minded .
You 're missing something , looking everywhere for it . ""
He does n't say the next bit : "" Susan would have known just where I 'd put them . ""
Instead he says : "" And then you realise you are not feeling her presence . ""
She died two days after his maiden speech to Zimbabwe 's parliament as prime minister , as he embarked on a coalition government with President Robert Mugabe .
Shawn drowned on 4 April when , like many toddlers , he slipped out of sight of his parents and into the pool in the garden .
It is early morning in Strathaven , where Tsvangirai lives .
The battered red Movement for Democratic Change campaign bus stands in the drive , looking spent .
Security staff are cleaning cars that are already shiny .
Tsvangirai 's office walls are lined with political biographies and MDC campaign posters .
He looks dapper in his dark suit as he speaks slowly , carefully choosing his words .
The couple , both from modest , Shona working - class homes , met in 1976 .
Susan was visiting her uncle in Bindura , where Tsvangirai , the eldest of nine children , had risen from plant operator to foreman after only two years at the nickel mine .
They married in 1978 and Edwin , the first of their six children , was born .
At independence in 1980 , when Mugabe , then 56 , became prime minister , Tsvangirai was 28 and Susan 22 .
A mineworkers ' leader , he joined the victorious Zimbabwe African National Union - Patriotic Front ( Zanu - PF ) but built his political career in the trade union movement .
By 1989 , at the age of 37 , he was head of the Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions .
Ever in the background , attentive to her husband and his growing retinue , Susan - the kind of woman who would always have a needle and thread - was already "" mother "" to many . ""
She was a solid pillar behind my career .
She touched a lot of people in a very profound way , "" he says with a sudden depth to his timbre that defies grief .
When Tsvangirai launched the MDC in 1999 , Zimbabwe had lost its beloved first lady , Sally Mugabe , who died from kidney failure in 1992 .
Robert had married the young Grace , who was already showing excessive spending habits .
Zimbabweans looked to Susan , a churchgoing Methodist full of restraint , as a future "" amai "" ( mother ) in the Sally mould .
"" She was a very clear adviser on many issues both in the party and in the family .
Losing her is a real personal loss .
People have said , ' Do this , do that ' to overcome the grief .
It 's only natural for people to feel sorry , but really the question is that it is a personal life experience that I have to go through on a daily basis . ""
His early mornings have just got a bit lonelier with the departure of relatives who had come home for Susan 's funeral and Easter .
Among them were the couple 's second son , Garikai , 29 , and his wife Lillian .
They were the parents of Shawn , who had been living with Susan and Tsvangirai while they got settled in Canada .
Tsvangirai is not one to drop God into the conversation , even less the restive Shona ancestors whom some people believe must be haunting Zimbabwe if their prime minister has been so cruelly damned by two bereavements . ""
When Shawn died the immediate reaction from me was , ' Why me ? '
We thought that with the passing of Susan we had come to accept the reality .
But Shawn 's death was the more devastating for Gari and Lillian .
It was another bolt from the blue .
The boy was just a lovely boy . ""
No one suspects foul play in Shawn 's death .
But questions remain over the incident on 6 March that saw an oncoming lorry swerve into the southbound lane of the Harare - Masvingo road , forcing the Toyota Land Cruiser in which the Tsvangirais were travelling into a manoeuvre that killed Susan and slightly injured the other three occupants .
It was four days before Tsvangirai 's 57th birthday and the couple were on their way to their rural home in Buhera , 140 miles southeast of Harare , at the end of a whirlwind period that had started with Tsvangirai 's swearing - in on 11 February and ended with his maiden speech .
In a country where the regime has often been accused of killing its foes in faked car accidents - and given that Tsvangirai has survived three known assassination attempts since 1997 - questions are inevitably being asked .
Indeed , Zimbabwe 's cabinet has voted to invite a senior foreign judge to head an inquiry into the accident .
But the road to Masvingo is notorious .
Last Thursday 29 people died in a bus accident on the same road .
Tsvangirai insists they were the victims of a real accident and he dismisses talk of the hidden hand of restive ancestral spirits . ""
In our custom they say all sorts of things but , really , it was an accident . ""
He admits that his security arrangements are lacking .
"" We are taking measures to prevent a recurrence of such an incident .
But the thing is that if the United States president can be shot , who am I to have a foolproof security arrangement ? ""
He is talking more animatedly now .
Tsvangirai is a man who will bury his grief in his work , and he has plenty to do .
The MDC 's decision in January to enter a South African - brokered coalition with Zanu - PF has been a leap of faith into a world of non - believers .
Preceded by 10 years of farm invasions , beatings , torture and killings of his supporters , flawed elections and his own two treason trials , the marriage with 86-year - old President Mugabe 's regime seems doomed .
He understands the "" cynical "" western view that Zanu - PF entered the coalition only to use the MDC to obtain the lifting of US sanctions and European travel restrictions on the elite .
But he denies he is being used : "" We are the majority party , how can we be used ?
Western scepticism is justifiable because nearly 30 years of one man creates an impression that there will never be change .
But let me tell you there is an irreversible process happening and no one wants to go back .
The international community must accept that the transition is not an event , it is a slow process that requires changes of mindsets and cultures of governance .
It is going to take some time . ""
But is there time ?
Tsvangirai and his ministers have inherited a situation in which more than half the population is on emergency food aid , the health system is limping on with drugs provided by Britain and state schools are only functioning because of foreign aid .
Investors are not returning , because Tsvangirai still has not secured either guarantees of transparency in landownership and the judiciary , or the removal of Gideon Gono , the central bank governor who vandalised the economy .
The recent mini - scandal in the wake of ministers accepting new Mercedes cars was a clear example of the compromised position in which Tsvangirai now finds himself .
These days , as a leading member of the unity government , he rarely criticises Mugabe .
Three political prisoners , including his own former adviser , Gandhi Mudzingwa , are battling to clear their names after enduring four months of captivity on apparently trumped - up charges .
Mugabe last week removed the communications portfolio , including oversight over surveillance , from Nelson Chamisa , the MDC minister of information and communications technology , and gave it to the Zanu - PF - controlled Transport Ministry .
Tsvangirai insists : ""
Gandhi , Gono , Johannes Tomana [ the attorney - general ] and
Chamisa 's portfolio erosion are all outstanding issues that will be dealt with at our meeting to review the global political agreement . ""
That meeting was due two weeks ago , then last week , but has not happened .
The party says a meeting between Mugabe and Tsangvirai is now scheduled for Monday .
Tsvangirai 's supporters point to elements of progress .
Hyperinflation was halted overnight last month by scrapping the Zimbabwe dollar and replacing it with hard currency .
In another sign of progress , an all - party committee has been created to draft a constitution due to be put to a referendum next July , before elections in as little as two years .
The unity government has found the funds to pay soldiers , the army , civil servants and MPs $ 100 a month .
Imminently , in a significant signal of trust , the World Bank is expected to announce a post - conflict "" pre - arrears grant "" of about $ 100 m to the Zimbabwean treasury .
Tsvangirai claims his party 's democratic ideals will not be subsumed in the machinery of Mugabe 's ruthless regime .
But even when talking about sanctions , the president 's hobby - horse , he does not condemn him .
"" There are those who say , ' Let 's speak with one voice to get sanctions removed . '
I say , let 's act with one voice on unnecessary diversions like farm invasions that are blocking our path to building international confidence . ""
The danger is that Tsvangirai has responsibility without power .
He carries a burden not only of grief but of tremendous expectations .
And as he faces up to the most complex chapter of his life , he must do so , tragically , without Susan ."
2009-04-24,"Up - to - date enough to identify Morgan Tsvangirai as Zimbabwe 's prime minister , this "" concise guide to problems of English spelling and usage "" has been thoroughly revised since its first appearance in 1991 .
Initially , Bryson 's motivation seems to be a furious determination to expose error , exemplified by his splendidly grumpy insistence that "" data is a plural , although this fact is widely disregarded "" .
Yet this impression of the former Times subeditor scrawling "" wrong ! "" all over his breakfast newspaper gradually fades in a book that is sane , lucid and unpedantic in its grammatical rulings .
Throughout , Bryson is self - effacing , reining in the wit displayed in his travel writing , although he says the selection policy reflects his "" interests , experiences and blind spots "" .
The last appear to include much of popular culture , with no guidance , for instance , on spelling the Coen brothers , Mötley Crüe or Guus Hiddink .
Perhaps footballers are missing because their careers are brief - but if so , why the comparative readiness to find room for female tennis players ?"
2009-04-27,"Morgan Tsvangirai , Zimbabwe 's prime minister , said on Saturday there was no going back on the unity government he formed with President Robert Mugabe .
He and his finance minister Tendai Biti , the Movement for Democratic Change 's other key man in government , have begun to challenge donor countries to remove the benchmarks for aid to Zimbabwe imposed on the Mugabe regime and start channelling funds through the ministry now controlled by his MDC faction .
Mr Biti arrives in London this week with a demand which will challenge current British policy .
He wants $ 8bn from Europe and the US to reconstruct the country that the other half of his government has plundered and could still continue to do so .
Mr Biti 's tour poses a number of questions .
Is the worst really over and should Zimbabwe now be treated as a post - conflict society in need of aid upfront ?
Or does conflict still bubble under the surface in the form of continuing arrests of MDC activists , farm invasions , and conflict over ministerial posts and provincial appointments ?
Does the risk of not supporting that part of the government which Mr Tsvangirai controls outweigh the risk of having the money siphoned off by the likes of Gideon Gono , the central banker who has already admitted plundering the hard currency accounts of private businesses ?
How much has changed since the unity government took over and how fragile the progress ?
These are difficult questions to answer after only two months .
Good news is thin on the ground .
The generals who unleashed the reign of terror last year against the MDC in general and Mr Biti in person ( he was arrested and charged with treason ) are still in business .
There are doubts about whether the collision which killed Susan Tsvangirai was a genuine road accident and not a botched assassination attempt .
There are renewed fears for Mr Tsvangirai 's life .
The generals are more independent of Mr Mugabe than they were , but both need the other .
Without Mr Mugabe , Zanu - PF could well fall apart , so he is still their best asset .
Sensing this , Mr Mugabe could simply be keeping his attack dogs on a leash .
Should the unity government fail to deliver the international cash and the orderly exit he thinks is his due , Mr Mugabe may be tempted to cash in his insurance policy and let the generals announce a military coup , which would be a first for Zimbabwe .
On the other hand , the arrangement between Mr Mugabe and his generals is inherently unstable .
The generals can no longer be as confident as they were last year that they can act with impunity against the MDC .
For one thing , their orders may not be fulfilled by their subordinates as both the army and ruling party are hollowing out as institutions of state .
For another , there are signs that the loyalty of soldiers is transferring from Zanu - PF , which failed to ensure their payment , to Mr Tsvangirai and Mr Biti who at least tried to pay them .
That was one effect of a decision they made to allow the use of payments in foreign currency .
The unity government is not so much a power - sharing arrangement as it is a continuing power - struggle .
And one in which Mr Tsvangirai has only two real assets , the finance ministry and control over the lower house of parliament .
It is essential not only to get the aid to the people who need it most , by using UN agencies and NGOs .
It is also important to deliver aid in a way which bolsters the MDC and pragmatists within Zanu - PF who see the current arrangement as a transition to free and fair elections and a new era .
This does not mean abandoning targeted sanctions , but it may mean engaging more directly with the unity government .
Some of the generals may get away with a farm and a hard currency pension .
Conflicts in Africa do not have a redemptive ending and the end is never neat .
But the paramount aim is to ensure that the conflict does end .
Justice , for the moment , must bide its time ."
2009-05-03,"State schools in Zimbabwe have been ordered to slash their fees in a bid to stave off the collapse of the country 's education system , it was reported today .
The move came after Morgan Tsvangirai , the prime minister , admitted that the unity government he formed with his rival , President Robert Mugabe , was "" broke "" and could not meet union demands for higher wages .
Zimbabwe 's Sunday Mail newspaper said David Coltart , the education minister , had recommended that state schools should cut their fees when they open for a new term on Tuesday because many parents could not afford them .
"" I can not divulge the figures at the moment because the recommendations are going to Mugabe , Tsvangirai and deputy prime minister Arthur Mutambara on Monday , "" he was quoted as saying . ""
However , what we want are substantial cuts .
"" The government set school fees in state schools at between $ 20 and $ 280 a term two months ago , but many parents have failed to pay , citing low wages and high living costs .
Coltart added : "" When the fees were set in March , the assumption was that we would get balance of payments support [ to ] kickstart the economy .
But this has not materialised and parents are worse off than before .
"" The malaise in Zimbabwe 's education system , once the envy of Africa , is a telling measure of the country 's steep decline .
In the early years of independence under Mugabe , who began his career as a teacher , 96 % of children attended school .
Mugabe has since presided over an exodus of tens of thousands of teachers , which has left many schools shut and fears that a generation will grow up without education .
Zimbabwe was criticised last week by Amnesty International for failing to protect teachers from harassment and beatings during last year 's elections .
The country 's top university in Harare has been closed for nearly a year , with broken toilets and no piped water .
The state media reported yesterday that only 68 students out of 12,000 had paid their full fees of about $ 300 when the college tried to reopen in March , and it was now appealing for foreign assistance .
Zimbabwe said last week that it had secured $ 400 m in credit lines from African states to revive some of its ailing industries , many of which are operating at below 20 % of their capacity .
Trade unions have called for a monthly minimum wage of $ 450 and threatened to go on strike if their demands are not met .
But Tsvangirai told a May Day rally in Harare that no state worker , including Mugabe , was earning more than $ 100 a month . ""
This government is broke , and we are only able to pay the $ 100 allowance , "" he said , adding that this would "" graduate into a proper salary "" when the situation improved and more people were paying tax .
"" We have been in office for less than three months .
I plead with you to please give us time . ""
Unemployment is estimated at 90 % , while numerous hospitals are closed and roads and sewers have fallen into disrepair .
Zimbabwe has asked for billions of dollars to rescue the economy , but western countries have demanded broad reforms before restoring aid .
There is an increasing belief among analysts that the unity government appears to be stalling , with Mugabe still holding the whip hand .
They cite as evidence his continued detention of political activists , renewed farm invasions and the seizure of the department of communications from Tsvangirai 's Movement for Democratic Change ."
2009-05-10,"Morgan Tsvangirai , Zimbabwe 's prime minister , has insisted that President Robert Mugabe is "" part of the solution "" to the country 's chronic problems as he seeks to win over sceptical donors in the west .
Tsvangirai declared Zimbabwe open for business and eager for investment and described his first 100 days in office , blighted by personal tragedy , as "" the most wonderful and awful "" of his life .
Critics argue that Mugabe has been winning the battle of wills against his rival since they signed a power - sharing agreement in February .
They point to the president 's control of key ministries and the continuing detention of political prisoners and seizures of white - owned farms .
Anxieties that Tsvangirai has conceded too much ground , inadvertently legitimising his rival , were voiced when he attended a public forum with exiled Zimbabweans at South Africa 's University of the Witwatersrand last week .
One member of the audience declared , to applause , that Mugabe "" has almost single - handedly destroyed the country , lost two elections and yet is still there …
Why do you have to sleep with the enemy ?
Is not the simple solution that Mugabe goes ? ""
Tsvangirai responded with a message partly aimed at doubters in the west : "" Do n't be too paranoid about your obsession with Robert Mugabe because he is n't going to go away ; he is there .
Robert Mugabe was part of the problem but he is also part of the solution , whether you like it or not . ""
The prime minister said his Movement for Democratic Change , and Mugabe 's Zanu - PF , had resolved nearly all the outstanding issues and that an announcement would be made on Tuesday .
It could prove a watershed in what has become a delicate waiting game for the west .
Britain and other countries provided about $ 670 m ( £ 444 m ) in emergency humanitarian aid to Zimbabwe in 2008 and have pledged more this year , but they have demanded that certain preconditions be met before they will deliver long - term development support .
They were urged to give the unity government the benefit of the doubt last week by the Elders , a group of eminent global leaders including the former United Nations secretary general Kofi Annan , and the former South African president Nelson Mandela .
The Elders said they believed the risks of inaction by donors outweighed the challenges of delivering increased aid .
The group 's chairman , Archbishop Desmond Tutu , said : "" The inclusive government needs more support to ensure that it can initiate the urgent stabilisation and early recovery programmes that the people so desperately need .
Now is not the time for donors to take a ' wait and see ' approach .
This is the best chance Zimbabweans have had for peace and prosperity in decades . ""
The Elders said more funds were needed to provide teaching materials , cover school fees , support local food production and rehabilitate the water and sanitation infrastructure , especially after a devastating cholera outbreak .
There is some evidence of increased willingness among investors to gamble on Zimbabwe stabilising .
Neighbouring countries and two African banks have pledged $ 650 m in credit lines .
The International Monetary Fund said last week that its board had decided to partially lift the suspension of technical assistance .
Patrice Motsepe , a Soweto - born businessman dubbed South Africa 's first black billionaire , visited Harare last month and told Mugabe that , with reassurances , capital would flow in .
"" I 'm very confident and optimistic , Mr President , that two years from now , there will be huge investment in this country , "" he said .
But the government is still far short of its target of $ 2bn in emergency funding and $ 8bn in the long term to help stabilise an economy ravaged by a decade of hyperinflation , unemployment above 90 % and political violence .
Tendai Biti , the finance minister , made the case for the lifting of western sanctions during recent visits to Washington and London .
He said : "" There are some western colleagues who still have bones to chew with us , and we understand that .
We welcome African institutions that want to help us . ""
In an interview with South Africa 's Sunday Times , Tsvangirai meanwhile reflected on "" the most wonderful and awful "" time of his life .
His first 100 days as prime minister were marked by the deaths of his wife and his grandson in separate accidents .
"" It has been quite an experience , from the formation of an inclusive government to the trepidation about what 's going to happen , and the personal loss , "" he said .
"" It is only 100 days so far , but this government has consolidated .
We have our problems – who does n't ? .
"" Some people are not happy with everything that 's happening , but sceptics are now the minority .
The majority believe we are on the right track
and I believe so myself .
""
The newspaper predicted that , in his review in parliament on Tuesday , Tsvangirai would detail the ongoing torture and beatings of political detainees and continuing looting and farm invasions .
He would thank the British government for its assistance in paying retention allowances to doctors and nurses so state hospitals could be reopened , the Sunday Times said ."
2009-05-22,"Zimbabwe 's prime minister , Morgan Tsvangirai , signalled a new openness today when he predicted foreign donors and media would soon feel confident operating in the country .
Tsvangirai , who took office 100 days ago , said his personal relationship with President Robert Mugabe was "" workable and respectful "" and insisted their government was moving in the right direction .
Western governments including Britain and the US are withholding aid and demanding broad political reforms before they are willing to help Zimbabwe reach its $ 8.3bn ( £ 5.2bn ) funding target .
But Tsvangirai believes there has been a shift in attitudes among foreign donors .
"" There has been some positive engagement with them , "" he told South Africa 's Star newspaper today .
"" They all accept that there is change taking place and that change must be consolidated .
They will eventually open [ their purses ] . ""
Tsvangirai said that foreign journalists , who have previously been banned or harassed and arrested , were now free to report in Zimbabwe .
"" There 's no reason why these news agencies and groups should not be in the country , "" Tsvangirai said .
He cited the appointment of 10 provincial governors as progress in the government .
The positions will be divided between the parties and five vacant ambassadorial posts will be filled by his Movement for Democratic Change and a smaller coalition partner .
In another U - turn , Mugabe would allow opposition politician Roy Bennett to be sworn in as deputy agriculture minister , he said .
Despite Tsvangirai 's optimism , sceptics argue Mugabe has retained control of Zimbabwe 's key ministries , including communications .
The editor and news editor of the Zimbabwe Independent newspaper were arrested last week on the orders of the attorney general .
Invasions of white - owned farms have continued and some health experts warn of renewed outbreaks of cholera ."
2009-05-30,"The prime minister , Morgan Tsvangirai , said yesterday his efforts to restore democratic freedoms and the rule of law to his country had so far failed .
Tsvangirai took his Movement for Democratic Change into a coalition government with autocratic President Robert Mugabe in February to end the country 's political deadlock and economic collapse .
But he gave the party 's annual convention a bleak assessment of Zimbabwe 's situation and said hard - liners backing Mugabe were frustrating progress .
"" We have not yet succeeded in restoring the rule of law ... our people do not live free from fear , hunger and poverty , "" he said .
But Tsvangirai has so far shown no sign that he will pull the MDC out of the coalition in protest ."
2009-06-01,"He is commonly regarded as one of Africa 's most ruthless tyrants , unleashing persecution and violence on anyone who dares challenge his iron rule .
So it came as a surprise to Zimbabwe 's main opposition when they discovered that President Robert Mugabe has the manners of a Victorian English gentleman .
The Movement for Democratic Change , led by prime minister Morgan Tsvangirai , is more than three months into a fraught power - sharing agreement with Mugabe 's Zanu - PF party .
Tendai Biti , who is effectively Tsvangirai 's No 2 , said it was hard to equate the real Mugabe , who came to power in 1980 , with the degradation and despotism of Zimbabwe 's recent past .
Biti , who is finance minister in the unity government , said : "" When you have private meetings with Robert Mugabe , as I have , you are actually shocked that there 's no connection between this typical British gentleman – well dressed and well spoken – that you talk to , who does n't get flustered and so forth , and everything else that some of us have been fighting throughout our entire lives . ""
Biti added , presumably in jest : "" He 's a British gentleman in a proper Victorian sense .
He should be knighted . ""
The MDC has been criticised for taking a naive approach towards Mugabe , who has retained control of most key ministries in Zimbabwe .
The MDC 's calls for the removal of the central bank governor , Gideon Gono , and the attorney general , Johannes Tomana , have been flatly refused by the 85-year - old president .
Biti 's account was echoed by journalist Heidi Holland , author of Dinner with Mugabe , who conducted the first in - depth interview with him for nearly 30 years .
"" When you get there , he 's just immaculate and understated , "" she said .
"" His whole environment is redolent of his attempts to be a British gentleman . ""
Mugabe grew up in the colonial era .
One of the reasons he 's been so angry and is still so angry is that he 's been rejected by the British .
When I interviewed him in 2007 he had tears in his eyes when he mentioned the British royal family .
The real problem is that he tries to be both an African and a Brit and he ca n't pull it off because they are parallel people and they despise each other . ""
Speaking from Johannesburg , Holland said she believed the MDC had judged Mugabe 's character well . ""
I think Morgan Tsvangirai has played him very cleverly because he has treated him with respect , and if there 's one thing Mugabe wants it 's respect for what he describes as his sacrifice and suffering . ""
She said that when Mugabe and Tsvangirai first had dinner together last summer "" they got on famously "" .
Questions remain over how much power Mugabe still exerts over the internal factions of Zanu - PF .
A local news agency reported last week that Zanu - PF had finally set up a committee to oversee the process of finding his successor .
It said senior party members were shocked at the prospect of the end of the Mugabe era , which threatens to plunge the party into civil war .
The MDC is watching the situation closely .
Biti warned : "" The biggest threat to this country 's peace and stability is the unresolved issue of succession in Zanu - PF .
In Africa , when you have big men , big men fill up more space , and unless the transition is managed , and unless the party reforms fundamentally , when the big man goes , it collapses . ""
He also responded to critics of the power - sharing agreement , who point to farm invasions and arrests of lawyers and journalists . ""
This is a coalition government , "" he said .
"" Any coalition government , like any marriage , goes through its pendulum - setting period .
You 're trying to find the balances .
That 's what we 're going through at the present moment . """
2009-06-18,"Press coverage of the current visit of Zimbabwe 's prime minister , Morgan Tsvangirai , to Europe and the United States in the slavishly pro - Mugabe Zimbabwean media makes interesting reading .
Penned as it is by die - hard Zanu ( PF ) loyalists , it gives an insight into the workings of the mind of a power - crazed monster – intent only upon winning the next election , no matter what .
Tsvangirai 's trip has been a triumph .
It marks the welcoming back into the fold of the international community of a pariah state .
He has been feted , honoured , saluted and lauded by the world 's most powerful leaders .
Much has been made of his personal courage and democratic credentials .
Millions have been pledged for humanitarian aid .
But The Herald has done nothing but criticise the trip – making much of the Tsvangirai 's "" failure "" to fill the state coffers with western money .
A recent opinion piece by The Herald 's political editor –
The rise of a predatory state – accused Tsvangirai of touring western capitals rather than sorting out the problems at home .
It also claims the new government is doing little to get agriculture back on its feet and is putting human rights and democracy ahead of putting food on the table . ""
The inclusive government would have us believe that if [ Johannes ] Tomana ( the Attorney General ) is fired and [ Jestina ] Mukoko ( a human rights activist ) is freed then we will have food on our tables and money in our pockets , "" said The Herald .
"" Where is the state while farmers scrounge around for resources so that they can feed the nation ? ""
This is a fundamentally flawed argument , say analysts , given that the previous Zanu ( PF ) government oversaw the destruction of the country 's agricultural production , the collapse of the economy and the ruination of relationships with the west .
They say the constant sniping at Tsvangirai and his officials demonstrates that Zanu ( PF ) is keener than ever to see the unity government fail .
But why ?
Tsvangirai 's trip has raised millions in new money .
For obvious reasons , none of this money is going directly into government coffers .
This means the Zanu ( PF ) hawks , whose survival depends on the party patronage system run directly from the Reserve Bank under Gideon Gono , are out of pocket .
For Mugabe and his generals , Zimbabwe 's survival has nothing to do with the survival of Zimbabweans .
Therefore Tsvangirai is of no use to them .
They successfully used him to regain legitimacy for Mugabe as president of Zimbabwe , and thought they could use him to get the west to withdraw targeted measures against him and his cronies .
But it did n't .
And now , the next election is uppermost in their minds .
So they need to portray Tsvangirai as a failure .
The spin is fascinating : Tsvangirai has failed to get money for the new government ( because Mugabe continues to refuse to honour the power - sharing agreement they signed in February ) ; Tsvangirai has failed to get sanctions lifted ( because Mugabe persists in human rights abuses ) ; Tsvangirai has failed to put food on the table and medicine in the hospitals ( because Mugabe maintains a stranglehold on all economic activity through the patronage system ) ; Tsvangirai has failed to attract foreign investment despite swanning about in the global corridors of power ( because Mugabe continues with the land invasions and nationalisation of mines and refuse to allow a return to the rule of law ) .
And so it goes – laughable from a free press vantage point ; tragically believable to the relatively unsophisticated voting populace who remain in the country after an estimated four million with any form of education , skill and expertise have voted with their feet ."
2009-06-24,"These have been difficult days in London for Zimbabwe 's prime minister , Morgan Tsvangirai , as he makes the case that his country is changing .
Fellow Zimbabweans shouted him down in Southwark Cathedral when he said things were good enough for them to come home .
Then he had to handle sceptical British ministers and media interviewers and urge them to drop their fixation with seeing Robert Mugabe punished .
So it was not surprising that , at one of his final engagements , a speech to Chatham House members on Tuesday , he still found himself "" appealing for support "" , as he put it frankly .
"" I am not a Mandela , "" he pointed out with a smile , but there were important parallels with South Africa .
It 's easily forgotten now but the transition to democracy in South Africa was not smooth . ""
It took four years and two months to get a legitimate government after Mandela 's release and another two - years to craft a world - class constitution , "" he argued .
Close to 20,000 people were killed in those four years .
By implication , Zimbabwe 's recent violence is not unprecedented .
What was unprecedented , he claimed , was the way Zimbabweans mounted a sustained non - violent protest last year "" against a post - colonial regime and a flamboyant tyranny and that struggle has largely been won .
"" The word "" largely "" is the nub .
Tsvangirai repeatedly tried to square the circle .
On the one hand , he claimed the transition to a new constitution and free elections was already irreversible .
On the other hand , he argued that only through today 's national unity government and a soft landing for Zanu - PF 's leadership can the transition become irreversible .
Wishful thinking or tentative reality ?
How can anyone be sure ?
The crucial ingredient is an amnesty for Mugabe and his henchmen .
Unpopular though the line is in Britain and for many Zimbabweans who have had to flee their country , Tsvangirai is right .
"" We have no intention of ostracising or vilifying any Zimbabwean .
We seek no retribution , "" he told Chatham House .
"" We have to accommodate them ; we have to address their concerns .
And we have to help them to understand that there is greater good for both the victim and the perpetrator in the end . ""
Think Mandela and De Klerk .
Think Tsvangirai and Mugabe .
Think reconciliation .
It is a complex case , made more complex by the fact that Mugabe is not a colonial racist or a settler with European origins .
Indeed , as Tsvangirai put it ( using words that many others of his generation could echo ) : "" In 1980 Robert Mugabe was my hero "" .
But the man who had led Zimbabwe 's liberation struggle had gone on to become a champion of exclusion .
Without naming Mugabe in this part of his speech , Tsvangirai compared post - colonial Zimbabwe with a system of political rather than racial apartheid : "" One group believes in separate development , oiled by a system of patronage and keeping others out as a survival mechanism , while the entire country cries out for a better deal "" .
Tsvangirai is no Mandela , but nor is he a Thabo Mbeki – prone to bitterness .
When I last saw him in 2000 during Zimbabwe 's parliamentary elections , which were only marginally less bloody than last year 's futile second round , he seemed too sunny and trusting to be a successful political leader .
Nine years of struggle since then , complete with imprisonment , beatings and false accusations of treason , as well as the recent tragedy of his wife 's death and his lucky survival in a mysterious car crash ( which he does n't blame on Mugabe 's people ) , have clearly steeled him .
His genial temperament has become a strength , not a weakness .
He appears to bear no grudges . ""
Do I trust Mugabe ?
"" he said Tuesday afternoon .
"" It 's too early to say I trust him completely , but when we disagree , we do so respectfully .
During the negotiations , there were acrimonious exchanges but we all realise we have to make this work .
""
Much of the press and many people in Britain would love nothing better than to see Mugabe arrested and sent to the Hague .
Tsvangirai would be entitled to share that view , but he is bigger and more astute .
He would rather engineer Mugabe 's retreat through democratic and redemptive means .
"" There 's no possibility of a dignified exit without this unity government , "" Tsvangirai argues .
"" This gives him a chance to restore his legacy as Zimbabwe 's founding father and to allow the transition to take place without the country falling back into chaos . ""
Well said , Morgan .
It 's a tough and unpopular line to take , but there is no better way ."
2009-06-25,"In his long years in opposition as leader of the Movement for Democratic Change , Morgan Tsvangirai was abused , hounded , arrested and sometimes beaten by officials and security forces acting on orders from the president , Robert Mugabe .
As Zimbabwe 's prime minister in a power - sharing government , Tsvangirai now finds himself obliged to deal face to face with the man who persecuted him so unceasingly .
It has been a "" dramatic "" experience , he says .
"" It 's too early to say I trust him [ Mugabe ] wholly but where we differ , we differ respectfully , "" Tsvangirai said in London this week .
"" We meet regularly to discuss government business .
I am the last person to defend his past .
But we will work together to improve the country ...
The inclusive government gives him an opportunity to restore his legacy ...
It 's up to him .
"" It was still possible , he said , for Mugabe to make "" a dignified exit "" .
Tsvangirai 's forgiving attitude towards what he called Zimbabwe 's "" flamboyant tyranny "" has elicited little in the way of reciprocal magnanimity during his three - week tour of the US and Europe , which ended in France today .
From Germany to the US to Britain , his appeals for aid and investment met a mixture of suspicion and caution .
Most governments , and many Zimbabwean exiles , continue to question his chances of instituting genuine democratic reform while Mugabe remains in power .
Gordon Brown was more encouraging than many when he met Tsvangirai on Monday , pointing to "" great signs of progress "" and adding £ 5 m to the £ 15 m in humanitarian aid pledged in April .
"" We are prepared to go further in offering more transitional support if the reform programme on the ground gains momentum , "" Brown said .
But like other European leaders , he warned that Britain would not turn a blind eye to continuing human rights abuses , corruption , arbitrary arrests and farm seizures .
"" It [ the power - sharing government ] is beginning to work , although there are plenty of pitfalls .
Mr Mugabe could easily try to go back on his word and grab absolute power again , "" Mark Malloch - Brown , Britain 's Africa minister , told the Times .
Amnesty International also noted that while political violence had lessened , "" the human rights situation remains fragile and the social and economic situation is grim "" .
This wariness is widely shared , as shown by the significant undershoot in the amount of funds Tsvangirai was able to raise .
Before setting out , MDC officials suggested his target was between $ 700 m and $ 1bn .
It 's estimated that the actual take was closer to $ 200 m , including $ 73 m from the US .
Most of the funding will be disbursed through NGOs or international agencies rather than sent directly to Tsvangirai 's government .
All his host governments seem to have given Tsvangirai the same message : if you want more , you must do better .
This could turn out to be a tragically short - sighted approach .
Tsvangirai is already being mocked at home by Zanu - PF opponents and Mugabe toadies for failing to obtain greater western assistance .
This demonstrated both his personal ineffectiveness and his foolhardiness in asking Zimbabwe 's "" enemies "" for help , they say .
The prime minister has agreed an 18-month timetable for political reform with Mugabe .
But this limited period is becoming the measure of Tsvangirai 's ability to deliver broader , overall economic and social improvements .
If he stumbles , the unity government could implode .
And what then ?
Tsvangirai appears more attuned to this danger than some of his western interlocutors , hence the passionate urgency of his appeals .
"" Zimbabwe is in a difficult transition and requires massive moral and material support , "" he told an audience at the Chatham House thinktank . ""
Transitions by their very nature can be extremely difficult periods in a nation 's history ...
We have our own nail - biting challenges as hardliners who realise they are losing their grip on power play opportunistic games designed to frustrate the national sentiment . ""
But his government did not seek to apportion blame , did not seek retribution and would welcome a process of national reconciliation , he said .
And it had achieved much in a short space of time , including reining in inflation , reopening schools and hospitals , embarking on constitutional reform ahead of new elections , and relaxing media controls .
"" I am aware that suspicions abound as to whether the country is likely to slide back in to the past once our former adversaries garner sufficient breathing space , "" he said .
But a permanent , transformational shift was under way .
"" As a society , we were near death , and we have come back to life . ""
Setting aside the past , Britain and the west should have faith in this resurrection ."
2009-06-29,"The following correction was printed in the Guardian 's Corrections and clarifications column , Wednesday 1 July 2009
In the article below editing changes transformed Thokozani Khupe , vice - president of Zimbabwe 's Movement for Democratic Change , into a man when quoting her concerns about the state of government .
Zimbabwe 's fragile unity government appeared on the brink of collapse today after opponents of President Robert Mugabe refused to attend a cabinet meeting and threatened to boycott the power - sharing deal .
The Movement for Democratic Change ( MDC ) , led by the Morgan Tsvangirai , accused Mugabe 's Zanu - PF of consistently obstructing and undermining the agreement they signed four months ago .
Thokozani Khupe , vice - president of the MDC , said the latest incident happened today when Mugabe rescheduled tomorrow 's weekly cabinet meeting because he was going to be out of town .
Khupe described it as a snub to Tsvangirai , saying he , as prime minister , should have chaired the meeting in Mugabe 's absence . ""
Innocent and innocuous as this decision may be , the fact of the matter is that it underpins everything wrong about the present agreement , "" Khupe said .
"" The decision seeks to deny the recognition of the prime minister as chair of cabinet when the president is away ...
This reflects unilateralism , disrespect , contempt and refusal to recognise reality and the letter and spirit of the GPA
[ Global Political Agreement ] . ""
MDC ministers refused to attend today 's rescheduled cabinet meeting .
Khupe said : "" We remain concerned about the persistent victimisation , arrest and violence against our MPs , activists , civil society members , and members of staff .
"" We have remained abhorred by the continuous incidents of farm invasions and virile prosecution of farmers .
We have remained abhorred at the selective application of the rule of law .
Equally of concern is our disenchantment at the continued frustration of the democratisation agenda by Zanu - PF . ""
Media reforms remain aborted whilst state media , in particular the Herald [ newspaper ] and ZBC [ broadcaster ] continue to churn out vitriol and propaganda .
Equally , there is no movement on key legislation on fundamental issues such as the promotion of freedom of speech , assembly and expression . ""
Khupe warned that the MDC retained the option of quitting the agreement .
"" Whilst we remain fundamentally committed to the GPA in the interests of our people , it is our constitutional right to consider disengagement , "" he said .
His comments reflect ongoing concerns that the GPA is unravelling .
The MDC has twice called on the Southern African Development Community , which pushed for the coalition government , to intervene in resolving issues , such as Mugabe 's appointment of loyalists to key positions , the arrests of activists and MDC politicians , and the seizures of white - owned farms .
A source close to the MDC told the Guardian : "" The veneer of inclusivity is beginning to peel off and cracks are appearing due to the intransigence of Zanu - PF .
We 've been bending over backwards so far and , if it comes to it , we will consider disengaging .
Zanu - PF needs the MDC more than the MDC needs Zanu - PF . ""
Tsvangirai made no public comment after returning from a tour of western countries .
His warm reception by world leaders including Barack Obama and Gordon Brown is said to have unnerved allies of Mugabe , who is barred from such visits by travel restrictions .
Zanu - PF has objected to the publication of a newsletter by the MDC promoting Tsvangirai 's mission and criticised him for failing to raise more development aid .
Last week Mugabe told the state - owned Herald newspaper : "" Our inclusive government came with the expectation that since we were all in this partnership , there would be aid from all quarters of the world .
Money can not be found to pay those who are working .
Not even the ministers , not the president . ""
He added : "" So is this inclusive government a government of hunger ?
I had never received a $ 100 in salary but this year that is what I was promised –
not a single cent has come to me so far . """
2009-07-27,"The finance minister of Zimbabwe today received a letter containing a live bullet and a warning to "" prepare your will "" .
Tendai Biti , widely seen as prime minister Morgan Tsvangirai 's number two , found the apparent death threat delivered to his home in the capital , Harare .
The letter accompanying the bullet was inscribed "" raira nhaka "" , which can be translated as "" prepare your will "" or "" sort out your estate "" .
The Movement for Democratic Change said it was treating the package as a death threat and it had been reported to the police .
Biti 's aide , Nqobizitha Mlilo , was quoted by SW Radio Africa as saying that the finance minister was "" a bit low and shaken up as a result of this episode "" .
Biti is secretary - general of the MDC , which has formed a unity government with president Mugabe 's Zanu - PF .
He has been locked in a battle over the economy with Reserve Bank governor Gideon Gono , whom Mugabe refuses to sack .
An MDC statement said tonight : "" Hon Tendai Biti has received a letter with a live bullet inside it in what the party is treating as a death threat .
The letter was delivered at the MDC secretary - general 's home in Highlands and a police report has been lodged at Harare Central police station . ""
The incident comes after a perilous month for the power - sharing government , involving chaotic scuffles at a constitution - writing conference , and reports of violent assaults on MDC supporters .
The statement added : "" The MDC believes that these threats can not be taken lightly , especially against the background of renewed violence and persecution of MDC leaders , MPs and members . ""
The live bullet delivered at Hon Biti 's home is a tragic climax to the barrage of defamatory vitriol spewed through the public media ever since the Minister of Finance delivered a pro - poor mid - term fiscal policy position which was well - received by the various sectors of the economy . ""
The terror tactics of sending live bullets to cabinet ministers is a sure sign that the desperate forces fighting the new dispensation are getting more and more desperate every day . ""
MDC ministers have warned that despite the formation of the unity government political assassinations are still a risk and expressed a desire to see more security around Tsvangirai ."
2009-08-06,"One of the most senior members of Zimbabwe 's unity government has spoken of his fear that he and the prime minister , Morgan Tsvangirai , could be the target of assassination by forces determined to block political reforms .
Tendai Biti , finance minister and secretary general of the Movement for Democratic Change ( MDC ) , received an envelope at his home last week containing a 9 mm bullet and a death threat telling him to prepare his will .
One of his employees was hospitalised after being beaten and kicked by a soldier outside Biti 's front gate .
Tsvangirai and Biti are the MDC 's principal players in the six - month - old power - sharing agreement with Robert Mugabe 's Zanu - PF , whose supporters have been blamed for a surge in political violence in recent weeks . ""
Tsvangirai is the face of change in Zimbabwe and change is a threat to those who have been benefiting from the status quo , "" Biti told the Guardian . ""
Yes , we are at risk [ of assassination ] and I think we are being irresponsible by having the lax security arrangements we have , certainly myself . ""
He continued : "" The fact of the matter is that we are in a struggle , a vicious struggle .
The easiest and most opportunistic solution is to eliminate , and when you eliminate particularly strategic persons like prime minister Tsvangirai , you take the struggle backwards for many years .
So of course any opponent would have to strategise and say , ' Look guys , this is an easy solution . '
""
But killing somebody is not easy and also the world has moved .
The information highway has helped : Zimbabwe is not an island .
There will be harsh consequences to any act of insanity . ""
The finance minister , who has been credited with rebuilding the economy after last year 's record hyperinflation , conceded that he should take the threat to his safety more seriously .
"" If they want to do anything to you , they can do it .
I do n't move around with a bodyguard because God is my bodyguard .
I do n't think about my personal security , which I think is stupid , but that 's the reality . ""
The inclusive government last month launched a campaign of "" national healing "" and reconciliation , which prompted the rare sight of Mugabe and Tsvangirai laughing together on stage .
Mugabe called for an end to violence , urging Zimbabweans to promote "" the values and practice of tolerance , respect , non - violence and dialogue as a means of resolving political differences "" .
But last weekend Biti 's gardener was assaulted outside the politician 's home in Harare .
Howard Makonza said he was passing the residence of the national army commander , General Philip Valerio Sibanda , when three armed guards told him to stop .
He continued walking and a soldier started chasing him down the street .
Makonzi ran to Biti 's house but the soldier caught him outside the gate and struck him to the ground .
Makonza recalled : "" He started beating me in a strong way , kicking me in the head , in my mouth and all over my body .
He beat me for about 20 minutes .
I thought he was going to kill me .
I was screaming and people ran away , but my workmate helped me and opened the gate so Mr Biti 's vicious dogs came out .
The soldier shook the gate and said ' Now you 're for it ' but then he went away .
"" I was bleeding in from the teeth and the lips .
They called a doctor for me and I was taken to hospital .
Later we went to the police and they asked the soldier why he beat me .
The soldier said ' I want to beat him again ' in front of the police , who said they would come back the next day . ""
The 39-year - old gardener now fears for his safety .
"" They want to destroy me .
I 've got small children to support and my mother is ill .
I 'm the breadwinner so if they destroy me , no one can support my family . """
2009-08-18,"What do you say to a man widely blamed for beating you , stealing your job and trying to have you thrown out of a 10th - floor window ?
Morgan Tsvangirai , prime minister of Zimbabwe , insists that he is now able to joke with his long - time opponent , President Robert Mugabe . ""
Over a long period of time you start to develop some chemistry , "" he says , leaning forward in a black armchair in his ministerial office .
"" That 's where you ca n't just go in and talk about business , you actually have to talk about personal issues .
Sometimes it 's helpful to unlock the barriers that may exist between people . ""
The democrat and the dictator are six months into southern Africa 's most curious marriage of convenience .
Their power - sharing agreement followed a bitterly contested election that robbed Tsvangirai of victory and left scores of his supporters dead .
Their two parties continue to fight , but Tsvangirai describes the odd couple 's meetings as "" cordial … not acrimonious "" .
He explains : "" There are certainly many areas where we differ , but we agree to differ .
We communicate , we talk , we discuss , we do n't believe that there 's anything insurmountable to discuss …
I 'm very free .
I 've decided that I will not keep anything to myself .
I will express it and express it forcefully if it affects my own constituency , my own party and the general thrust of the inclusive government . ""
Recently , for example , Mugabe made a populist speech to assert Zimbabwe 's disdain for western help , in direct contravention of the policy agreed with Tsvangirai .
The prime minister used humour to defuse the tension by remarking : "" Well , your statement was quite predictable . ""
Mugabe , apparently , laughed it off .
Tsvangirai has proved doubters wrong simply by still being here and holding together the fragile compromise .
The unity government has rescued the economy from the brink and slowly put schools and hospitals back in some semblance of working order , though the headaches that remain are legion .
Plenty of sceptics believe the president , who retains the "" hard power "" over the army , police and law courts , is bending the prime minister to his will .
Tsvangirai insists , however , that the man who has ruled Zimbabwe with an iron fist for 29 years is no longer the main obstacle to democracy . ""
This is a perpetual suspicion of Mugabe , "" he says .
"" It 's a template .
People ca n't believe that Mugabe has any capacity to change .
It 's an inherent mistrust and it 's nothing to do with what we are trying to build . ""
So does Mugabe , even at 85 , have the capacity to change ?
"" I have no doubt he himself is committed to see this through .
I have no doubt that perhaps there could be people in his own party or other elements who have reservations about it , but so far I think we are moving to achieve those incremental gains . ""
He continues : "" You must understand Mugabe 's political character has always been a character of denial , shifting blame for his own shortcomings .
But it 's always good to have a legacy , and I 'm sure that for him , it is the positive aspects of his life that he wants to take , not to be reminded about the negative aspects . ""
Last year , it is estimated that about 200 of Tsvangirai 's supporters in the Movement for Democratic Change ( MDC ) were murdered in violence perpetrated in the name of Mugabe 's Zanu - PF .
And more than 200 people were massacred when troops seized control of diamond fields in the eastern Marange district .
Yet Mugabe apparently tries to laugh off his global infamy . ""
He jokes about it .
He says , ' People say I 'm a tyrant . '
So what do you think of yourself ?
He says , ' I 'm not a tyrant . '
…
We do n't ignore what has happened .
Sometimes those things are facts on the ground which have characterised him . ""
Tsvangirai himself was once almost hurled from a 10th - floor window by men thought to be from Zimbabwe 's secret service .
He has faced three more attempts on his life and been repeatedly beaten and arrested .
It is widely considered that Mugabe stole the elections from him in 2002 and again in 2008 .
How , then , does the 57-year - old bring himself to now sup with the devil ?
He replies : "" What is reconciliation without that ?
Reconciliation is a measure of tolerance across the very serious political divide that has existed in this country .
How can we stand up as leaders and call for national unity when between us we do n't relate to each other ? ""
Tsvangirai admits that Zanu - PF 's influence over the judiciary remains problematic but dismisses fears that continuing arrests of MDC MPs will threaten the party 's parliamentary majority , saying that he will simply put up more MPs in their place .
He is equally sanguine about the threat of assassination , despite his finance minister , Tendai Biti , having received a 9 mm bullet in the post last month . ""
Those threats I do n't think will go overnight .
There are people who feel threatened by the very existence of the inclusive government : it threatens their patronage , it threatens their benefactors , so naturally they react .
"" Conspiracy theories continue to swirl around the car crash , less than a month after he became prime minister , in which Tsvangirai was hurt and his wife , Susan , was killed .
He insists it was an accident .
Tsvangirai 's conciliatory attitude has led to criticism , not least from within his own ranks , that he has conceded too much ground to Mugabe , sacrificing change for the facade of unity .
Sceptics prophesy that , come the next election , violence will flare up again and the power - sharing agreement will be worthless .
Tsvangirai vehemently rejects the charge .
"" I 'm not bending over backwards .
This is a shared compromise .
It has never been meant to be winner takes all …
It 's not a perfect marriage .
It 's a marriage that is meant to ensure that this country moves forward and so , yes , frustrations will be there . ""
But let 's not miss the goal
…
We will keep our eye on the ball until such time as we are going to have an election which is free and fair . ""

2009-08-28,"South Africa 's president , Jacob Zuma , has given an upbeat assessment of Zimbabwe 's unity government , saying he believes the worst of the country 's troubles are over .
Zuma held talks in Harare with President Robert Mugabe , who looked well despite speculation over his health , and the prime minister , Morgan Tsvangirai , in a bid to end feuding between the coalition partners .
But even as Zuma struck an optimistic note , new figures showed a surge in violent attacks and human rights abuses by soldiers loyal to Mugabe .
Zuma , on his first visit to Zimbabwe as South African president , told a state banquet today : "" It is indeed very encouraging to note the significant progress that has been made under the auspices of the inclusive government . ""
He added : "" The remaining issues are not insurmountable and can be overcome .
The most difficult path has already been travelled . ""
Speaking at the same event , Mugabe said : "" I am happy to inform you that the inclusive government is alive and well and that the three principals [ including the deputy prime minister , Arthur Mutambara ] are committed to its success .
Indeed , a political accommodation of this nature is bound to experience teething problems . ""
Tsvangirai 's Movement for Democratic Change is hoping that Zuma , who is the current chairman of the Southern African Development Community ( SADC ) , will put pressure on Mugabe to rein in hardline supporters and fulfil his commitment to the country 's global political agreement .
Tsvangirai said after a meeting with Zuma early this morning , that he had briefed the South African leader on the "" outstanding issues "" of the political deal .
But in an interview with the Guardian earlier this month , Tsvangirai admitted he could not expect preferential treatment from Zuma . ""
He does n't take sides , "" the prime minister said .
"" He is committed to ensuring all the issues of the global political agreement are implemented , because he 's chairman of SADC . ""
He can not pick and choose between Zanu - PF and MDC .
What he wants to see is the strengthening of the inclusive government .
He wants to see progress , he wants to see more positive outcomes .

"" The month of June saw the levels of organised violence being sustained with little indication that the Government of National Unity was committed to ending human rights violations in the country , "" the forum said .
"" Of note in the month of June is the increase in incidents of violence reportedly perpetrated by members of the army against civilians …
It is alarming that some members of the ZNA [ the army ] appear to be a law unto themselves and continue to harass defenceless civilians . """
2009-09-09,"A European Union team of government ministers and senior officials is to travel to Zimbabwe this weekend to meet President Robert Mugabe and to explore the prospects for the country 's gradual international rehabilitation after years of isolation , sanctions and blacklists .
The Swedish and Spanish development ministers and the European Commission 's top aid official , Karel De Gucht , are to push Mugabe to come good on his pledges to Morgan Tsvangirai , prime minister and former opposition leader , under the power - sharing national unity pact struck last February .
The sensitive EU mission , which Sweden , the current EU president , sought to keep under wraps , is the most senior to go to Harare since sanctions were slapped on the Mugabe regime seven years ago .
It follows demands on Tuesday from southern African leaders for all international sanctions on Zimbabwe to be lifted .
EU officials stressed that it was too early to talk of lifting penalties .
The British government , the harshest EU critic of Mugabe , is believed to support the Swedish - led attempt to gauge the scope for better relations , but would not yet back a relaxation of the sanctions .
"" There is an urgent need for all parties to fulfil their obligations .
By doing this , the EU can once again fully re - engage with Zimbabwe and help the country in its return to normality and prosperity , "" said De Gucht .
"" This is a critical time for Zimbabwe and the weight of responsibility falls squarely on the country 's leaders to deliver urgent political , economic and social progress . ""
The EU is the biggest donor to Zimbabwe , supplying around ¤90 m a year , a figure that could rise steeply if the country 's human rights and rule of law records were improved , as intended by the February pact that put Mugabe 's Zanu - PF in a power - sharing administration with Tsvangirai 's Movement for Democratic Change .
European governments believe there has been some improvement on the economic front in Zimbabwe , but progress in the political and human rights spheres is inadequate .
In 2002 , in a policy pushed by Britain , the EU put Mugabe and many of his associates on a blacklist , proscribing travel to Europe .
When the Portuguese invited Mugabe to an EU - Africa summit in Lisbon in 2007 , Gordon Brown boycotted it .
More than 200 Mugabe associates and 40 companies linked with his regime are on the blacklist or subject to financial , trading and bank account sanctions .
The European officials are to meet Mugabe on Saturday in Harare after seeing Tsvangirai in Bulawayo .
Zimbabwe 's prime minister visited Brussels in June in an attempt to restart relations with Europe .
Sweden 's prime minister , Fredrik Reinfeldt , is to hold a Europe - South Africa summit in Cape Town on Friday where President Jacob Zuma is expected to press for an end to European sanctions on Zimbabwe .
European diplomats stressed that it was too early to speak of "" big offers "" to Harare .
A summit of southern African leaders in Kinshasa on Tuesday demanded that "" the international community remove all forms of sanctions against Zimbabwe"".But a European diplomat in Brussels said : "" We 're not going there offering concessions at this stage . ""
The southern African leaders argue that the power - sharing deal in Zimbabwe will not be properly implemented until sanctions are lifted while the Europeans say they can not be lifted until the pact is properly observed .
Feuding between the rival sides in Zimbabwe is imperilling the February pact and holding up chronically needed foreign aid in a country whose economy was driven to complete collapse by the Mugabe regime .
In a further sign of an end to isolation , however , the International Monetary Fund last week released more than half a billion dollars for Zimbabwe , the first such funds in a decade .
The Tsvangirai camp is worried that the money could be purloined by the Mugabe side , particularly since the head of the central bank , Gideon Gono , is a close Mugabe aide identified with the economic meltdown .
Among other demands on Mugabe , the Europeans are to demand that Gono be replaced along with the country 's attorney - general ."
2009-09-13,"Morgan Tsvangirai , the prime minister of Zimbabwe , took a new tough stance against President Robert Mugabe yesterday , warning : "" You misjudge me at your peril . ""
Tsvangirai said he would consult the public on whether the fraught unity government was still tenable .
His hard line came as the first European Union delegation to visit Zimbabwe since 2002 said that targeted sanctions would not be lifted until the political rivals had resolved their differences .
Tsvangirai , addressing a rally to mark the 10th anniversary of his party , the Movement for Democratic Change , insisted that he would no longer tolerate violations of the power sharing agreement by Mugabe 's Zanu - PF party .
"" I am not going to stand by while Zanu - PF continue to violate the law , persecute our members of parliament , spread the language of hate , invade our productive farms … ignore our international treaties , "" the prime minister told thousands of supporters in Bulawayo . ""
I am not going to stand by and let this happen .
"" In a tone that seemed to hover between defiance and exhaustion , Tsvangirai said : "" I have done my part to promote reconciliation in this country .
Even after winning the election , I have compromised for the sake of Zimbabwe .
But do n't misjudge me .
You misjudge me at your peril . ""
He added : "" We want partners that are sincere .
We want partners who are going to commit themselves to good governance principles .
We can not have partners of looters . ""
The MDC was formed on 11 September 1999 when a coalition of civil rights groups and churches launched a party to challenge Mugabe , who has been in power since 1980 .
It joined a unity government in February in an attempt to end the political unrest that erupted after last year 's failed elections .
But the party says its supporters still suffer political attacks .
Tsvangirai , who has been criticised by some supporters for being too compliant , announced an initiative to consult the public on the future of the unity government during the next month .
"" We are coming to you .
Is this government sustainable ?
It is you , the people , who shall give us direction . ""
Mugabe welcomed the EU delegation on Saturday with what he described as "" open arms "" .
Zimbabwe is seeking billions of dollars in aid to rebuild its ruined economy .
The EU delegation flew out of Harare today saying it would continue to give an average of € 90 m ( £ 79 m ) a year in humanitarian assistance , along with a new injection of € 7.5 m for an education sponsorship fund .
But it said sanctions on Zimbabwean individuals and firms would not be lifted until the power - sharing agreement had been fully implemented .
Speaking in Johannesburg today , Gunilla Carlsson , the international development minister of Sweden , which holds the EU 's rotating presidency , said : "" Much more needs to be done .
It 's a mixed picture and this is only the start of a long journey .
My first impression is that there is a basic agreement with Mugabe and Tsvangirai that the GPA [ global political agreement ] is the way to go and there is no alternative .
There is common ground , but it 's a small island . ""
Carlsson highlighted agricultural production , the rule of law , conditions for foreign investment and the overall legal framework as ongoing obstacles to recovery .
On the issue of sanctions , she said : "" The key for re - engagement is the full implementation of the GPA .
We are not there yet .
It needs to be seen how deep the will is . ""
Asked if she thought the MDC might run out of patience with its coalition partner , Carlsson added : "" I can understand it 's tricky to come from such different views in a government .
However , they have decided to do it , and the prime minister asked us to stay on message with the government of national unity .
It will depend on how the situation develops . ""
Karel De Gucht , the EU commissioner for development and humanitarian aid , said Mugabe and Tsvangirai were still deeply divided :
"" They do not have the same reading of the same document .
They have a different reading on how this should be done and at what speed … Mugabe has a legalistic approach .
Tsvangirai has a teleological approach , which means you work towards a purpose . """
2009-10-14,"A white former farmer and senior member of the prime minister Morgan Tsvangirai 's party , was ordered to return to jail in Zimbabwe today over long - discredited allegations that his party plotted President Robert Mugabe 's violent overthrow .
A court in Mutare ruled that Roy Bennett should stand trial on terrorism charges on Monday , when he can reapply for bail .
The Movement for Democratic Change ( MDC ) nominated him as deputy agriculture minister but he was arrested hours before the coalition government was sworn in on 13 February .
The supreme court ordered his release after a month .
Bennett , who lost his farm under Mugabe 's land seizure programme , denies the charges , which relate to an alleged arms cache and plans to overthrow the government dating back to 2006 .
His co - accused in the case have already been cleared by the courts , which discredited the alleged plot .
The opposition says the charges are politically motivated .
Obert Gutu , a MDC senator and a lawyer , said returning Bennett to jail "" will create unnecessary tension "" in an already troubled coalition . ""
The re - arrest at a time when we are trying to work together as the inclusive government clearly shows that the arrest of Bennett is politically motivated and is political persecution , "" Gutu said .
"" We know that there are some hardliners within the Zanu - PF [ Mugabe 's party ] who have never liked Bennett . "" Only weeks ago , those pushing for democratic reform were heartened when the supreme court released nine activists and dropped all charges against them because they had been tortured and beaten in jail .
The court said their constitutional rights had been violated to such an extent that the trial could not go ahead .
Accusations that the activists had been plotting to overthrow Mugabe had been widely denounced as trumped - up and politically motivated ."
2009-10-16,"Zimbabwe 's prime minister , Morgan Tsvangirai , said today that his party was boycotting the unity government over the "" dishonest and unreliable "" behaviour of President Robert Mugabe and his Zanu - PF allies .
Addressing a news conference in Harare , Tsvangirai stopped short of pulling out of the coalition but said fresh elections might eventually be necessary if the political crisis was not resolved .
Though the decision was sparked by the detention this week of Roy Bennett , a Movement for Democratic Change minister , it reflects months of frustration over the lack of genuine power - sharing .
"" It is our right to disengage from a dishonest and unreliable partner , "" Tsvangirai said .
"" In this regard , whilst being in government we shall forthwith disengage from Zanu - PF and in particular from cabinet and the council of ministers until such time as confidence and respect are restored amongst us . ""
Zimbabwe was plunged into a financial and humanitarian crisis last year after Mugabe used widespread violence and intimidation to win a presidential run - off and extend his 28-year - rule .
Facing political paralysis and coming under pressure from the regional Southern African Development Community ( SADC ) , Mugabe agreed to share power with Tsvangirai in September 2008 and they formed a unity government in February .
The settlement helped to avert economic collapse , and Tsvangirai has since successfully lobbied western donors to increase aid to help restore essential services such as health and education .
But hardline Zanu - PF ministers have frustrated attempts at inclusive government , analysts say , with MDC ministers ' complaints ranging from a denial of office space to broader issues of continued human rights violations and farm invasions .
The case of Bennett , a white former farmer and senior MDC member , illustrates how fractious the relationship has been from the start .
Police arrested Bennett on 13 February , the day he was due to be sworn in as deputy agriculture minister .
He was charged with terrorism in connection with a long discredited plot to overthrow Mugabe in 2006 .
After a month in jail Bennett was granted bail , but this week prosecutors issued a fresh indictment and he was detained again in advance of a trial due to start on Monday .
The move drew a strong reaction from the European Union and the United States , which remain mistrustful of Mugabe 's commitment to sharing power and are still withholding direct financial support for the government .
Tsvangirai today described the court 's decision to proceed with the trial as "" persecution "" , not prosecution . ""
The … detention of our party treasurer Roy Bennett has brought home the fiction of the credibility and integrity of the transitional government .
It has brought home the self - evident fact that Zanu - PF see us as a junior , fickle and unserious movement , "" he said .
For their part , some of Mugabe 's ministers have complained that the MDC is not doing enough to persuade western governments to drop targeted sanctions against Zanu - PF leaders , which prevents them travelling abroad freely .
Ephraim Masawi , a party spokesman , said : "" We were having problems with MDC , working together .
We have been trying but it was not easy . ""
For now the risk of the coalition government collapsing appears small .
Tsvangirai said today that his party was the only one "" with the mandate to remain [ in government ] "" , while for Mugabe , having the MDC as a partner is his only veneer of legitimacy .
Sydney Masamvu , a Johannesburg - based analyst with the International Crisis Group , said that with a humanitarian crisis having eased , Tsvangirai felt in a strong enough position to make demands of Mugabe and seek regional support for his position . ""
The hawks in Zanu - PF have been trying to undermine the coalition from the start , believing that if they can force the MDC to quit the spoils will be theirs , "" he said .
"" It 's now up to the SADC to end its hands - off approach and ensure that the terms of the power - sharing agreement are adhered to . ""
Tsvangirai is expected to travel to South Africa on Monday , where he will discuss his concerns with President Jacob Zuma ."
2009-10-29,"The United Nations torture investigator said today he would recommend action against Zimbabwe after he was detained on arrival at Harare airport and deported .
Manfred Nowak , the UN special rapporteur on torture , said he had been invited by the prime minister , Morgan Tsvangirai , and wanted to investigate reports of rising violence and intimidation .
He believes that the president , Robert Mugabe , may have given the order to deny him entry .
"" I have never been treated as rudely by any government as the government of Zimbabwe , "" Nowak said after arriving back in Johannesburg , South Africa .
"" This mission has now failed .
A lot of money was wasted because of the unacceptable behaviour of the government .
"" The "" serious diplomatic incident "" happened days after Tsvangirai 's Movement for Democratic Change disengaged from Mugabe 's Zanu - PF party , citing human rights violations and persistent breaches of their power - sharing agreement .
A delegation of ministers from southern Africa began talks with the parties yesterday in an attempt to prevent the unity government from collapsing .
Nowak flew into Harare on the same plane as the ministers , but while they were given an official welcome , he and his team were taken to one side and informed that despite having visas their entry had not been cleared by the minister of foreign affairs .
Nowak was told to go to an underground office but stood his ground .
He recalled : "" They got a bit more threatening and said : ' I am ordering you to come down to the office . ' ""
He complied and , despite a long night of frantic calls to the prime minister 's office and others , was told to leave on the first plane out , at 7.20am today .
The group managed little sleep in the airport 's VIP lounge overnight .
"" There are certainly some parts of the government who do not want me to assess the current conditions of torture , "" Nowak said .
"" There are strong indications that this was not just done by the ministry of foreign affairs without at least the knowledge or instruction by President Mugabe .
"" It is for me a very alarming signal in relation to the working , or the non - working , of the unity government .
If the prime minister can invite a UN representative and is not able to get clearance from his Zanu - PF colleagues , this sheds light on where the power lies at the moment .
"" Nowak , who had scheduled a meeting with Tsvangirai , said he would recommend the UN Human Rights Council take action against Zimbabwe over his expulsion .
He added that he had received reports of disappearances and torture perpetrated by the police , army and paramilitary organisations close to Zanu - PF . ""
The climate is certainly deteriorating .
Since MDC ministers stopped attending cabinet meetings , there are definitely indications of a rise in violence and intimidation . ""
Ephraim Masawi , a spokesman for Zanu - PF , said allegations that Mugabe was involved in barring Nowak were "" not true "" .
A prominent Zanu - PF MP also rejected Nowak 's claims .
Jonathan Moyo , a former information minister , said : "" He was n't turned away .
He was already notified that his visit should be postponed to later date due to the visit of the SADC troika [ the Southern African Development Community 's politics and security organ ] .
The people hosting him and others assisting him were busy with the troika . ""
Moyo added : "" It was undiplomatic of him to ignore this and bulldoze his way into our country .
I do n't think any country in the world would accept this .
His behaviour was insulting .
Is he Jesus ?
There is now doubt the GPA [ Global Political Agreement ] is the most important thing in the country right now .
Why ca n't people respect Zimbabwe ? ""
Moyo described allegations of growing violence as "" garbage "" .
The MDC claims that its transport manager , Pascal Gwezere , was abducted from his home by six armed men on Tuesday night and is in detention .
It says other MPs and officials have been similarly targeted .
There are unconfirmed reports of Zanu - PF youth militias regrouping and targeting teachers in rural areas .
David Coltart , the MDC education minister , said : "" We 're not back to where we were in November last year – yet –
but there 's been a deterioration in the human rights situation .
If this falls apart , it will have consquences for the whole region including South Africa in the lead - up to 2010 [ the World Cup ] , and they know it . """
2009-11-06,"Zimbabwe 's unity government pulled back from the brink last night when Morgan Tsvangirai , the prime minister , called off his boycott of power sharing with president Robert Mugabe .
"" We have suspended our disengagement from the government with immediate effect , "" said Tsvangirai after an emergency regional summit in Maputo , Mozambique .
But he presented Mugabe with a new ultimatum .
"" We will give President Robert Mugabe 30 days to implement the agreements on the pertinent issues we are concerned about , "" he said .
His announcement came after talks with Mugabe and heads of state , including South African president Jacob Zuma , aimed at ending the political stalemate in Zimbabwe .
Tsvangirai 's Movement for Democratic Change party boycotted the inclusive government on 16 October , raising fears that the eight - month - old power sharing agreement was heading for collapse .
The walkout followed MDC claims that Mugabe 's Zanu - PF had repeatedly flouted the power - sharing agreement and committed human rights abuses .
The issue came to a head after the detention of a senior MDC aide , Roy Bennett , on terrorism charges .
The MDC said there had been "" increased violent "" attacks on party members by militants from Zanu - PF .
Zanu - PF described the comments as "" cheap propaganda "" .
The Southern Africa Development Community ( SADC ) security troika was made up of Mozambican President Armando Guebuza , Zambian President Rupiah Banda and Swaziland 's King Mswati III .
Zuma also attended yesterday 's meeting .
SADC , which is the guarantor of last year 's power - sharing agreement , instructed the parties that they have 15 days to resolve outstanding issues .
It said that Zimbabwe 's political parties should prevent the situation in the country from deteriorating further .
Tomaz Salomao , its executive secretary , said the parties should "" engage in a dialogue to find a lasting solution to the outstanding issues "" .
SADC , which has been criticised by sceptics as ineffective , also reiterated its call for western sanctions on Zimbabwean political leaders to be lifted .
Accusations of human rights abuses and vote rigging in past elections have led the European Union and US to impose travel bans and asset freezes on Mugabe and his allies .
The next Zimbabwe cabinet meeting is on Tuesday , and the MDC spokesman , Nelson Chamisa , said his party 's ministers would attend .
Mugabe , who has ruled since 1980 , declined to comment after the Maputo meeting .
Some MDC supporters had applauded Tsvangirai 's decision to disengage as evidence that he will stand up to Mugabe .
Others regarded it as an empty gesture that left him little room for manoeuvre .
Civil society organisations said there has been a subsequent increase in political violence .
Sydney Chisi , spokesperson for the Crisis in Zimbabwe Coalition , said this week : "" Since the disengagement two weeks ago of Morgan Tsvangirai 's Movement for Democratic Change from contact with Robert Mugabe 's Zanu - PF within the government of national unity , there has been widespread political violence and intimidation . ""
He added : "" There have also been reports of abductions of youth who are again being detained in Zanu - PF training camps ... preparing them to perpetrate violent acts against enemies . ""
Kerry Kay of the MDC said : "" The situation in Zimbabwe is very , very precarious .
There are crimes against humanity taking place all day every day .
The region , the world turn their back on it .
The animal has been let out now
and it 's going to bite hard . """
2010-02-07,"At the recent World Economic Forum in Davos , Morgan Tsvangirai , former opposition leader , was one of those present to represent Zimbabwe – a reminder that the fragile power - sharing arrangement brokered just a year ago still survives .
But it would be a brave person who took this as a sign that Zimbabwe was moving steadily towards anything like political normality or full economic recovery .
Some urgent humanitarian matters have been addressed , especially in relation to the freedom of NGOs to deliver essential services .
But education remains in chaos , and disease – including HIV rates and measles infection – is on the rise ; last year 's cholera epidemic is over , but this year 's rains will bring new risks .
The number of doctors in the country is tiny , with all routine health services seriously depleted .
One sign of dysfunctionality and oppression is the continuing level of harassment of Anglican Christians in Harare and elsewhere .
Some congregations were locked out of their churches at Christmas ; church members are threatened , attacked and beaten .
The election of several new bishops with a clear and courageous commitment to the welfare of their people is provoking the disgraced and ousted former church leadership to continue the tactics of violent intimidation that led to their alienation from the wider church and eventual removal .
That violence is actively supported by the police , despite court judgments in favour of the new leadership .
In one diocese , the former bishop and his small group of associates still have a stranglehold on property , so that no funds are available to pay stipends for the legitimate clergy .
But in the middle of all this – with legal costs threatening to cripple their work –
Anglicans in Zimbabwe have become vital contributors to sustaining and rebuilding the social fabric .
A year ago , the archbishops of Canterbury and York launched their appeal for Zimbabwe .
It has so far raised nearly half a million pounds from the Church of England .
This money , administered through USPG :
Anglicans in World Mission , has enabled the Anglican church in Zimbabwe to increase its already extensive development work – HIV care , rural clinics , training in sustainable farming practices , feeding programmes delivered through schools , often in close partnership with local government and NGOs .
The Nets for Life programme , funded by the Episcopal church in America , is widespread in the country .
No less importantly , various dioceses sponsor healing and reconciliation initiatives , with drama and music workshops for young people in both rural and urban settings .
The church 's record in Zimbabwe has been uneven , especially in the shameful period of uncritical support for Mugabe from leaders like the former bishop of Harare .
But things have changed .
Last year , the churches jointly offered a framework for confronting and dealing with the buried traumas of many decades in a country that has seen more than its share of violence and corruption .
And in October 2009 , the Roman Catholic bishops ' conference of Zimbabwe published a pastoral letter on national healing which gave an impressively comprehensive analysis of the country 's ills and spelled out what the churches could provide .
Anglican churches in particular have been at the forefront of establishing counselling centres where people can speak about their sufferings , and education programmes that open new possibilities .
Unless government adopts something like this framework , Zimbabwe is doomed to another round of trauma and destitution .
There are still those who say – as some of the discussion about aid for Haiti has shown – that churches are not the best vehicle for delivering aid , because they have an "" agenda "" to advance .
This is nonsense – and dangerously unrealistic nonsense .
In societies where the main civil society networks are closely bound to the life of the churches , it is self - defeatingly foolish to bypass their systems .
The "" agenda "" of the churches in contexts like this is simply the restoration of human dignity and stability in a deeply damaged society .
No one else is there to do it .
A year on from the launch of the archbishops ' appeal and a year on from the power - sharing agreement , Zimbabwe still suffers acutely .
We in the UK need to be clear about the urgency of supporting those working for basic human dignities and struggling to build social capital for the future through their work in counselling and reconciliation .

This has been corrected ."
2010-03-03,"Lifting sanctions against President Robert Mugabe and his Zanu - PF party "" would give Zimbabwe an opportunity to move forward "" , Jacob Zuma told reporters this week during his visit to Britain .
South Africa 's president is right .
The continued EU sanctions are seriously weakening the hand of Morgan Tsvangirai , the leader of the Movement for Democratic Change , in his efforts to implement a power - sharing deal in Zimbabwe .
This is because Zanu - PF 's response to the EU sanctions has consisted of an unrelenting propaganda effort to cast Tsvangirai and the MDC as "" sell outs "" who campaigned for the imposition of unjustified sanctions that are "" racist "" and a violation of Zimbabwe 's sovereignty .
Zanu - PF has circulated this message since sanctions were imposed in 2002 .
It depicts Tsvangirai 's MDC as being in cahoots with imperialist western states .
Tsvangirai 's party denies it campaigned for the imposition of sanctions .
But it has nonetheless failed to counter Zanu - PF 's propaganda because its message has never been as coherent and consistent .
The fact that Zimbabwe 's public media is controlled and dominated by Zanu - PF scarcely helps .
Since the MDC began sharing power it has come under pressure to advocate the removal of sanctions because it supposedly "" instigated "" them .
Zanu - PF refuses to implement democratic reforms it consented to in the power - sharing agreement for as long as the sanctions remain in place .
The sanctions standoff is one of the main reasons why the government has made little headway in democratising Zimbabwean institutions in time for the next election in 2012 .
This stalemate is what prompted Zuma 's call – although it is consistent with the position taken by several southern African leaders since 2002 .
The then Tanzanian president , Benjamin Mkapa , was scathing about the EU move : "" As you have heard about Zimbabwe and the EU 's decision to impose sanctions , it seems they want to divide Africa at Brussels in 2002 just as they did in Berlin in 1884 .
Africa must be prepared to say no , "" he said .
When Zimbabwe 's power - sharing deal was signed in 2008 , the Southern African Development Community ( SADC ) called on the EU and the United States to remove all forms of sanctions .
They declined , arguing that sanctions should only be removed when Zanu - PF had fully implemented the power - sharing agreement .
Today , the EU contends that if it brings Zimbabwe 's isolation to an end , it will have less leverage to persuade Zanu - PF to fully implement the agreement .
The EU 's condemnation of Mugabe and the Zanu - PF elite would command more authority if the same standards were applied elsewhere .
After Afghanistan 's inconclusive presidential election in August last year , Afghans were expected to vote in a runoff between incumbent Hamid Karzai and challenger Abdullah Abdullah .
Abdullah withdrew , citing vote rigging designed to ensure Karzai 's victory .
In Zimbabwe this drew comparisons with how Tsvangirai pulled out of the 2008 runoff against Mugabe because of its unfair nature .
In spite of the evident electoral abnormalities in Afghanistan , the US and EU recognised Karzai as the duly elected president .
Zuma and other SADC leaders who brokered power sharing in Zimbabwe deeply resent the EU 's refusal to lift sanctions when they applied no equivalent to Karzai .
Few , if any , African countries still look up to the EU , and the west generally , as champions of human rights and democracy .
It is time to start listening and taking our cue from leaders like Zuma , who are far more engaged with the region and better placed to bring about free and fair elections in Zimbabwe ."
2010-03-23,"Zimbabwe 's Sunday Mail newspaper , which is controlled by Robert Mugabe and his Zanu PF party , ran an article last week headlined "" Gay rights furore "" .
It claimed that "" Zimbabwe 's major political parties are on a collision course over the inclusion of gay rights in the new constitution "" because Morgan Tsvangirai 's MDC is campaigning for the recognition of gay rights , while Zanu PF is against the idea for cultural reasons .
In turn Tsvangirai 's MDC has denounced what it regards as "" attempts by Zanu PF to distort the MDC constitution principles through media reports that the party is lobbying for gay rights in the new constitution : "" Nowhere in our principles document is there any reference to gays and lesbians .
For the record , it is well - known that homosexuality is practised in Zanu PF where senior officials from that party have been jailed while others are under police probe on allegations of sodomy .
It is in Zanu PF where homosexuality is a religion . ""
Zanu PF and the MDC 's use of the gay rights debate for political mileage and in order to deflect attention from other subjects are superficial explanations for these homophobic political developments .
They are symptomatic of a broad disinclination for open and factual discussion about gay rights in many African states and black communities around the world .
Myths about African culture , the strength of religion and black masculinity are the main reasons .
The standard explanation offered by Africans opposed to gay rights is that homosexuality is alien to their culture and was introduced to Africa by European colonialists .
A good deal of African - American homophobia relies on the same justification .
But late 19th - century records on Africa and African oral history show that homosexual practices existed in pre - colonial Africa .
One case in point are the Azande people in the north - east of modern - day Democratic Republic of the Congo ( DRC ) , where it was acceptable for kings , princes and soldiers to take young male lovers .
Further evidence for the existence of homosexuality is that pre - colonial African ethnic groups ascribed tribal classifications to gay people .
While some of these categorisations had negative associations , many had neutral connotations .
Certain tribes in pre - colonial Burkina Faso and South Africa regarded lesbians as astrologers and traditional healers .
A number of tribal groups in Cameroon and Gabon believed homosexuality had a medicinal effect .
In pre - colonial Benin , homosexuality was viewed as a boyhood phase that males passed through and eventually grew out of .
Indeed , European contact altered some pre - colonial African attitudes towards homosexuality considerably .
For instance , early colonial Portuguese penal codes criminalised homosexuality in Angola .
Prior to Portuguese control , homosexual men called chibados had been free to exercise their sexuality .
Portuguese colonial laws either gave rise to or intensified homophobia in Africa .
Homophobia is more colonial than the practice of homosexuality in Africa .
The contradiction could not be starker .
Moreover , it is wrong to claim that nowadays the west campaigns for gay rights in Africa .
In fact , the American evangelical right invests as much financial and advocacy effort in influencing religious Africans to shun gay rights as do pro - gay rights western non - governmental organisations working in Africa .
Along with the moralisms of Traditional African religions , Christianity and Islam – which were brought to Africa by European missionaries and Arab traders respectively – facilitated homophobia because they regard homosexuality as sin .
Today religion shapes many African and African - American social and political designs .
Churches in Africa are major players in the production of homophobia .
In black America , churches are the most dominant homophobic institutions .
Not all African and African - American churches , however , are intolerant to homosexuals .
The response of many Africans and African - Americans to European colonialism , racism and slavery was the construction of a black masculinity pitted against white supremacy .
The enduring legacy of this is that black Africans and African - Americans often interpret homosexuals and white males alike as synonymous with femininity and vulnerability .
From my experience as a black boy growing up in a white Zimbabwean neighbourhood and during my higher education in the west , I am all too conscious of how my masculinity is partly formed by continuing racial stereotypes of black men as sexually rapacious solely towards women .
There is no scope for black male homosexuality in this pigeonhole .
Little surprise sex between black men is ridiculed and criminalised more than sex between black women in African and African - American communities .
Black Africans and African - Americans must address constructions of their masculinity , the myth that pre - colonial Africa was exclusively heterosexual and anti - homosexual attitudes emanating from religion if they are to rise above homophobia ."
2010-04-13,"For almost a decade , the US , EU , UK , Canada and Australia have imposed sanctions on Zimbabwe .
On 21 April , the prime minister , Morgan Tsvangirai , will travel to Brussels to ask the EU to lift the sanctions it has imposed on his country .
If the west is truly concerned with supporting democracy in Zimbabwe , it must heed Tsvangirai 's request .
The EU sanctions date back to February 2002 , when during the first election campaign to pit Tsvangirai against President Robert Mugabe , it argued that "" serious violations of human rights "" prevented the vote from being free and fair .
The sanctions banned dozens of top - ranking members of Mugabe 's Zanu - PF from entering the EU , froze their assets and forbade the export of arms to Zimbabwe .
The US first targeted Zimbabwe in 2001 , in the midst of the chaotic land reform that saw thousands of white - owned farms invaded and occupied .
The Zimbabwe Democracy and Economic Recovery Act directed that the US government should oppose the granting of any loan or financial assistance to Zimbabwe .
In 2003 , President George Bush expanded the sanctions by declaring a national emergency to deal with the Zimbabwean threat .
Since 2008 , Zimbabwe has been moving in a more democratic direction .
The long struggle by Tsvangirai 's Movement for Democratic Change ( MDC ) , together with international pressure , meant that in the aftermath of a violent election campaign , an isolated Zanu - PF was forced to enter into negotiations for a government of national unity .
The power - sharing government took office in February 2009 .
Tsvangirai became prime minister , and cabinet posts were split among the MDC , Zanu - PF and a breakaway faction of the MDC led by Arthur Mutambara .
Mugabe remained president .
For the first time since independence in 1980 , Mugabe and his party did not have a monopoly on state power .
The unity government 's greatest achievement has been to return Zimbabwe 's economy to growth after economic collapse and disastrous hyperinflation .
This success means that in spite of uneven progress implementing the terms of the agreement that brought the coalition about , polls show that a majority of Zimbabweans still support their new government .
Tsvangirai has earned the right to criticise the Mugabe government .
In his political career he has been arrested , beaten , and seen his supporters killed .
Yet ever since he became prime minister , he has called for an end to the west 's restrictive measures .
Mutambara , another former opposition politician , has also been very vocal in his belief that the sanctions have no value whatsoever .
The west 's restrictive measures are opposed in the wider region .
President Jacob Zuma of South Africa has consistently argued that the sanctions must be lifted to allow the unity government to "" function to its full capacity "" .
The 15 states that make up the Southern African Development Community have also been unanimous in their opposition to continued sanctions on Zimbabwe .
The opposition and the old regime have joined together to move Zimbabwe forward .
The government of national unity enjoys the support of Zimbabweans and the friendship of its neighbours .
Why then does the west refuse to accept the legitimacy of the new government and treat it as an equal ?
Is it because the 2008 elections were too bloody ?
Violence after Kenya 's disputed election in 2007 claimed more than 1,000 lives , but a power - sharing deal very similar to Zimbabwe 's restored peace and normality .
This can not be the reason .
Is it because the 2008 elections were rigged ?
Many western allies retain power through fraudulent elections .
For example , the government of Egypt , Africa 's single largest recipient of US aid .
Or is it simply because Mugabe 's regime has violated human rights ?
This can not be denied , but the west is happy to do business with many other exploitative regimes , such as Equatorial Guinea or Gabon .
Why no sanctions on them ?
The western fixation on Mugabe 's removal is impractical .
Mugabe 's most important political asset is the credibility he gained as a dedicated fighter against colonialism in southern Africa .
By unfairly singling Mugabe out , western governments play into his hands .
The essence of democracy is that political power comes from the people .
If the goal of the EU and US is to build democracy in Zimbabwe , they must remove the sanctions that Zimbabweans do not want .
The MDC - Zanu - PF government must be given a fair chance to chart a new way .
If the west can not accept that , by what right do they criticise Zimbabwe ?

2010-04-22,"For some the scene would have called to mind Henry Kissinger 's remark about the Iran - Iraq war : too bad both ca n't lose .
Two arch - nemeses of the west , Robert Mugabe and Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , came face to face in Harare today despite criticism of Zimbabwe 's president for inviting his Iranian counterpart .
The state visit has driven a wedge between Mugabe and the prime minister , Morgan Tsvangirai , whose party condemned it as "" a colossal political scandal "" and "" an insult to the peace - loving people of Zimbabwe and Iran "" .
Mugabe greeted Ahmadinejad at Harare airport thisafternoon and was due to host a state dinner for him .
Tsvangirai and leading ministers from his Movement for Democratic Change ( MDC ) are to boycott the entire trip .
Iran is the biggest exhibitor at an international trade show that Ahmadinejad is due to open in Zimbabwe 's second city of Bulawayo tomorrow .
He is the first leader from outside Africa to open the show since Zimbabwe became independent 30 years ago .
The MDC , partner of Mugabe 's Zanu - PF in a unity government , criticised the "" unilateral "" decision to invite Ahmadinejad , whose uranium enrichment programme and human rights abuses have made him a bogeyman in the west .
The MDC said : "" His visit will definitely send a wrong message about the kind of company that we keep at a time when the people of Africa and the rest of the world have begun to see us as a nation working hard to restore democracy and good governance . ""
The party , which observers agree was robbed of election victory in 2008 by a campaign of violence and intimidation , drew parallels between Mugabe and Ahmadinejad 's strong - arm tactics .
The MDC said while the teetotal Ahmadinejad would be "" wining and dining "" in Zimbabwe , nine opposition activists in Iran faced death sentences for contesting the outcome of last year 's presidential election .
The party added : "" Choice of friends defines character and inviting the Iranian strongman to an investment forum is like inviting a mosquito to cure malaria . ""
Hobnobbing with dubious political leaders confirms stereotypes that we are a banana republic .
"" If a man is to be judged by his friends , Mugabe has some image problems to repair .
His visit to North Korea in the early 1980s to seek help from dictator Kim Il - sung is widely blamed for leading to the Gukurahundi massacre , in which more than 20,000 Zimbabweans died .
Mugabe is also said to have been close to Nicolae Ceausescu and to have considered his Romania a model socialist state .
Rumour has it that he was so inconsolable on learning of Ceausescu 's execution that he did not eat for three days .
Zanu - PF has always enjoyed ties with China , which is flooding Zimbabwe with cheap products .
Earlier this year , Mugabe attended an 86th birthday party held in his honour at the Chinese embassy in Harare – the first time he had visited a foreign embassy in the country during his three decades in power .
But on a different note , guests at Mugabe 's 1996 wedding to Grace Marufu included the then South African president , Nelson Mandela , while Joaquim Chissano , the impeccably democratic president of Mozambique , was best man .
Zimbabwe 's Herald newspaper , a mouthpiece of Zanu - PF , said Ahmadinejad 's visit came after the west had declared Iran "" an axis of evil "" and Zimbabwe a pariah state .
It accused the west of wanting to bully both countries using "" the might of its weapons of mass destruction "" .
"" The west 's neocolonial agenda should only make us stronger , "" it said in an editorial .
But the diplomatic embrace of Ahmadinejad was criticised by human rights groups .
McDonald Lewanika , co - ordinator of the Crisis in Zimbabwe Coalition , said : "" Clearly his track record shows he is not the best kind of person to associate with .
They have a lot in common .
They are both experts are repressing their people , both experts at killing their electorates .
This visit is an unfortunate and unhelpful thing for Zimbabwe . ""
Simbarashe Mumbengegwi , the foreign minister and a Mugabe ally , said Zimbabwe would benefit from the trip by signing several trade and co - operation agreements with the oil - rich country .
After Zimbabwe , Ahmadinejad is due to visit Uganda , where oil has recently been discovered .

2010-04-24,"Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , the president of Iran , discovered the split personality of Zimbabwe 's government when he visited the country last week .
There was a warm welcome at Harare airport from the president , Robert Mugabe , who hosted a state dinner in his honour and assured the "" comrade president "" of Zimbabwe 's continuous support of Iran 's "" just cause "" on the nuclear issue .
But the prime minister , Morgan Tsvangirai , was less hospitable .
His party , the Movement for Democratic Change , described the trip as "" a colossal political scandal "" and said that inviting Ahmadinejad to an investment forum is "" like inviting a mosquito to cure malaria "" .
The mixed signals underlined the perils inherent in the concept of a "" unity "" government , a growing trend in Africa .
Power sharing can often become a power struggle by other means .
A peace deal in Kenya was salvaged from the ashes of post - election violence in 2008 .
But divisions run deep in the fractious coalition , with the president , Mwai Kibaki and prime minister Raila Odinga often pulling in opposite directions and threatening a constitutional crisis .
The protagonists in Madagascar 's political deadlock have agreed to talks in South Africa this week , with international mediators pushing for another inclusive solution .
Opposition politicians joined a unity government in Ivory Coast earlier this year after the previous one was sacked .
But the country remains in stalemate ahead of long - awaited elections .
Zimbabwe 's grandly named "" global political agreement "" , signed after disputed elections in 2008 , is probably the most notorious example , described by one report as trench warfare every day .
Ministers from Mugabe 's Zanu - PF and Tsvangirai 's MDC regularly issue contradictory statements , most recently on the introduction of a controversial indigenisation law stipulating that every company must have at least 51 % of its shares owned by black Zimbabweans .
"" Something has to give .
It 's untenable , "" said Nelson Chamisa , a government minister and MDC spokesman .
"" You have a half - donkey , half - horse arrangement .
The nature of the beast is something that is a puzzle , even for the people who brought it into being . ""
Along with their practical inefficiencies , unity governments are accused of defying the democratic will .
If two sets of politicians are in power there is no longer an opposition to hold them accountable and the electorate has lost its right to choose .
But for pragmatists they appear to be the imperfect answer to a deeply imperfect situation .
Blessing - Miles Tendi , a Zimbabwean academic at Oxford University , noted in an interview that unity governments shelve rather than solve problems but added : "" It 's easy for you and me and many others to sit there , deliberate and criticise power sharing
but there 's a big elephant in the room :
had there been no power sharing in Zimbabwe and Kenya , flawed as it is , what other option did we have ? """
2010-09-16,"Robert Mugabe is a hero , a liberator and the founding father of Zimbabwe , Morgan Tsvangirai , arch rival and victim of rights abuses under his regime , said today .
The conciliatory words chosen by the Zimbabwean prime minister came as he challenged the world to see the president as not only part of his country 's problem , but also part of the solution .
Speaking at a conference in Johannesburg , Tsvangirai acknowledged the atrocities of the past decade but insisted Mugabe could rescue his legacy . ""
I suppose Robert Mugabe has been portrayed as a demon , "" he told the Guardian . ""
He himself made a contribution to that caricature because I can not defend what he did over the last 10 years in terms of violence , in terms of expropriation and all these other activities . ""
But there is also a positive contribution to our country that he has made .
Remember that he was the national liberation hero , and so those are positive years .
I suppose there is the personality conflict between a hero and a villain , of which you have to make an assessment .
History will have to judge him . ""
Tsvangirai entered a unity government after disputed elections in 2008 which left more than 200 people dead .
The Movement for Democratic Change leader claims that Mugabe accepts the power - sharing agreement and the need for free and fair elections , probably next year . ""
He 's committed to this transition , once that transition is done , he is committed to ensure we have a peaceful election , "" Tsvangirai said .
"" That will restore his legacy as the founding father of the nation as well as the liberator , rather than the villain he has come to be associated with . ""
Tsvangirai , who was beaten by Mugabe loyalists in 2007 , effectively ruled out any criminal prosecution of the president or his allies after they leave office .
He argued that Zimbabwe had gone through two negotiations : the power - sharing deal and a new constitution , which could go to a referendum next year . ""
Those processes by their very nature are processes of reconciliation and finding common ground .
How would we turn around after going through those two processes and start embarking on a retributive agenda ?
It does n't make sense .
"" That does not take away what we have experienced , and as one of the victims of that repression , I can tell you that … reconciliation is the only solution for that country to have assured stability , peace and progress . ""
In earlier remarks , Tsvangirai told the Economist magazine conference : "" I go around the country sometimes addressing people – those who have lost their loved ones , those who have been beaten , those who have been tortured – and when I talk about reconciliation some of them say , ' You ca n't say that , we want instant justice . '
"" I say , ' Yes , an eye for an eye is very good , but remember if it 's an eye for an eye , it may leave Zimbabwe blind . '
I know it 's difficult to accept
but there is no other way out of it than to preach national healing , national reconciliation .
It includes of course having to accept the fact that Mugabe may be part of the problem , but he 's also part of the solution . ""
Tsvangirai angered critics in the west earlier this year when he spoke out against homosexuality .
But he said today : "" We 're not writing a constitution for the west , we 're writing a constitution for Zimbabweans .
It is Zimbabweans that have to give their views regarding that particular issue .
I hope they will be progressive , they will be liberal , but I know how Zimbabweans feel about that particular subject . ""
Asked for his personal view , Tsvangirai said : "" There 's no such thing as personal view .
If I give my personal view , people will say the prime minister is influencing what the outcome should be .
My personal view is known publicly and I do n't need to repeat that . ""
In a generally upbeat performance at the event in Johannesburg , the prime minister pointed to steady improvements in hospitals , schools , supermarkets , water and petrol supplies , inflation and economic growth as evidence that the country is recovering and on the right track .
But the pressure group Crisis in Zimbabwe Coalition rejected such optimism , expressing disappointment as how "" the hopes of many Zimbabweans have been shattered and betrayed by the inclusive government "" .

This article was amended on 17 September 2010 .
A sub - heading in the original described Morgan Tsvangirai as "" Zimbabwe president "" .
This has been corrected ."
2010-12-03,"Zimbabwe 's prime minister , Morgan Tsvangirai can be forgiven for being an angry man .
Not only has Robert Mugabe failed to implement the agreement that created Zimbabwe 's unity government between Mugabe 's Zanu - PF and Tsvangirai 's MDC , the cables unleashed on WikiLeaks in recent days have revealed just what one of his key allies thinks of the prime minister .
The country is abuzz with details of what America 's former ambassador to Zimbabwe thinks of Tsvangirai .
It is of course the view of one man , Christopher Dell , but to many , the US has spoken .
As Thursday 's Guardian editorial put it : "" The cables were written by Americans , to be read by Americans and they form the undigested raw material of American policy . ""
And what the US had to say about Tsvangirai is so raw as to be downright unflattering .
Tsvangirai , according to Dell , is "" a flawed figure , not readily open to advice , indecisive and with questionable judgment "" .
He is , Dell wrote , "" an indispensable element for opposition success … but possibly an albatross around their necks once in power .
In short … Zimbabwe needs him , but should not rely on his executive abilities to lead the country 's recovery . ""
The Guardian pointed out that many of the diplomats ' cables are "" are consistently well - informed , well - sourced and well - judged "" .
Tsvangirai 's spokesman issued a bellicose response : Dell 's assessment of Tsvangirai , he said , was contrary to the views of the increasing number of Zimbabweans who have been supporting him since 1999 .
But this is beside the point .
The reality is that Tsvangirai has always been a protest choice , and not a real one .
Given the choice between him and Mugabe , most voters would choose , and have chosen him .
But this is not to say that he is by any means the best possible leader for Zimbabwe .
Dell 's thinking chimes with what many in Tsvangirai 's MDC and outside it have been whispering .
There is no question at all that Tsvangirai is a brave man , a decent human being , and from all accounts , a likable one .
But his actions as MDC leader have also revealed him to be all the things that Dell has said .
Tsvangirai encapsulates the dilemma of the revolution donated from abroad : for the west , he raises the question of what to do about a pro - democracy leader who is not all that he should be , but represents the best alternative to the regimeit is fighting .
Dell compared him to Lech Walesa , but he is more like Hamid Karzai .
Like the Afghan leader , he is a deeply flawed man whose success is nonetheless essential to the interests of the US and its allies , and who , flawed as he is , still offers a better alternative to the regime he is fighting .
But the strategy of uncritically supporting the lesser of two evils has been to the detriment of politics in Zimbabwe , and indeed , to its democratic development .
Tsvangirai may be a lesser evil , but there is still much about him that causes discomfort .
Supporting him has led to multiple contradictions and hypocrisies , both for the people of Zimbabwe and the MDC 's western allies .
So while Mugabe is castigated for hanging on to power , and refusing to let democratic processes take place both within his party and the country , Tsvangirai , who intends to stay on as MDC president beyond the constitutional limits imposed by his party 's constitution , is considered essential to democracy .
In effect , undemocratic means are used to advance supposedly democratic outcomes .
And in pushing and supporting a man who as patently flawed as Tsvangirai , they may effectively be creating a monster .
Dell also zoomed in on Tsvangirai 's apparent aversion to ideas outside his small narrow circle .
Rumours abounded that he wanted to sack Tendai Biti , the finance minister who has proved to be one of the leading lights in cabinet , and who , interestingly , was lauded by Dell as one of only two quality leaders in the MDC .
This , in the context of the elevation of the patently unqualified Theresa Makone to the high profile home affairs portfolio was a shocking development .
A flamboyant businesswoman who started life as a beauty therapist , Makone and her equally wealthy husband are said to control party appointments in a way that many consider damaging to the party .
Dell 's reflections are therefore an important trigger for a discussion of Tsvangirai and his style of leadership .
The MDC has largely escaped scrutiny , as , for that matter , have other actors opposed to Mugabe .
The thinking behind this lack of scrutiny is that those opposed to Mugabe must be in the right .
But Mugabe himself is the best example of a revolutionary motivated by idealism who soon found himself opposed to everything that he had stood for .
Dell 's cables are thus important to an examination of the MDC .
But considering the bellicose response to Dell from Tsvangirai and his party , this may ultimately prove to be a vain hope ."

EO 12958 DECL :
09/20/2019 TAGS PREL , ETRD , ZU , EU SUBJECT :
EU COMMISSIONER DE GUCHT 'S TRIP TO ZIMBABWE
Classified By :
USEU Charge d'Affaires Christopher Murray , for reasons 1 .4(b ) and ( d ) 1 .
( SBU ) SUMMARY :
The EU Commissioner for Development and Humanitarian Aid , Karel de Gucht , along with the Swedish International Development Cooperation Minister Gunilla Carlsson , traveled to Zimbabwe on 12 - 13 September with an EU delegation including representatives of the Council , Commission , and the current and future Presidencies .
While there , they met with President Mugabe , Prime Minister Morgan Tsvangirai , the Foreign and Justice Ministers , and civil society members .
They then traveled to South Africa where they met with Deputy Prime Minister Mutambara .
POLOFF , along with Canadian and Australian counterparts , met with Louis Amorim of the Council Secretariat on September 18 , and then with Maud Arnould and John Clancy from Commissioner de Gucht 's Cabinet on October 1 to discuss the visit , the status of the Global Peace Agreement ( GPA ) , the Government of National Unity , sanctions and the way forward .
END SUMMARY ATMOSPHERICS :
------------- 2 .
( SBU )
The EU delegation saw the visit as a success because it drew media attention back onto Zimbabwe .
This was the first high - level EU visit since 2002 , and the GOZ made a real effort .
But Mugabe 's anti - Western rhetoric continued in the press , including public statements about "" Bloody Whites "" coming to interfere with their internal affairs .
The Foreign Minister told the delegation not to worry as the remarks were simply playing to the domestic constituency .
The meetings were very political and not at all technical .
There were huge differences of opinion , but open discussions , even with President Mugabe .
MEETING WITH MUGABE
------------------- 3 .
( C )
President Robert Mugabe was willing to engage , which the delegation took as a positive , but not willing to give an inch .
Mugabe acknowledged the important role the British Labor Party ( plus the Swedish , German and Danish ) had in helping Zimbabwe achieve independence .
He clearly wanted to be conciliatory here , particularly toward the Swedes .
Then he returned to the theme of a U.S. and U.K. conspiracy to overthrow him .
4 .
( C )
The delegation expressed concern about slow reforms , the status of the GPA , and continuing political violence .
Mugabe resisted it all claiming , for example , that the only violence today consists of small incidents involving youths .
The Movement for Democratic Change party ( MDC ) , he added , is also full of violent youths .
In response , the Swedish Minister was polite but very straightforward saying , "" We do n't share those views , even if it could be a question of perception . ""
When pressed , Mugabe would say , "" I will do the right things and I will avoid the wrong things . ""
5 .
( C )
Throughout , Mugabe was a superb debater , always looking for proof and asking his underlings regarding details .
( NOTE :
Clancy advised it is better to stay out of the weeds when trying to make points to Mugabe because "" he will turn details against you . ""
END NOTE )
Mugabe stated the GPA has been completely implemented and the Unity Government was working well , so sanctions should be lifted .
He claimed there was an independent judiciary in Zimbabwe , so the fate of imprisoned MDC Minister Roy Bennett was not in his hands .
He claimed no knowledge of other arrested parliamentarians and turned to his Chief of Intelligence for details , who also claimed to know nothing .
Ignoring the view of the Southern African Development Community ( SADC ) that certain appointments , such as the Central Bank Governor and Attorney General , must be made by the Unity Government , Mugabe claims those appointments could not be deemed unilateral because he was not required to consult .
He admonished the delegation not to let themselves be manipulated by the opposition on these topics .
6 .
( C ) Mugabe stated that land reform was an irreversible decision .
He said he was not completely against some kind of land ownership system , and a leasing idea , "" does not shock him . ""
He argued that resolving the land issues would require a comprehensive land survey , for which Zimbabwe would need BRUSSELS 00001399 002 OF 004 financial and human resources .
The direct implication was that unless donors provide the resources , the GOZ is not going to do it .
( NOTE :
In a later meeting , the Foreign and Justice Ministers repeated these points , adding the threatening comment , "" This is the one issue about which people take up arms . ""
END NOTE )
IMPRESSIONS OF MUGABE
--------------------- 7 .
( C )
Our EU interlocutors said Mugabe appeared physically fit , mentally sharp , and "" charming . ""
When asked if his position had either weakened or been consolidated , Amorim answered that it was very strong .
He remains powerful but is clearly surrounded by hardliners who are "" dodgy , "" "" cold , "" and lack Mugabe 's intelligence .
( NOTE :
Mutambara cautioned the delegation not to be fooled into thinking that Mugabe was being lead by hard - liners , saying , "" He is the worst hardliner there is . ""
END NOTE ) 8 .
( C )
In both meetings with our EU interlocutors , they told the same illustrative anecdote : during the delegation 's meeting with Mugabe , a strong , young man entered with a bowl and pitcher of water on a silver tray .
He knelt in front of Mugabe , who made a show of washing his hands with this subservient man at his feet .
The delegation thought Mugabe intended it as a show of his strength and power , but instead , as Clancy put it , "" it showed that Mugabe has lost the plot of normal human interaction and the responsibility of leaders toward their people . ""
MEETING WITH TSVANGIRAI :
CHALLENGES AND PRIORITIES
---------------------------------------------
----- 9 .
( C )
The delegation then went to Bulawayo and met with Prime Minister Morgan Tsvangirai and separately with Minister of Education David Coltart .
Tsvangirai was much more positive in Brussels in June about the GPA than he was in this meeting .
He gave a structured , concise description of challenges and priorities .
The challenges included the disputed appointments of the Attorney General and Central Bank Governor .
He blamed the latter for the complete economic meltdown and said , "" We can not have him there . ""
XXXXXXXXXXXX END NOTE )
10 .
( C ) Tsvangirai discussed political harassment , particularly the serious accusations against Roy Bennett .
The fact that he is "" white "" matters , Tsvangirai said , since ZANU - PF is concerned that Bennett will defend the white farmers .
Tsvangirai said the spirit of the Unity Government is threatened by ZANU - PF .
He insisted there is no alternative to the Unity Government , but added that he did not know "" how much longer we can take this . ""
He is very disappointed that the SADC extraordinary session on Zimbabwe did not happen , and that there has been little progress since June .
Minister Carlsson asked if there was a risk of the Unity Government collapsing , and he said "" no . ""
11 .
( C )
As for priorities , he highlighted that the MDC heads all the ministries that promote the population 's well - being , such as education , health , and housing , among others .
MDC was originally unhappy with the distribution , especially with ZANU - PF 's control of all the "" hard "" sectors , but then saw that the only resources coming from outside supporters were for service provision .
If MDC can make its sectors work ( through aid or other means ) , they can make the Unity Government work , and people will see a difference in their lives .
Amorim noted that Tsvangirai 's analysis seems accurate .
Everyone he spoke with who was not a government official confirmed that things are better - schools are open and stores have food .
Tsvangirai remains concerned about food security , however .
He explained the goal of providing one million homes with seeds and fertilizer , saying they had already done half and asked the EU to fund the rest .
MEETING WITH MUTAMBARA
---------------------- 12 .
( C )
Deputy Prime Minister Mutambara impressed Amorim as being "" very sharp , young , engaging , and very , very dangerous . ""
Arnould said Mutambara was a "" strong personality "" who was talking for the camera - he made a long BRUSSELS 00001399 003 OF 004 speech to the press about the importance of his faction in the government , and the imperative to lift sanctions .
Mutambara was livid that the United States met with Mugabe and Tsvangirai but did not meet with him .
Amorim summarized Mutambara 's main message to the delegation as , "" You have to count me in .
If you do not include me , I can wreck this . ""
He claimed he was "" the only one who can shut up Mugabe , "" and that everyone else is afraid of him .
When asked if others in the government shared Mutambara 's assessment of his importance , Amorim replied that while Mutambara only has three seats , they tipped the balance and allowed the MDC to claim a majority .
Mutambara knows that he could pull out and destroy the whole thing .
Mutambara stated that he considers the SADC communique of January to be part of the GPA and implementation will not be complete without it .
He sees the GPA as irreversible , "" there is no Plan B. "" MEETINGS WITH FOREIGN AND JUSTICE MINISTERS , CIVIL SOCIETY
---------------------------------------------
------------- 13 .
( C )
Back in Harare on Sunday morning , the delegation also met with Foreign Minister Samuel Mumbengegwi and Justice Minister Patrick Chinamasa who were described as playing good cop and bad cop , respectively .
The Foreign Minister was conciliatory , describing the visit as a crucial step to normalization .
The Justice Minister was confrontational , asking , "" Who are you to tell us how to run our business ? "" and saying , "" listening to you and listening to Tsvangirai is the same thing .
"" The delegation had the impression it was hard for them not to have all the control and to have Europeans "" telling them what to do . "" 14 .
( C )
In meetings with Civil Society leaders , they talked of continued violence in the rural areas by ZANU - PF , but also by MDC .
In urban areas , there have been fragile gains on human rights , including press freedom , but it depends on Ministerial tolerance .
It could all vanish tomorrow because the laws remain unchanged .
( Note :
Tsvangirai and Biti said that they want to see the Property Rights Act , the Freedom of Media Act , and the Public Order Act all passed in the next six months .
END NOTE )
But on constitutional reform , there is deadlock .
The July meeting started ominously , with participants nearly coming to blows , and ZANU - PF members saying they would not participate because MDC members were getting paid and they were not .
SANCTIONS ---------
15 ( C ) Sanctions were discussed in all meetings with government officials .
Mugabe portrayed the West as unfairly targeting people in the Unity Government for no reason .
"" What do you expect but hostility when you expel the children of my collaborators from universities in your countries ?
This hurts us . ""
He uses the sanctions in the media , saying , "" You are making the people of Zimbabwe suffer , trying to force regime change from the outside . ""
Clancy noted , "" One would think that sanctions would be a gadfly to him - nothing more than annoying .
But they bother him enormously because they do not apply to the MDC . ""
The officials with Mugabe stated that the targeted travel measures do not matter , but indicated the measures against parastatals do .
Unsurprisingly , Tsvangirai does not want sanctions lifted .
He says the process needs to be a two - way street , so there is no reason to lift them when there has been no progress .
16 .
( C )
Out of the three , Mutambara spoke the most about sanctions and claimed they only help Mugabe .
Without sanctions , he said , the GPA could move ahead , as Mugabe would have no excuse .
( NOTE :
Considering that Mugabe claims the GPA is finished , the delegation did not share this assessment .
END NOTE )
Mutambara asserted that the West must follow the advice of Africa leaders . ""
If Zuma says so , then you should not bat an eye . ""
He seemed surprised to hear from the delegation that Tsvangirai did not agree .
Mutambara said that any progress would require considerable engagement with Zuma .
"" You must get African leaders to put pressure on Mugabe .
He will not listen to you . ""
17 .
( C )
The Zimbabwean Ministers said the African Union and SADC have asked that the sanctions be lifted , so "" why do n't you listen to them ? ""
Minister Carlsson asked how they reconcile asking for respect for SADC 's views on sanctions when the GOZ had pulled out of the SADC Tribunal because of its views ( a reference to the case brought by Mike Campbell , a white farmer ) .
Displaying a capacity to "" create reality "" BRUSSELS 00001399 004 OF 004 ( Amorim 's words ) , the Ministers gave a very legalistic response ending with , "" the Tribunal does not exist .
"" WHAT 'S NEXT ?
------------ 18 .
( C )
Arnould stated that ZANU - PF is rebuilding and needs money , but time is on their side .
( She mentioned ZANU - PF has an arrangement with the Iranians to supply oil . )
Asked about the way forward , Amorim said the EU is committed to the plan for the dual roadmaps ( in which the GOZ prepares a roadmap for GPA implementation , and EU Heads of Mission prepare one for normalizing relations ; then they would link the two ) .
He stressed that the GOZ must accept the need to deal with the Member States ' Heads of Mission in Harare on this , not always with Ministers from capitals .
The delegation 's message was that they support the people of Zimbabwe and will continue to do so , just not necessarily by going through the government .
The current visit should not be taken to imply that things are fine now .
It 's a long - term process .
They sent the very strong message that the reluctance of the GOZ to engage in the roadmap is matched by European reluctance .
Nothing has moved in Harare , so the EU sees no reason to move from their current position .
19 .
( C )
In response to Prime Minister Tsvangirai 's 16 October remarks on the lack of political progress in Zimbabwe , Commissioner de Gucht issued a statement outlining again the absolute necessity for all parties to implement the GPA without further delay .
De Gucht encouraged key regional bodies , particularly SADC , to do all they can to assist the parties to the GPA to resolve their differences for the benefit of the Zimbabwean people .

SUMMARY

1 .
( S )
According to Elton Mangoma , MDC - T Minister of Economic Development and member of Prime Minister Morgan Tsvangirai 's inner circle , the MDC would like the U.S. to contribute to a "" trust fund "" to buy off securocrats and move them into retirement .
The MDC will also try to pressure Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe ( RBZ )
Governor Gideon Gono to resignXXXXXXXXXXXX .
Finally , Mangoma believes an agreement will be reached ending the MDC 's disengagement from ZANU - PF , but if not , the MDC will continue pursuing its long - term strategy of preparing for elections .
END SUMMARY .
2 .
( SBU ) Pol / Econ chief met with Minister of Economic Development Elton Mangoma on October 29 at the Ministry .
Mangoma is one of Tsvangirai 's closest advisors and was one of the MDC - T negotiators of the Global Political Agreement ( GPA ) .
3 .
( S ) Reiterating Tsvangirai 's views ( Refs A and C )
, Mangoma said that a primary obstacle to political progress and reform was the service chiefs .
Unlike many ZANU - PF insiders who had stolen and invested wisely , these individuals had not become wealthy .
They feared economic pressures , as well as prosecution for their misdeeds , should political change result in their being forced from office .
Therefore , they were resisting GPA progress that could ultimately result in fair elections .
Mangoma asked for consideration of U.S. contribution to a "" trust fund "" that could be used to negotiate the service chiefs ' retirement .
He said he planned to approach the UK and Germany with the same request .

( C )
Although doubtful about the ability of SADC to bring about a rapprochement between ZANU - PF and the MDC , Mangoma Qabout a rapprochement between ZANU - PF and the MDC , Mangoma was hopeful that the parties themselves could ultimately reach an agreement .
Most ZANU - PF officials realized that the entry of the MDC into government had brought about stability and did not want to see the MDC withdraw .
If an agreement was not reached , the MDC would consider next steps with the goal of eventually having elections .

We posited there was a general perception among diplomats and in civil society that the MDC did not have a strategic vision and had disengaged without a Plan B in the event ZANU - PF did not compromise on outstanding issues .
Mangoma disagreed ; the West had continuously underestimated the MDC by focusing on specific events such as ZANU - PF 's repressive actions of the last week ( Septel ) rather than the long - term process by which the MDC had managed to enter government and begun to set itself up to win the next elections .
With regard to the events of the last week , Mangoma said bumps in the road were to be expected .

The relative power of Mugabe vis - a - vis the service chiefs is a matter of debate .
While no doubt there are hardliners , including the service chiefs , close to Mugabe who are pressuring him not to further implement the GPA , we continue to believe he could make concessions should he choose to do so .
The current visit of the SADC Troika may give an indication if there is any ZANU - PF flexibility .
We 're skeptical and expect the current impasse -- and ZANU - PF repression -- will continue in the near term .

2010-12-27,"Zimbabwe is to investigate bringing treason charges against the prime minister , Morgan Tsvangirai , and other individuals over confidential talks with US diplomats revealed by WikiLeaks .
Johannes Tomana , the attorney general , said he would appoint a commission of five lawyers to examine whether recent disclosures in leaked US embassy cables amount to a breach of the constitution .
A cable dated 24 December 2009 suggested Tsvangirai privately insisted sanctions "" must be kept in place "" .
High treason in Zimbabwe can result in the death penalty .
Tomana told the state - owned Herald newspaper : "" With immediate effect , I am going to instruct a team of practising lawyers to look into the issues that arise from the WikiLeaks . ""
The WikiLeaks appear to show a treasonous collusion between local Zimbabweans and the aggressive international world , particularly the United States . ""
State media reports have said hardline supporters of the president , Robert Mugabe , want an official inquiry into Tsvangirai 's discussion of international sanctions with the US ambassador in Harare .
Mugabe 's Zanu - PF party said last week the government should draft a law that makes it a treasonable offence to call for sanctions .
The Movement for Democratic Change leader "" acknowledged that his public statements calling for easing of sanctions versus his private conversations saying they must be kept in place have caused problems , "" the memo states .
It says : "" If necessary , he said , he and [ deputy prime minister Arthur ] Mutambara can quietly meet with western leadership to develop a plan on the issue of sanctions .
He said that he and Mutambara have decided to take this issue out of the hands of the negotiators and handle it personally . ""
Defenders of Tsvangirai might note that , in the same US cable , he is described as asking for some "" flexibility "" in sanctions .
It says : "" Zanu - PF has implemented a strategy of reciprocity in the negotiations , using western sanctions as a cudgel against MDC .
He [ Tsvangirai ] would like to see some quiet moves , provided there are acceptable benchmarks , to ' give ' some modest reward for modest progress . ""
Tsvangirai 's aides say he is not guilty and describe the controversy as personal attacks on the prime minister .
Beatrice Mtetwa , a leading human rights lawyer , said it would be very difficult to mount a legal case on the basis of WikiLeaks .
"" If there is a commission to look into WikiLeaks , it will have to investigate everything WikiLeaks has discussed , including officials from Zanu - PF , "" she said .
"" It can not be selective .
When it comes to witnesses , are they going to call back the former US ambassadors ?
The cables are based on opinion , not fact .
There are a host of legal problems . ""
Asked if she could rule out treason charges against Tsvangirai , Mtetwa replied : "" From a legal perspective it would be folly .
But I 'm not going to say it 's unlikely because the attorney general has been known to chase rainbows against us .
He was put in the position for that particular reason . ""
Last week , the US treasury department imposed restrictive measures on the attorney general , saying his actions undermined the country 's democratic institutions .
Tomana condemned the move as an attack on his office and the constitution of Zimbabwe .
Even the term "" sanctions "" is hotly disputed in Zimbabwe .
Opponents of Mugabe argue that they are no such thing , but rather targeted "" restrictive measures "" , such as asset freezes and travel bans , imposed by the EU and US on around 200 people and 40 firms linked to Zanu - PF .
Mugabe 's wife , Grace , has filed a $ 15 m ( £ 9.5 m ) lawsuit against a newspaper that reproduced a WikiLeaks report saying she had been involved in underhand sales of diamonds from the controversial Marange mines .
The MDC has called for the government to investigate charges against Mugabe 's wife and other senior officials implicated in the US cables .
The WikiLeaks reports have added to tensions within Zimbabwe 's inclusive government , with Zanu - PF charging that the US cables vindicate its claim that the MDC is working with the west to oust Mugabe ."
2011-11-03,"Security agents loyal to Robert Mugabe are behind a "" coup "" that is plunging Zimbabwe back into political violence , the country 's prime minister has warned .
Speaking a day after police sealed the offices of his Movement for Democratic Change party ( MDC ) , firing teargas into the building and at bystanders in central Harare , Morgan Tsvangirai said : "" It appears the demons of violence are back – a siege mood seems to be slowly gripping the country . ""
The state security agents have instituted a coup over the civilian authority and they are now above the law , to the extent of disrupting government programmes and assaulting civilians with impunity . ""
Incidents of political violence decreased after Mugabe and Tsvangirai formed a unity government following disputed elections in 2008 during which more than 200 people died , but talk of a possible poll next year has reignited tensions .
Tsvangirai remains critical of the president for clinging to power , but describes the relationship in their weekly meetings as cordial .
He has told of heated exchanges between MDC ministers and Mugabe 's Zanu - PF in cabinet .
The MDC claims the power - sharing compromise has allowed it to make progress in reviving the economy and improving schools and hospitals .
But in the past few weeks police have disrupted Tsvangirai 's rallies in the western Matabeleland region , where the MDC won the majority of parliamentary seats in 2008 .
On Saturday , Zanu - PF militants disrupted an MDC rally organised by a minister jointly responsible for police affairs .
Tsvangirai said : "" The violence we are witnessing is state - sponsored and state - driven .
It is being championed by a few fascist leaders who want to reverse the little progress we have made .
"" The country is at a high risk of imploding if some in the leadership continue to be privately abetting lawlessness while publicly preaching non - violence . ""
Tsvangirai said Mugabe had assured him , during a meeting on Tuesday , that the issue of violence would be dealt with .
He gave no further details .
In a speech to parliament in September , Mugabe called for an end to violence .
While he was speaking , Zanu - PF supporters attacked MDC activists outside .
Zanu - PF denies engaging in violence and instead accuses MDC supporters of provoking its supporters .
Some analysts believe Zanu - PF is rattled by speculation over Mugabe 's failing health and that he could even face a challenge from within the bitterly divided party at its conference next month .
Senior figures are said to be worried that the 87-year - old is unfit for another arduous campaign .
On Sunday , Mugabe returned from a private visit to Singapore , to which he travels on an almost monthly basis , apparently for medical reasons .
Tsvangirai said Mugabe should consider resigning now . ""
The question of age is catching up , the question of health is catching up , "" he added .
"" I am sure that advisably he would be in a position for the sake of the country , for the sake of his legacy , for the sake of his children , to consider stepping down . """
2011-12-01,"After a ritual ceremony in which $ 36,000 ( £ 23,000 ) and 10 cows were reportedly handed to the bride 's family , it looked like a rare moment of joy amid the grind of death and despair in Zimbabwe .
Prime minister Morgan Tsvangirai , who lost his wife a in car crash in 2009 , had found new love with local businesswoman Locadia Karimatsenga and , just for once , politics could be forgotten .
It was not to be .
The romance has been killed by gossip , heartbreak and conspiracy theories just 12 days after the traditional paying of lobola , or bride price , in cash and cattle made a happy ending seem inevitable .
Tsvangirai , 59 , announced on Thursday that his relationship with Karimatsenga had been "" irretrievably damaged "" after it was "" hijacked "" by political opponents .
He said "" marriage is now inconceivable "" with the 39-year - old , a commodity trader and sister of an MP in president Robert Mugabe 's Zanu - PF party , which is locked in a bitter power struggle with Tsvangirai 's Movement for Democratic Change ( MDC ) .
Tsvangirai 's wife of 31 years , Susan , was killed in a road accident soon after he became prime minister .
He was travelling in the same vehicle and , despite widespread speculation , insists it was an accident .
His romance with Karimatsenga is said to have started at OR Tambo international airport in Johannesburg , South Africa .
In accordance with custom , Tsvangirai 's representatives paid a lobola , at a ceremony on 18 November , triggering a media frenzy including claims that Karimatsenga is pregnant – a taboo outside wedlock .
Zimbabwe 's state - owned Herald newspaper , ever hostile to Tsvangirai , led the charge .
It alleged he had several girlfriends and had promised to marry another woman , with headlines such as "" All the prime minister 's women "" and "" Dongo lambasts Tsvangirai for ' pants dropping ' . ""
Even Mugabe called on the media to leave his rival in peace .
But two weeks later Tsvangirai has issued a statement in a bid to put an end to the "" sordid saga "" , claiming he is the victim of collusion between political forces and some sections of the media .
"" I have become a spectator in this relationship and things are happening too fast , on camera and without my knowledge , "" he said .
"" This has led me to conclude that there is a greater and thicker plot around this issue which has undermined my confidence in this relationship . ""
Tsvangirai denied reports that he had been present at the traditional ceremony in Christon Bank , about 15 miles north of Harare , saying he had been at his office and sent a delegation to Karimatsenga 's family home to "" formalise "" the relationship .
"" There have been several developments since that day which have been deliberately planted in the media and which I have had to read in the press ; developments that would have taken place without my involvement and knowledge as an interested party , "" he continued .
"" The ' marriage ' has been hijacked and there is an apparent active political hand that is now driving the processes .
State security agents have also weighed in to force and direct proceedings which has resulted in everything regarding this relationship now taking place on camera , with the public media journalists in tow .
"" Everything is so well choreographed .
The intention is clear : to inflict maximum damage on my person and character for political gain .
This has caused me to have serious misgivings as to whether this will be a perfect union that will inspire young couples and reflect marriage as the noble and respectable institution that it is . ""
Tsvangirai said he had informed Karimatsenga 's family of the breakdown in their relationship .
He added : "" I also realised that sometimes when you are searching for a partner , especially after losing your wife , there are many stakeholders in the process , some of whom have their own ulterior intentions .
Having been married for 31 years , the tendency is to want to use your experience as a yardstick for future relationships .
Regrettably , the individuals , like the one in question , may not meet the same standards . ""
He went on : "" This relationship has been irretrievably damaged to a point where marriage is now inconceivable .
However , I want to assure the people of Zimbabwe that this dark patch in my private life will not dampen my commitment to serve my country and to deliver real change to the people . ""
Karimatsenga 's late father was reportedly a senior fighter with Mugabe 's guerilla army during the 1970s struggle for independence , while her elder sister , Beatrice Nyamupinga , is a Zanu - PF MP .
Members of Zimbabwe 's majority Shona tribe , to which Tsvangirai belongs , often refuse to marry in November , believing it will bring bad luck .
The prime minister , who faces possible elections against Mugabe next year , quickly became the butt of jokes on Twitter . ""
Tsvangirai has outdone Kim Kardashian for the shortest marriage this year , "" one commentator observed ."
2011-12-12,"First Zimbabwe 's prime minister announced that his engagement to a local businesswoman had been cancelled after 12 days , blaming it on interference by his political enemies .
Now Morgan Tsvangirai has been hit with a fine for seeking to marry in the month of November which , according to tribal custom , is taboo .
The penalty ?
Two cows , two sheep and 10 yards of cotton cloth .
Marriage negotiations are forbidden during November , a period deemed "" sacred "" in ancient folklore by Zimbabwe 's majority Shona tribe , to which Tsvangirai belongs .
Many believe it will bring bad luck .
The fine has been imposed by a traditional African chief , who gave Tsvangirai 30 days to pay , according to state radio .
But Tsvangirai 's Movement for Democratic Change , locked in a power struggle with president Robert Mugabe , says it does not recognise the chief 's powers .
The prime minister already paid lobola , or bride price , reportedly worth $ 36,000 ( £ 23,000 ) and 10 cows when initiating the marriage last month to 39-year - old Locadia Karimatsenga Tembo .
Just 12 days later Tsvangirai , who lost his first wife a in car crash in 2009 , announced that the relationship had been irretrievably damaged after it was "" hijacked "" by political foes and state security agents .
The 59-year - old said "" marriage is now inconceivable "" with Karimatsenga Tembo , sister of an MP in Mugabe 's Zanu - PF party .
To the surprise of many , Mugabe expressed sympathy and called for Tsvangirai to be left in peace : "" He who wants many wives , one or two , it 's his own choice .
If one chooses his wife , why should people mind about that ?
It 's his own choice .
Now newspapers write about that and are on his case , why ? ""
Meanwhile on Saturday , Mugabe , 87 , was endorsed as Zanu - PF candidate for elections expected to be held next year .
He told supporters that he would not quit as long as western nations maintained sanctions on his party ."
2012-08-22,"Zimbabwe 's president , Robert Mugabe , is enjoying a surge of popularity that could propel him to victory in the country 's next elections , an independent poll of voters ' intentions suggests .
Mugabe would command the support of 31 % of voters in a presidential election , ahead of rival Morgan Tsvangirai on 19 % , according to research for the US - based pro - democracy group Freedom House .
Tsvangirai 's Movement for Democratic Change ( MDC ) dismissed the results , noting that Mugabe 's supporters were outnumbered by voters who refused to declare their intentions .
But it is likely to boost the confidence of Mugabe 's Zanu - PF party heading into elections expected next year .
The Mass Public Opinion Institute polled a nationally representative sample of 1,198 adult Zimbabweans between 23 June and 7 July 2012 , Freedom House said .
When asked who they would vote for if presidential elections were held tomorrow , 31 % say they would back Zanu - PF , an increase from just 12 % in a 2009 survey .
Alarmingly for the MDC , only 19 % expressed support for the party , a dramatic fall from 55 % three years ago .
Other parties registered just 2 % .
However , some 40 % of respondents did not declare their voting intentions , making it hard to draw categorical conclusions .
Asked who they would support in parliamentary elections , 47 % of respondents said they would not vote , or refused to indicate who they would vote for .
Some 20 % said they would support the MDC ( down from 38 % in 2010 ) and 31 % would back Zanu - PF ( up from 17 % in 2010 ) .
The results come as a surprise because for years there has been a near default assumption by the MDC , activists and media that Mugabe 's 32-year rule was drained of popular support and is sustained only by rigged elections and violence and intimidation .
Freedom House 's survey implies that the 88-year - old could yet make a political comeback and win .
It also resonates with signs of discontent about the MDC 's performance in the unity government it formed with Zanu - PF following the disputed election of 2008 .
The MDC took responsibility for departments such as education and health and has been criticised for slow delivery .
Some observers argue that MDC ministers have fallen in love with their official cars and other trappings of power .
Susan Booysen , author of the interim report Change and ' New ' Politics in Zimbabwe for Freedom House , said she encountered complaints that the MDC had lost touch with grassroots constituencies , whereas Zanu - PF was still visible and fighting party political battles there .
"" I 've heard people saying MDC is just not doing work in the constituencies and is spending too much time in the palace , "" Booysen added .
"" They 're taking for granted they 're the crown princes .
They are not capturing the desire for change .
And there is still a desire for change among people . ""
The MDC questioned the validity of the study .
Douglas Mwonzora , the party spokesperson , said in Harare : "" The party respects the right of individuals and institutions to carry out opinion surveys on the views of the people of Zimbabwe from time to time .
However , we note that surveys carried out under current conditions are difficult to rely on due to the fact that they are held under conditions of major fluidity . ""
We note that a lot of people interviewed refused to disclose their political preferences .
This is obviously for fear of intimidation and the violence they have been subjected to by Zanu - PF and its military junta .
This margin of terror fundamentally impugns the conclusion that can be derived from this report . ""
A statement from the party added : "" The MDC reasserts that it is still the most popular party within Zimbabwe .
That it has had a positive impact on the lives of the people of Zimbabwe since it formed the inclusive government can never be doubted . """
2012-09-20,"Zimbabwe 's prime minister , Morgan Tsvangirai , believes that intelligence agents loyal to president Robert Mugabe 's Zanu PF party orchestrated a plot to humiliate and embarrass him ahead of his wedding , which was to have taken place last Saturday .
What Tsvangirai does not say is that his messy love life and poor judgment have made it all too easy for such plots to succeed .
Before the wedding , Zimbabwe was gripped by headline after headline featuring all the prime minister 's women .
There is his fiance , Elizabeth Macheka .
There is a South African woman who claimed he proposed to her , and gave a graphically detailed account of their love life , complete with pictures of Tsvangirai smiling on a luxury cruise ship and on a beach in the Seychelles .
And there is his jilted lover , Locardia Karimatsenga , whose legal action to have the wedding stopped precipitated this damaging crisis .
Karimatsenga approached a magistrate to have Tsvangirai 's marriage licence annulled and the wedding interdicted .
She argued that he could not marry another woman in a monogamous process as that would amount to bigamy .
The journalists who have filed on this story did not consult legal experts , and have , subsequently failed to understand the importance of customary law in Zimbabwe .
Zimbabwe 's legal system recognises customary law and not "" tribal law "" , as it is patronisingly called in many international reports .
Customary law is the complex system of law that governed indigenous societies in Zimbabwe prior to colonial conquest in 1890 .
And , like every republic , Zimbabwe also has a legal system derived from its constitution , legislation , common law and legal precedent .
Zimbabwean law thus has multiple sources .
Customary law on the family has detailed rules about how marriages are established and dissolved .
At the same time , general law also applies to marriages , guardianship of children and inheritance .
The challenge for the system has been to strike a balance between , on the one hand , the rights that derive from tradition and , on the other , progressive norms such as equality for women and protecting the rights of girls .
The system has not always succeeded , and has led to seemingly contradictory outcomes : Zimbabwean law recognises polygamy but criminalises bigamy .
A man may have any number of wives as long as he stays within the customary law framework .
If he chooses to marry in a polygamous marriage , he can not subsequently marry another woman in a monogamous marriage , as that marriage would mean the automatic divorce of the polygamous wife .
To get around the bigamy laws , he would first have to divorce his customary law wife or wives before he commits to a form of marriage that allows him to marry only one wife .
This was the argument that Karimatsenga made in her attempt to stop Tsvangirai 's wedding .
The magistrate agreed with her .
He ruled that Tsvangirai had indeed married her , but he had failed to go through the formal steps under customary law that would have dissolved the marriage .
The magistrate ruled further he could not issue the couple a marriage licence for a monogamous wedding until Tsvangirai had gone through the customary rites of divorce in their proper form .
If Tsvangirai nonetheless went ahead and married , he would be arrested for bigamy .
The international press has reported that he married "" in defiance "" of the court order .
He actually respected it .
The couple were careful not to "" marry "" , and instead celebrated their already existing customary law union and affirmed their commitment to each other ..
But how much does all this matter ?
For the most part , Zimbabweans do n't particularly care about the private lives of politicians .
President Mugabe and his wife Grace began their relationship with an affair when both were married to other partners .
Cabinet minsters routinely jump in and out of multiple beds , and Zimbabwe gives a collective shrug .
This debacle matters for different reasons .
It raises , once again , questions about the prime minister 's judgment and fitness for office .
Even his allies are lining up to speak out .
The Independent , a leading business weekly , asked the question : is he fit to govern , while veteran journalist Geoff Nyarota encouraged Tsvangirai to have regard for the dignity of his office .
Certainly , his multiple , and , apparently , simultaneous , sexual relationships with partners who appear to have been subject to no vetting not only demonstrates his extremely poor judgment , they also raise security concerns .
He has made it woefully easy for his enemies to portray him as a sex - crazed maniac : the acerbic Jonathan Moyo famously wrote that Tsvangirai approaches every issue with a shut mind and every woman with an open zip .
Tsvangirai 's poor judgment is particularly puzzling given that he has been the subject of intelligence plots before : he barely escaped from an orchestrated treason trial .
The invisible hand of the intelligence agency is , indeed , all over this debacle .
The events had a smooth efficiency that suggests careful planning .
It can not be said often enough that any plot against him only worked because Tsvangirai has made himself vulnerable to such plots .
Will this hurt him ?
There is the very real possibility that Tsvangirai will not only survive this , but may even gain a sympathy bump in his popularity .
The intelligence agents who orchestrated this debacle overreached themselves .
Tsvangirai has certainly been exposed as a self - indulgent and careless man .
But his enemies have demonstrated a single - minded ruthlessness that shows why Zimbabwe desperately needs a new constitution and a change of government .
The apparent use of state resources and machinery to humiliate the president 's main rival demonstrates clearly why Zanu PF can no longer be an option for Zimbabwe .
This is Zimbabwe 's tragedy : the mantle of leadership has rested too long on the shoulders of the man who currently leads Zimbabwe , and it will sit uneasily on the man who wants to unseat him .
But voters are likely to conclude that Tsvangirai is the lesser of two evils .
Flawed as he is , he may just make it ."
2012-10-10,"Morgan Tsvangirai is a man under pressure .
Ahead of next year 's elections the Zimbabwean prime minister is trying to deliver a new constitution , revive a troubled economy and manage a difficult relationship with the country 's president , Robert Mugabe .
Yet one of Tsvangirai 's main concerns right now is keeping his love life from the headlines amid accusations of serial dating , illegitimate children and bigamy .
Three weeks ago Tsvangirai , 60 , was forced to cancel his high - profile wedding because a judge ruled he was customarily married to another woman .
Tsvangirai , 60 , and Elizabeth Macheka , 35 , went ahead with a lavish ceremony but did not sign the legal marriage register after a judge warned that it could lead to bigamy charges from his 12-day marriage last year to Locardia Karimatsenga , 39 .
Speaking to the Guardian in his Harare residence , Tsvangirai said he had been the victim of a smear campaign .
"" I had two or three relationships and that was blown out of proportion , "" he said .
"" If two consenting adults have a relationship what is wrong with that ?
I did n't go and rape somebody .
I did n't go and take somebody 's wife . ""
He said the media frenzy over his private life since his wife 's death in a car accident in 2009 had been fed by his political enemies .
"" They knew they could not pin me down on anything so they had to find something that they could point to as if they were angels .
Some of these people who are writing about my so - called sexual scandals have a string of girlfriends , a string of wives and children .
We fell apart , as human beings fall apart in relationships .
It is natural .
But to call it a scandal is a bit exaggerated . ""
Tsvangirai , the leader of the Movement for Democratic Change ( MDC ) , heads a coalition government in an uneasy alliance with Mugabe 's Zanu PF party .
Despite the bitter rivalry between the two , Tsvangirai said Mugabe was still needed to help Zimbabwe transform into a functioning democracy . ""
Mugabe is part of the solution because of his grip on the party and the institutions of the state , "" Tsvangirai said .
"" For the sake of his legacy and the sake of the future stability I hope that he behaves in a manner which observes the constitution . ""
He said , perhaps hopefully , that Mugabe 's 88 years were catching up with him and he was contemplating retirement . ""
With his age he 's frail , "" he said .
"" To tell you honestly Mugabe is not in a fighting mood to retain power .
I think he has long given up that .
He knows that time and tide has gone beyond him . ""
Tsvangirai would not confirm reports that Mugabe often falls asleep during cabinet meetings but he admitted that the president , whose eyesight is fading , now only receives verbal briefing on key issues .
"" I do n't think he has that staying power to study , read and develop , "" he said .
"" That time is gone . ""
In 2008 Tsvangirai – leading in the presidential poll – pulled out in the face of brutal violence against his supporters .
Tsvangirai himself was almost killed in 1997 when Zanu PF henchmen tried to throw him out of a tenth floor window .
But he insists he holds no rancour towards Mugabe . ""
He nearly killed me but what 's the use ? "" he said .
"" The way I was beaten and left for dead , I will never recover that , even if I were to beat him to the same extent .
We learn a lot from reconciliation . ""
"" We have gone through an evolving relationship from very polarised positions – even you might say a love - hate relationship – because at some point we both realised we needed each other to resolve the critical national crisis we were facing . ""
Asked about Mugabe 's legacy , he said it would be a "" mixed fortune "" : "" from a hero to a villain and back again to someone who has managed a transition "" .
If Mugabe is losing his grip on power at home , the tide is also turning amongst Zimbabwe 's neighbours . ""
He is now a liability to the region .
And therefore they are asking if supporting Mugabe is really in the best interests of the region , "" Tsvangirai said .
Zimbabwe has been subject to international sanctions for the past decade but the European Union says it will suspend most of them once a credible referendum is held on a new constitution – which could be as soon as next month .
But Tsvangirai said the sanctions should be lifted already .
"" They are no longer an instrument of leverage , "" Tsvangirai said .
"" The continuing restrictions are actually stifling any further reform . ""
Since Tsvangirai became prime minister in February 2009 much has changed in Zimbabwe .
Inflation , measured at 500 trillion percent in 2008 , is now under 5 % , mainly due to Zimbabwe adopting the American dollar .
The economy , which halved in size in the decade to 2009 , has grown by more than 7 % a year since then – although unemployment is still estimated at 80 % and millions are still dependent on food aid . ""
There is peace , there is food on the table , the hyperinflation is gone , "" Tsvangirai said , eager to highlight his successes .
But he knows that the real test of the country 's progress , and his leadership , will take place next year , when the country goes to the polls ."
2012-12-13,"Is liberation blood thicker than democratic water ?
In his biography , At the Deep End , Zimbabwean prime minister Morgan Tsvangirai tells how he was "" stunned "" by South African president Thabo Mbeki 's part in a "" conspiracy "" to divide and weaken the Movement for Democratic Change ( MDC ) .
It is also now a footnote in history that when Julius Malema , then president of the African National Congress youth league , turfed a BBC journalist out of a press conference , he had been extolling the virtues of Robert Mugabe and mocking the "" Mickey Mouse "" opposition for using air - conditioned offices .
Such incidents illustrate how many in the ANC still see Mugabe as a brother in Africa 's liberation struggle while dismissing the MDC as a Johnny - come - lately conjured up by western imperialists .
Mbeki 's successor , Jacob Zuma , is however broadly seen as less sympathetic to Mugabe and more neutral in his mediation efforts ahead of elections expected next year .
Sitting down with Zuma at the Union Buildings in Pretoria , I put to him bluntly : what went wrong in Zimbabwe ?
He demurrs : "" I avoid being judgmental to other people . ""
Many have described Mugabe as a dictator , but Zuma pointedly avoids the word .
"" I would n't because in Zimbabwe Zanu - PF holds its conferences
, they elect Mugabe ; I do n't look at how that happened .
They regularly hold elections and that 's why you could say these elections did not go very well .
What else do you need ?
People do things in different places in different ways .
"" If you are telling me there have never been elections in Zimbabwe , either in the ruling party or the general election , it would be a different story .
How Zimbabweans are influenced in one or the other is a different matter . ""
Malema , who has visited Mugabe like an apprentice to a master , reportedly claimed that Zuma "" hates "" Africa 's oldest leader .
Zuma denies this , saying of their personal relationship : "" It 's good .
We were freedom fighters together , we know each other from way back .
So I 've known him for a long time . ""
Does that mean Mugabe receives preferential treatment ? ""
Not necessarily .
I deal with issues as they come as an ANC and as an individual .
What we need in Zimbabwe is to ensure that Zimbabwe is democratic , that 's why we talk to all of them , let the Zimbabwean people decide which party leads them .
We ca n't interfere . ""
And what of this notion that the MDC is a stooge of British and American interests ?
"" We do n't say that in the ANC .
Much as it is true that we come from the liberation movement with Mugabe , but that to us does not give anyone a licence to mishandle his country , so if at all there was mishandling of the country we 'd be critical .
"" We do n't say because a person has come from not a liberation movement , they can not be democratic .
What determines everything is how people run their affairs in their own countries .
We are not going to prefer them in terms of their history , but we are going to prefer them in terms of what they do .
However , the history will remain the history : the fact that I was a freedom fighter together with Mugabe is a fact we can not erase .
We must judge what people do at a given time . """
2013-01-23,"Elections will be held in Zimbabwe later this year , leading with grim predictability to another bout of Mugabe - phobia in the British media .
The trigger for the presidential and parliamentary poll was the deal struck last week between the 88-year - old president and the leader of the rival Movement for Democratic Change , the rime minister Morgan Tsvangirai , on a new constitution .
After months of wrangling the two men , who have been running the country in an uneasy coalition for the last four years , agreed on a text .
It has not yet been published , so doubt remains on whether it reduces the president 's power in favour of parliament , as the MDC wanted .
But whatever it contains , the document will have to be put to a referendum .
Then follow elections , and there are already strong hints that they could again be marked by violence .
Mugabe seems determined to stand once more , admitting he is vulnerable but saying he will fight like "" a wounded beast "" .
Meanwhile , a group of 58 civil organisations last week condemned what they called a "" well - calculated and intensive "" assault on human rights activists and journalists as voter registration gets under way .
As passions risk becoming inflamed again and the old battle positions resume in Britain 's media as well as Zimbabwe 's , the danger is that long - term trends get overlooked .
Good news has just emerged from Britain 's last former African colony that shows that the land occupations and evictions of white farmers by angry veterans of the liberation struggle that was the big Zimbabwe story of a decade ago did not destroy the country 's agriculture , as so often claimed .
Far from it , production is now back to the levels of the late 1990s and more land is under cultivation than was worked by white farmers .
The evidence is contained in Zimbabwe Takes Back Its Land , a book based on several research studies in various parts of the country .
The authors look at Zimbabwe 's first land reform right after independence in 1980 , which was not so fiercely contested , as well as the changes sparked by the veterans ' occupations in the late 1990s , which Mugabe 's Zanu - PF party originally ignored but later took over and turned into a political weapon .
The authors criticise Mugabe 's economic mismanagement , which led to hyperinflation between 2005 and 2008 .
It was not the land reform that caused hyperinflation , but bad economic decisions .
They say the introduction of the US dollar by the unity government four years ago brought a quicker economic recovery and hence greater benefits for farm producers than anyone expected .
They have the courage to criticise Amnesty International for exaggerating the plight of farm workers who were forced off formerly "" white "" land taken over by Africans , and say that by 2011 the number of people working on resettlement land had increased more than fivefold , from 167,000 to over a million .
They have a go at a prominent BBC report which , they say , fell for the myth of a cornucopia when white people ran most of commercial agriculture and a "" black disaster "" thereafter .
White farmers never used all the land they had taken .
In the years just before minority rule collapsed , in spite of generous government subsidies , 30 % of white farmers were insolvent and another 30 % only broke even .
Some 66 % of arable land was lying fallow .
After the occupations in 2000 , although some new African farmers reverted to subsistence agriculture , a growing number have been moving into commercial farming and there has even been a healthy return to the land by urban black people .
In part this is because land is still highly prized in Zimbabwe and the desire to recover it was so crucial an element , ideologically and emotionally , in the struggle against white settlement .
Indeed , the authors start their book with an arch reminder of an earlier generation of war veterans who evicted farmers and burnt their houses .
They included the former Rhodesian white minority leader Ian Smith and other champions of white minority rule who got their economic start in life in 1945 by defining African farmers as squatters and throwing them – without compensation – off land that the foreign settlers ' government designated as the exclusive preserve of white people .
"" Regaining the land was central to the independence struggle in a way that was never the case in Mozambique and South Africa …
Mozambique 's urbanised elite simply do not think of farming , "" they write .
In spite of the progress of recent years the book argues that Zimbabwean farming still faces major challenges of investment shortages and training .
It takes a generation for farmers to master their land and 10 years is too short a period to judge the complete success of the occupations .
But the record is far better than the outside world gives credit for .
While Zimbabwe Takes Back Its Land focuses on a specific controversy , its challenge to conventional wisdom and stereotyping offers wider lessons .
It is a reminder that crisis coverage , even when accurate , is only a part of what the media should be about .
Follow - ups and reports on long - term trends are equally needed .

Jonathan Steele covered Zimbabwe 's elections in 2000 for the Guardian"
2013-03-13,"On Saturday Zimbabweans will go to the polls to approve a new constitution that has been many years in the making , but which some feel has not been worth the effort .
The new constitution will be the last major hurdle before the country can hold elections , probably in late July .
That vote will once again pit Robert Mugabe , now 89 , and Morgan Tsvangirai against each other .
Mugabe shows no signs of having lost the taste for power , and Tsvangirai has certainly shown that he appreciates its privileges .
A splendid mansion , shopping trips abroad , and amorous adventures seem evidence of that .
Even so , Tsvangirai is the only candidate who proposes a new start , and the west has invested heavily in him .
If he wins , the country may indeed get its new start
but if he loses the kind of compromise coalition that South Africa 's Thabo Mbeki negotiated last time around may be impossible .
The new constitution has no place for a prime minister – Tsvangirai 's current position – and the role of vice presidents is not suitable for powerful or even influential personalities with demanding parties at their heels .
The words of the UN secretary - general , urging that last week 's Kenyan elections should be "" credible and peaceful "" have set a tone .
No one is talking "" free and fair "" .
If Zimbabwe 's referendum on Saturday is credible and peaceful , the UN , the Commonwealth , the southern African region and many others will breathe a sigh of relief .
The constitution , which is almost certain to be approved , is a curious document .
In some ways it resembles closely a draft that Mbeki 's negotiators put forward half a dozen years ago , the so - called Kariba draft , as it was put to the Zimbabwean parties on a houseboat moored on Lake Kariba .
In others , it recognises some of the positive aspects of the new Kenyan constitution and makes a faint - hearted but discernible effort to enshrine citizen rights .
The chief complaint , one made consistently by civil society groups , is that the president retains too much power .
Such power might well be required by a victorious Tsvangirai to unite the country and take it forwards , but the unspoken fear is that it will be a possible licence for abuse by a triumphant Mugabe – who may be within reach of a "" credible and peaceful "" victory which would hardly be free and fair .
Having said that , the powers of the president in the new constitution are not greater than those granted in France .
If the president dies in office , then the right of the senior vice president to succeed and hold power without election is just as it is in the United States .
But this is where the constitution is a strange beast .
It is clearly a document with last - minute compromises embedded within it – including one that states that if the president dies or stands down in the first 10 years after its adoption , the succession would pass to a nominee of the president 's own party .
This is seen as a safeguard for Mugabe 's Zanu - PF party but , even with this exceptional provision , it is not likely Tsvangirai would be made senior vice president in a coalition government dominated by Mugabe .
Behind the scenes , all parties are talking about compromises , coalitions , immunities from prosecution .
The problem is that everyone wants to dominate any coalition .
And that 's because no one is really certain who might win .
The most comprehensive polls , although with huge margins of error , seem to favour Mugabe – even in a free and fair contest .
But that huge margin of error could work in many ways .
Certainly it could disguise a huge disillusionment within the electorate and there may well be massive abstention or spoiling of ballots .
With this uncertainty about the margin of error , the fear is that Zanu - PF will intimidate and rig again .
The referendum this weekend will attract a small vote .
The weariness in the country accepts that a compromise constitution is the best available .
Whether the electoral commission can conduct the referendum smoothly – the country still has difficulty funding democratic exercises – is the burning question .
No one wants the March referendum to prefigure a July election which is botched administratively rather than won or lost peacefully , credibly , freely or fairly .
In the meantime , the Law Society of Zimbabwe is right to say that there is something to celebrate in the constitution .
It provides an expansive Bill of Rights with citizen capacities to enforce those rights in law .
Gender rights are very visible .
Powers are clearly separated to protect the courts .
Such a constitution , with a government that observed it in good faith , would be workable and a massive improvement .
But the question in today 's Zimbabwe is precisely to do with good faith ."
2013-07-26,"Morgan Tsvangirai , the principal challenger to Robert Mugabe for the presidency of Zimbabwe , has said a credible election next week is all but impossible and lashed out at the head of the African Union for backing his rival .
The prime minister said Nkosazana Dlamini - Zuma was perpetuating the narrative of Mugabe 's Zanu - PF party and distorting his complaints of vote - rigging in a way that "" puts into question her integrity as an impartial observer "" .
Tsvangirai , leader of the Movement for Democratic Change ( MDC ) , takes on Mugabe in a long - awaited election on Wednesday amid fears of a repeat of the 2008 poll that led to economic meltdown and violence in which more than 200 people died .
Western monitors have been banned from the process again , so the role of the AU 's observation mission is crucial .
At a press conference in Harare on Friday , Dlamini - Zuma – ex - wife of the South African president , Jacob Zuma – welcomed the peaceful atmosphere of the campaign so far and claimed that Tsvangirai and other candidates had not raised irregularities with her . ""
None of them used the word ' rigging ' , "" she said .
"" They might tell you what you want to hear …
We do n't deal with rumours .
We do n't deal with speculation . ""
An hour later across town , Tsvangirai gave a very different version of events , claiming the MDC had uncovered evidence of cheating in a special vote held early for thousands of security sector employees .
Brandishing a document at the lectern , he said : "" Yesterday we found out that some ballots which were passed under the special vote found themselves in dustbins .
Why ?
Because this ballot supposedly is voted for MDC .
So it must find itself in the dustbin and not in the counting station
…
So those who voted for Morgan Tsvangirai must find themselves in the dustbin . ""
He complained that his party had not been given access to the voter list , as required by law , and his supporters faced intimidation due to the "" militarisation "" of the vote .
He continued : "" What we have seen on the ground so far is clear evidence that the credibility of this election is at serious risk .
There is clear evidence of manipulation and a desperate attempt to subvert the people 's will .
We have engaged observer missions and given them our position on some of these issues . ""
Tsvangirai , who joined Mugabe in a unity government after the 2008 election , was asked why Dlamini - Zuma had told the world 's media that he made no mention of vote - rigging during their meeting .
Bridling with indignation , he snapped back : "" You ask her .
That 's a Zanu - PF narrative : endorse an outcome which then supports the Zanu - PF outcome . ""
In an apparent reference to Dlamini - Zuma 's close political ties with Thabo Mbeki , the former South African president whose intervention in Zimbabwe angered the MDC in 2008 , he continued : "" You know her background .
She does n't know .
"" It is a very unfortunate position to take , to accuse me of lying when I had a full meeting in which she was there , a number of her own delegation were , a number of my staffers were there and I pointed out these issues to her .
Now , the question is why would she want to distort a meeting in which everyone participated .
It puts into question her integrity as an impartial observer to this process . ""
The AU has long been criticised as bureaucratic and impotent in solving the continent 's conflicts , for example in seeking a peaceful solution to the 2011 uprising in Libya .
As the leader of a liberation movement against colonialism , Mugabe still commands wide respect and support in many African countries .
Enemies of Tsvangirai , meanwhile , seek to portray the prime minister as a puppet of the west .
During a tumultuous decade Tsvangirai has been beaten , arrested , almost thrown from a 10th - floor window and , according to many observers , had two election victories snatched away from him .
There are signs that on Wednesday it could happen again . ""
Is it the same story that has characterised Zimbabwean elections or have we matured as a democracy ? ""
Tsvangirai asked . ""
Obviously , with what I have highlighted , it is a far cry from the ideal . ""
Asked to describe his emotions at this critical moment , the 61-year - old replied : "" Am I frustrated ?
Actually I 'm very bullish about the outcome of this election .
It will indicate to you how resilient the people of Zimbabwe are .
Indeed , it will surprise you in spite of the violence , the shenanigans that are taking place . ""
He added : "" Zanu - PF can not win an election , never won an election , but they have found ways of retaining power against the people 's wishes .
That is not democracy .
So actually I feel emboldened by the fact that we have resisted this dictatorship for all these years using democratic means and we have resisted their attempt to try to label us as a violent party , as people who want to get power by whatever means .
"" We have stuck to our principle of having democratic change .
The support of the people , who have remained resilient over the last 14 years , gives us that encouragement . """
2013-07-29,"On 31 July , Zimbabweans will go to the polls to vote in presidential , senate , national assembly and local government elections .
The focus will be on the acrimonious battle for the presidency between the incumbent , Robert Mugabe , and the prime minster , Morgan Tsvangirai .
What is at stake ?
After the violent elections in 2008 , Mugabe 's Zanu - PF party and Tsvangirai 's MDC - T ( so named to distinguish it from the MDC - N , a breakaway faction of the MDC led by Welshman Ncube , the industry and commerce minister ) , were forced to form a coalition , which has , against the odds , overseen solid economic growth since 2010 , due to the resurgence of agriculture and revenue from diamonds .
The re - emergence of the agricultural industry is of particular significance , as it formed the backbone of the economy until the policy of land reform was implemented .
Now , resettled farmers grow 40 % of the country 's tobacco and 49 % of its maize .
However , the economy is slowing , and unemployment is understood to be running at 85 % , with youth unemployment a particular concern .
Education – formerly an area in which Zimbabwe excelled , with the highest literacy rate in Africa – has been especially slow to recover , owing to a lack of funding and a "" brain drain "" .
Although the economy is the most pressing issue for many Zimbabweans , youth unemployment and education will be two of the country 's long - term challenges .
The two leaders have very different visions for Zimbabwe .
Mugabe is under pressure from a hardcore section of his supporters to bring foreign - owned companies under "" indigenous "" control .
This rhetoric appeals to Zimbabweans , especially young people , who are often forced to operate in the informal economy , which is traditionally unreliable .
Tsvangirai , whose reputation has been tarnished by personal scandals and dissatisfaction with his leadership , wants to encourage foreign investment and reintegrate the country into the international community .
This is a pivotal moment for Zimbabwe , and the election outcome could mean the difference between a return to the turmoil after the 2008 vote or a continuation of the rebuilding process .
Will the elections be free and fair ?
In a rare moment of co - operation , Mugabe and Tsvangirai signed a new constitution that stipulated all security forces and government institutions , including state media , must be impartial , and genuine reforms on freedom of speech must be implemented .
However , by calling for elections to be held at the end of July , Mugabe has made sure there would not be enough time for all reforms to take place .
The electoral registration has also been tainted and , according to an independent audit carried out by the Research and Advocacy Unit , the names of more than a million people who are either deceased or have emigrated were found on the electoral roll .
Under these conditions , free and fair elections will be difficult , and there have been instances of politically motivated arrests .
Who will be the likely winner ?
Questions about his personal life and the subsequent smear campaign , especially in the state media , have led to Tsvangirai losing support among urban voters .
Zanu - PF has successfully portrayed him as a "" western stooge "" .
The MDC - T has failed to fully mobilise its support and its popularity has slumped from 38 % in 2010 to 20 % last year , according to a report by Freedom House .
But the party believes it will not be denied this time .
It claims credit for Zimbabwe 's economic recovery , as it was in charge of the financial portfolio , and the shortages that blighted everyday life have disappeared .
However , because the majority of food is imported , prices are high .
Lower - income families in the cities face particular challenges , as they can not grow crops so must rely on rural relatives to provide the staples .
But backed by the state apparatus , a Mugabe victory seems inevitable , and many commentators predict a comfortable win against Tsvangirai .
The same can not be said about Zanu - PF .
Dogged by infighting between "" hardliners "" , who want foreign - owned businesses to be owned by the black majority , and more conciliatory "" reformists "" , the party appears to be in the midst of an ideological battle .
The loss of key politicians has left the party weaker , but loyalty to Mugabe remains strong .
The real concern for both parties is the loss of votes to emerging rivals such as MDC - N and older parties including Zapu .
The issue is of great concern for MDC - T , which risks haemorrhaging votes to the likes of Zapu , whose traditional stronghold is Matabeleland .
If Mugabe wins the presidency , he will probably oversee a fractured government .
With local government , national assembly and senate seats up for grabs , pacts and coalitions may be the order of the day .
Uniting a fractious government will be his main challenge and , considering his age , 89 , it could be his biggest .
In order to overcome the deep issues the country faces with high unemployment and an education system that is struggling for funding and results , Mugabe will have to be able work successfully with a divided government .
What if Mugabe loses ?
Both parties have agreed to accept the result irrespective of the winner .
Yet the language from the campaign suggests the opposite .
After military intervention in Egypt , many commentators worry that if Mugabe loses at the polls , the same will happen in Zimbabwe .
Some senior military officers loyal to Mugabe have strongly indicated that they would not accept Tsvangirai as president .
The generals are loyal to Mugabe , as he appointed them and they have profited immensely under him , but the allegiance of the rank and file is unknown .
So while the threat from the military is real , it should not be overstated .
Avoiding the violence that followed the 2008 election will need to be the priority of the Southern African Development Community , but by capitulating on reforms and allowing Mugabe to dictate terms , it is likely that anything but a victory for him will mean more bloodshed ."
2013-08-03,
2013-08-03,"The United States and Britain have expressed their concerns after Robert Mugabe was declared the winner of Zimbabwe 's presidential election on Saturday with 2,110,434 votes , giving him 61 % of the total and Morgan Tsvangirai 34 % .
The margin was enough to avoid a repeat of the runoff of 2008 .
As Zanu - PF supporters celebrated the national election commission announcement , Tsvangirai and other MDC leaders held a press conference that was attended by the British and other western ambassadors . ""
The fraudulent and stolen election has plunged Zimbabwe into a constitutional , political and economic crisis , "" he said .
"" Instead of celebration , there is national mourning . ""
John Kerry , the US secretary of state , commended Zimbabweans for rejecting violence but added : "" Make no mistake : in light of substantial electoral irregularities reported by domestic and regional observers , the United States does not believe that the results announced today represent a credible expression of the will of the Zimbabwean people . ""
William Hague , the British foreign secretary , also expressed "" grave concerns "" about the conduct of the vote .
The MDC will boycott government institutions and "" pursue peaceful , legal , political , constitutional and diplomatic remedies "" , including in court , Tsvangirai said .
The MDC called on African and regional bodies to meet urgently to restore legitimacy in Zimbabwe and demanded a fresh election as soon as possible .
Asked about the lack of popular revolt , Tsvangirai replied : "" Why should there be ?
Our people are disciplined .
You do n't solve problems by creating violence .
In fact , we are at this stage because of the discipline of our people .
If it was any other country , they would burn down the building .
They have not chosen to do that because they know at the end of the day we do n't want any violent resolution of this crisis . ""
He denied that the result raised questions over his leadership .
"" We did not lose this election .
We won .
It is the imagination of Zanu - PF that they 've won it , yet they know the truth .
This is not a personal issue , this is a national issue .
If the MDC lost this election , then it is not Tsvangirai who has lost . ""
So far I have the full backing of the national council , I have the full backing of the people of Zimbabwe .
Until such time that they can express it , then we can talk about it . ""
In the short term , there is the question of an appropriate response to an election likely to be ratified by African observers .
The MDC and independent watchdogs alike claim it was rigged with brilliant subtlety and sophistication .
"" They have transformed this election from the margin of violence to the margin of error – from the baton stick and machete to the desktop , "" said MDC secretary general Tendai Biti .
Zanu - PF has dared the MDC to challenge the result in court , but it would face judges appointed by Mugabe .
An alternative is mass protest .
The MDC 's final "" crossover rally "" drew an estimated 100,000 people .
Few in the optimistic crowd guessed that the "" crossover "" would be into potential oblivion .
Yet there is scant sign of those thousands taking to the streets in an Egyptian - style uprising against Mugabe 's 33-year rule .
"" It 's not going to happen in an environment like that , because it 's certain death , "" said Roy Bennett , the MDC treasurer general , who claims to have been driven into exile in neighbouring South Africa .
"" Anybody who goes out to protest now will get shot .
It would be suicide , and who 's going to commit suicide ? ""
Bennett said the MDC leadership faced similar constraints , but called for a campaign of passive resistance . ""
Unless the MDC acts , and acts decisively , now , "" he warned , "" Zanu - PF will rule for ever and the MDC will fade into oblivion .
The people need strong leadership .
If they do n't get it , new leaders will emerge . ""
Asked if Tsvangirai can provide this , Bennett , who wanted the MDC to boycott the elections , hesitated before replying : "" The next couple of weeks will prove whether he has the heart . ""
Tsvangirai has survived beatings , arrests and assassination attempts , including nearly being thrown from a 10th - floor window .
He has tried and failed to dislodge Mugabe three times , although supporters argue that , on a level playing field , he would have won every time .
In 2008 , the presidency seemed in his grasp when he beat Mugabe in the first round , only to withdraw from a runoff , citing violence against supporters that left more than 200 people dead .
Tsvangirai became prime minister in a coalition government and believed he could win outright this time .
Instead , the party has lost many parliamentary strongholds .
Results so far paint the electoral map Zanu - PF green , with only a few pockets of MDC red .
Whatever the degree of any rigging , some believe Tsvangirai was a weak leader who let the MDC become tarnished by corruption and made careless choices in his search for a wife .
Tawanda Majoni , a political columnist , said : "" It is clear that the MDC has made several fatal mistakes during the tenure of the government of national unity , from Tsvangirai 's love gaffes to the party 's cosy approach to politics during the period in question …
The MDC should have used its nearness to power to gain some clout , but it did n't . ""
But Tsvangirai , a former trade unionist , appeared to rediscover his mojo in recent weeks when it came to doing what he does best – mobilising crowds .
Jameson Timba , minister of state in Tsvangirai 's office , said : "" In my view , Morgan Tsvangirai still has the drive to complete the struggle for democratic change . ""
Petina Gappah , a writer and political commentator , admitted being among the sceptics who had written the MDC off at the start of the year .
But she added : "" A lot of people are pointing fingers at Morgan , but nobody could have prevented this . ""
My respect for Morgan has risen and , if he steps down , he will be a hero to many and have absolutely nothing to be ashamed of .
He and his party gave us opposition politics .
Until the late 1990s , we had a one - party state here , and any future opposition party will owe a lot to the MDC . ""
Born from the labour movement in 1999 , the MDC has never been allowed to forget that white people were conspicuous at its beginnings .
Zanu - PF still paints it as a puppet of western imperialism , although the crowd at last Monday 's rally was 99.9 % black .
MDC members have been murdered , tortured and jailed during a long struggle and the prize now seems further away than ever .
The party is at a crossroads , mindful that for decades opposition movements have made little headway against liberation governments in neighbouring Botswana , Mozambique and South Africa , although Zambia has seen democratic transfers of power .
Bennett even predicted that an MDC "" armed wing "" could emerge to take on Mugabe 's "" military junta "" .
But as police maintained watch on people shopping and strolling in parks , Zimbabwe seemed to be illustrating the idea that nothing , like something , happens anywhere ."
2013-08-04,"Morgan Tsvangirai , striving to overturn his defeat in Zimbabwe 's presidential election , has given his biggest hint yet that a popular uprising is the only option left for resisting the regime of the president , Robert Mugabe .
According to the national election commission , Mugabe won 61 % of the vote compared with Tsvangirai 's 34 % .
The result was branded a "" coup by ballot "" by the opposition leader .
But on Sunday the polls result was endorsed by South Africa , leaving Tsvangirai isolated and fast running out of alternatives .
"" Revolutions are not called by leaders , "" Tsvangirai , head of the Movement for Democratic Change ( MDC ) told South Africa 's eNews Channel Africa .
"" Revolutions are something that is inside , and if you 've got something inside and it drives you to do something , then nothing can stop you .
In this case , there 's no strategy for the leadership of the MDC .
We 've told people , there 's been a subversion in 2002 , there 's been a subversion in 2008 , there 's a subversion now .
The power is in your hands .
It can not be a revolution by the leadership .
"" The MDC has consistently renounced violence and resisted calls to organise street protests against what it regards a stolen election .
But last week Roy Bennett , the party 's treasurer - general who is exiled in South Africa , called for a campaign of passive resistance to bring the country to a standstill .
Other officials floated the idea of a mass prayer meeting .
But Harare , the capital , was calm on Sunday with many residents going to church as usual .
In his eNCA interview , Tsvangirai , 61 , added : "" Remember that this democratic struggle has been a struggle with so many frustrating episodes .
For me , I think this is the most frustrating event of my life because I thought that like everyone else in the world , president Mugabe , Zanu - PF , would respect Zimbabweans .
But I have seen that they have no respect for Zimbabweans .
They have respect for themselves and their power . ""
Mugabe 's Zanu - PF party also won three - quarters of the seats in parliament , leaving the MDC at one of the lowest ebbs in its 14-year history .
Party members have complained about the printing of surplus ballot papers , irregularities in the voters ' roll , traditional leaders "" frogmarching "" villagers to the polls , people feigning illiteracy to be "" assisted "" , voters being bussed to faraway constituencies , and the malign influence of the military .
"" It 's not the reflection of the will of the people , "" said Tsvangirai , who was prime minister under Africa 's oldest leader in an uneasy coalition government .
"" I do n't think that even those in Africa that have committed acts of ballot rigging have done it such a brazen manner . ""
He spoke as a division between Africa and the west opened up over the integrity of last week 's polls .
The UK , US and Australia lined up behind Tsvangirai while the African Union and South Africa took 89-year - old Mugabe 's side in what critics saw as a sacrifice of principle for the sake of regional stability .
Following deep reservations expressed by William Hague and John Kerry , Australia 's government called for a re - run of the election , warning that it would not lift sanctions unless free and fair polls were held .
The foreign minister , Bob Carr , said : "" Given our doubts about the results , Australia calls for a re - run of the elections based on a verified and agreed voters roll . ""
But the South African president , Jacob Zuma , who has led the Zimbabwe mediation process in recent years , offered "" profound congratulations "" to Mugabe .
His office said Zuma "" urges all political parties in Zimbabwe to accept the outcome of the elections as election observers reported it to be an expression of the will of the people "" .
The verdict comes as a hammer blow to the MDC which has previously praised Zuma for taking a tougher line against Mugabe than his predecessor , Thabo Mbeki .
In effect it destroys Tsvangirai 's last hope of appealing to the southern African regional bloc to intervene and nullify the election .
It also leaves Britain and its western allies marginalised .
South Africa 's main opposition party , the Democratic Alliance , gave a scathing response .
The shadow foreign minister , Ian Davidson , said : "" By congratulating Robert Mugabe on his stolen election president Zuma has failed Zimbabwe , failed Zimbabweans and failed the Southern African Development Community by not providing the leadership that the region desperately required . ""
President Zuma 's congratulations are not only extremely premature , given the very serious irregularities that have been noted in the elections , but shamefully legitimise undemocratic practices during elections , and send a message that significant irregularities will be tolerated by his administration . ""
In Zimbabwe , independent domestic monitors said the polls were "" seriously compromised "" by registration problems that may have disenfranchised up to a million people .
The anti - corruption watchdog Global Witness has alleged that state diamond revenues were spent on securing Mugabe 's re - election .
Zanu - PF has rejected all vote - rigging allegations but on Saturday one of the nine members of the election commission resigned over the way it was conducted .
The commissioner , Mkhululi Nyathi , said in his resignation letter : "" While throughout the whole process I retained some measure of hope that the integrity of the whole process could be salvaged along the way , this was not to be . """
2013-08-09,"Zimbabwean president Robert Mugabe 's political opponents went to court on Friday to challenge his victory in last week 's elections and demand an immediate rerun .
Lawyers for the Movement for Democratic Change ( MDC ) filed papers at the constitutional court alleging that the polls were rigged in favour of 89-year - old Mugabe 's ruling Zanu - PF party .
Mugabe , Africa 's oldest leader , won with 61 % of the presidential vote , trouncing MDC leader Morgan Tsvangirai on 34 % .
Zanu - PF gained more than a two - thirds majority in parliament , with 160 seats compared with 49 for the MDC .
The African Union and most southern African nations have generally been supportive of the vote , but sharp criticism has come from non - governmental groups and western governments including Britain .
Botswana has also called for an audit .
Few analysts believe the MDC will make much headway in court , however , noting that judges are appointed by Mugabe and generally favour the ruling party .
There have been no significant protests against the result as Mugabe retains an iron grip .
Police trucks with mounted water cannon watch over "" freedom square "" , the name given to an open field in downtown Harare by MDC supporters who held what was described as the country 's biggest ever election rally there .
The MDC has also accused the police of a round - the - clock heavy deployment and surveillance by armed police at its Harvest House headquarters in Harare , describing it as "" a clear sign of provocation intended to intimidate , instil fear and subdue any dissension "" .
"" The MDC views this is as a wanton act of aggression by Zanu - PF aimed at covering up the massive electoral fraud by the Zimbabwe Electoral Commission ( ZEC ) orchestrated at the behest and connivance of Zanu PF , "" the party said .
"" The MDC finds it strange that the police and Zanu - PF are using such intimidatory tactics when Zanu - PF is claiming that it won last week 's elections .
We wonder why the victor should be afraid of the people and the actions by the police vindicate the MDC 's position that Zanu - PF using ZEC stole the people 's victory . ""
The heavy deployment of police at Harvest House clearly shows that Zanu PF is hiding something . ""
On Thursday , Zimbabwe 's state election commission admitted that nearly 305,000 people were turned away from voting and another 207,000 were "" assisted voters "" – "" supposedly illiterate or infirm "" – who needed help from polling officials to cast ballots .
But it insisted the mistakes were not enough to affect the outcome .
The MDC seized on the figures , however , claiming they vindicate its position that the elections were a "" monumental farce "" that "" stole the people 's victory "" .
It noted that highest number of votes turned away was in Harare province – an MDC stronghold .
It added : "" However , although ZEC has released these figures , the correct numbers are higher than this considering that two million people particularly in the urban areas failed to register in the chaotic voter registration exercise . ""
From the figures released by ZEC , it is clear that people 's will was disregarded especially in the rural areas where villagers were coerced to vote for Zanu - PF by the state agents , Zanu - PF militias and traditional leaders in clear violation of the electoral act . ""
The MDC demanded a forensic audit of the electoral processes and a rerun of a free and credible election as soon as possible .
But Zanu - PF has poured scorn on the complaints as sour grapes .
Patrick Chinamasa , justice minister and a member of the party 's legal team , said last week : "" Start preparing your case if you have any .
Feel free to employ the best lawyers ; I know that you have very good lawyers at the MDC .
If you are dissatisfied with what happened , the courts are there .
This is why we set them up
and we have instructed them to give decisions expeditiously . ""
Amnesty International claims that some female political activists in rural areas say they have been threatened with violence and forced to flee with their children for refusing to reveal their vote to supporters of Zanu - PF .
The women said they resisted instructions from Zanu - PF supporters to feign illiteracy , blindness or physical injury , which would have meant someone else marking the ballot on their behalf .
Noel Kututwa , Amnesty 's deputy director for Africa , said : "" It appears the Zanu - PF supporters wanted to ensure that these women did not vote for the other parties and tried to compromise the secrecy of the ballot . ""
The Zimbabwean police must guarantee the safety of political activists in rural areas following these reports of politically motivated displacement .
The authorities have a duty to investigate any threats of violence and ensure those responsible are brought to justice . """
2013-08-17,"Much of the world looked on with dismay as Zimbabwe held another disputed presidential election this month , handing 89-year - old Robert Mugabe a seventh term in office .
Newspapers sent their correspondents to report allegations of ballot fraud and intimidation .
Television reports around the world featured the angry face of Morgan Tsvangirai as he denounced the election as a farce .
In Uganda , liberals and politicians rolled their eyes and sighed wearily .
For we have our own Mugabe figure , but no one seems to care .
For the last decade , Ugandan activists of various stripes have been trying to draw attention to Yoweri Kaguta Museveni 's brutal regime .
The difficulty is getting anyone to listen .
Museveni , 69 , has ruled the country for 27 years , six fewer than Mugabe in Zimbabwe .
But while the world recognises Mugabe as a dictator , Museveni is still , to them , the same blue - eyed boy who was once feted as the ideal of democracy and transformation in Africa .
Like Mugabe , Museveni came to power after a western - backed coup , apparently committed to democracy and speaking the language of human rights .
His regime is credited for reforming the East African country 's economy , which , after the ravages of the years of Idi Amin and Milton Obote , was on the verge of collapse , with inflation at more than 200 % when Museveni took power in 1986 .
Uganda has made some strides in the fight against HIV / Aids and the country has enjoyed relative peace and stability .
But his legacy is souring .
Before Museveni 's drastic transformation from democrat to autocrat , he said that Africa 's biggest problem was that leaders stayed too long in power .
Today , he sings another tune , arguing it is important for leaders to "" consolidate "" their achievements .
The latest Uganda Human Rights Commission Report shows that , just as in previous regimes , people are tortured and dissidents mysteriously disappear .
Museveni seems to have suddenly decided that human rights are an import from the west that can not be tolerated ; and that democracy is compatible with a politician holding a life presidency – provided the person in power is a visionary like him .
In 2005 Museveni amended the constitution to remove term limits , allowing him to be a candidate for the presidency as many times as he wished .
He has won the last three elections amid allegations of unlimited bribery , disenfranchisement , intimidation and violence .
Attempts by the opposition to challenge the elections in court were futile .
The legal system upheld them even though it was recognised that there was evidence of malpractice .
Rising inflation , fuel and food prices led to opposition - led protests in 2011 .
Museveni reacted by ferociously clamping down on all dissent .
Ugandans got used to the sound of gunshots and the sting of teargas .
Fearing an Arab spring kind of uprising , Museveni ordered the police to shoot whoever participated in the protests .
Opposition leaders who dare question Museveni 's regime are routinely arrested and harassed .
A recent investigation by Kampala 's Observer newspaper , which I work for , found that opposition leader Kizza Besigye has been arrested and charged 34 times in five years .
That figure does not include the times when security officials have simply barricaded his home and in effect prevented him from leaving his house .
Or the other less high - profile politicians whose arrests may or may not make the local news , depending on their luck .
In May , Museveni shut down independent media in Uganda , after they published a general 's memo claiming Museveni was grooming his son for the succession .
General David Sejusa was forced to flee to the UK , fearing for his life .
He has since joined the numerous opposition voices against Museveni .
Three months down the road , a law has now been passed forbidding public gatherings and political debate .
Under the law , more than two people can meet in a public place only after notifying the police seven days in advance .
The police have discretionary powers to stop such a meeting .
The truth is that public debate was stifled long before the act .
Parliament is also considering a law that will give the government power to shut down critical media .
So where is the international outrage when it comes to Uganda ?
In 2009 , the world successfully put pressure on Uganda to drop the anti - homosexuality bill that proposed the death penalty for certain homosexual acts .
Why , as the voices of protest and democracy are silenced , do the leaders of the western world continue to wine and dine Museveni ?
Why do they continue to hand over generous donations to Museveni 's government that the people never see , turning a blind eye to issues of human rights and democracy ?
Britain 's Department for International Development budget for Uganda is £ 60 m .
Most of this money is supposedly intended for projects concerning democracy , health and human rights .
Even with all that is happening in Uganda , the country is still masquerading as an African democracy .
It is not all bad .
While half the population still live on less than a dollar a day , Uganda has halved poverty that was at 56 % in the early 1990s .
The country 's economy is said to be growing and literacy rates stand at 73 % , with more people attaining secondary education .
But look at this tale of rigged elections , opponents in exile , mysterious disappearances and killings , torture , clampdown on the media – it is the Mugabe script but with a different cast .
Inexorably consolidating his power , Museveni has built himself a mansion and stocked up on military jets .
There is no sign he will step aside and he has promised he will be the one to usher the country into becoming a "" middle income "" state .
This is a feat he has been having a go at for the last 27 years .
The reality is that Ugandans have been beaten into docility by hunger , disease , poverty and sheer need .
The unprecedented rise in the cost of living and the deplorable state of hospitals have put the people in the exact position that Museveni and his cronies want them to be – a place where many are too worried about their next meal to care about abstract political ideas and rights .
Sure , the 1960s happened a long time ago and Africa can not forever blame its ills on colonialism .
But Ugandans can not help but question the integrity of countries that continue to accommodate one dictator , while condemning the other .
Tyrants who have squeezed life out of the country now coo about the new African revolution .
And the world nods and cheers and promises Africa that things will improve .
They will not .
Not until the root of all this evil is totally uprooted .
Diplomacy may be the game , but what if it comes at too high a cost – more deaths , more disease and an eventual economic collapse ?
The argument often goes that Zimbabwe is an extreme case and Uganda still manages to function from day to day .
Critics say this is nothing more than "" western hypocrisy , "" a necessary evasion of responsibility because Museveni is still the west 's "" yes boy , "" in various international bodies .
The message is loud and clear to all dictators : you can arrest the opposition every other day , pass draconian laws and let your country wallow in poverty , as long as your troops are available for us when we need to go on a peace keeping mission in , say , Somalia .
As long as you vote on our side when we sit on the [ UN ] Human Rights Council and sign as many human rights treaties as is required .
Democracy ?
No , you do not have to be democratic .
It is enough for you to appear democratic .

2013-10-12,"Zimbabwe : former prime minister 's staff sacked from government Civil servants fear a nationwide purge by Robert Mugabe 's ruling party after many staff employed in former prime minister Morgan Tsvangirai 's office were fired .
In letters sent by the Civil Service Commission , the civil serbants were told they were being "" retired from the civil service in line with the government policy "" .
There are fears that more officials who served under the previous government will also be laid off .
Zimbabwe 's new constitution protects employees against discrimination , including on the grounds of party political affiliation .
Turkey : ban on headscarves for civil servants lifted A decades - old ban on headscarves in the civil service has been lifted as part of a package of reforms brought in by the Islamic government designed to improve rights for minority Kurds .
Prime minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan said the development was "" a step towards normalisation "" .
But critics fear that lifting the ban is an attempt to force Islamic values on the majority Muslim but secular nation .
The opposition party labelled it "" a serious blow to the secular republic "" .
The ban remains in place for judges , prosecutors , police and military personnel .
Sudan : probe launched into unlawful dismissal of officials A committee has been set up to investigate the circumstances under which thousands of civil servants were dismissed in 2010 under the previous government in South Sudan .
The specialised committee will reinstate the ex - government employees should it find that their dismissal contradicted existing labour laws .
It is expected to finish its work within two weeks .
Japan : civil service reform in limbo
The government is facing difficulties reconciling opinions over bills , including the creation of new posts of minister advisers and the establishment of a new Cabinet bureau for personnel affairs .
The bills are promoted by Tomomi Inada , minister in charge of the national public servant employment reform , but many lawmakers have voiced opposition .
The advisers , who will be appointed by the Cabinet , will have the same status as parliamentary secretaries in each ministry and will help reinforce leadership of politicians .
The Cabinet bureau for personnel affairs will allow the prime minister 's office to effectively control the appointments of about 600 government posts .
Ireland :
almost half of civil servants are over 50
The average age of workers in the civil service is 46 and only 4 % are under the age of 30 , according to new figures .
Nearly half ( 45 % ) of government staff are over the age of 50 , a figure expected to rise to 66 % within 10 years , due to a recruitment ban in recent years .
The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform secretary general Robert Watt said the lack of young blood in the civil service was "" not optimal "" and "" reflects a planning failure "" .
The Association of Higher Civil and Public Servants said a crisis is looming over the growing age profile ."
2014-04-27,"A faction in Zimbabwe 's main opposition movement has said it is no longer recognising Morgan Tsvangirai as the party leader , blaming "" fascist "" tendencies and his failure to oust President Robert Mugabe .
The group led by Tendai Biti , secretary general of the Movement for Democratic Change ( MDC ) , said it had suspended Tsvangirai but their authority to do so was immediately disputed by rivals within the MDC .
Biti 's group accused Tsvangirai his lieutenants of resisting a leadership change after losing a third general election to Mugabe last July , and of using violence against internal challengers .
The 90-year - old Mugabe , Africa 's oldest leader , has ruled Zimbabwe since independence in 1980 despite frequent western criticism over human rights and accusations of economic mismanagement .
In a statement after a day - long meeting , Biti 's faction said Tsvangirai and his deputy Thokozani Khupe had been suspended for deviating from democracy and failing to effectively tackle Mugabe . ""
The MDC as we know it has abandoned its original founding values and principles , "" it said .
"" The party has been hijacked by a dangerous fascist clique bent on destroying the same and totally working against the working people of Zimbabwe . ""
Tsvangirai 's faction dismissed the removal as unconstitutional and meaningless . ""
The MDC leadership can not be changed by a bunch of desperate power - hungry officials , a minority that can not win a leadership contest at party congress , "" national party spokesman Douglas Mwonzora told reporters .
Tsvangirai has resisted pressure to quit after losing the 2013 election , which he says was rigged by Mugabe 's supporters .
Analysts predict the MDC will break apart .
The 62-year - old Tsvangirai has led the MDC since its formation in 1999 , when the former trade unionist emerged as the biggest threat to Mugabe .
But he has failed to dislodge his rival in three presidential polls that his MDC and many western observers say were neither free or fair .
While accusing Mugabe 's Zanu - PF party of using violence and vote - rigging to retain power , some senior MDC officials also say Tsvangirai has become bogged down by sex scandals and failed to adopt the right tactics to win power .
An ally of Biti , Elton Mangoma , ignited debate over Tsvangirai with an open letter early this year calling on him to step down as party president .
He said Tsvangirai could no longer drive a reform agenda for Zimbabwe , having failed to do so in the four years he served as prime minister and shared executive powers with Mugabe .
Their unity government ended last year and Zanu - PF has ruled alone since then .
Analysts say Tsvangirai 's MDC critics have so far failed convince the party 's national executive to hold an early congress before one scheduled for 2016 .
They have also struggled to persuade ordinary members that Tsvangirai is to blame for the MDC 's poll losses .

2014-04-30,"In 1998 two aspiring politicians met to plot the beginnings of a movement that would change Zimbabwe ’s political landscape for more than a decade .
One of them , Morgan Tsvangirai , was already a household name in the country as a result of the mass protests that he had led against the government 's economic austerity measures of the late 1990s .
Because of this experience and associated celebrity , he naturally became the first leader of the newly created Movement for Democratic Change ( MDC )
The other , Tendai Biti , a gifted and ambitious lawyer , chose not to contest the party leadership – he would have been soundly thrashed by Tsvangirai in any contest .
Instead , he took a backstage , and assumed that most precarious of perches : Heir Apparent .
The two quickly fell out after the formation of the party , but for appearances sake , decided to exist side by side in an uneasy alliance that has been characterised by back-
stabbing , plotting and sub - plotting against each other .
The uneasiness between the two largely stems from the dominance of Tsvangirai ’s personality over the MDC .
Tsvangirai is popular with the party supporters and as a result he and his followers find it hard to accommodate alternative ideas and leadership .
Indeed , the name of the party , MDC - Tsvangirai , illustrates the entrenchment of his personal power .
The power struggle approached comic - opera status this Saturday when Tsvangirai was suspended by the MDC ’s national council after a meeting that had been instigated by Biti .
Biti ’s ‘ ambush’ followed the suspension of several of his allies a couple of months earlier , leaving his position within the party severely weakened .
In a statement read out by one of Biti ’s consigliere , Samuel Sipepa Nkomo , the MDC National Council ( often the venue of the most vicious political infighting ) declared that the party had suspended and dissolved the entire committee consisting of President Tsvangirai , Deputy President Thokozani Khupe , National Chairman Lovemore Moyo , Vice Chairman , Morgan Komichi , National Organising Secretary , Nelson Chamisa , Vice Organising Secretary Abedinico Bhebhe , and National Spokesman , Douglas Mwonzora .
Sipepa Nkomo also announced the lifting of the suspension of Biti ’s allies .
According to the resolutions , the party ’s Guardian Council headed by Sekai Holland will now take charge and prepare for an earlier elective congress where Tendai Biti is expected to stand for the leadership .
Biti , who has been determinedly silent about his leadership ambitions , appears to have now made his agenda clear .
Indeed , for the first time , he was critical of his rival , and stated that Tsvangirai would be charged with violation of the MDC ’s constitution as well as bringing the party into disrepute .
In his harshest assessment of Tsvangirai to date , Biti was quoted at the weekend saying that Tsvangirai had ‘ failed as a leader.’
In a statement , the opposition party said it was suspending the party leader Morgan Tsvangirai for ‘ fascist’ tendencies , further alleging that the MDC had been ‘ transformed into a fiefdom of the leader’ .
They also accused Tsvangirai and his lieutenants of resisting leadership change after losing a third general election to Mugabe last July .
Behind the scenes some MDC officials have reportedly compiled a dossier of allegations of misuse of party funds by Tsvangirai which insiders say they hope will persuade him to go quietly .
The ‘ putsch’ has rankled Tsvangirai ’s rank and file supporters who soon after learning of the suspension , turned up at the party headquarters to show their support for the beleaguered leader .
The move has also drawn outraged cries of treachery from his allies , who have since dismissed the suspension as unconstitutional and meaningless .
Nelson Chamisa , the party ’s organising secretary and a staunch Tsvangirai supporter dismissed his boss ’s suspension as ‘ utter nonsense’ .
Douglas Mwonzora , the polarising party spokesman , also declared that Tsvangirai remains the MDC leader .
Indeed , on Sunday , Tsvangirai ’s group convened its own meeting and called for a press conference in Harare .
In an attempt to discredit the MDC ’s suspension of Tsvangirai , in a statement , Tsvangirai ’s allies went through the composition of the National Council that had suspended the MDC leader , alleging that paid youth and political members from other parties had masqueraded as national council members .
Though the suspensions and counter - suspensions provide a fertile landscape for bitter recriminations , the MDC is unlikely to split .
The spectre of 2005 , when the then secretary general Welshman Ncube created another splinter group , is just too much .
Tendai Biti and his group appear resolved to see Tsvangirai toppled .
Unlike Welshman Ncube , whose attempt to unseat the MDC leader in 2005 was seen as a personal calamity , Biti ’s move is largely seen as a party initiative .
In addition , in comparison to Ncube , his political tribe is solid and is unlikely to be pushed out so easily .
They are likely to play a waiting game , hoping that the former Prime Minister ’s political fortunes will continue to decline before they attempt a fatal blow .
According to a Biti ally who spoke on condition of anonymity , the former Minister of Finance will continue to amass and consolidate power , using a mixture of promises and pressure to win over the elites in Tsvangirai ’s group as he works to marginalise the trade unionists and expunge the support that he still has amongst this group .
He added that Biti ’s group is confident that Tsvangirai is now closer than at any point in his career to losing the party leadership .
They just have to be patient .
But for now , with both groups not recognising the other , and claiming legitimacy of their actions , this dilemma is setting the stage for a bruising legal battle .
The two groups are likely to seek legal recourse in an attempt to resolve the leadership impasse .
Indeed , the suspension of Tsvangirai , and the inevitable counter - suspension of Biti by Tsvangirai ’s group , is certain to be challenged by each man ’s allies .
The courts , packed with Zanu - PF allies , has the option of letting the legal battle drag beyond the 2018 elections , plunging the opposition into a crisis that will confuse voters .
Alternatively , the courts might hand the leadership to Biti , whom Zanu - PF perceives as electorally weaker .
Turmoil in the MDC is a gift to Zanu - PF .
Indeed , the MDC leadership is increasingly weakened by the constant plotting against each other , with power struggles eroding internal cohesion , tarnishing the public image and undermining the party ’s recruitment drive .
There is potential that voters might be turned off and stay at home rather than vote for a candidate who is not their preferred choice .
The infighting would be less chaotic if the two main combatants , Biti and Tsvangirai , realised that the MDC is not merely defined by their own personalities , but is a force that they should harness together in order to achieve change in Zimbabwe .
Whilst Tsvangirai appeals to the masses , Biti has the trust of political elites and donors .
The truth is , both men need each other ."

2015-12-23,"Robert Mugabe has lost his grip on power and been replaced by his wife , Grace Mugabe , Zimbabwe ’s opposition leader has claimed .
Morgan Tsvangirai said that the 91-year - old president ’s wife is now effectively in charge after a “ palace coup ” , and that the government has been paralysed as members of the ruling party jockey for position .
“
No one in government is thinking of solutions to the national challenges as everyone is preoccupied with issues of who will succeed this tired man steering the ship of state , ” Tsvangirai was quoted by South Africa ’s Mail and Guardian newspaper as saying .
Grace Mugabe has been an increasingly prominent presence on Zimbabwe ’s political scene in recent months , taking up a key post in the ruling party last December and going around the country addressing rallies and handing out gifts .
Her aggressive statements against those she deems insufficiently loyal to her husband come at a time when Africa ’s oldest leader is looking increasingly frail .
The famously austere Mugabe has long been in robust physical and mental condition , but several mishaps in recent months have sent tongues wagging .
Bodyguards had to rush to stop him falling as he stumbled while reaching out to shake hands with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi in the last week of October .
A month earlier , he read the wrong speech during the opening of parliament without realising his error .
Mugabe is still expected to be endorsed as the ruling party Zanu - PF ’s presidential candidate in 2018 , when he will be 94 .
But with the end of his rule inevitably drawing nearer , a furious behind - the - scenes succession battle is underway .
Local media have reported two competing camps forming around army chief Emmerson Mnangagwa and Grace Mugabe , despite president Mugabe ’s warnings that the jockeying for power “ threatens to split the party ” .
Amid this battle , Tsvangirai ’s claim that Robert Mugabe wife had “ surreptitiously but willingly ” assumed power appear designed to take advantage of the current rifts .
Grace Mugabe has managed to rally a group of younger party members around her , dubbed by local media as “ the G-40 ” , but she is generally unpopular with the wider public thanks to her lavish shopping trips overseas at a time when the country ’s economy is struggling to recover from a devastating period of hyperinflation .
On Tuesday , Zimbabwe announced it would make the Chinese Yuan legal tender , as one of a basket of currencies that replaced Zimbabwe ’s own dollar , which was abandoned in 2009 with inflation running at 500bn% ."
